      androgens, or sex hormones produced by the adrenal glands. An enzyme called aromatase carries
      out this process. Exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, blocks production of estrogens.
      Research indicates that the gene responsible for aromatase activity is CYPO19. Therefore,
      exemestane helps to inhibit aromatase activity through CYP019. Along with CYP019, another
      gene associated with breast cancer is an overexpression of COX-2 enzymes. Research suggests
      that COX-2 overexpression can cause cancer cell division, increased blood flow to tumors, and
      metastases. Celecoxib blocks COX-2 activity and produces fewer side effects compared with
      other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This study builds on previous research to
      test the combination of exemestane and celecoxib for breast cancer.

      Purpose: This study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of exemestane and celecoxib before
      surgery for stage II, III, and IV breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Tests will analyze
      the CYP019 gene after these treatments.

      Treatment: Patients in this study will receive exemestane and celecoxib. Both drugs will be
      given to patients as oral pills. Exemestane will be taken daily for sixteen weeks. Starting
      in week 9, celecoxib will be taken twice daily for eight weeks. Therefore, during weeks 9-16,
      patients will be taking both exemestane and celecoxib. Several tests and exams will be given
      throughout the study to closely monitor patients, including a biopsy performed after the
      first 8 weeks on exemestane. After sixteen weeks on exemestane and celecoxib, patients will
      have breast surgery.
