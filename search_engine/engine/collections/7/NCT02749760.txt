      stabilizers toward valgus stress at the elbow, the wrist flexors, flexor digitorum
      superficialis, and pronator teres emanating from the medial epicondyle, affect the incidence
      of ulnar collateral ligament injuries of the elbows in pitchers. Pitchers in the minor
      leagues of a single professional baseball club will have the strength of these secondary
      muscular stabilizers assessed and then correlated to ulnar collateral ligament injuries and
      time missed from baseball season and subsequent seasons. A secondary goal is to assess
      whether strengthening exercises targeted toward these muscular stabilizers of the elbow can
      decrease the incidence of ulnar collateral ligament injuries in young baseball pitchers. This
      could impact the field by changing the emphasis from reconstruction and rehabilitation of
      ulnar collateral ligament injuries to prevention.
