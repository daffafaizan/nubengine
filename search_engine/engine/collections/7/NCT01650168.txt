      acetate (2.5mg) and 17ÃŸ-estradiol (1.5mg) which is taken for 24 days followed by 4 days of
      placebo. The most relevant adverse clinical outcome that has been linked to the use of COCs
      is venous thromboembolism (VTE). Data from randomized clinical trials did not show any
      serious health concerns for NOMAC-E2. However, the statistical power to detect rare adverse
      events is limited in these studies.

      PRO-E2 is a large, prospective, controlled, long-term active surveillance study to
      investigate the safety of NOMAC-E2 with regard to the outcomes of interest. This study
      follows the European Active Surveillance (EURAS) design methodology with some modifications
      due to country- and product-specific characteristics. The outcomes of interest will be
      validated via the attending physicians. A multi-faceted follow-up procedure will ensure a low
      loss to follow-up rate. This study will involve women from Europe and Australia who will be
      followed for up to 2 years. Data analysis will include multivariable techniques such as Cox
      regression.
