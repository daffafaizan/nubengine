    
      General objective:

        1. To evaluate the safety of EV71 vaccine in adults and in children age 6-71 months

        2. To evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine in children by assessing the
           neutralization antibody levels before immunization; then 7, 15, 30 days after the first
           inoculation; and also 7, 15, 30 days after the second inoculation.

        3. To assess the incidence rate of adverse reactions/events

      Specific objective: To find out:

        1. Seroconversion rate of neutralization antibody on the day 30 after the whole-range
           immunization (i.e. after 2nd dose of vaccination);

        2. Positive rate and Geometric Mean Titer of neutralization antibody on the day 30 after
           the whole-range immunization;

        3. Seroconversion rate, positive rate and Geometric Mean Titer of serum neutralization
           antibody on the day 7, day 15, day 30 after the first inoculation;

        4. Seroconversion rate,positive rate and Geometric Mean Titer of serum neutralization
           antibody on the day 7, day 15 after the second inoculation;

        5. The incidence rate of adverse reactions & serious adverse events during the observation
           period of safety;

        6. The incidence rate of adverse reactions 0-30 days after each inoculation of vaccine;

        7. The incidence rate of adverse events 0-7 days after each inoculation of vaccine;
