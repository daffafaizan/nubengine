      Control (MBWC) intervention to improve weight management outcomes among adolescents (ages
      13-17) who are overweight or obese and from a low-income background. First, we will pilot
      (open-trial) the 16-session MBWC intervention, with a focus on decreasing emotional eating,
      in an adolescent population. Second, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the
      16-week MBWC intervention vs. a 16-week standard behavioral weight control intervention among
      adolescents who are overweight or obese and compare outcomes of the MBWC and control
      interventions. We are interested in examining change in biological and behavioral variables
      (e.g., body mass index normed for age and biological sex; perceived stress; physiological
      stress biomarkers; eating and activity patterns; psychological function related to weight
      management) post-intervention and at three-month follow-up. Treatment satisfaction/treatment
      acceptability will be evaluated at the end of treatment.
