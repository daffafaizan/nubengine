      toxicity on patients who have had treatment with TARGIT.

      Outcomes will be measured over short and long terms. Outcome measures will include
      effectiveness and safety, assessed in various cohorts of patients. Core outcomes will be used
      for effectiveness. In addition, true recurrence (basically, ipsilateral breast tumor
      recurrence at the same site as the original primary) will be used as defined by Recht. Safety
      outcomes will be based on Common Toxicity Criteria.

      Budget impact analysis of IORT in subgroups of patients will be assessed. This amounts to
      using cost data to calculate the mean incremental (or extra) cost per person treated using
      intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) versus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and mastectomies
      (where IORT could have been given instead) and then multiplying this by the total patients
      eligible nationally for IORT, to calculate the total expected budget impact on the NHS if
      IORT in these subgroups was rolled out nationally.
