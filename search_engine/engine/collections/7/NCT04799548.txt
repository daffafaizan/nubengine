      surgery still the backbone, various clinical trials have shown the benefit of perioperative
      treatment to gastric cancer patients.

      The report of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment in gastric cancer is
      relatively limited, though different case reports have showed its efficacy and safety in
      advanced gastric cancer. With transarterial infusion chemotherapy, TACE increases the local
      concentration of chemotherapeutic agents and reduces adverse reaction. With embolization,
      TACE blocks the blood supply and causes the necrosis of tumors, in this way exposing tumor
      antigen and promoting tumor immunity. The combination of TACE and PD-1 antibody is expected
      to further boost tumor immunity.

      Meanwhile, Noman et.al. reported hypoxia could upregulate PD-L1 by activating HIF-1alpha. So,
      embolism may lead to immune evasion of tumors by upregulating PD-L1, but on the other side
      generate targets for PD-1/PD-L1 therapies.

      Based on those knowledges, we designed this phase II, prospective, single-center, single-arm
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of neoadjuvant transcatheter
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and PD-1 antibody Tislelizumab in the locally advanced
      stomach adenocarcinoma. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pathologic
      complete response (pCR) rate of TACE plus Tislelizumab. The second purpose is to evaluate
      pathologic response rate (pRR), objective Response Rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and PFS
      (progression-free survival) of the patients enrolled in this study.
