      150mg or 1200mg, of TMC278LA, given as a single intramuscular dose to HIV-negative
      participants. Investigation of drug pharmacokinetics in plasma, female genital secretions and
      tissue samples, and male rectal fluid and tissue samples (at the 600mg dose) will be also
      carried out in order to provide data on relative drug exposure following drug administration.
      Additionally, ex-vivo assays to assess viral inhibition in fluid from genital secretions and
      rectal compartments will provide partial information on pharmacodynamic characteristics of
      TMC278; this may usefully inform future selection decisions on the appropriate target
      concentrations required for prevention.

      The target concentration for a prophylactic use of TMC278 in plasma, genital or rectal
      tissues and fluids is unknown. It is possible that a target lower than that required for
      treatment of established infection would be suitable. However, there is currently no
      pharmacodynamic data to usefully inform what this target concentration might be. In the
      absence of population PK data in an efficacy trial of TMC278 as a prophylactic agent, the
      investigators aim to obtain useful indirect data from ex-vivo viral inhibition assays to at
      least guide future decisions on dose selection.

      Up to 60 evaluable female participants will be enrolled, with more than 40% being of African
      ancestry. Six male participants will also be enrolled. This will provide data on plasma
      pharmacokinetics and the relative distribution kinetics in the female genital tract and male
      rectal compartment in order to support expanded safety studies and a phase III global
      efficacy trial.
