    
      Individual patient African American and Caucasian American prostate biopsy cores or surgical
      specimens will be obtained from the following procedures: transrectal ultrasound biopsy of
      the prostate (TRUSBxP), MR fusion biopsy, intra-operatively (IO) at the time of
      prostatectomy. Using cellular DNA and RNA, isolated from prostate cancer and patient-matched
      normal prostate biopsy cores or surgical specimens, the investigators will perform ancestral
      genotyping, exon arrays, targeted RNA sequencing, and epigenetic analyses. As controls, blood
      will also be collected. Genomic data from blood and tumor tissue will be compared.
