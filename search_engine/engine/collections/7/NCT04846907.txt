      general, high levels of stress, anxiety, fatigue and suffering, due to the nature and
      location of their work. As a result, the health and well being of these professionals can be
      significantly compromised. In outbreaks of serious infectious diseases and pandemics, these
      risks become amplified and the health team is at greater risk of falling ill, presenting
      changes in mental health and psychological trauma, while caring for infected patients and
      becoming potential contaminants in their family and community.

      The objective is to study the mental health of professionals who work in Pediatric Intensive
      Care Units (PICUs) in Brazil, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome
      will be the incidence of burnout in the team involved with the care of critically ill
      children. Secondary outcomes such as anxiety, depression, quality of professional life,
      compassionate fatigue and post-traumatic stress disorder will be measured. Possible
      associations between demographic, work and coping variables (social support and resilience)
      with mental and emotional health outcomes will be investigated, in an exploratory character.

      It is a multicenter, observational, longitudinal study, with a descriptive and exploratory
      analytical component. Data collection will be carried out through an electronic survey during
      and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
