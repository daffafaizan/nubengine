      preliminary clinical activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of ZN-c3. This
      study consists of 2 cohorts in participants with platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer. One cohort will test a combination of ZN-c3 and pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin (PLD), and the other cohort will test a combination of ZN-c3 and carboplatin.
