      negative effect of a specific disease-causing protein. The potential to treat diseases by
      means of immunotherapy instead of using conventional drugs represents an attractive
      opportunity in a number of chronic disease areas, including asthma and allergy. Resistentia's
      model to treat allergic diseases, and ultimately asthma, is to use the immune system to
      produce antibodies against the IgE molecules themselves. The resulting anti-IgE antibodies
      intercept and form complexes with the IgE molecules before they can bind to the mast cells
      and basophils and are thus able to block any allergen-triggered inflammatory reaction. The
      approach works in all types of IgE-mediated allergies independently of allergen, and also in
      patients sensitive to multiple allergens.

      Comparisons: Three doses and two dosing regimes of RP01 will be compared as regards safety
      and effect.
