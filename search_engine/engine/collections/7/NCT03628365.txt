      patients is associated with poor outcome, and limitations of functional recovery. High
      protein feeding only partially attenuates the muscle loss. The aim is to study the impact of
      HMB (3 g/day) on the muscle mass of the critically ill patients from day 4 of their admission
      to maximum 30 days, but at least for 10 days. The study is testing a nutrition complement
      (HMB) that is included in feeding products registered for medical nutrition by Swiss Federal
      Authorities, but who do not provide sufficient protein quantities.

      On days 4 and 15 after ICU admission, specific investigations will include: Ultrasound
      measurement of the muscle quadriceps femoris (CSA), bioimpedance analysis (BIA) of body
      composition, protein synthesis and catabolism using amino acid tracers. On D30 and D60:
      telephone contact to assess global health and mobility (SF-12).
