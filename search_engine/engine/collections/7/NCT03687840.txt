      motor and autonomic nerve damage caused by metabolic and micro vessel alterations due to
      hyperglycaemia. The signs and symptoms of diabetic polyneuropathy vary according to the type
      of nerve fiber affected. The involvement of the small nerve fibers results in deterioration
      of the pain and temperature perception, while the impairing of large nerve fibers result in
      decrease of touch and proprioception sensations. Due to the sensory loss, accidental foot
      injuries may develop in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy. While the feet constitute a
      small percentage (3.5%) of the total body surface area, burn injuries of them in patients
      with diabetic polyneuropathy can cause significant effects on quality of life because
      impaired wound healing process in diabetics may cause risk of prolonged bed rest and
      hospitalization period, and increased early and late complications. Therefore, it has an
      important effects on daily living activities because it causes inadequacies in gait and
      balance activities due to the negative effects on mobility and weight bearing functions. In
      studies that examining changes in gait parameters in other diabetic foot complications such
      as sensory loss, ulceration, and amputation as secondary to diabetic polyneuropathy have
      shown that these individuals acquire a protective adaptive gait strategies that allow for
      more controlled gait in the present of proprioceptive deficits such as slower gait speed,
      smaller step length and in particular increased opposite foot off time in order to shift body
      weight from injured limb to unaffected side. There's no studies have yet been conducted to
      investigating of changes in gait parameters in patients who have diabetic
      polyneuropathy-related lower extremity burn injury. The aim of this case-control study is to
      examine whether similar gait strategies have been gained in this group of patients, as
      indicated in the results of previous studies demonstrating protective adaptive gait
      strategies that adopt under the presence of other diabetic foot complications due to diabetic
      polyneuropathy.
