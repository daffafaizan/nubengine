      incidence of 1-2/100 000 yearly. The primary tumor(s) are often small and symptoms usually
      arise when the disease has become metastatic with hormonal symptoms and/or symptoms due to
      local growth. As the tumors grow slowly and the symptoms in many cases are rather diffuse and
      develops gradually over a long time period there is often a long delay from onset to a final
      diagnosis both depending on "patient's delay" and "doctor's delay" The aim of the current
      project is to map and analyze the patient's journey from the first appearance of symptoms to
      the time point of a final diagnosis and to try to identify factors contributing to a delayed
      process.

      The method is interview based and the interviews will be analyzed through the Design Thinking
      Methodology
