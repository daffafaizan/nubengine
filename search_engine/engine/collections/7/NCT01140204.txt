      reduce in-stent restenosis in animal experiments and initial clinical trials. Paclitaxel
      dissolved in the angiographic contrast agent iopromide was well tolerated and inhibited
      neointimal proliferation in a dose-dependent manner after injection into porcine coronary
      arteries.

      Methods: As a first step in entering clinical development, a phase I trial was performed
      using 4 ascending paclitaxel dose/concentration levels: samples of up to 100 ml of the
      contrast agent containing 10, 50, 100 or 200 Î¼M paclitaxel were randomly administered to 6
      adult patients each assigned to bare metal stent implantation for single de novo coronary
      artery lesions, while 8 patients treated with plain contrast medium served as controls.
      Safety variables and tolerability as well as angiographic parameters were assessed.
