      treatment of individuals with autism. The biologic actions of oxytocin on social cognition
      and prosocial behaviors and the clinical, genetic and epigenetic evidence for involvement of
      the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of some cases of autism strongly suggest that
      supplemental oxytocin therapy could significantly improve the social disabilities involved in
      autism. Many people feel that these social difficulties are the most characteristic and
      central feature of autism. Overall, this study aims to determine the tolerability,
      accessibility, and feasibility of an oxytocin pilot study.

      This study will consent up to 30 subjects in order to randomize up to 25 subjects into a
      2-month (8 weeks) randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled initial treatment period, a
      subsequent 2-month (8 weeks) period in which all participants receive oxytocin, and up to
      three post-treatment visits that occur at week 28 (Â±2 weeks),an interim visit anytime between
      week 16 and week 76 only for those patients who plan to start oxytocin on their own outside
      of study treatment and who will experience a lag time between week 16 (end of open label
      treatment) and when outside oxytocin treatment will begin, and some time before week 76. The
      investigators hope that this study will help to inform future study designs in determining
      whether a short term or long term treatment trial is necessary to observe significant
      effects. This will also help to develop systematic preliminary safety measures.
