        -  Determine whether the addition of paclitaxel, using filgrastim (G-CSF) support, to
           standard doxorubicin/cisplatin chemotherapy produces improvement in the frequency of
           objective response, progression-free survival, or overall survival in patients with
           stage III, stage IV, or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.

        -  Compare the toxicities of these two regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 15-30 minutes, followed immediately by
           cisplatin IV over 1 hour.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin and cisplatin as in arm I on day 1. On day 2,
           patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
           subcutaneously beginning on day 3 and continuing for at least 10 days.

      Courses are repeated every 21 days. Treatment continues for up to 7 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (120 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 21 months.
