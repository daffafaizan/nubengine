      order to identify additional predictors of Graves' disease and apply them to a well
      characterized group of patients with Graves' disease followed prospectively. More
      specifically, we plan to further investigate the antibodies by measuring lambda: kappa light
      chain antibody ratios in pediatric patients. We will assess epitope heterogeneity by using
      novel chimeric proteins in which specific portions of the TSH receptor have been replaced
      with the closely related LH receptor. We will utilize microarray technology to determine if
      there are differences in gene expression profiles in responders versus non responders. It is
      hoped that these methods will lead to an improved ability to follow disease progression and
      to monitor efficacy of therapy.
