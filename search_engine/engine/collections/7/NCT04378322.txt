      future health outcomes and financial burden to the healthcare system and employers.

      The effect of personalized meal planning and online food purchasing and delivery on weight
      loss and management is unknown.

      Design: This trial is an online, three-arm randomized trial to compare a meal planning and
      telenutrition tool, a meal planning tool only, and MyPlate optimization.

      Participants will be assigned to randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three
      groups.

      Participants will follow the intervention for 6 months after randomization and will be
      followed for an additional 1.5 years after randomization.

      Participants will report dietary behavior and weight at baseline and each month of the
      intervention (6 months), 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months.

      Population Approximately 300 participants will be enrolled and randomized (100 per arm).
      Participants will be adults living in New York state who are obese (at least a BMI of 30
      kg/m2).

      Outcomes Primary outcome: weight change after 6 months Other outcomes: waist circumference;
      blood pressure, dietary changes, cooking, meal planning, and eating out frequencies
