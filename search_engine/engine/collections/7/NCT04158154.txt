    
      This study includes the implementation and evaluation of a culturally- and
      contextually-adapted intervention package based on the Kaiser Permanente Northern California
      and World Health Organization HEARTS programs for hypertension diagnosis and treatment at
      primary health centers in Abuja, Nigeria. The intervention has been adapted based on a local
      needs' assessment including evidence synthesis and specific exploration of health care
      workers' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to hypertension, causes, consequences,
      and treatment, including fixed-dose combination and patient self-management, and patients'
      knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to hypertension, causes, consequences, and
      treatment. Implementation pathways have been developed with particular attention to
      overcoming modifiable system- and patient-level barriers to hypertension treatment and
      control across capability, intentional, and system domains using the Consolidated Framework
      for Implementation Research. Preparedness and capacity have been assessed at primary health
      centers (e.g. available staff; information systems; use of clinical guidelines) through an
      adapted Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) instrument during the formative
      work for this study.
