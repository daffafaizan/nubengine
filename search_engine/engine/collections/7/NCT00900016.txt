      Primary

        -  To assess the degree of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) enzymatic activity at the
           tumor site in patients with localized pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To explore correlations between tumor stromal FAP enzymatic activity and stromal
           α_2-antiplasmin levels.

        -  To explore correlations between tumor FAP enzymatic activity and plasma dipeptidyl
           peptidase and plasma α_2-antiplasmin converting enzyme activity as potential surrogates.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo fine-needle aspiration of tumor or suspected mass at baseline.
      Tumor samples are analyzed by IHC for fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression,
      immunocapture assay for ex vivo FAP enzymatic activity, and western analysis for FAP
      concentrations. Blood samples are collected weekly and analyzed for dipeptidyl peptidase
      activity by ELISA and α_2-antiplasmin converting enzyme.
