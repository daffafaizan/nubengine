      I. Determine the effect of delayed administration of sodium thiosulfate on the rates of
      platelet toxicity (i.e. platelet count less than 20,000), in subjects with high-grade glioma
      undergoing treatment with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide/etoposide phosphate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess tumor response in subjects with high-grade glioma undergoing treatment with
      carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide/etoposide phosphate, with or without delayed
      sodium thiosulfate.

      II. Assess the effect of delayed administration of sodium thiosulfate on granulocyte and
      erythrocyte counts, in subjects undergoing treatment with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide and
      etoposide/etoposide phosphate.

      III. Assess hearing changes, if any, at the higher frequencies in the standard testing range
      (4000 and 8000 Hertz [Hz]), and at higher frequencies above standard testing (9000 to 16000
      Hz).

      IV. Assess quality of life in subjects undergoing treatment with carboplatin,
      cyclophosphamide and etoposide phosphate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV), etoposide phosphate IV, and
      carboplatin intra-arterially (IA) over 10 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, etoposide phosphate IV, and carboplatin IA as
      in Arm I. Patients also receive sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes 4 and 8 hours after
      carboplatin.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
