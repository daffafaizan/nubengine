      function or normal gait to many stroke survivors. Functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS)
      has shown promise for functional enhancement of both upper and lower limb motor control
      following stroke. Gains included muscle activation latencies, strength, coordination, upper
      limb functional tasks, gait kinematics, walking endurance, and quality of life. The purpose
      of the proposed work is to test the radio frequency-controlled (RF) Microstimulator (RFM)
      Gait System regarding system performance and subject response to treatment.

      Methods: This is a feasibility study in which up to four subjects will receive the (RFM) Gait
      System. Up to ten RFMs will be placed for a given subject. An RFM ankle muscle system will be
      used to train ankle gait components. A separate RFM system will be used to train knee gait
      components. Subjects will be treated for 6 months, four sessions/wk. Primary outcome measures
      for the RFM Gait System will be: kinematic swing phase gait components and walking endurance.
      Secondary outcome measures will include: strength, coordination, spasticity, function, and
      quality of life. Data collections will occur at months 1, 3 and 6, and for follow-up times up
      to a year after the end of treatment. The results of the RFM ankle system have the potential
      to provide a new technology for ankle muscle gait components.
