    
      This is 2-armed parallel group, prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3
      controlled trial to establish the efficacy and safety of conversion from maintenance
      immunosuppressive therapy with Prograf capsules (tacrolimus, Astellas Pharma US, Inc.,
      Deerfield, IL) twice daily to maintenance immunotherapy with LCP-Tacro tablets (tacrolimus,
      LifeCycle Pharma A/S, Horsholm, Denmark) once daily for the prevention of acute allograft
      rejection in stable adult make and female kidney transplant patients. Recipients of kidney
      transplant 3 months to 5 years before Screening and on a stable dose of Prograf will be
      randomly assigned to be converted from Prograf twice daily to LCP-Tacro once daily or to
      remain on maintenance therapy with Prograf twice daily. There will be 11 study visits in the
      Treatment period.
