      discectomy and fusion (ACDF). However, few methods were available to determine which muscle
      groups are associated with PD in details in previous investigations. Local steroid
      administration has shown some effects on PD in a large number meta-analysis. In this study,
      we aimed to conduct a prospective randomized-double blinded study to exam the efficacy and
      the safety of the local steroid administration on ACDF patients, and the also apply the high
      resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) on patients receiving ACDF for better delineation of
      the swallowing function. Pressure-flow analysis (PFA), derives pharyngeal pressure flow
      variables obtained from HRIM were used to analyze the mechanisms of PD.
