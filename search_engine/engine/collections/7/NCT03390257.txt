      nasal anatomy and paranasal sinuses (Maxillary, Frontal and Sphenoid sinuses) in conjunction
      with Balloon Sinus Dilation in patients suffering from symptoms attributable to sinusitis is
      feasible in the office and operating room settings; This is an essential step in the
      development of a combined dilation and visualization system that will allow visualization,
      dilation and lavage of the sinuses via their natural ostia during an office visit, and
      minimize radiation exposure, antibiotic use, multiple office visits, and cost.
