      is strongly associated with reduced quality of life in this population. Studies have shown a
      strong association between fatigue and menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal
      symptoms, and sexual dysfunction. Because sleep disturbance commonly co-occurs in women with
      hot flashes as a result of nocturnal hot flashes disrupting sleep, sleep disturbance may
      explain the association between hot flashes and fatigue in this population. However evidence
      suggests that fatigue can occur in the absence of sleep disruption, indicating that sleep
      problems do not exclusively explain the etiology of fatigue in this population.

      Armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent that acts as a central nervous system stimulant.
      It is chemically and pharmacologically unrelated to other CNS stimulants, such as
      methylphenidate and amphetamine. Armodafinil is FDA approved to increase wakefulness in
      patients with excessive sleepiness due to narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work
      sleep disorder. It has not be studied in menopause-associated fatigue.

      In the proposed study, the investigators plan to investigate the effect of armodafinil on
      quality of life and fatigue in a population of peri- and postmenopausal women with fatigue
      and reduced quality of life who do not have primary sleep disorders, significant levels of
      insomnia, or depression.
