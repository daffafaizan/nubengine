           pressure from baseline and evaluate the final results (the percentage of patients whose
           conditions have significant improved and the variation of the percentage of median
           intraocular pressure. (2)Assess the amount of medication after surgery.

        2. Secondary goals:(1) Compare median intraocular pressure with baseline at each
           postoperative follow-up and access the variation of median intraocular pressure from
           baseline at each postoperative follow-up. (2) Count the number of intraocular pressure
           lowering drugs at each postoperative follow-up.

      b.Safety: Investigate the incidence of all device-related(or procedure-related) adverse
      events during the study (intraoperative and postoperative follow-up).
