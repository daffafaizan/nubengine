    
      This study is open-label, single-arm, multicenter, prospective study to evaluate the
      usefulness of fentanyl matrix (fentanyl transdermal patch-type system) by assessing patient
      satisfaction when administrating fentanyl matrix (a background pain treatment, and a
      breakthrough pain treatment) for patients with lung cancer for 21 days. Fentanyl transdermal
      patch-type system is designed to deliver medication at a nearly constant amount per unit time
      into the body through the skin for 3 days (72 hours). Studies about transdermal fentanyl have
      found that it had analgesic effects on malignant pain, and most patients receiving the
      medication preferred fentanyl because they experienced less constipation. Safety assessments
      will include adverse event monitoring, vital signs, laboratory work. starting with 12.5g/h or
      25g/h of fentanyl matrix transdermally at the investigator's discretion and flexible dose
      depending the patient's pain relief for 3 weeks
