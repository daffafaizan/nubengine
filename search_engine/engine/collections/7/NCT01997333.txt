    
      CDX-011 consists of an antibody attached to a drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), that can
      kill cancer cells. The antibody delivers the drug to cancer cells by attaching to a protein
      called glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB) that is expressed on the cancer cell. The MMAE is then
      released inside of the cell, where it interferes with cell growth and may lead to cell death.

      This study will examine the efficacy and safety of CDX-011 in patients with advanced TNBC
      that makes the gpNMB protein. The effect of CDX-011 will be compared to treatment with
      capecitabine.

      Eligible patients who enroll in the study will be randomly assigned (by chance) to receive
      treatment with CDX-011 or with capecitabine. For every three patients enrolled, two will
      receive CDX-011 and one will receive treatment with capecitabine. All patients enrolled in
      the study will be closely monitored to determine if their cancer is responding to treatment
      and for any side effects that may occur.
