      (WES/WGS) studies and to receive results present challenges to achieving informed consent due
      to the scope, depth and uncertainty of the information. NIH Intramural studies increasingly
      involve WES/WGS to identify elusive primary variants. This umbrella protocol aims to compare
      an evidence-based consent for WES/WGS to a standard consent in collaboration with ongoing and
      future NIH studies. An equivocal hypothesis will be tested to evaluate whether informed
      choice and perceptions of uncertainty differ between two consent

      groups. A mixed-methods design is proposed that starts with a qualitative mental-model pilot

      study to revise an expert opinion consent intervention by integrating lay-person response

      preferences. Following development of this evidence-based intervention, a randomized two-
      factor design will be used for a quantitative survey study conducted in conjunction with a

      number of NIH studies conducting WES/WGS to test for differences between two consent

      models. A descriptive analysis of the audiotaped consent process will also be conducted to

      assess differences in the content or extent of the process, and related outcomes of
      satisfaction and decisional conflict will also be assessed.
