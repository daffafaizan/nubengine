      fractures. The effect of treating proximal and distal intra-articulatio tibial fractures has
      been positive until now.

      Complications such as malunions, nonunions, re-fractures and extended time of ring fixation
      will occur in 5-10% of all tibial fractures in patients treated with ring fixator. Factors
      like trauma of soft tissue, smoking and compromised afflux of blood are associated with a
      higher frequency of nonunion.

      It has been documented that elderly people with hypovitaminosis D have a higher risk of being
      affected by osteoporosis and fractures. Furthermore, there is a possible association between
      the severity of fracture and hypovitaminosis. The time of fracture healing is also extended
      compared to fractures in patients who are not affected by osteoporosis.

      Until now research has not shown whether the fracture healing process is influenzed by
      vitamin D.
