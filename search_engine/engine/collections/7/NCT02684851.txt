      blood loss and outcome after surgery to the acetabulum.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups. In this study, investigators plan to administer
      a 10mg/kg dose within 30 minutes of surgery followed by a 10mg/kg infusion over a 4hr period
      to the treatment group (for patients weighting over 100kg, a weight of 100kg will be used for
      the dose calculation). The control group will receive equal volumes of and rates of normal
      saline.

      Research Questions:

        1. Do patients undergoing acetabular ORIF who receive tranexamic acid have a reduced risk
           of allogenic blood transfusion as compared to patients who receive placebo?

        2. Do patients undergoing acetabular ORIF who receive tranexamic acid have reduced
           peri-operative blood loss as compared to patients who receive placebo?

        3. Do patients undergoing acetabular ORIF who receive tranexamic acid have a higher risk
           for thromboembolic events than patients who receive placebo?

        4. Do patients undergoing acetabular ORIF who receive tranexamic acid have a reduced risk
           of wound complications (prolonged wound drainage, return to the OR within 30 days,
           infection)?

        5. Is the use of tranexamic acid cost effective relative to the use of allogenic blood
           transfusion as a blood loss management strategy in acetabular ORIF?
