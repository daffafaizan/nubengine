      excessive worry. The investigators will include 12 participants with excessive worry and test
      the treatment which focuses on reducing intolerance of uncertainty (IU) in order to reduce
      worry.

      Participants will be randomized to either one, two or three weeks of weekly baseline
      measurements prior to starting treatment, and will thus work as their on controls in this
      case series design.

      Primary outcome measures will be collected at 12 weeks after treatment start. Participants
      will be followed up at three months after treatment.
