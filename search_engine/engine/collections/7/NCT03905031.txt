      will be approached for enrollment. An alert will notify study personnel as CT scans are
      ordered. The goal is to obtain NIRS data within four-hours before or after the CT scan.
      Informed consent will be obtained according to institutional protocols. NIRS data will be
      obtained using Infrascanner model 2000 (Infrascanner Inc.). Eight data points will be
      collected for each subject in standard fashion from right to left frontal, temporal,
      parietal, and occipital locations. Study personnel will be trained by the manufacturer and
      will be blinded to the results of the CT scan. Data stored on the Infrascanner will be
      subsequently transferred to a password-protected database for storage and analysis. For each
      participant scanned with the Infrascanner 2000, they will be de-identified with a subject
      number, with patient demographics, mechanism of injury, GCS presentation, time of CT scan,
      and time of NIRS recorded. CT scan results comprise presence of epidural hematoma and/or
      subdural hematoma and its maximal thickness if present; presence of intraparenchymal
      hematoma; presence of skull fracture; and any other traumatic injuries contained in the CT
      scan report. The length of time required to acquire NIRS data will also be recorded for
      quality improvement purposes.

      The specific aims of this study are to better understand the epidemiology of traumatic brain
      injury (TBI) at Dayton Children's Hospital, to establish the operating characteristics of
      NIRS for suspected traumatic intracranial hemorrhage at Dayton Children's Hospital, and to
      study the implementation of a new diagnostic modality in a busy tertiary care emergency
      department.
