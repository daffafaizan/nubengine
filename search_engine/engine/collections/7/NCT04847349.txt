    
      This pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial will test the preliminary efficacy of two
      doses (a standard dose and a high dose) of a combination of live microbials (probiotics),
      currently marketed in food (including products labeled as dietary supplements), given daily
      for 21 days to boost the immunity of unvaccinated, generally healthy persons ages 18-60 with
      prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data collected will include demographics,
      comorbidities, medications, information about prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and self-reported
      symptoms and adverse events (AEs). Biospecimens (saliva, nasal wash, blood, and stool) will
      be collected at baseline and days 21 and 42 for analysis.
