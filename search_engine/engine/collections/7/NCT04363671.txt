      Phenomenological Analysis. 15 adolescents followed in consultation, day hospital or full
      hospitalization and 15 health professionals working at the Maison des Adolescents will be
      included. Semi-structured interviews will be carried out by a psychiatrist, based on flexible
      and evolving interview guides. Qualitative analysis of adolescents and therapists' interviews
      will allow to explore the experience of teleconsultation by each group of participants and to
      inform about the advantages and limits of a teleconsultation device in adolescent care.
