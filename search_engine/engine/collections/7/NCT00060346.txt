        -  Determine the response rate of patients with newly diagnosed Waldenstrom's
           macroglobulinemia treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
           and prednisone.

        -  Determine the associated toxic effects of this regimen, specifically the frequency of
           febrile neutropenia, in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate baseline cytogenetic features and gene expression profiles with response in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over approximately 4 hours, cyclophosphamide IV
      over 5-30 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 5-15 minutes, and vincristine IV over 1 minute on day
      1. Patients also receive oral prednisone on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients were accrued for this study.
