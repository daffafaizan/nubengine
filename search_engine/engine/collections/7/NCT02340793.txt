    
      All participants will receive the Counterweight Plus dietary intervention. This consists of:

        -  12-20 weeks 800+ calories/day Total Diet Replacement Plan, followed by

        -  6-8 weeks Food Reintroduction, followed by

        -  up to 104 weeks Weight Loss Maintenance, based on maintaining daily calorie restriction.

      All participants will undergo the following investigations at baseline and at regular
      intervals throughout the study period:

        -  height (baseline only)

        -  whole body MRI scans: total-body skeletal muscle volume and fat mass will be measured
           using whole-body multi-slice MRI (baseline and 12 weeks only)

        -  functional assessment: completion of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
           Arthritis Index (WOMAC) (baseline and 12 weeks only)

        -  gait and muscle strength assessment: biomechanical gait analysis will be carried out
           using an 8 camera VICON system during flat walking to determine maximum flexion and
           extension moments for both limbs and maximum adduction and abduction moments. Muscle
           strength will also be directly measured of both the upper (grip strength) and lower
           (quadriceps and hamstrings) limb using a dynamometer and myometer (baseline and 12 weeks
           only)

        -  anthropometric measurement: body weight; waist, hip, thigh, arm and calf circumferences

        -  indirect calorimetry: resting metabolic rate will be measured by a computerised
           open-circuit ventilated hood system

        -  fasting blood sampling: for measurement of HbA1C, lipid profile, leptin, thyroid
           hormones

        -  gut microbiota analysis from faecal samples

        -  Binge Eating Disorder and Quality of Life (EQ-5D) questionnaires

      Participants will receive regular support/advice from a research dietician/ nutritionist
      during the two year study period.
