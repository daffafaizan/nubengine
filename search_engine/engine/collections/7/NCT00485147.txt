      Objective 1: technical validation of GPS measurements in healthy subjects.

      phase 1: technical validation of a GPS device to study outdoor walking (completed).

      phase 2: comparison and use of various GPS devices (intra- and inter-GPS variability) in the
      study outdoor walking (on-going).

      phase 3: study of several factors that could influence accuracy of GPS measurements as
      walking speed, environment, sampling frequency and others technical features as the
      WAAS/EGNOS function (on-going).

      Objective 2: Application in PAD patients to study walking capacity under free-living
      conditions

      phase 1: comparison of GPS measurements (maximal walking distance) with the gold standard
      treadmill measurement of maximal walking distance (completed).

      phase 2: analysis of the variability of the walking capacity under free-living conditions
      from GPS measurements (completed).

      phase 3: study of reliability and sensibility (effect of treatment) of GPS measurements
      (on-going).

      phase 4: study of the relationship between laboratory measurements of walking capacity and
      GPS-derived parameters.
