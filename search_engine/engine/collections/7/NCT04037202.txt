      postpartum period on the need of receiving analgesic medication after assessing the
      postpartum comfort and pain status of the mothers who had vaginal delivery.

      Materials and methods: In order to keep the number of people in balance between the groups,
      "block randomization" method which is one of the fixed probability randomization types was
      preferred. The research was completed with 66 persons, 33 in the study group and 33 in the
      control group. As data collection tools, a questionnaire, Postpartum Comfort Scale (PCS),
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Drug Follow-up Card (DFC) were used.

      Research inclusion criteria include (i) primipara mothers (who had their first birth), (ii)
      mothers who had normal vaginal delivery, (iii) those who had undergone episiotomy, (iv) who
      were volunteered to participate in the study, (v) who were on the first day of delivery
      (first 24 hours), (vi) who had no complications in the infant and the baby, (vii) age of whom
      ranged from 18 to 35, (viii) those who did not apply or receive any other complementary
