      in Biomedical Research Center laboratories. This protocol is designed to create the
      opportunity to obtain such tissue samples including: blood, urine, saliva, sweat, feces, hair
      and nail clippings, nasal scraping, muscle, fat, skin and taste buds. It may also include
      samples taken during a surgical procedure, including: fluid from around the spinal column,
      heart, lungs and abdomen; fat, muscle, connective tissue and organs (liver, bladder, heart,
      kidney and skin).

      Information derived from such studies is for research purposes only and is not provided to
      the participants or their health care provider. Samples will be coded (no names) and
      identifying information linking the participant to the sample will be maintained in a secure
      location by the P.I. and Study Coordinator.

      Participants will be 18 years or older and have been identified by the investigator and/or
      physician to have a condition of interest for exploratory studies related to the participant
      s illness or other feature that offers the possibility of creating information that leads to
      scientifically useful and important studies. Participants could also be healthy volunteers,
      willing to provide their samples. These samples could be requested by an investigator to be
      used as age, gender, race and/or ethnicity-matched controls or to calibrate or compare and
      contrast across lab equipment. Participants will be excluded if obtaining the sample would be
      over and above usual clinical care, would result in excessive blood loss, or the individual
      is unable to provide informed consent.

      The expected outcome is to provide investigators with the opportunity to obtain tissues of
      interest for laboratory evaluation.
