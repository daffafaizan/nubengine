    
      This is a multi-center, phase II, 18-week, two arm, unblinded randomized clinical trial.

      Seventy-eight pediatric subjects with SLE and 25(OH)D levels ≤ 20 ng/mL will be randomized in
      a 1:1 ratio to receive either standard-dose (400 IU/day) or high-dose (6,000 IU/day) vitamin
      D3 for 18 weeks based upon weight at baseline. Subjects randomized to the high-dose vitamin
      D3 treatment arm will receive 6,000 IU per day from baseline until the subject's vitamin D
      levels reach ≥ 40 ng/mL at which point the vitamin D3 dose will be reduced to 4,000 IU per
      day. Subjects randomized to the high-dose treatment arm weighing < 40 kg will receive
      supplementation five days per week and all other subjects will receive supplementation seven
      days a week.

      In addition to the baseline, and weeks 6, 12, and 18 visits, subjects randomized to the
      high-dose treatment arm will return at Weeks 3 and 9 to assess for symptoms of vitamin D
      toxicity. If a subject in the high-dose arm is found to exhibit evidence of vitamin D
      toxicity at the week 12 visit, he/she will be asked to return to their clinical research site
      for an additional vitamin D toxicity assessment at week 15. Study personnel will record each
      subject's interval history, assess adverse events, disease activity, and collect samples for
      safety and mechanistic assessments.
