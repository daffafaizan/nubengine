      is identified, the colonoscope will be removed and a sigmoidoscope inserted. The colon OFDI
      catheter will be advanced through the sigmoidoscope accessory port and positioned adjacent to
      the colon wall. Imaging will be performed with the OFDI system across the polyp's surface and
      the base/stalk if pedunculated. The investigators anticipate that on average the
      investigators will utilize 4 helical scans per polyp. Each of the scans will take less than
      30 seconds.
