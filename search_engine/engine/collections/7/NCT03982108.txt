      computer-generated list in order to randomize all participants to receive one of two
      treatments (https://www.random.org/sequences/).

      Rotator cuff tear diagnosis will be made by physical examination and magnetic resonance
      imaging. Participants who agree to be enrolled to study will be examined one day prior to
      surgery. Half of the participants will undergo an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with
      knot-tying suture-bridge technique, while the other half will receive a knotless
      suture-bridge technique. All the surgeries will be performed by the same senior surgeon
      experienced in shoulder surgery under general anesthesia with participant in beach-chair
      position.

      All participants will receive a standard postoperative rehabilitation program starting
      immediately after surgery with active elbow and passive shoulder exercises. The operated
      upper extremity will be placed in a sling for 6 weeks. Active-assisted exercises will be
      started at 6 weeks postoperatively.

      Postoperative evaluations will be performed regularly at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 12 months postoperatively and each following year. The results of last follow-up will
      be analyzed. To assess repair integrity and tendon healing, a postoperative magnetic
      resonance imaging scan will be performed to all participants at 6 months postoperatively. The
      results of prospective clinical follow-up data and radiological evaluation will be analyzed
      in order to compare clinical outcomes, failure rates and patterns of knot-tying and knotless
      suture-bridge arthroscopic rotator cuff repair techniques.
