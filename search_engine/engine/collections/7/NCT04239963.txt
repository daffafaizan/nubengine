      be recruited from McLean's Ketamine clinic. Suitability for Ketamine treatment will be
      determined as typically done by the service - through evaluation by the clinicians on the
      staff of the Ketamine Service who perform psychiatric consultations and assessments for
      Ketamine suitability. Potential subjects will be informed about the study only after they
      have received a positive consultation at the clinic and have already agreed to receive the
      treatment.

      This study consists of a set of questionnaires, urine drug screen, and electroencephalogram
      (EEG) recordings.
