      oxygen use for patients with COPD who have recovered after a recent hospitalization.
      Participants will be randomized to usual care vs. an oxygen de-implementation intervention.
      Patients assigned to the oxygen de-implementation intervention group will have their active
      oxygen prescription discontinued, be educated on pursed lip breathing and receive inhaler
      training. A follow-up assessment will occur at 12 weeks. The primary outcome at 12 weeks will
      be discontinuation of oxygen. Secondary outcomes include health status as measured by the
      Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), tele-six minute walk test (6MWT) distance, and Borg
      dyspnea scale assessed after the tele-6MWT. Among the intervention group, the investigators
      will also assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention for patient participants
      and their providers.
