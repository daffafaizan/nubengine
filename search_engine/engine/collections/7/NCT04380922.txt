    
      The present study explores the prevalence of periodontal diseases regarding to the activity
      status of IBD (active versus non-active).

      Diseases activity will be assessed by HBI (Crohn's disease) or partial Mayo score (Ulcerative
      Colitis) associated with fecal calprotectin and/or CRP and/or inflammatory/ulcerative
      lesions.

      Periodontal diseases (periodontitis and gingivitis) will be diagnosed according to the
      international classification of periodontal diseases (Chicago 2017) and based on the
      decision-making algorithms by Tonetti and Sanz. A periodontal screening, socio-demographic
      data and clinical data will be collected. Then, oral mucosa dermatological manifestations
      relative to IBD, treatment need (ICDAS) and quality of life related to oral health (GOHAI)
      will be evaluated. These data will be collected by a periodontist.

      The principal hypothesis of this study is that the prevalence of periodontal diseases could
      be increased in patient presenting an active IBD.

      The primary objective is to evaluate if patients presenting active IBD present more stage III
      and IV periodontal diseases than non-active IBD ones.

      The second objectives are :

        -  to compare periodontal diseases, gingivitis and oral mucosa dermatological
           manifestations rates according to the diseases activity, the IBD type and the treatment
           used to treat IBD,

        -  to compare oral treatment need according to the activity and the type of IBD,

        -  to compare quality of life related to oral health according to the activity and the type
           of IBD
