      aging, which may be due to vascular dysfunction. Aging and inflammation also lead to
      increased oxidative stress, which impairs vascular function. During acute inflammation,
      endothelial function is altered differently in younger and older adults with decreases in
      endothelial function in younger, but not older adults. However, cardiorespiratory fitness is
      cardio-protective, impacting inflammation, vascular function, and oxidative stress. During
      acute inflammation, moderately fit older adults exhibit similar responses to younger adults,
      suggesting preserved endothelial reactivity. However, whether the protective mechanism is
      oxidative stress has not been confirmed. Furthermore, it is undetermined whether the vascular
      dysfunction is further propagated down the arterial tree during acute inflammation to the
      microvasculature.

      The aims of this research study are to determine if age and fitness moderate the vascular
      response to acute inflammation and to determine if antioxidant administration eliminates
      vascular dysfunction during acute inflammation. The results from this study will help to
      elucidate if fitness is a protective and preventive measure to ameliorate the detrimental
      cardiovascular response to acute inflammation. Thus, this study may provide health
      professionals with a behavioral intervention to reduce cardiovascular disease burden in the
      rapidly growing aging population.
