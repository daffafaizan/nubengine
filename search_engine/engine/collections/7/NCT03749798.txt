      wavefront aberrometry, Tscherning aberrometry, Laser Raytracing and automatic retinoscopy.
      While Hartmann-Shack wavefront aberrometry, the most widespread of these techniques, uses a
      lenslet array to record distortions of light bundles coming from a single source form the
      retina, Tscherning aberrometry uses a matrix of pinholes. Laser Ray Tracing in contrast
      measures the aberration of a laser beam at different locations. All three systems compare
      distorsions of the measured light beams with a perfect optical system to calculate the
      wavefront errors. Repeatability of wavefront devices was studied in young healthy subjects
      and different devices have been compared to each other. These results do not represent the
      typical cataract patient. Several factors, such as tear film instability and pupil size, have
      an influence on the measurements and these factors may change significantly with age.

      Intraoperative measured data could help to get a better information about wavefront
      aberrations.
