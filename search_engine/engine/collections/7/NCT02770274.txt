    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, single-blinded, phase III, controlled trial investigating
      the safety and effectiveness of dual antiplatelet therapy with cilostazol 100 mg twice daily
      and aspirin 100 mg daily versus monotherapy with aspirin 100 mg daily in patients undergoing
      peripheral, infrainguinal angioplasty or stenting or both for the management of peripheral
      arterial disease (intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia). The study will
      include in total 200 patients randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either dual antiplatelet
      therapy for 6 months cilostazol 100 mg once daily and aspirin 100 mg daily versus monotherapy
      with aspirin 100 mg daily for 12 months. The study's primary endpoint will be the composite
      of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke,
      major amputation, target limb open surgical or endovascular revascularization). Additional
      therapy with clopidogrel 75mg daily will be added in either group for one month in case of
      stent placement. Secondary endpoints will include quality of life assessment using dedicated
      questionnaires, drug- and procedure-related complication rates, target-limb revascularization
      rates, clinical improvement (ABI and Rutherford-Becker classification changes). Clinical
      follow up will be performed at 1, 6 and 12 months and will include physical examination, ABI
      measurements, Rutherford-Becker classification. Maximum follow up period will be 2 years
      after the index procedure.
