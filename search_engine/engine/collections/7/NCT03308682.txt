    
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that can develop anywhere
      in the body and arise from neuroendocrine cells throughout the endocrine system. The most
      recent NCCN guidelines for unresectable and metastatic NET recommend somatostatin analogues
      as first-line treatment, but do not recommend a particular treatment sequence for the
      remaining therapies. Radiolabeled somatostatin analogue therapy, also known as peptide
      receptor radionuclide therapy has become a well-accepted treatment for patients with well to
      moderately differentiated unresectable or metastatic NETs and disease progression after
      first-line treatment. However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-Dotatate has
      been its short half-life and fast rate of clearance. This study was designed to investigate
      the safety, dosimetry and preliminary effects of a long-lasting radiolabeled somatostatin
      analogue 177Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE in patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.
