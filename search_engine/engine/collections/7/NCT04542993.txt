      possible to utilize resveratrol as a transporter for zinc treatment as means to minimize
      viral load and severity of resulting COVID-19 disease?

      60 ambulatory SARS-CoV-2 positive volunteers who will be randomized into one of two treatment
      arms to receive either Zinc and resveratrol or double placebo for a period of 5 days and will
      be monitored for a 14 day period. It is anticipated to take approximately 20 weeks to accrue
      this cohort resulting in an estimated active project period of 22 weeks, although it may take
      up to 12 additional weeks to collect all of the data related to COVID-19 admissions in the
      cohort.
