      disease of diabetes and its complications. The value of pharmacists' involvement in disease
      state management in producing positive outcomes for patients has been well documented in the
      literature. There have been several studies that have shown that pharmacists' involvement in
      diabetes care improves glycemic control. There are also studies that look at pharmacists'
      management of glycemic control and adherence to the ADA guidelines. Many of these studies are
      retrospective, lack a randomized control group, had a small study sample, or were short term.
      We undertook a prospective, randomized study to demonstrate that pharmacists working
      collaboratively with physicians and other providers in an ambulatory care setting can improve
      glucose, blood pressure, and lipid control, as well as improve quality of life, adherence to
      screening and general preventative measures.
