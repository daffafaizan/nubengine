      I. To assess 4-month disease control rate (DCR) in pre-treated patients with unresectable
      malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) treated with brentuximab vedotin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate, progression-free and overall survival, and safety/toxicity
      of brentuximab vedotin in CD30+ malignant mesothelioma.

      II. To prospectively evaluate the incidence of CD30+ expression in malignant mesothelioma
      during the screening process.

      III. To determine whether CD30+ expression levels in tumor tissue correlate to response to
      brentuximab vedotin.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect archival or new tissue and blood for correlative studies. II. Next generation
      sequencing (NGS) will be conducted on adequate tumor tissue specimens.

      III. Exploratory analysis: Bank peripheral blood at baseline for subsequent cytokine or
      reverse phase protein array (RPPA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months
      and then every 6 months thereafter.
