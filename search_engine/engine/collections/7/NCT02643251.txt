    
      Study CLO-291 is a randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter study of 0.1% clonidine topical gel (Clonidine Gel) for the treatment of pain
      associated with painful diabetic neuropathy. The study will include three (3) phases:
      Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Follow-up Phase. Subjects who satisfy all eligibility
      criteria will apply Clonidine Gel Comparator to their feet three times daily and will record
      their daily pain scores using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Approximately 100
      adult subjects will be randomized to receive Clonidine Gel or Clonidine Gel Comparator during
      the 12 week Treatment Phase.
