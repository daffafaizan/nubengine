      be used as a method to measure the activity of the locus coeruleus non-invasively.

      There are 3 conditions:

        1. transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation

        2. sham stimulation

        3. no stimulation

      The conditions will be randomized.

      In each condition the participant will do the oddball task and then the memory task. Between
      the conditions there is a wash-out period of 30 minutes. After completion of all 3 conditions
      and after a wash-out period of 30 minutes, the participant will do a final recognition task
      (part of the memory task in total).

      During the oddball task EEG will be measured. An electro-cardiogram (ECG), electro-oculogram
      (EOG) and larynx electromyogram (EMG) will also be recorded for easy filtering of artefacts.
