    
      The study consists of a screening phase, followed by a 4 week double-blind phase. During the
      double-blind phase, the patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either Lodotra® or
      immediate release prednisone (prednisone IR) plus respective placebo.

      After completion of the double-blind phase, patients will be re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio to
      open-label Lodotra® or prednisone IR for 48 weeks. During the open-label phase, the dose of
      study medication will be tapered based on titration criteria.
