      inhibitory control (DNIC), an endogenous pain inhibitory pathway in which pain inhibits pain.
      Conditioned pain modulation is less efficient in individuals with chronic pain conditions and
      it is a predictor for the development of chronic pain.

      Massage is a common manual therapy intervention for individuals with musculoskeletal pain.
      Greater changes in pain sensitivity occur following pain inducing massage suggesting a
      mechanism dependent upon the efficiency of the conditioned pain modulation response.

      The study team will evaluate the association between pain inducing massage and the
      conditioned pain modulation paradigm. Healthy participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive a pain inducing massage, a pain free massage, or participate in a coldpressor task.
      Pre-and post intervention pain sensitivity including conditioned pain modulation will be
      assessed. The study team will determine if analgesia induced by massage is similar to the
      conditioned pain modulation paradigm and compare changes in pain sensitivity between groups.

      Previous research has indicated pain inducing massage is more effective than pain free
      massage suggesting a mechanism dependent upon conditioned pain modulation. However, this
      study will be the first to systematically investigate if analgesia induced by pain inducing
      massage is similar to the conditioned pain modulation paradigm. Furthermore, this study will
      be the first to determine the association between baseline conditioned pain modulation and
      massage related hypoalgesia.
