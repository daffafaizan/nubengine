      I. Improve detection of metastasis with fluciclovine F18 (fluciclovine) and gallium Ga
      68-labeled PSMA-11 (PSMA) PET versus best standard of care conventional imaging, as confirmed
      with histology.

      II. Determine concordance and discordance of invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) detection
      with PSMA versus fluciclovine PET, as confirmed with histology.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Establish the role of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) directed to
      ESR1 and PI3K DNA in characterizing the degree of tumor burden as identified by metabolic
      amino acid transport and tumor neovasculature receptor imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and undergo a PET/computed
      tomography (CT) scan over 30 minutes. On a separate day, patients receive fluciclovine F18 IV
      and undergo a PET/CT scan over 30 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up in 5-10 business days, and then up to 5
      years.
