    
      This is a single-site, non-randomized pilot study to determine whether Magnetic Resonance
      Elastography (MRE) can be optimized for clinical use as part of the patients routine clinical
      imaging and to correlate with MR signal characteristics of the uterine fibroid.

      MRE is performed at the end of the examination after the standard Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      protocol.

      Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To acquire magnetic resonance elastography images on women who have a
      clinically ordered pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for uterine fibroids.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine the correlation between MRE stiffness values and MR T2 signal
      characteristics for uterine fibroids. For a subset of patients going on to surgery
      correlation with pathology can also be performed.

      This study will seek to determine whether MRE can be performed in the pelvis on a routine
      clinical basis as well as correlating the MRE findings with magnetic resonance signal
      characteristics. There are no additional risks to the patient and no additional cost to the
      MRI exam.
