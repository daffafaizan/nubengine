      help evaluate the validity of the patients' perception that the current dosage of opioid is
      sufficient of insufficient to alleviate pain. This study will test the quantifiable proteins
      such as S100B and BDNF will serve as objective measures (biomarkers) of pain.

      Fibromyalgia patients will be recruited into two groups-- one that uses opioids and the other
      that does not. Blood will be collected every 6 months for two years. The serum will be used
      to assay for levels of S100B and BDNF, The pressure-pain threshold (PPT) data, as part of
      standard of care, will also be collected. Correlation will the be assessed.
