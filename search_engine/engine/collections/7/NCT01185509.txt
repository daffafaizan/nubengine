    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of trastuzumab and vinorelbine in patients
           with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 negative primary tumors and HER2 positive
           circulating tumor cells.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the number of CTCs and the CTCs characteristics before and after therapy,
           and to explore the correlation of these findings with response.

        -  To further characterize the safety and tolerability.

        -  To evaluate progression-free survival.

        -  To evaluate clinical benefit rate [complete response (CR)+partial response (PR)+stable
           disease (SD)>24 weeks].

      Exploratory

        -  To determine the clinical feasibility of high-throughput mutation profiling on
           circulating tumor cells (CTCs).
