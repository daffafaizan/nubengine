      subjects to be enrolled at sub-therapeutic doses such as the very low starting doses in both
      arms of the study. Initial cohorts will include only one subject and dose escalations will be
      in 100% increments until a single Grade 2 toxicity related to study drug or DLT occurs in
      Cycle 1. Dose escalation will proceed until the MTD is exceeded. MTD is defined as average of
      the highest dose level for which 2 out of 6 subjects experience a DLT and the previous dose
      level, provided no additional DLTs occur. Subjects who discontinue TLI treatment before
      completion of Cycle 1 for reasons other than toxicity will not be evaluable for the
      determination of MTD and will be replaced.

      The study will consist of a screening period, treatment period, and a post-treatment period.
      Subjects will be followed for 30 days after their last TLI dose. Safety and tolerability
      parameters include clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, and
      adverse events (AEs).
