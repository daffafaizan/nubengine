      10 with resistant genital ulcers will be enrolled (screen 40). After enrollment all patients
      will be followed for a month to document the number of oral and genital ulcers on their
      current regimen. Then all patients will receive abatacept for 6 months (evaluated at weeks 0,
      2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24). Then the treatment will be stopped and they will be observed for the
      next 2 months, for a total of 9 month trial.
