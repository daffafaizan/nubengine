      pump, a Dexcom continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and an experiential MMPPC (multiple model
      probabilistic predictive control) algorithm housed on an android cell phone. The system doses
      insulin based on CGM sensor glucose levels and the experimental algorithm. The algorithm runs
      through a glucose control platform called the DiAs (Diabetes Assistant)

      The aim of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of the MMPPC controller in
      adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes testing the use of predefined tuning parameters
      to provide adaptability to patient. We will assess the safety of the system with both
      unannounced meals, and meals using a meal announcement with a premeal insulin bolus based on
      the subject's estimated carbohydrate content of the meal
