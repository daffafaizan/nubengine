      test a stepped-care intervention to improve functional and work-related outcomes in Operation
      Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
      Stepped-care involves starting with lower intensity, less costly treatments initially (Step
      1) and "stepping up" to more intensive, costly, or complex treatments in patients with
      inadequate response (Step 2). The study design will be a randomized controlled trial. The
      stepped care approach will involve 12 weeks of a pain self-management program in Step 1
      followed by 12 weeks of brief cognitive behavioral therapy in participants with inadequate
      improvement in pain-related disability (Step 2). Patients treated in usual care will be the
      control group. Thus, the primary objective of the ESCAPE trial is to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of a stepped care intervention vs. usual care
      in OIF/OEF veterans with chronic and disabling musculoskeletal pain and evaluate the impact
      of this intervention on pain-related disability, work function, psychological distress, and
      secondary outcomes.
