    
      This study was prospective, randomized, controlled, double blind, in which patients who met
      the inclusion criteria and give written consent to participate in the study underwent a
      baseline hemodynamic study to determine the portal pressure gradient (GPSH). During the
      event, will assess the acute response to intravenous administration of propranolol. It is
      considered good hemodynamic response to declining GPSH >20% from baseline or decrease to <12
      mmHg. At the conclusion of the baseline hemodynamic study patients will be divided into 2
      treatment groups:

      a) patients responding to treatment with beta-blockers, in which she was treated with nadolol
      at doses of 40mg/24horas (increasing the dose every 2-3 days as tolerated, to a maximum of
      240 mg / 24 hours. Subsequently randomized into two treatment arms, double-blind:

      a.1: simvastatin 20 mg capsules, starting at doses of 20 mg / 24 hours, may increase to 40 mg
      according to clinical and laboratory tolerance.

      a.2: placebo capsules with external characteristics similar to simvastatin.

      b) non-responders to treatment with beta blockers, carvedilol receive treatment with an
      initial dose of 6.25 mg / 24 hours, may increase to 25mg/dia if good clinical tolerance (HR
      and BP monitoring) and analytical (renal function and electrolyte disturbances) .
      Subsequently randomized into two treatment arms, double-blind b.1: simvastatin 20 mg
      capsules, starting at doses of 20 mg / 24 hours, may increase to 40 mg according to clinical
      and laboratory tolerance.

      b.2: placebo capsules with external characteristics similar to simvastatin.

      In order to evaluate the long-term hemodynamic effect, patients will receive treatment for a
      month and hemodynamic study will be repeated to completion.
