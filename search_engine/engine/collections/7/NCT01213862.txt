      cause of re-hospitalizations in the Unified Health System, which has not changed over the
      years, impairs the management of the limited resources of the public health system.
      Additionally, HF leads to substantial damage to the quality of life of patients, many of them
      at a socially productive age, resulting in early retirements and absences. In this study, the
      objective is to evaluate the impact of the follow-up of heart failure patients at home,
      interspersed with telephone contacts, by the nursing team, after hospital discharge,
      regarding knowledge of the disease, self-care skills and quality of life improvement,
      compared with the conventional follow-up of patients in a 6-month period without this
      intervention, as well as to build a mobile-technology computer structure to make the use of
      cardiology nursing evaluation forms viable; correlate sociodemographic and clinical
      characteristics with treatment compliance and re-hospitalization rates in both; and ascertain
      home follow-up costs.

      With this purpose, a two-center randomized clinical trial, blinded for the endpoints
      re-hospitalization and costs, was designed.
