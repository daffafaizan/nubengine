      to clarify which patient group or severity of illness is more affected by this issue. The
      effect of exercise on cognitive functions is a remarkable issue in recent years. It can also
      be predicted that cognitive function may be effective on program adaptation in patients who
      are given home program without supervision. The aim of the investigator's study was to
      investigate the effect of cognitive status to pulmonary rehabilitation gains in lung
      transplant candidates.

      Lung transplantation candidates who refered from Lung Transplantation surgery team will
      receive the Pulmonary Rehabilitation program for 3-months (2 days at hospital, 3 days at
      home). Exercise program includes aerobic (walking band, bicycle, arm ergometer) and
      strengthening (with free weights) components. Patient will evaluate at the beginning and end
      of the program. Demographic information, diagnosis distributions, educational status of
      patients will be recorded. Exercise capacities are determined by 6 min walk test. The medical
      research council dyspnea scale is used in determining the dispense levels. Montreal Cognitive
      Function Assessment (MOCA) is used to determine cognitive functions. Cognitive functions and
      exercise capacities of the patients before and after the program will be evaluated.
