    
      This registry is a non-interventional, multicentre, retrospective cohort study in patients
      with acute myocardial infarction undergoing PCI after CRP, ventilated and/or with cardiogenic
      shock.

      The study is purely observational; data will be documented retrospectively based on available
      medical records. No additional data will be collected, no study-related treatment will be
      initiated.

      About 10 - 20 high-volume PCI clinics in Germany treating patients with myocardial infarction
      are eligible for participation. Participating sites will be given a maximum of 6 months for
      retrospectively documenting eligible patients.

      Eligible are all patients with acute myocardial infarction (STEMI, NSTEMI) who underwent PCI
      after CRP, ventilated and/or with cardiogenic shock and were treated with cangrelor during
      index procedure. It is planned to enrol about 400 patients in total. Patient characteristics,
      procedural details and clinical events occurring during the period between index MI and
      discharge or death (whichever came first) will be documented based on the relevant existing
      medical charts of the patients.
