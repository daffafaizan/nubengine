      the protrusion of vagina, uterus, or both. The investigators designed a prospective study in
      this article to evaluate the efficacy, the life quality and the complications of two
      different meshes of type I (one is Perigee/Apogee, the other is named Gynecare prolift)
      versus traditional surgery. The investigators also studied the influence of some surgical
      procedures on the prognosis. In this study，The investigators divided the patients randomly
      into three groups :the group A was a total of 91 patients who accepted transvaginal
      hysterectomy and total pelvic floor reconstruction combined Perigee and Apogee polypropylene
      mesh(PA)；the group B was a total of 97 patients who accepted transvaginal hysterectomy and
      total pelvic floor reconstruction with Gynecare prolift polypropylene mesh；the group C was a
      total of 70 patients who accepted transvaginal hysterectomy and anterior and posterior
      vaginal wall repair without any mesh.The investigators did POP-Q measurements and
      questionnaire preoperatively and postoperatively and recorded volume of bleeding，day of
      postoperative indwelling catheter and the mesh complications。
