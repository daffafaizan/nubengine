    
      Observational case-control study in a retrospective cohort of patients with stage II or III
      colorectal cancer undergoing scheduled surgery. Period January 2010-December 2014. Patients
      must have had at least 5 years of follow-up to define disease-free survival. From the cohort
      of patients previously studied in our center by immunohistochemistry, 31 we will select 10
      cases with recurrence by random sampling and we will match 10 controls by leveling the
      propensity score (propensity score matching).
