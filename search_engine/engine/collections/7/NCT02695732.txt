      groups: 1)the Carvedilol group and 2)the endoscopy group. Treatment allocation is by block
      randomization, with an two-to-one ratio for Carvedilol and endoscopy. The results are
      concealed in opaque envelopes. The dose of Carvedilol is titrated according to systolic
      arterial blood pressure (ABPsys) and heart rate (HR). Doses are increased every 7 days until
      ABPsys is not less than 95 mm Hg and HR is not less than 55 bpm. Carvedilol is started at a
      dose of 6.25 mg/d, and titrated to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/d. Patients receiving endoscopic
      therapy every 4 weeks until eradication of varices. Patients will come for clinic visit every
      6 months, receiving laboratory tests and endoscopic examinations, and events of primary and
      secondary outcomes will be analyzed.
