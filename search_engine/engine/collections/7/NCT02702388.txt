    
      This study consists of 2 phases, the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase. The
      Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days and will include a Screening Period
      to establish protocol eligibility and a Baseline Period to confirm eligibility and establish
      disease characteristics prior to randomization and treatment.

      The Randomization Phase will consist of a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. It will
      begin at the time of randomization of the first participant and will consist of 28-day
      blinded study treatment cycles. The data cutoff for the primary analysis will occur at the
      end of the Randomization Phase, which is defined as when the last participant enrolled
      completes the Week 24 tumor assessments or discontinues study treatment if before Week 24.

      Participants on treatment at the time of data cutoff for the primary analysis will remain on
      blinded investigational product until the primary analysis has been completed, after which
      they will transition to commercial lenvatinib outside the study. The last participant's last
      assessment (Off-treatment visit) will be the End of Study.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with 1 of 2 blinded starting dosages of
      lenvatinib in a 1:1 ratio to receive lenvatinib 18 mg or 24 mg orally once daily (QD). Dose
      reductions will occur in succession based on the previous dose level (24, 20, 14, 10, and 8
      mg QD, or 18, 14, 10, 8, and 4 mg QD, respectively). Once the dose has been reduced, it may
      not be increased at a later date.
