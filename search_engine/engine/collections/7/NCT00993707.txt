      (formerly ETX-100) with respect to elastin breakdown, but will also concurrently gather data
      that may point to efficacy. The preliminary efficacy results will be used to assist in the
      design of subsequent phase 2b clinical studies of longer duration to examine both efficacy
      and safety of CTX-100 as a therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
