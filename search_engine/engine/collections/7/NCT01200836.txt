      secondary prevention of heart disease. Their benefit to patients with heart diseases appears
      to exceed that predicted from cholesterol lowering alone. A recent study has found benefits
      of statin therapy in patients with normal cholesterol and high C-reactive protein, a marker
      of inflammation, suggesting that statins exert an anti inflammatory effect in addition to the
      well known cholesterol lowering activity. Studies in mice have revealed mixed observations
      regarding the role of statins in inflammation. Therefore the Center for Human Immunology,
      Autoimmunity and Inflammation is conducting this trial to study the effects of statins on the
      immune system and the inflammatory response in healthy volunteers with normal cholesterol
      levels, and normal or elevated C-reactive protein levels.

      The primary objective is to characterize the immune system before and during statin therapy.
