      parallel group study in healthy adult volunteers with mild to moderate gingivitis. There will
      be six visits to the study site: Screening, Baseline, Day 3 and Weeks 1, 2 and 6. Gingivitis
      will be assessed using a Modified Gingival Index (MGI) and a Bleeding Index (BI). Plaque will
      be assessed by the Turesky modification of the Quigley Hein (TPI). All evaluable teeth (in
      relation to the inclusion/ exclusion general dentition criteria) will be assessed.

      The dosage regimen of twice daily treatment (morning and evening) for the washout dentifrice
      and study products will be the same for all participants and is based on widely recommended
      oral hygiene practice/typical consumer habit. Study participants will be instructed to brush
      for at least 1 timed minute with their assigned study dentifrice on each brushing occasion.
      After 6 weeks (Day 42+/-3 days) twice daily treatment, each participant should complete
      between approximately 84-90 treatment applications. During the washout period for this study
      (minimum 14 days/ maximum 28 days), eligible participants will use a marketed, regular
      fluoride toothpaste and toothbrush (as provided).
