    
      Long term follow-up of vulnerable children such as infants born prematurely are generally
      studied without taking into account the social, familial and care resources available in the
      child environment.

      Thus, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate prematurely born children cognitive
      development at school age, with regards to birth conditions but also to related social
      situation, intra family relationships, modalities of care and utilization of care resources.

      The study will be divided into 3 parts:

        1. Children born prematurely in our level III referral Center will undergo psychometric
           evaluation at 8 to 11 years of age by routine test (WISC IV). The relationship between
           cognitive scores and neonatal characteristics will be determined and compared with the
           results of schoolmate control children, born at term.

        2. The quality of parent and child relationship will be evaluated by standardized
           questionnaire (Perinatal PTSD Questionnaire). This questionnaire allows evaluating
           persistent perinatal stress trauma related to prematurity.

        3. An anthropologic study of care and utilization of care resources will be performed
           within the follow-up network taking care of these children. This part will use
           semi-directive interviews of caregivers involved in the follow-up network.

      This study should allow to better correlate prematurely born children outcome with their
      global environment and propose improvements in care resources utilization for a better
      development.
