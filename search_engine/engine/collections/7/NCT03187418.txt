      involves ciliary body destruction by targeting the ciliary epithelium and stroma, resulting
      in a reduction in aqueous secretion and hence intraocular pressure. This strategy is
      effective for all forms of glaucoma.

      Traditional trans-scleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) achieve its cyclodestructive action
      by using continuous diode laser to target the melanin in the pigmented ciliary body
      epithelium. However, the continuous mode has been shown to cause significant collateral
      tissue damage to adjacent non-pigmented structures including the ciliary stroma and ciliary
      muscle. Traditional TSCPC may therefore be associated with serious complications including
      uveitis, visual deterioration, chronic hypotony, and others.

      More recently, a micropulse delivery mode of diode laser (Micropulse TSCPC, mTSCPC) has been
      used to treat glaucoma by ablating the ciliary processes and reduce aqueous humor production
      with more selective targeting and less collateral damage. In contrast to conventional laser
      delivery where a continuous flow of high intensity energy is delivered, micropulse laser
      application delivers a series of repetitive short pulses of energy with rest periods in
      between pulses. Only a few studies have described the outcomes of this novel glaucoma
      therapy, showing mTSCPC to have comparable efficacy with fewer side effects when compared
      with traditional continuous wave mode diode laser delivery.This improved side effect profile
      has the potential to make mTSCPC an earlier therapeutic option instead of reserving it
      exclusively for end-stage refractory eyes.
