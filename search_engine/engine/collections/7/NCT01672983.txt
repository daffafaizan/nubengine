      of a Treatment and Post-treatment Phase, divided into 2 cohorts: 1) chronic HCV GT1b-
      infected, pegIFN/RBV treatment-exposed Japanese adults; and 2) HCV GT2-infected, pegIFN/RBV
      treatment-exposed Japanese adults. The Treatment Phase evaluated the antiviral activity,
      safety, and pharmacokinetics of a range of ABT-450/r and ABT-267 doses for 12 to 24 weeks.
      The Post-treatment Phase evaluated the evolution and persistence of viral resistance to
      ABT-267 and ABT-450.
