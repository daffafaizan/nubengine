      hypovitaminosis D may affect 40-80% of patients in the perioperative setting. Recent evidence
      also suggests that surgical stress may be associated with a 40% reduction in circulating
      25(OH)D levels when compared to preoperative values. Moreover, the derangement in
      perioperative 25(OH)D levels may be sustained for up to 3 months after surgery. This finding
      has potential implications regarding modifiable risk factors for surgical site infections
      (SSIs), which account for nearly 40% of all nosocomial infections. On aggregate, SSIs result
      in 3.7 million extra hospital days per annum and an added burden of $1.6 billion in annual
      healthcare costs. A growing body of evidence suggests that robust postoperative immune
      function is associated with a lower risk of SSIs. At the same time, vitamin D is increasingly
      recognized as a key regulator of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Yet, optimization of
      perioperative vitamin D status remains grossly understudied. Although our overarching aim is
      to study the impact of vitamin D status on SSIs, the focus of the current investigation is to
      determine whether the administration of a "bolus" oral dose of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)
      in the preoperative setting alters vitamin D status in the perioperative setting (compared to
      a placebo). The investigators elected to conduct the current study in patients who will
      undergo colorectal surgery since these patients are historically at higher risk of developing
      SSIs and therefore would be ideal for future investigations.
