      to receive either Nimotuzumab combined with docetaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil regimen (Arm A)
      or docetaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil alone regimen (Arm B). Combination arm chemotherapy was
      as conducted as follows. Since day 1, Nimotuzumab (200 mg, given as a 2-hour intravenous
      infusion before chemotherapy, Biotech Pharmaceutical Inc., Beijing, China) was administrated
      1 h before chemotherapy once a week for two successive courses, followed by docetaxel (at a
      dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area) was administered as a 1-hour intravenous
      infusion, followed by intravenous cisplatin (75 mg per square meter), administered during a
      period of 0.5 to 3 hours. After completion of the cisplatin infusion, fluorouracil (1000 mg
      per square meter per day) was administered as a continuous 24-hour infusion for 4 days.
      Patients in arm A received docetaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil only.One treatment cycle
      comprised a period of 3 weeks (21 days). Patients received six cycles in both treatment arms,
      unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was observed. Patients in the
      experimental group who had at least stable disease could choose to continue maintenance
      Nimotuzumab every week until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or study withdrawal.
