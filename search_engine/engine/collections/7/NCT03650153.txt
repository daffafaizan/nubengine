      transrectal (TR) prostate MRI targeted biopsy was aimed to provide evidence for clinicians to
      select the appropriate biopsy approach under different conditions. TP (n = 75) and TR (n =
      75) will be performed randomly for 150 patients who are suspicious of prostate cancer (PCa).
      The cancer detection rate (CDR), complication rate, visual analog scale (VAS) score, most
      painful procedure, number of repeated biopsy and additional anesthesia, and operating time
      (starting from lying down on the operating table to getting up) will be recorded.
