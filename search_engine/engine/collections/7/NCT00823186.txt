    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase I study of paclitaxel and cisplatin as neoadjuvant
      therapy in patients with FIGO IB2 or bulky IIA, squamous cell cervical carcinoma of the
      uterine cervix.

      The study is mainly for the dose-finding of paclitaxel, combining with a fixed cisplatinum
      dose, as neoadjuvant chemotherapy on a weekly basis. The optimal dose of paclitaxel is
      principally defined as the highest dose that allow at least 5/6 patients, after NAC, to
      undergo scheduled radical hysterectomy. A subsequent toxicity assessment to evaluate the
      impact of this neoadjuvant chemotherapy to the recovery of the following radical
      hysterectomy, and efficacy assessment is set as the second purpose of this study.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  to establish an optimal dose of weekly cisplatin plus paclitaxel for 3 cycles as
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for FIGO IB2 and bulky IIA, squamous cell cervical
           cancer, followed by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  to evaluate the toxicity of the study regimen and its impact to the radical hysterectomy
           after neoadjuvant chemotherapy

        -  to evaluate the overall tumor response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy

      An estimated of 8 to 21 patients will be enrolled in this study.
