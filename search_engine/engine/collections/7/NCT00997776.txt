      fracture. The ability of hip fracture patients to make sustained functional improvements
      above and beyond natural recovery is unknown. It has been shown that gym-based programs can
      help old adults regain function after hip fracture. It is unclear if these results could be
      translated into the home setting that lacks the gym-based equipment, or if improvement would
      be sustainable. This program compares high intensity strength training performed in the home
      twice weekly for 10 weeks to an attention placebo control in which participants receive
      sensory electrical stimulation to leg muscles.
