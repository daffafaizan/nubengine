    
      A cluster controlled trial using minimisation for allocation at the level of general practice
      in two centres (London and Nottingham/Derby), to compare a community-centre based group
      exercise programme - FaME [delivered by specifically trained postural stability instructors
      (PSIs) and supplemented by home exercise and prescriptive recommendations for walking], with
      a home based exercise programme and walking plan - OEP [supported by specifically trained and
      similarly aged mentors], with two years follow-up to determine the impact, acceptability and
      adherence to the programme, and longer term continuation of exercise. Control subjects will
      continue to receive usual care in primary care. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be
      conducted within the study.
