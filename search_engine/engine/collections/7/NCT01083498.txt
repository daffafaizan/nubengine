      increased pigmentation, a slightly elevated, verrucous surface of the affected skin and
      sometimes hyperpigmentation. No effective treatment is available. Several laser modalities
      have been applied in the treatment of Becker's nevus in uncontrolled studies with varying
      results. Recently, fractional laser therapy was suggested as treatment option for Becker's
      nevus. In fractional laser therapy, microscopic columns of skin are coagulated or ablated,
      leaving the surrounding tissue intact, which enhances healing of the treated skin. In this
      study, the efficacy and safety of ablative fractional laser therapy was assessed in the
      treatment of Becker's nevus.
