      an MRI of the hip joints. Prior to the MRI, a physician will perform a range of motion check
      of the participants hips. The MRI will take approximately 20 minutes during which the
      participant will have to lie still in a closed space. Participants will receive a letter
      which can be forwarded to their family doctor if the MRI has any abnormal findings including
      signs of hip impingement.
