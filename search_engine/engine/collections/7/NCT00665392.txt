      Primary

        -  To determine the complete clinical response rate at 3 months in patients with stage III
           or IV nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx treated with cetuximab,
           docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the rate of tumor response.

        -  To determine progression-free and overall survival.

        -  To determine the rate of complete pathological response.

        -  To assess the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15; docetaxel IV over 1 hour
      and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1; and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and every
      3 months for 2 years.
