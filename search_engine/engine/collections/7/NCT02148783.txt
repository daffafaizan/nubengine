    
      -  Males and females (n=30), between the ages of 18 and 55 years in the chronic stage after
           TBI who experience deficits in neuropsychological function from TBIs incurred 6 months
           after the injury, will be recruited from military treatment facilities or civilian
           clinics when presenting for clinical management of TBI or post-concussive symptoms.

        -  1. Study participants will be evaluated using brain MRI, psychometric measures adapted
           from the TBI Common Data Elements, attention tests and information about details of the
           injury and experience of post-concussive symptoms will be recorded. Transcranial
           magnetic stimulation (TMS) with placebo and with methylphenidate (60 mg by mouth)
           challenge will be performed to predict a stimulant response.

        -  2. Subjects will be studied with [11C]-raclopride PET in two imaging sessions. One
           session will be after administration of placebo and the other after methylphenidate, 60
           mg by mouth. Both placebo and methylphenidate will be given 60 minutes prior to
           injection of [11C]-raclopride to allow for peak uptake of methylphenidate in the brain.
           The binding potential of [11C]-raclopride relative to a non-displaceable reference
           region (cerebellum), BPND, will be used as a measure of D2/D3 receptor availability. The
           difference in BPND between methylphenidate and placebo (Î”BPND) is used to measure of
           tonic DA release.

        -  3. Subjects will then be treated with oral methylphenidate, using a forced titration up
           to a dose of 30 mg given twice daily for 4 weeks. At that point, the neuropsychologic
           tests are repeated.

        -  Outcome measures: The primary outcome is change in information processing speed during
           neuropsychologic testing.
