      is established well, although absolute target BP level is uncertain. Current guidelines
      defined the normal BP as <120/80mmHg and recommend individualized target BP level.

      Large well performed stroke prevention trials consistently showed that reduction of 10/5mmHg
      in patients with systolic BP below 140mmHg had clear benefits in the prevention of
      cardiovascular events. However, we have a dilemma about BP control in the patients with
      severe intracranial atherosclerosis.

      Aggressive BP control will be more effective in the prevention of overall cardiovascular
      events than modest BP control, but aggressive BP control will reduce cerebral perfusion in
      the territory of severe intracranial disease and may increase the risk of ischemic damage.

      The study will try to reveal aggressive BP control in the patients with symptomatic severe
      intracranial atherosclerosis is not increase ischemic lesion volume in hemisphere to compare
      modest BP control.
