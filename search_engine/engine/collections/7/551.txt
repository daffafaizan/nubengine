effects of parathyroid hormone and other proteins in vitroon mitochondrial metabolismit is apparent that in addition to parathyroid hormone, severalnon-hormonal basic proteins stimulate mitochondrial respiration, iontransport, and atpase, but inhibit the 32pi-atp exchange reaction.thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biologicalactions of parathyroid hormone as the previous reports suggested.rasmussen et al. (1964) have also isolated from parathyroidextracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrialtransport of phosphate in vitro.  they postulated that this proteinmight be yet another biologically important factor produced by para-thyroid glands.  the latter speculation may not be warranted in viewof the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria.  allof our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroidproteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically,or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone.further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determinewhether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validlyreflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is soundto use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.
