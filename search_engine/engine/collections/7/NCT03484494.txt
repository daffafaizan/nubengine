      Magnetic Stimulation in subjects over the age of 50 with bipolar disorder who are currently
      depressed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and proton Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy. Following screening visits, study procedures include two visits, at least two
      weeks apart, during which subjects will complete brief mood scales, undergo 15 minutes of
      imaging, receive 20 minutes of Low Field Magnetic Stimulation treatment, and then return to
      the scanner to undergo another 15 minutes of imaging procedures. Due to the crossover design,
      subjects receiving active treatment during the first visit will receive sham treatment during
      the second visit; subjects receiving sham treatment during the first visit will receive
      active treatment during the second visit. A follow-up phone call will occur two days after
      each imaging/treatment visit. The main endpoint of this study is the observation of changes
      in resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activity in post-treatment
      acquisitions as compared to pre-treatment acquisitions.
