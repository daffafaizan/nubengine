    
      Hypothesis:

      COVID-19+ hospitalized patients with preexisting CVD or newly onset CVD at time of
      hospitalization have different clinical outcomes compared to those without CVD and COVID-19+.

      Objectives:

      The primary aim of this study is to gather observational data, starting from February 1st
      2020 until the end of the pandemic, to compare clinical outcomes COVID+ hospitalized patients
      at HUG or in a care center in Geneva with pre-existing or newly onset CVD, to COVID+
      hospitalized patients at HUG or in a care center in Geneva without pre-existing CVD.

      The secondary aims of this study are:

        -  To determine the association between COVID-19 disease and CVD, based on: age, previous
           CV diseases, CV risks factors, CV medications (e.g. ACE Inhibitors or angiotensin II
           receptor antagonists)

        -  To explore CVD profiles that may influence COVID-19 disease outcomes

        -  To determine the cause of death in CVD patients (either with preexisting CVD or newly
           diagnosed with CVD)

        -  To understand the vulnerability of the myocardium (new event of either heart failure,
           acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, myocarditis) in patients with COVID-19 disease.
