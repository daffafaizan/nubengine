      series of castings, surveys, data collection, and outcome testing that includes both
      endurance and aerobic exercises while wearing the check sockets of varying tension values.
      The outcome measures will be performed in the Nichol Hall Motion Capture Lab.

        -  The participants will sign consent forms and three casts will be taken on the first
           visit.

        -  The second visit will consist of fitting test socket A, which includes socket
           adjustments and the dynamic alignment. Once the socket is properly fit on the subject,
           we will begin their three trials (with two to three minute breaks in between trials) of
           the Time Up and Go assessment (TUG) followed by the Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire
           (PEQ) survey.

        -  Visit three will be comprised of socket B fitting, alignment, and testing. The subjects
           will proceed with the same procedure as stated in visit two. Following the outcome
           measures, participants will take the PEQ survey for socket B.

        -  Visit four is the final visit of testing and data collection. Socket C will be presented
           to the subject and they will go through the same dynamic alignment process and outcome
           testing as the previous visits. Once finished, the subjects will take the final PEQ
           survey on socket C and receive their compensation.
