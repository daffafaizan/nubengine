    
      All patients admitted in the Emergency Department of the participating centres and diagnosed
      with PE will be eligible and assessed for potential inclusion.

      Included patients will be randomized into two groups (1:1) and stratified by centre. Data
      will be recorded in a computerized case report form (e-CRF) enabling the randomization.

      The HESTIA group will receive outpatient care proposal based on HESTIA criteria. The sPESI
      group will receive outpatient care proposal based on the simplified PESI score. Any reason
      for management (hospitalization or outpatient treatment) not based on the recommendation will
      be explained and documented in the e-CRF.

      Follow-up will occur within 72 hours after inclusion, at 14 days, 1 month, and 3 months in
      both groups to gather clinical event data (recurrent VTE, major bleeding, death), treatment
      data, unscheduled hospitalizations and patient satisfaction assessment results.

      The major objectives will test HESTIA based strategy versus sPESI based strategy in a
      hierarchical approach:

        -  step 1: non-inferiority analysis on the rate of adverse events,

        -  if yes, step 2: superiority analysis on the rate of patients managed as outpatients,

        -  if yes, step3: superiority analysis on the rate of patients, in theory, eligible for
           outpatient care.
