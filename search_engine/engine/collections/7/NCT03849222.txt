      pulp, immature apices, and periapical lesions because of the absence of natural apical
      constriction and the presence of moisture contamination. In these cases, the risk of
      extrusion of the root ﬁlling materials and the difﬁculty in managing apical seals compromise
      the long-term outcome of treatment.

      Management of immature teeth with non-vital pulp were confined to custom fitting the filling
      material, paste fills and apical surgery. The limited success enjoyed by these procedures
      resulted in significant interest in the phenomenon of establishment of an apical barrier like
      apexification or continued apical development. Apexification defined as a procedure to induce
      a calcified barrier in a root with an open apex and necrotic pulp Traditionally, the most
      commonly used material for apexification is Ca(OH)2 .Despite the high success rate of The
      long-term Ca(OH)2 apexification , there are several disadvantages to this technique; Length
      of time for induction of apical hard tissue barriers. Incomplete apical hard tissue barriers
      because of vascular inclusions.To avoid the challenges associated with long-term Ca(OH)2
      apexification procedures, a non-surgical, one-step apexification using MTA as apical plug.

      The major problem in cases of a wide open apex is the need to limit the apexification
      material at the apex, thus avoiding the extrusion of a large amount of material into the
      periodontal tissue. The use of a matrix is advisable since its placement in the area of bone
      destruction provides a base on which the sealing material can be packed .

      This randomized controlled trial study was carried out to compare the clinical and
      radiographic outcome of Ca(OH)2 and MTA with or without internal matrix in non-vital immature
      maxillary incisors.
