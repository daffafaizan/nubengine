      between March2014-September 2015. The inclusion criteria were patients with anterior cruciate
      ligamentous injury who needed ligamentous reconstruction, closed growth plates and younger
      than 60 years old, absence of ligament injury to the opposite knee. The exclusion criteria
      are patients who did not want to participate in this study or patient with failed anterior
      cruciate ligamentous reconstruction.

      All the procedure of anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions were performed by the senior
      authors (B.C). Semitendinosus and gracilis tendons were harvested through an oblique approach
      medial to the tibial tubercle in all patients. Complete anterior cruciate ligament was
      confirmed at arthroscopy. Associated intra-articular injuries such as meniscus tear and
      cartilage lesions were fixed at of the index operation .The femoral tunnel were drilled
      though the AM portal.
