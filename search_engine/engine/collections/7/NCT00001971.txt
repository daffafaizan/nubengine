    
      This is a general clinical research protocol to allow for evaluation, investigation and
      long-term follow up of patients who have an acute or chronic liver disease. The protocol is
      designed to study the natural history and pathogenesis of various liver diseases such as
      acute and chronic hepatitis B, C, D and E, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing
      cholangitis, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
      noncirrhotic portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cryptogenic or poorly defined
      forms of chronic liver disease. Patients will initially be seen in the outpatient department
      and undergo a medical history and physical examination. They will have a series of of
      clinical evaluation and the collection of research samples. Patients will then be followed in
      the outpatient department at intervals appropriate for their clinical status. At which
      patients will undergo an interim medical history and brief examination, with research samples
      collected. Collection of additional tissue biopsy may be obtained during a clinically
      indicated procedure such as liver biopsy.

      Subjects may be asked to undergo leukapheresis or plasmapheresis, and genetic analysis for
      research purposes, and separate consent forms are provided. In addition, a control group of
      healthy volunteers will be recruited for genetic analysis, leukapheresis and plasmapheresis.

      Subjects who qualify for other studies of their liver disease will be offered participation.
