      I. To assess progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced/metastatic in patients with
      carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival and response rate in advanced/metastatic poor prognosis in
      patients with carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell tumors.

      II. To assess the toxicity of patients treated with regorafenib. III. To explore markers of
      angiogenesis as they relate to outcome in carcinoid and pancreatic islet cell tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
