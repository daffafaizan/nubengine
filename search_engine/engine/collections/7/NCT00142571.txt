      phase III study. This means that one treatment is being compared to another to find out which
      is better. We are comparing the drug gemcitabine to the two drugs gemcitabine and docetaxel
      to find out which treatment is better for people who have sarcomas. From previous studies we
      know that gemcitabine causes shrinking of some people's sarcoma tumors. We also know that
      gemcitabine and docetaxel are useful for sarcomas as well, but we believe the two drugs
      together may be more toxic than the single drug alone. In this study we are trying to answer
      the question: "Is the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel any better than just
      gemcitabine alone?"

      This is a randomized Phase III trial comparing two treatment regimens in patients with
      unresectable soft tissue sarcoma. The failure rates observed on both treatment arms (failure
      defined as progression or death) will be compared to determine which regimen results in the
      lowest failure rate (Primary objective). As a secondary endpoint, the percentage of patients
      who are failure-free (failure defined as progression or death) at 3 months and 6 months will
      be compared between the two arms (Secondary objective).

      This trial, sponsored by the North American Sarcoma Study Group of the Connective Tissue
      Oncology Society, is being done at a number of hospitals around the country and is expected
      to enroll up to 120 patients.
