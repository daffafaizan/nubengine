      assessment will be conducted during the 1-week postpartum home visit, with another study
      visit at 8 weeks after delivery. After obtaining written informed consent, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to either the intervention arm or control conditions (standard management).
      Participants will be told that the aim of the study is to investigate factors that may make
      breastfeeding easier for mothers with a LPI and ETI, so they can breast-feed for longer. They
      will not be told about the randomisation until the end of the study, as this knowledge would
      most likely lead to mothers in the control group using some form of relaxation therapy.
      Background characteristics of mothers and their early feeding experiences will be recorded.

      Participants can choose to complete the questionnaires on paper or online in their own time
      after the study visit. A breast milk sample will be collected pre-feed and infant
      anthropometry will be assessed by a trained nurse pre-feed at each home visit. Feed duration
      will be noted by the trained nurse. Stool samples of infants who were born vaginally will be
      collected by a trained nurse at baseline and at 8-weeks. At 3-month and 6-month postpartum,
      there will be a telephone contact to the participants for follow-up. Participants will be
      invited to complete the infant questionnaires again on paper or online in their own time.
