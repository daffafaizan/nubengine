      candidates as potential prognostic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers that have the potential to
      facilitate therapy development for patients with ALS and related disorders. Biomarker
      candidates that will be considered include: urinary p75 neurotrophin receptor extracellular
      domain (p75ECD), blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated neurofilament heavy
      (pNfH), blood and CSF neurofilament light (NfL) and, in the population with a C9orf72
      hexanucleotide repeat expansion, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and CSF levels of
      the dipeptide repeat protein poly(GP). In pursuit of these goals, the CReATe Consortium is
      already collecting longitudinal biological samples from patients with ALS and related
      disorders through the ongoing Phenotype-Genotype-Biomarker (PGB) study. TRIAL READY aims to
      identify additional patients with the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation
      (HREM), the most common genetic cause of ALS, who may be further followed through the PGB
      study. This study will also enroll and longitudinally evaluate a cohort of age- and
      gender-match healthy controls.
