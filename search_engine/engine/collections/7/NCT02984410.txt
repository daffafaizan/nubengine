    
      Eligible patients will be randomized 1 to 1 to radiotherapy (Arm 1) or surgery (Arm 2).

      ARM 1: Radiotherapy

      Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) will be
      applied to all patients in this arm. PTV prescription to tumor and high risk areas will be
      delivered daily for 5 days per week to a total dose of 66-70Gy in 2 Gy/fraction over 6 weeks,
      elective/prophylactic mucosal and nodal areas will receive a total dose of 54.25- 54.45 Gy in
      33-35 fractions of 1.55-1.65 Gy over 6 weeks.

      ARM 2: Surgery

      Trans-oral surgery (any trans-oral approach such as trans-oral laser microsurgery
      conventional trans-oral surgery or trans-oral robotic surgery) will be applied to all
      patients in this arm.

      A surgical margin is defined to be clear (R0), if found to be >/=3mm in the final specimen
      (except deep margin for tonsillar resection, that is either R1 or R0), is defined to be
      close, if 1-<3mm, and considered to be involved (R1), if <1mm in the final specimen. Clearly
      defined marginal biopsies are required for each TOS-technique. Trans-oral re-resections are
      required in case of R1 or close-margin to convert the patient to an R0-status.Postoperative
      RT or chemo-RT will be given within 5-6 weeks of surgery in case of positive.
