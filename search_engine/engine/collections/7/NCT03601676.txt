      hospitalized despite being eligible for outpatient care. One impediment to home discharge is
      the difficulty of identifying which patients can safely forego hospitalization. This
      pragmatic clinical trial intends to evaluate the effect on emergency department disposition
      of a multicomponent intervention, including electronic clinical decision support system
      access, physician education, and physician-specific audit and feedback. The hypothesis for
      this study is that intervention sites, when compared with concurrent control sites, will see
      an increase in home discharges without an increase in 5-day pulmonary embolism-related return
      visits or 30-day all-cause mortality.
