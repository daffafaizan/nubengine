    
      The study consists of two consecutive parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of two doses of AT-001 vs placebo. The primary objective of Part A is to
      demonstrate that AT-001 improves or prevents the decline of functional capacity in patients
      with Diabetic Cardiomyopathy. Part B is an extension of at least 12 months that will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of chronic administration of AT-001 vs placebo in the same patients
      who had previously been evaluated in Part A. Assessments in Part B will include safety
      endpoints and exploratory clinical efficacy endpoints, i.e. death and hospitalization due to
      a cardiac event.
