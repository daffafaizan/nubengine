      replacement is a procedure which aims to relieve pain and help to improve mobility. There has
      been continued development and improvement in knee implant design and the instruments
      required during surgery to assist with the accurate placement of the implant. These
      developments have reduced surgery time and assisted in the accurate positioning of the knee
      implant, which leads to better long term outcomes.

      Navigation system is a computerised system currently used intraoperatively to position the
      Advance knee implant. The Prophecy technique is a pre-operative alignment technique. Patient
      undergo a MRI or CT scan which is used to manufacture personalised cutting blocks which are
      then used intraoperatively to position the knee implant.
