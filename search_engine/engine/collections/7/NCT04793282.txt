    
      This is a randomized controlled trial. The experimental group will receive a phone call
      within 72 hours of discharge to provide psycho education, clarify any questions they may have
      and to reinforce discharge plans made in the ED. The control group will not receive this
      phone call. Within 30 days of discharge, both groups will receive a phone call to collect
      data on treatment compliance including medication and follow-up adherence and if any
      additional visits to the Emergency Department were necessary.
