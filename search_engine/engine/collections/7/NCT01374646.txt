      reducing excess weight. Overweight and obese study participants will be grouped with peers of
      similar ages and their parent/guardians. The participants will be divided into 2 groups,
      child (6-12 yrs. old) and teens (13-17 yrs. old) and will be accompanied by their
      parent/guardian. 150 participants will be recruited for this study.

      This 6-month program (12 in-person group workshop sessions and 12 at-home sessions) takes the
      best components of current evidence for individual treatment and places them in a
      comprehensive community based program. These include:

        -  Parental involvement

        -  Reduction in consumption of sugar sweetened beverages

        -  Reduction of screen time

        -  Self-monitoring

        -  Physical activity

        -  Stimulus control
