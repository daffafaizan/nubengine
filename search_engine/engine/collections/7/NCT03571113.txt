      between 01.01.2010 and 31.12.2016 within the German Resuscitation Registry (GRR),4 attended
      by EMS. The GRR represents currently approximately 160 emergency medical systems who record
      data on out-of-hospital resuscitation attempts throughout Germany, thus encompassing
      approximately 30 million citizens (total population of Germany counts 85 million).

      The German Resuscitation Registry for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is divided into two
      different datasets:

        1. The 'Preclinical care' dataset originated from the Utstein-style template aiming at
           documentation of pre-hospital logistic issues, presumed aetiology, resuscitation therapy
           and patient's initial outcome including 118 variables.12

        2. The 'Postresuscitation care' dataset is aimed at documentation of in-hospital
           post-resuscitation efforts. The participating hospitals can choose between a basic
           version which includes the use of coronary angiography, temperature management and the
           status at hospital discharged and an extended version. This includes 156 variables and
           inquires especially the status at admission, initial blood gas analysis, temperature
           management, coronary angiography and survival at 24h after cardiac arrest, 30 days and
           at hospital discharge exactly.12 Participation in the registry is voluntary. The
           participating emergency medical services and hospitals submit their data anonymously
           into a central database via a web-based application. Multiple plausibility checks have
           been implemented into this application in order to improve data quality. The registry is
           organised and funded by the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care
           Medicine (DGAI).
