    
      This study is a prospective, single-center clinical trial. The investigator design to recruit
      45 subjects. After implanting the Sirolimus Target Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold
      (Firesorb) successfully, all the subjects will be randomly assigned to queue 1 (n=30) and
      queue 2 (n=15). The clinical follow-up will be performed in all subjects at 1 month,6
      months,1 year,2 years,3 years,4 years and 5 years after scaffold implantation.
      Angiographic,IVUS and OCT follow-up will be performed at 6 months and 2 years after scaffold
      implantation in queue 1; angiographic,IVUS and OCT follow-up will be performed at 1 year and
      3 years after scaffold implantation in queue 2. The primary endpoint of the study is target
      lesion failure (TLF) at 30 days after scaffold implantation, the secondary endpoints are
      series of imaging outcomes, for evaluation of feasibility and preliminary safety and efficacy
      of the product.
