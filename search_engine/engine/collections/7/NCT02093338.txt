           group included 25 women per group

             -  Group 1: 3x109 cfu / day (n = 25)

             -  Group 2: 6x109 cfu / day (n = 25)

             -  Group 3: 9x109 cfu / day (n = 25)

             -  Group 4: placebo (n = 25)

        2. Statistical calculation of sample size. The calculation of sample size was calculated by
           the company SEPLIN Solutions Statistics. The primary endpoint was the bacterial count of
           in milk. The sample size obtained to observe a difference of 1 log10, with a power of
           0.80 and a significance level of 0.05 was 20 volunteers per group.

        3. Randomization Randomization was performed using a list of random numbers generated by
           computer. Subjects will be randomized in a strictly sequential.

           If a subject is removed from the test, the number that was assigned randomization not be
           reused again.

        4. Overall design and outline of the study At visit 1 we require the informed consent of
           the patient. It will take the milk sample, we will review the implementation of the
           inclusion and exclusion criteria. Be randomized and explain the treatment guidelines to
           be followed, the data to be collected and medical appointments that must go (2 and 3
           weeks). It will complete the pain assessment questionnaire (MQP) and nutrition survey.

           On visits 2, 3 and 4 corresponding to 1, 2 and 3 weeks of intervention will collect milk
           sample pain assessment survey and nutrition survey.

           Milk samples (5 mL) were collected aseptically in sterile tubes to be frozen immediately
           until analysis to be carried out within seven days.

        5. Intervention duration The intervention will last three weeks.
