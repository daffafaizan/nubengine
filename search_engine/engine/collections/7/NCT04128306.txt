      determining the time a moving object will take to reach him. It is however striking to note
      that the different brain areas supporting this function are not clearly identified, in
      particular the contribution of non-visual areas that are engaged in the definition of a
      peri-personal space for the observer. This lack could be fulfilled during a brain surgery
      experiment. Indeed, in such a surgery, the patient is awakened, and the surgeon apply direct
      cortical stimulation to de-activate specific brain areas while testing different cognitive
      function. The failure to succeed in the task indicates that this area is engaged in the
      cognitive function. The present study therefore will test different brain areas to
      investigate their respective contribution in the TTC estimation function.

      Three groups of participants will be tested, in pre and per surgery phases. After an initial
      pre-surgery phase, patients for which the tumor does not interfere with the TTC estimation
      anility will be enrolled in the Pré-Per group, and tested during the brain surgery. Patients
      for which the pre-test indicates that the TTC estimation is damaged by the tumor, will be
      tested in pre-surgery phase only, constituting the Pré-End group. Finally, a control group,
      paired with the patients, will be tested as well.

      For the patients, all the testing phases will be achieved during their medical process. The
      awake surgery is now a well-established technique, currently and usually done at the
      University Hospital Toulouse, and the present test in the per surgery phase only lasts a
      couple of minutes, no more than 5 minutes. As such, there is no additional risk carried out
      in the project.
