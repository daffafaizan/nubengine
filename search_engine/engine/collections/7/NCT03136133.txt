      sport requiring both high endurance capacity and muscle strength. In the recovery phase
      following exhaustive physical activity there is a need both for rebuilding the muscle energy
      stores, for muscle repair and for compensatory muscle cell development. Therefore, marine
      peptide combined with dietary protein will be given in order to examine the capacity to
      recover after exhaustive endurance cycling.
