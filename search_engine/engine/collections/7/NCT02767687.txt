      patients will be submitted to noninvasive mechanical ventilation with continuous positive
      airway pressure right after extubation and tissue perfusion markers (central venous oxygen
      saturation (SVcO2) and lactate) will be obtained via central venous catheter.

      Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is a common resource in the ICU to reduce extubation
      failures and to improve clinical outcomes, whether it can influence tissue perfusion remains
      unclear.

      This study evaluates whether noninvasive ventilation affects tissue perfusion and whether
      tissue perfusion markers in the ICU are correlated with better clinical results for patients
      after heart surgery.
