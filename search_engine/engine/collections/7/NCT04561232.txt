      remain at high risk for CP by month 4 as measured by the General Movements Assessment and the
      Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) at 4 months of age will continue to locomotor
      training phases. Prone locomotor training using the Self-Initiated Prone Progression Crawler
      (SIPPC) will be delivered from 5-9 months of age. Upright locomotor training with dynamic
      weight support (DWS) will be delivered from 9-18 months of age. Repeated assessments of
      locomotor skill, movement quality, training characteristics, and variables that may mediate
      locomotor learning will be collected at time points from 1 month to 18 months of post-term
      age.

      Investigators will examine the relationships between motor error and locomotor skill
      acquisition over time, anticipating that experiencing and correcting movement errors is
      critical to skill acquisition in infants at risk for CP; the contribution of other training
      characteristics (movement time, movement variability, and postural control) to locomotor
      learning; and how learning is mediated by neurobehavioral factors outside of training.
      Investigators will develop comprehensive models of training predictors and mediators for
      prone and upright locomotor learning.
