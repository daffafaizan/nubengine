      agent used since the development of anaesthesia care. Despite its wide use, there is
      sufficient doubt as to the risk-benefit profile.

      There is strong evidence that N2O is a major risk factor for postoperative nausea and
      vomiting. It is clear that (even) brief exposure to N2O impairs methionine synthetase, an
      enzyme required for DNA production, red and white blood cell formation. Tissue hypoxia may be
      more common. These adverse effects are enhanced in "sick" patients (ie. those at highest
      risk, with increased hospital length of stay and healthcare expenditure), and will be more
      likely in longer surgery. At the same time, observational studies and subgroup analysis of
      published trials suggest that N2O may have beneficial effects in preventing pain and
      postoperative cognitive disorders

      Outcome trial data on postoperative cognitive disorders are lacking in this area for an
      anaesthetic gas used in more than 90% of all surgery around the world. The enigma2 substudy
      as a nested study of the large Enigma2 randomised controlled trial aims at answering this
      question.

      The investigators aim at recruiting 420 patients in 2 of the 25 centres participating to the
      Enigma 2 trials, who are undergoing major surgery.
