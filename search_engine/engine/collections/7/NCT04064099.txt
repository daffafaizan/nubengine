      to provide a resilient surface for shock absorption and impact dissipation. However, some
      discontinued using mouthguard complaint that general discomfort and speech disturbance are
      the main barriers to their compliance. The nuisance is largely due to their use of
      poorly-fitted stock or boil-and-bite mouthguards. Therefore, the primary objective of this
      study is to evaluate speech adaptations when using custom-fitted mouthguards. The secondary
      objective is to assess the incidence of dental trauma within the six-month duration of
      mouthguard use. A prospective study will be carried out at the National Sports Institute.
      During the first day (T0), a workshop on the prevention and management of dental trauma will
      be carried out. Then, dental examination, dental impression, and recording of baseline speech
      performance will be performed. During the second visit (T1), mouthguards delivery,
      self-assessment of oral impairments, and speech recording will be carried out. After 6-months
      of monitoring (T2), all participants will be called again to fill in the self-assessment form
      and final speech performance will be recorded. Data analysis will be carried out to evaluate
      the self-assessment of speech performance and digital sonography of speech recordings over
      time. Also, the incidence of dental trauma will be reported.
