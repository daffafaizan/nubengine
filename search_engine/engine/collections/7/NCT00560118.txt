      Primary

        -  Assess the relationship between MGMT expression and response to fotemustine in patients
           with metastatic malignant melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  Establish a value for MGMT expression below which fotemustine has a strong probability
           of effectiveness.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising fotemustine IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,
      and 15. Beginning 5 weeks later, patients achieving stable or objective response receive
      maintenance chemotherapy comprising fotemustine IV over 1 hour once every 3 weeks for 6
      courses.

      Tissue samples are collected at baseline to assess level of MGMT expression by PCR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.
