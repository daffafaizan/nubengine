      with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), steroids and plasmapheresis. IVIg is effective in
      treating patients with CIDP, but most of the patients need long time maintenance treatment,
      which is associated with decreased autonomy and regular hospital admissions. Furthermore many
      of the patients complain of infusion related side effects such as headache, chills and
      fatigue, and over time there is problems obtaining intravenous entry because of occlusion of
      the veins.

      There is therefore a critical need for alternative methods to IVIg treatment. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of small doses of immunoglobulin
      administered subcutaneously (SCIg), compared with placebo. At the same time we compare the
      efficacy of SCIg with the regular IVIg treatment.

      We therefore hypothesize, 1: SCIg is better than subcutaneous placebo infusions, and is as
      good as IVIg in maintaining muscle function in patients with CIDP. 2: SCIg home treatment is
      safe and tolerable. 3: SCIg home treatment is preferred to IVIg under hospital admission, by
      the patients.
