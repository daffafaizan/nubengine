    
      â€¢ Patients with non-restorable teeth in the esthetic area will be recruited from Faculty of
      Dentistry in Cairo University A pre-operative cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) will be
      taken to examine the non-restorable tooth , measure bucco-lingual width and exclude any
      fenestration or dehiscence in the labial bone plate

      A non-surgical phase one therapy will be done for the patient as a preparatory phase

      Proper oral hygiene measures and chlorohexidene mouthwash will be prescribed after the the
      first

      Reassessment of the case to assure absence of any signs of inflammation and prescence of
      normal tissues before the surgical procedure

        -  The area will be anaesthetized using infiltration technique in labial site with 1.5ml of
           anaesthetic solution and palatal site with 0.3 ml of anaesthetic solution

        -  Decoronation of the tooth , if the crown is available, will be done to obtain a concave
           mesio-distal root

        -  A long shank root resection bur will be used to section the root mesiodistally as far
           apical as possible , in order to obtain the buccal half attached to the labial bone
           plate and together the apical and the palatal half will be attached to the palatal bone

        -  Periotome will be used to distort the periodontal ligaments between the palatal half of
           the root and palatal alveolar socket wall

        -  Together the apical and the palatal portions of the root will be delivered , using micro
           forceps

        -  Bone curettage will be done in the presence of peraipical infection

        -  Explorer will be used to exclude mobility of the buccal portion of the root

        -  The thickness of the buccal portion will be reduced to 2mm

        -  A large round bur will be used to reduce the height of the buccal portion in a
           mesiodistal direction.

        -  A bone grafting material will be placed in the remaining socket
