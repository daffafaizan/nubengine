      an SSRI for MDD. Patients who do not experience sufficient symptom improvement following this
      open-label trial will be enrolled in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of
      ziprasidone augmentation (second phase). Ziprasidone and placebo-remitters will then enter a
      12-month, double-blind extension phase (third phase). We estimate that approximately 400
      patients will enter phase 1 of the study so that a minimum of 180 subjects will enter
      double-blind treatment (phase 2) over 5 years. Each treatment arm during phase 2 will have 90
      subjects.

      Hypothesis B1: During phase 2, there will be a difference between the two groups in the
      percentage of responders (50% or greater reduction in symptom severity) with regards to
      anxious symptoms of MDD as measured by the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A);
      response rates will be higher for the ziprasidone group.

      Hypothesis B2: During phase 2, there will be a difference between the two groups in the
      percentage of responders (50% or greater reduction in symptom severity) with regards to
      painful symptoms of MDD, as measured by the overall visual analogue pain (VAS-pain) scale
      scores; response rates will be higher for the ziprasidone group.

      Hypothesis C: The time to relapse during phase 3 will be shorter among adjunctive placebo-
      than ziprasidone-remitters.
