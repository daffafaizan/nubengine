      providing adequate protein to meet nutritional requirements, and limiting protein intake in
      the hope of slowing or abating the progression of CRF. A number of studies have demonstrated
      that reduced dietary protein intake can slow the progression of chronic renal failure.
      Finding effective ways to increase nitrogen retention and decrease urinary nitrogen excretion
      may help CRF patients maintain a more positive nitrogen balance and lessen the nitrogen load
      on the kidneys for a given dietary protein intake. Our laboratory has demonstrated that in
      older men and women, the consequence of adherence to a low protein diet is an accommodation
      that results in decreased muscle mass, strength,and compromised immune function. We have also
      demonstrated that when healthy, free living older men and women consume a weight maintenance
      diet providing the RDA for protein of 0.8 g/kg-1/day-1 for 15 weeks they lose skeletal muscle
      mass. These data clearly indicate that elderly people have an increased need for dietary
      protein (compared to young people). Data has also demonstrated that progressive resistance
      exercise improves nitrogen balance in older healthy individuals as well as in patients with
      mild to moderate chronic renal failure.
