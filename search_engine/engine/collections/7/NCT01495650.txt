      regular dietary counseling and tailored physical activity is associated with reduced
      cancer-related fatigue and can improve quality of life and body weight control. We propose to
      conduct a randomized controlled trial which purpose is to evaluate the effect of an
      intervention combining physical exercise and nutritional therapeutic education on
      cancer-related fatigue. To gain behavioral change towards PA and nutrition habits,
      interventions will take place within hospitals, on the same days of adjuvant treatments.
