    
      Hypothermia is a common finding in severely traumatized patients. Decreases in core
      temperature during the course of initial evaluation and resuscitation are common, and can
      contribute to poor outcomes in multi-traumatized patients.

      In this study the temperature will be recorded continually with multiple skin probes and an
      ear-probe from the site of the accident to arrival in the intensive care unit (including time
      in primary surgery, if any).
