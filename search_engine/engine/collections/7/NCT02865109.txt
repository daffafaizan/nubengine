    
      The nusinersen expanded access program (EAP) is available at approved treatment centers in
      select territories.

      A doctor must decide whether nusinersen treatment is appropriate for each patient, based on
      the patient's medical history and program eligibility criteria. A full list of participating
      treatment centers is provided in the 'Contacts and Locations' section of this listing, and is
      regularly updated.

      Following local approval and official reimbursement of nusinersen in each territory, the EAP
      will close and patients will transfer to commercially available drug.
