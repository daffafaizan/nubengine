      survivors to self-administer physical performance tests in the survivor's own home, while an
      investigator remotely assesses the tests via videoconferencing. The test protocol includes
      written and video instructions and the test kit. To achieve this objective, the study will
      proceed with a series of phases. A similar concept of "saturation" will be applied, as is
      done in qualitative studies. In qualitative studies, the number of focus groups or interviews
      is based on the saturation point, i.e., the point at which no new information is learned. For
      the current study, each study phase will include a range in the number of participants
      enrolled. At the point at which no new information is being learned, i.e., no further
      adjustments are needed to the test protocol, the study will proceed to the next phase.
