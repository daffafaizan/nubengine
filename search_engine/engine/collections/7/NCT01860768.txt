      present to the Emergency Department with suspected AAD.

      Subjects enrolled in this study will sign and informed consent and have 3 blood samples drawn
      at different time points during their emergency department visit. In addition, data will be
      collected about the patient's health history, hospital procedures, and final diagnosis.

      Blood samples collected in this study will be sent to laboratory for long-term storage and
      analysis in the future for these blood markers as they become available. No genetic testing
      will be conducted on these samples.
