    
      Aim 1: To examine the extent of life space in older adults with POAG using the Life Space
      Questionnaire and to examine whether life space in persons with POAG is associated with the
      magnitude of visual field impairment.

      Aim 2: To examine difficulties seeing under dim illumination and at night in older adults
      with POAG using the Low Luminance Questionnaire and to examine whether greater difficulty in
      seeing under dim illumination and at night is related to the magnitude of visual field loss.

      Aim 3: To examine the relationship in older adults with POAG between visual problems seeing
      under dim illumination and at night (Low Luminance Questionnaire) and their life space (Life
      Space Questionnaire).
