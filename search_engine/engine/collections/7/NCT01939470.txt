      microarchitecture, is estimated to afflict 1 out of 2 women over the age of 50 years. These
      estimates are based primarily on Caucasian populations with limited information in Native
      Americans. Native American women may be considered high risk for osteoporosis due to
      lifestyle factors in conjunction with the incidence of diabetes. The objectives of this study
      are to: 1) determine the prevalence of osteopenia/osteoporosis in Native American female
      volunteers, aged 50+ years, who are eligible for health care through Indian Health Services;
      2) to evaluate their rate of bone loss, 3) to assess the relationship between lifestyle
      factors, inflammatory mediators, and select endocrine parameters on osteoporosis risk; and 4)
      determine the barriers to treatment. Native American women aged, 50+ years, who are eligible
      for services through Indian Health Services in the Oklahoma City (OKC) Area will be
      recruited. Participants will undergo a baseline osteoporosis risk assessment, i.e. medical
      history, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, dietary and physical activity
      assessment, and optional blood draw, and then encouraged to return to their primary care
      physician for counsel and/or treatment. Serum markers of bone metabolism, endocrine
      parameters (e.g. vitamin D metabolites) and inflammatory molecules will be assessed for
      participants that consent to the blood draw. All participants will receive educational
      information related to osteoporosis risk and prevention, and follow-up visits scheduled at
      the end of Year 1 and Year 2. Data will be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and
      logistical regression with the Î± set at 0.05 for statistical significance.
