      narrow band imaging is an acceptable strategy to diagnose polyp histology and determine
      future surveillance intervals. Endoscopic proficiency in macroscopic features to
      differentiate polyp histology can be attained in a relatively short time period. A new high
      definition colonoscope with close focus narrow band imaging features may further improve
      diagnostic accuracy for polyp differentiation, and can replace formal pathologic assessment
      in cases of high diagnostic confidence.

      Primary Aim: Compare the diagnostic accuracy of high definition narrow band imaging
      colonoscopy with and without close focus features for the macroscopic differentiation of
      neoplastic and non-neoplastic colorectal lesions using histopathologic diagnosis as the
      reference standard.

      Secondary Aims: Compare diagnostic characteristics of the colonoscopes, measure concordance
      of high confidence and accuracy, compare accuracy of predicted versus actual surveillance
      interval recommendations, perform a cost-effective analysis of endoscopic versus pathologic
      diagnoses, and measure complications.
