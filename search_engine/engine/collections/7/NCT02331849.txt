      GERD and eosinophilic esophagitis (via pH/MII-measurements or PPI-trial) -> High-resolution
      manometry (HRM) for evaluation of esophageal motility in patients with eosinophilic
      esophagitis (exclusion of GERD-patients)-> initiation of budesonide-therapy -> after eight
      weeks of therapy reevaluation of esophageal motility by HRM
