    
      Patients who are divided into two treatment groups: (a) a bilateral superficial cervical
      plexus group (group S) and a control group (group C).We performe bilateral superficial
      cervical plexus block (BSCPB)with 0.25-0.75% ropivacaine10 ml to group S and 10ml NaCl 0.9%
      to group C. All BSCPB is performed by experienced anesthesia doctor after a standardized
      induction of general anaesthesia.eneral anaesthesia was induced by using intravenously with
      midazolam,propofol, fentanyl, cisatracurium is injected IV to facilitate orotracheal
      intubation. After a standardized induction of general anaesthesia, patients receive Regional
      Anesthesia at the discretion of the experienced anesthesiologist who was blinded to
      treatment.

      The patient is placed in a supine position with the head turned away from the side to be
      blocked, and then the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) is identified by slight head
      elevation. SCPB is performed with a 26-gauge needle that is inserted at the midpoint of the
      posterior border of the SCM muscle and the needle is advanced just past the SCM muscle.
