      following the first chest pain can be included in the GIANT study. After the PCI, they'll
      receive DAT (Aspirin + Clopidogrel/Prasugrel).

      Patients will then be genotyped to determine if they carry one of the CYP2C19 gene variants
      making them resistant or hyper responder to clopidogrel. The genetic profile of the patients
      will be communicated to the physician who took care of them so that he can (or not) adjust
      the thienopyridine treatment (increase of the clopidogrel dosage, switch to prasugrel or
      switch to clopidogrel). A treatment will be prescribed for 12 months as according to the
      European guidelines.

      One year after the PCI, the patients will have to be available for a follow up visit. They'll
      be submitted to a VERIFY NOW P2Y12 protocol to determine whether they were compliant to their
      thienopyridine treatment. A clinical follow up will be also performed to evaluate the
      cardiovascular events.
