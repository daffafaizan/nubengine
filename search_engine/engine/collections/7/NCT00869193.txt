      stroke, heart disease, and end-stage renal disease. Several studies have shown that dietary
      polyphenols derived from fruits and vegetables (including those from grape products) can
      lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects.

      Study objectives: Primary objective: To study, in subjects with elevated blood pressure
      levels, the effects of grape seed extract high in polyphenols, on daytime ambulatory systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively). Secondary objective: To explore
      mechanistic pathways responsible for the blood pressure lowering efficacy in case a blood
      pressure lowering effect is shown.

      Study population: Each treatment group will consist of 35 men and postmenopausal women (35-75
      years of age) with daytime SBP between 120 and 159 mmHg. The total number of subjects will be
      70.

      Study design: This study will have a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel
      design with 2 treatments, a 1-week run-in period, and an 8-week intervention period. The 2
      treatments will consist of placebo capsules and capsules with grape seed extract.

      Study outcomes: Daytime ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) will be measured every 20 minutes for
      2 x 12 hours at baseline and 2 x 12 hours at the end of intervention. Furthermore, before and
      after the intervention period, 24-hour urine will be collected and 2 blood samples will be
      taken in order to investigate mechanistic pathways and platelet function.
