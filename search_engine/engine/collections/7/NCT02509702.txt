      Tanzanian Women testing positive to HR HPV at inclusion are randomly assigned in an
      allocation ratio of 1:1 to the SMS intervention or the control group (standard care). In a
      period of 10 months, the intervention group will receive 15 one-directional health educative
      text messages and SMS-reminders for their appointment. The total sample size will be 700 with
      350 women in each study arm. Primary outcome is attendance rate for follow-up. Secondary
      objectives are cost-effectiveness measured through incremental ratios and knowledge of
      cervical cancer by a 16-item true/false scale questionnaire at baseline and follow-up.
