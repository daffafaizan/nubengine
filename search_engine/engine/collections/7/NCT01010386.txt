      This will be a multi-center, prospective, double-blind clinical trial of physiologic (5%)
      oxygen tension in culture media vs. standard of care, atmospheric (SOC, 20%) oxygen tension
      with 840 eligible couples recruited to participate. The randomization scheme will be
      coordinated through the central data coordinating center (DCC-Yale) and the randomization
      will be stratified by age group of the woman (18-34, 35-37, 38-40 and 40-42) and each
      participating site.

      Treatment

      Couples will be randomized to either have their gametes and embryos placed in a physiologic
      (5%) oxygen atmosphere or in the currently widely used atmospheric (20%) oxygen atmosphere.
