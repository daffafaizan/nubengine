      can detect various diseases Including cancer and asthma on basis of evaporable substances.
      The device simulates the human nose ", which includes an array of tiny sensors connected to
      nanometric sizes electronic calculating unit.. Thanks to their small size, electrical,
      physical and chemical properties, the sensitive sensors smell and identified changes in
      composition of the materials that characterize various diseases including kidney disease and
      asthma.

      The electronic nose was developed by Professor Haick from the Technion. The main concept of
      the device is testing and characterization a trace amounts of substances in the air with the
      help of nana-technology sensors the idea is revolutionary and would allow the diagnosis of
      different diseases, like cancer, by exhaling air into the device.

      The test is simple and not complicated to perform ,the examiner inhale air into a bag which
      connected to the "electronic nose". The molecules of the patient's breath will be tied to
      sensors and transmit an electrical signal to computer chip.

      After processing the data the "electronic nose "can distinguish between normal cells and
      pathological cells.

      Hypothesis: the tiny sensors ("electronic nose") will smell and detect the changes in the
      sample of abnormal fetal karyotype, and fluid that will be confirmed by amniocentesis.
