    
      Double blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study. Approximately 40 healthy volunteers
      will be randomized to the study drug and 20 healthy volunteers randomized to the placebo, for
      a total of 60 enrolled participants.

      All participants will be treated with the study drug or placebo for 12 months. Subjects will
      be seen in the clinic for the following visits: Screening (Day -14), Baseline (Day 0), Month
      6, and End-of-Study (Month 12) while on study drug. An additional safety visit at Month 13
      (four weeks after study drug discontinuation) will be required of all participants.

      Participants will undergo vital signs assessment, medical history review, medication list
      review, and review of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) at each visit.

      Participants will undergo neuropsychological testing and routine physical examinations at the
      screening, baseline, and end-of-study visits.

      Participants will undergo blood draws, urine collection, MRI to assess lumbar puncture
      safety, and lumbar puncture at the baseline and end-of-study visits.
