      The subjects are expected to perform capillary BG tests during the 14-day sensor wear. Three
      in clinic visits are scheduled during the 14-day sensor wear period. During each in-clinic
      visit, study staff performed IV blood draws to obtain venous blood for YSI reference glucose
      measurements.
