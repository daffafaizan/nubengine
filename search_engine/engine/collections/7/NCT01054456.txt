    
      Palonosetron is currently approved for prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting
      associated with initial and repeat CINV caused by moderate and highly emetogenic
      chemotherapy. This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of palonesetron in
      preventing CINV when administered to patients who have experienced either vomiting and or at
      least moderate nausea during their last cycle of low emetogenic chemotherapy.

      Palonosetron will be given intravenously approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of the
      chemotherapy regimen. Efficacy and safety including episodes of nausea, retching and or
      vomiting will be assessed over five 24 hour periods starting on Day 1 and ending on Day 6 in
      patient diaries. On Day 2 and Day 6 a FLIE (Functional Living Index- Emesis) assessment will
      also be completed in order to help evaluate the patient's quality of life from the start of
      the chemotherapy cycle through Day 6.
