      with Photofrin PDT and HDT brachytherapy in patients with endobronchial obstructions from
      lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is not a randomized study. Photofrin solution is administered slowly as a bolus
      injection over 3-5 minutes on day 1. Bronchoscopy is performed under general anesthesia 48
      hours after Photofrin injection. Light is transmitted from the laser to the tumor via quartz
      fiber optics (interstitial or surface PDT). Another bronchoscopy is performed 48 hours after
      PDT treatment to clean out any tissue debris left after PDT treatment. HDR brachytherapy is
      performed using prescribed dose of radiation for 5-10 minutes to designated positions. Repeat
      bronchoscopy is performed 3-4 weeks post HDR brachytherapy and a second HDR brachytherapy
      treatment may be given. Patients are followed every 3 months until death, or for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 16 patients will be entered over 1.5 years.
