      monitoring of pCO2 is important in patients during and shortly after major surgery and in
      critically ill patients. But measurement of pCO2 requires arterial blood sampling and
      laboratory testing. Non-invasive monitors for continuous assessment of arterial pCO2 have
      been developed but their accuracy and feasibility were insufficient to make them useful in
      the clinical setting. Recently, a new digital system for continuous and non-invasive
      monitoring of arterial pCO2 and SO2 has been introduced (SenTec Digital Monitor System,
      SenTec AG, Therwil, Switzerland). This present study has been designed to evaluate the
      accuracy of the SenTec V-SignTM monitoring system for measuring pCO2 in comparison with
      repeated arterial blood gas testing in the operation room and in the intensive care unit.
