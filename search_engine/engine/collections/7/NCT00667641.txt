    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel in combination with bortezomib in
           patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumor malignancies that involve an
           activated Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the toxicity of this regimen.

        -  To assess tumor response in these patients.

        -  To determine whether Bim is upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained
           from patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To correlate markers of Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway activation in fresh or archived tumor
           tissue with clinical response in these patients.

        -  To perform pharmacokinetic (PK) studies to determine whether bortezomib alters
           paclitaxel PK parameters.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic
      and biomarker studies. Blood samples are analyzed for plasma concentrations of paclitaxel by
      high performance liquid chromatography and for Bim protein levels and phosphorylation status
      by western blotting. Tumor tissue samples, if available, are analyzed to evaluate the
      presence of an activated Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. Tumor tissue samples are analyzed for Ras
      and/or Raf mutations by nucleic acid extraction and direct sequencing; Ras and/or Raf
      overexpression by western blotting; Ras activation assay; and/or phospho-ERK by western
      blotting and IHC.
