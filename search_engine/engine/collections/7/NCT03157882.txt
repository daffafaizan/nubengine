    
      Phase 1 is a qualitative assessment of how pain is currently evaluated in the pediatric ED.
      Initial triage encounters will be observed and audio recorded. In addition to determining how
      often the Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (WBF) is administered with the intended script,
      the investigators will determine if there are common variations from the recommended script.
      The investigators will also evaluate how often a caregiver's perception of the child's pain
      is considered when completing the WBF.

      Phase 2 is a quantitative assessment to determine if neurocognitive development impacts the
      responsivity of the WBF and the Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) as well as the cognitive
      age equivalent required to use these scales accurately. Patients presenting with acute pain
      will report their level of pain before and after analgesic intervention using both the WBF
      and the FPS-R. They will also subjectively report their change in pain following analgesic
      intervention. Once the patient's pain has improved, he/she will complete the BRIGANCE Early
      Childhood Screens III to determine his/her cognitive age equivalent. He/she will also
      complete a series of tasks aimed to assess ability to successfully use the WBF and FPS-R
      (matching, grouping, classification, and seriation skills). The results of the child's
      self-report of pain will also be compared to the caregiver's estimate of the child's pain.
