      causing pain sensation to be perceived with lower stimuli and often causing chronic pain.
      Central sensitization can be seen with many conditions such as neuropathic pain and sleep
      disorders, as well as with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. There are few
      studies in the literature regarding increased frequency of neuropathic pain and sleep
      disturbance and decreased quality of life in Behçet's disease. Frequency of central
      sensitization was not investigated in patients with Behçet's disease before. In this study,
      it is aimed to investigate the frequency of central sensitization, neuropathic pain, sleep
      disorder and quality of life and their relation to each other in patients with Behcet's
      disease and healthy controls.
