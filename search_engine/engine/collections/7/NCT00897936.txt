      Primary

        -  Determine gene expression, genome integrity, cytosine methylation, and chromatin
           structure in patients with normal cytogenetics leukemia (NCL) acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine whether NCL can be deconstructed into specific disease entities by analysis of
           the integrated genomic and epigenomic datasets using supervised and unsupervised methods
           in these patients.

        -  Identify the gene pathways that define NCL subtypes and molecular targets for validation
           in preclinical and clinical trials for these patients.

        -  Determine whether integrated analysis provides markers of prognostic and therapeutic
           response that accurately predicts clinical outcome and can be used to select patients
           for risk-stratified therapeutic trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Samples are analyzed to assess array comparative genomic hybridization using polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) and fluorescent in situ hybridization; chromatin immunoprecipitations (chip)
      using PCR; Hpa II tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR (HELP) using DNA
      methylation analysis; and gene expression profiling.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
