    
      This is a randomized, multi-center, multinational, open-label, active-controlled, parallel
      design study of the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine versus the combination of
      lapatinib plus capecitabine in HER2+ MBC patients who have received two or more prior HER2
      directed regimens in the metastatic setting. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      one of the following treatment arms:

        -  Arm A: neratinib (240 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1500 mg/m^2 daily, 750 mg/m^2 twice
           daily [BID])

        -  Arm B: lapatinib (1250 mg once daily) + capecitabine (2000 mg/m^2 daily, 1000 mg/m^2
           BID)

      Patients will receive either neratinib plus capecitabine combination or lapatinib plus
      capecitabine combination until the occurrence of death, disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or other specified withdrawal criterion.
