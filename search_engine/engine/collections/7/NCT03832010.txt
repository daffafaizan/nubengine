      Twice daily topical corticosteroid (TCS) use over several weeks is recommended for active
      inflammatory disease. Side effects of TCS range from cutaneous atrophy to
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. Steroid phobia and misunderstanding often
      lead to poor compliance and inadequate disease control. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs)
      are currently recommended as steroid-reducing agents, especially on sensitive areas such as
      the face and skin folds. However, TCis are associated with burning reactions and come with
      black box warnings.

      Crisaborole (Eucrisa), the newest topical prescription option for AD, is a
      phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor with demonstrated efficacy in patients aged 2 and older with
      mild to moderate AD. Given the good tolerability and favorable safety profile, crisaborole
      makes for an alternative topical option to its predecessors. However, corresponding data are
      lacking. It would be of great interest to patients, patients' families and providers if
      crisaborole can be shown to reduce the amount of TCS necessary for control of AD. The
      investigators therefore propose a proof-of-concept study to investigate whether crisaborole
      can serve as an effective steroid-reducing agent.
