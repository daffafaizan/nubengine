      procedure in headache patients. GON blocks have been shown to be effective in the treatment
      of a variety of headaches including occipital neuralgia, migraine, vascular headache, cluster
      headache, cervicogenic headache, and post-concussive headache.The GON provides sensory
      innervation to the posterior scalp to the vertex of the skull and is known to communicate
      with the third occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve during its ascent at the
      occiput.The use of ultrasound guidance to assist with needle placement is becoming
      increasingly popular due to real-time visualization of soft tissue and surrounding
      vasculature as well as the appearance of bony structures. This imaging tool allows for fine
      adjustment of the needle tip and direct observation of the injectate thereby confirming local
      anesthetic spread at the targeted area. Local anesthetic and steroids have been successfully
      used for diagnostic and or therapeutic nerve pain such as lumbar radicultis with great
      success. Dexamethasone is a water soluble steroid, when combined with local anesthetic; it
      may increase the analgesia of block duration relative to its pharmacokinetics. When compared
      to dexamethasone, triamcinolone, a particulate steroid has a slower onset time but may
      provide anti-inflammatory effects up to several weeks. Investigators want to investigate to
      see if there exists a difference in reported pain intensity using the particulate
      anti-inflammatory corticosteroid (triamcinolone with bupivacaine) which may provide a greater
      reduction in reported pain intensity relief may allow the patient to undergo fewer
      interventional procedures.
