      acquiring multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MRE) during international travel, The
      investigators aimed to assess, among persons attending a consultation for travel medicine and
      international vaccines, patients level of knowledge regarding the risk of acquiring MRE,
      preventive behaviours and the need to inform health professionals that they had recently
      travelled if the patients require medical care after their return. A cross-sectional study
      was performed in the consultation for travel medicine and international vaccination in Reims
      University Hospital, France. All adult travellers who attended this consultation between
      January 2016 and May 2016 and who completed the questionnaire were included in the study. The
      questionnaire was completed before the planned travel. The travellers answered the
      questionnaires before seeing the physician.
