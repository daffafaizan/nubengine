        1. the effects of open-label, and deceptive placebo administration on placebo analgesia
           will be directly compared when both groups have a comparable expectancy-inducing
           scientific rationale;

        2. subjective meaning models will be assessed by comparing subjective narratives of the
           placebo effect in open-label and deceptive placebo groups in a nested qualitative study.

      The experimental study will be a randomized experiment with healthy subjects (N=120), and
      pain will be induced using a standardized heat pain paradigm (Medoc, Ramatishai, Israel;
      thermo-sensory analyzer (TSA)-II). Effects of the experimental conditions will be assessed
      both objectively (i.e. heat pain threshold and tolerance) and subjectively (i.e. subjective
      pain ratings, pain intensity and unpleasantness). Furthermore, investigators will randomly
      select 30 participants to take part in a nested qualitative study in order to qualitatively
      assess the meaning response by comparing subjective narratives of the placebo effect in the
      open-label and deceptive placebo groups, as well as in the control group.
