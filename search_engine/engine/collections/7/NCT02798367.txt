      nonpharmacological approaches. Behavioral techniques of Sleep Hygiene and Stimuli control are

      sleep-wake cycle, which is produced and secreted primarily by the pineal gland in the dark
      period and prepares the individual to sleep. Melatonin is involved in the induction of sleep
      and has proven therapeutic action in insomnia disorders, and may also play a role in the
      circadian timing system of mammals and serve as a marker for "biological clock".
