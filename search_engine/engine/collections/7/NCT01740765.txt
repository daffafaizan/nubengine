      randomized to complete 3 days of overfeeding (150% of baseline eucaloric energy requirements)
      or 3 days of underfeeding (50% of baseline eucaloric energy requirements). After completing
      one of these study arms, subjects will cross-over and complete the second arm. All study arms
      will be separated by two weeks. 24-hour energy expenditure will be measured 3 times during
      each of 3 day periods. We hypothesize that the impact of over or underfeeding on EE will be
      evident after 24-hours and will be comparable to 72 hour EE.
