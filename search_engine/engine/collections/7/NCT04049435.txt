      available bone in the treatment planning phase and inserting the implant in the correct 3D
      position to achieve good esthetic and function outcomes.(Rieder et al., 2016)

      The horizontal deficient anterior maxilla presents considerable challenges for surgical and
      prosthetic reconstruction. Inadequate alveolar ridge width caused by trauma , infection,
      congenitally missing teeth or resorption subsequent to dental extractions hampers dental
      implant placement (Aghaloo & Moy, 2007)

      Avariety of bone augmentation technigue have been described to enhance the bone volume of the
      deficient implant recipient site such as autogenous bone graft ,synthetic bone graft
      ,distraction osteogenesis ,ridge splitting, guided bone regeneration(Rakhmatia, Ayukawa,
      Furuhashi, & Koyano, 2013)(Gulinelli et al., 2017)

      Autograft remain the gold standard with the capacity to regenerate and forming new bone
      through its osteogenic ,osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties which can be obtained
      from chin area (Donos, Mardas, & Chadha, 2008).

      Due to the limited availabity of autograft in case of sever resorped ridge ,xenogrft can be
      mixed to increase the amount of bone applied to the defective area(Monje et al., 2015)

      However considerable graft resorption following augmentation and the graft was not
      sufficiently stable during the healing period ,the titanium membrane or sheet used to
      overcome this problem(Andreasi Bassi et al., 2016)

      The titanium sheet is non resorbable membrane , impermeable ,rigid acts as space
      maintainance, clot protection , a barrier preventing bacterial contamination of the gaft ,
      stopping the graft resorption , less morbid,less operative time , more accurate for contour
      reconstruction than the well known autogenous bone technique (Andreasi Bassi et al., 2016)

      Computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing technology (CAD/CAM) have been established
      in creation of three dimensional(3D) framework , Digitally virtually planned regenerated
      ridge was created from a cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) using specialized DICOM
      image ( Digital imaging and communication in medicine reconstructing 3D surgical model, and
      the design of the titanium sheet with the location of the bone screws was preserved. The new
      3D surgical model with the simulated surgery was used to fabricate titanium sheet positioning
      with all required dimensions decreasing the overall operative time .(Al-Ardah et al., 2018)

      The quality of newly formed bone will be evaluated by histologically at the time of implant
      placement , core biopsies will be retrieved . the specimen will immediately fixed in 10%
      buffered formalin for 1 week, then decalcified and processed according to standardized
      protocol Ethylenediamine-tetracetic acid (EDTA)-formic acid combination differentiating the
      newly formed bone end from the native bone end for histologic analysis(Atef, Hakam,
      Elfaramawey, Abou-Elfetouh, & Ekram, 2014)

      Following postoperative healing period of 6 months CBCT scan will take to evaluate the
      horizontal bone gain and planning of implant surgery(Mendoza-Azpur, Fuente, Chavez, Valdivia,
      & Khouly, 2019)
