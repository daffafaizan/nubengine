      syndrome can induce a peripheral neuropathy. The objectives of the present study are to
      investigate:

        1. the effect of physical training and diet education on neuropathic symptoms and
           neurophysiological parameters

        2. the best coaching modality of education.

      This will be a prospective single blind study (blinded evaluator). Patients will be randomly
      assigned in two groups. The first group will have a one-day therapeutic education program
      followed by a 5-minutes phone call every week for 3 months. The second group will have the
      same one-day therapeutic education program that will be followed by an unique one-hour phone
      call. During the one-day therapeutic education program and the phone calls, hygienic rules
      (ie physical activities) and dietetic regimen advices will be given to patients. Evaluation
      will be done at 3 months.
