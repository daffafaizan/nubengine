      of qualitative diagnostic images. These methods, being qualitative, do not offer a consistent
      and reproducible platform for contouring, making it difficult to evaluate the effects of
      contouring choices on treatment outcome. T2 component analysis in MRI has the potential to
      offer a quantitive basis for identifying tumor tissue- this potential is investigated in this
      pilot study.
