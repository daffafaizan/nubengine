    
      Given that:

        -  Ibrutinib as single agent has been associated with a high response rate and PFS in
           previously treated patients, and in patients with poor prognosis clinical and biologic
           features.

        -  Ibrutinib as single agent has proven activity and is associated with a good safety
           profile in elderly patients with CLL.

        -  The Ibrutinib plus Rituximab combination has been associated with a high response rate
           and PFS in previously treated patients, and in patients with poor prognosis clinical and
           biologic features.

        -  The combined administration of Ibrutinib and Rituximab could be an effective and safe
           front-line treatment schedule for unfit patients with CLL.

        -  The current study is designed to evaluate whether first line treatment with Ibrutinib
           and Rituximab results in a significant improvement in PFS at 12 months as compared with
           chlorambucil plus rituximab in patients unfit for fludarabine- or bendamustine-based
           treatments.
