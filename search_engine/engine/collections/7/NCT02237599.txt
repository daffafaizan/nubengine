      bilateral brachial plexus (clavicles), (2) Erb's point (posterior C8 cervical spine) and (3)
      on forehead will permit microvolt current to to be detected and analyzed against a
      proprietary algorithm. Neuropraxia will be detected based on abnormalities developing in
      received SSEP signals.
