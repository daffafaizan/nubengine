    
      Patients will be identified through attendance at the Wharton Head and Neck Clinic at
      Princess Margaret Hospital or attendance at the Toronto General Hospital Otolaryngology -
      Head & Neck Surgery clinic as requiring resection of mandibular pathology and subsequent
      reconstruction with bony free flap. Chart review (electronic) of these patients will be
      performed to obtain demographic information and factors such as tumor type, site, stage and
      prior treatment. Data will be obtained from CT scans to create 3D models, including anatomic
      parameters required for 3D printing of the mandible. Following reconstruction, a number of
      variables will be collected (i.e. position of the mandibular condyle within the
      temporomandibular joint, percentage of surface area contact between the plate and bone, type
      of occlusion/bite and degree of conformance). All of this data will be stored in a password
      protected Excel spreadsheet located on a secure University Health Network computer. Twenty
      participants will be enrolled into this study and randomized to one of two groups:
      intraoperative plate bending (n=10) or preoperative plate bending (n=10) using a 3D printed
      model. While the participant can be blinded to the strategy that will be pursued, the surgeon
      performing the reconstruction will not be blinded.
