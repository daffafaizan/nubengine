1319. diffuse tracheo-bronchial amyloidosis  a rare variant of a protean diseasea patient with diffuse tracheo-bronchialamyloidosis is described; brief clinicaldetails supplement those published in aprevious report (prowse,1958) and arefollowed by an account of the necropsyfindings and the histological appearancesat the site of amyloid deposition.  theliterature is reviewed and arguments areadvanced in favour of a common aetiologyfor amyloidosis in all its forms.  if thisacts through the immunity mechanism, it issuggested that variations in the site,strength, duration, and frequency of theantigen stimulus and the antibody responsemay determine the nature and distributionof the amyloid deposits.
