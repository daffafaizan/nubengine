        -  A clinical diagnostic interview as well as filling out a series of questionnaires and
           assessments.

        -  The second session will include a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
           scan to be conducted at the McLean Hospital Imaging Center. Participants will be asked
           to respond to surveys on their cell phone in the week following the fMRI brain scan.

        -  The third session will include a diagnostic interview, assessments, and questionnaires
           to be completed three-months after the fMRI brain scan. Participants will be asked to
           complete surveys on their cell phone during the week following this three month
           follow-up session.

        -  The fourth session will include a diagnostic interview, assessments, and questionnaires
           to be completed six-months after the fMRI brain scan. Participants will be asked to
           complete surveys on their cell phone during the week following this six month follow-up
           session.
