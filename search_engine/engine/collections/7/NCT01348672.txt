      sight-threatening change in patient with the ARMD, diabetic retinopathy and primary open
      glaucoma, and facilitate earlier detection of the problem to help us discover earlier
      treatments for people with these conditions. The reliability of each imaging technology will
      be assessed by determining its ability to differentiate between diseased and healthy eyes.
      Through this proposed Research Program, and in conjunction with our international academic
      and private sector partners, we will build and develop unique quantitative imaging
      technologies to:

        -  Comprehensively assess the blood supply to, and vascular regulation characteristics of
           the posterior segment of the eye, a diagnostic capability that is currently severely
           limited.

        -  Assess oxygen saturation disturbances in the retina and ON that occur prior to
           clinically detectable changes, diagnostic capability that currently does not exist

        -  Using the retinal blood supply and oxygen saturation parameters, we will derive net
           oxygen delivery to the retina and optic nerve head (ONH), a diagnostic capability that
           does not exist.
