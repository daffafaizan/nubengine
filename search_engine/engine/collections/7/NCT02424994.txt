      primarily from longitudinal, observational studies based at tertiary cardiac centres. It is
      unclear what the main causes of morbidity and death are in the general hypertropic
      cardiomyopathy population (outside tertiary referral centres) and it is likely that many
      patients have a benign clinical course and die from non-cardiac causes.

      Linkage of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office of National
      Statistics (ONS), offers the opportunities to study the natural history of hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy, from the time of diagnosis to the end of life, health care utilisation and to
      investigate the association between clinical characteristics and common clinical fatal and
      non-fatal outcomes.
