      target a specific oral disease). The optical filter can be exchanged for another if necessary
      (this is done prior to the subject visit as to not prolong the time of the visit). During
      operation, LED intensity can be altered using the rotary dimmer switch. The procedure took
      place during a routine dental visit once consent was obtained. The device was covered in a
      clear disposable plastic sheath (Consolidated Plastics, Stow, OH) or equivalent sterile
      disposable camera bag. After both the subject and clinician wore UV protective eyeware, a
      series of images and videos were taken. These included detailed frames of all 4 incisors and
      all 4 canines. A video of the camera aperture passing over the select teeth was also taken.
      Additional images focusing on areas of interest to the clinician were taken, with area of
      capture and device mode recorded. The total time required to capture all images and video is
      expected to be approximately 5 minutes. As a control, an Acteon Soprocare a commercial device
      operating under the same fluorescence principle was also used. Images and video of the
      aforementioned eight target teeth in each mode were similarly captured for comparison to the
      test device.
