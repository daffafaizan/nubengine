      technique. "Cover" when the ILM flap is everted over the MH gap in a single layer, "Fill"
      when the ILM is folded into multiple layers within the MH. All patients will undergo BCVA, RS
      and FS assessment at baseline, 1-month and 3-months after surgery.

      Purpose of the study is to report retinal differential sensitivity and fixation stability as
      well as anatomic and visual outcomes of patients operated on for idiopathic MH and randomly
      assigned to Fill or Cover Groups.
