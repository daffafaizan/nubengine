      shunt (TIPS) increases the risk of portal hypertension complications. Currently, a PPG
      reduction <12 mmHg after TIPS is the most consistent threshold associated with almost
      complete protection from variceal bleeding and ascites. However, the measurement of PPG
      requires an invasive procedure. A recent study investigated the variations in PPG
      measurements collected at different time points after placement of TIPS and demonstrated that
      a time point of at least 24 hours after which PPG values were best maintained (early PPG). It
      is of great clinical value to propose that an immediate PPG measurement fail to accurately
      identify the risk of decompensated event. And early PPG would change the decision making for
      re-intervention or not. However, the repeated invasive examination is extremely difficult to
      follow in clinical practice worldwide. The prospective multicenter trial aims to assess the
      diagnostic performance of a virtual imaging-based early portal pressure gradient (vePPG)
      (investigational technology) from CT angiography and Doppler ultrasound with invasive early
      PPG measurement as reference. The study participants with portal hypertension will be
      prospectively recruited at 10 high-volume liver centers (Beijing Shijitan Hospital; 302
      Hospital of PLA; Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University; The Third Xiangya Hospital of
      Central South University; Xingtai People's Hospital; Affiliated Traditional Chinese Medicine
      Hospital, Southwest Medical University; First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University;
      Beijing Ditan Hospital; PLA Army General Hospital; Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen
      University) in China.
