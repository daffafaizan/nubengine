      radiation at a high dose rate. It is designed for use with Axxent applicators to treat
      lesions, tumors, and conditions in or on the body where radiation is indicated. The Axxent
      System and Applicators are FDA cleared under 510(k)s K050843, K072683, K090914 and K122951.

      The purpose of this trial is to assess the overall survival of patients treated with the Xoft
      Axxent eBx System for single-fraction IORT following maximal neurosurgical resection of
      recurrent glioblastoma. A historical comparison will be made for surgical excision and
      GliaSite radiation therapy (Chan 2005), which resulted in a median OS of 9.1 months.

      Radiation is delivered to the target tissue (adjacent to the resection margins). It avoids
      treatment delays and eliminates weeks of post-surgical radiation therapy during which
      residual cancer cells might proliferate.
