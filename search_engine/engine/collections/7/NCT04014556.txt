      received 3 monthly injections of Aflibercept 2 mg/0.05 mL (Eylea; Bayer, Berlin, Germany) as
      a loading dose, followed one month later by one 577 nm yellow micropulse laser session with
      monthly PRN Aflibercept injections. Group B received 3 monthly injections of Aflibercept 2
      mg/0.05 mL as a loading dose, followed by monthly PRN Aflibercept injections. Patients in
      both groups were assessed one month after the end of loading phase; At this point, group A
      received the micropulse laser session and started PRN Aflibercept injections, while group B
      started PRN Aflibercept injections without receiving the micropulse laser session. After
      that, both groups were followed for 12 months.
