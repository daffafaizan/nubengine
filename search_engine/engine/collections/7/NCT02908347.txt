    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled exploratory pilot
      study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of systemic oral (po) administration
      of 100 mg MP1032 bid in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

      The study design consists of a 28-day screening/run-in period, a 42-day treatment period, 1
      day for the End of Treatment visit, and a 28-day follow-up period. Forty-four patients who
      meet the entry criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 100 mg
      MP1032 or placebo orally twice daily for 42 days. The goal is to have 40 patients (20 in each
      treatment group) complete the study.

      Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur on 3 designated study days. Safety will be monitored from
      the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the last follow-up visit on Day 71.

      Efficacy will be assessed on 6 designated study days using the following assessments: PASI,
      PGA, DLQI, mNAPSI, and EQ-5D 5L (VAS).
