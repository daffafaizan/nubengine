      Comparison of aerobic exercise, clomipramine, and placebo in the treatment of panic disorder.
      Am J Psychiatry 1998; 155(5):603-9.) it is the purpose of this trial to test the assumed
      superiority of a combined therapy of paroxetine and aerobic exercise compared to placebo or
      unspecific relaxation training in panic disorder. Participants were randomized to a 10 week
      treatment protocol of paroxetine 40 mg daily or placebo in combination with regular exercise
      or regular relaxation after having given informed consent and screening of in- and exclusion
      criteria.
