      enrolled to dose-escalation cohorts until establishment of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)
      and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Sym004 in combination with FOLFIRI.

      The Phase 2a (Dose-Expansion) portion of the trial is expected to begin after establishing
      the RP2D.

      Note: In January 2017, the trial was terminated during Phase 1b and enrollment was
      prematurely discontinued. The primary objective changed to assess the safety of the treatment
      combination; collection of data for secondary and exploratory objectives was omitted.
