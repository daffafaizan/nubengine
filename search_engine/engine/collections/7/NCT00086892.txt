        -  Determine the antitumor activity of cetuximab and carboplatin in patients with recurrent
           platinum-sensitive ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour (over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 only) on days 1,
      8 , and 15. Patients also receive carboplatin IV after cetuximab administration on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-65 patients will be accrued for this study.
