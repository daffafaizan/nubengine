      the postprandial carbohydrate oxidation. Medium chain triglycerides could be absorbed and
      metabolized immediately. It is plausible that its addition to a mixed meal unchains the
      decrement in the carbohydrate oxidation and increment in fat oxidation. If this hypothesis it
      is correct, its lower postprandial carbohydrate oxidation could develop a higher postprandial
      exposure to hyperglycemia, being of clinical interest.

      20 young adults will be randomized into two conditions (experimental and control conditions)
      with 7 days of separation between conditions. Each evaluation day will conform to the
      following tests:

        1. Basal metabolic rate assessment through indirect calorimetry.

        2. Intake of the corresponding mixed meal (experimental or control)

        3. Postprandial nutrient oxidation and energy expenditure through indirect calorimetry

        4. Blood samples assessment in 9 time points during the evaluation day.

        5. Post-prandial sensations related to appetite in 11 time points during the evaluation day
