    
      Recurrent prostate cancer after radical radiation therapy is a common problem with often a
      long interval from biochemical failure to the time of symptomatic relapse. Androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most commonly used intervention following radiation failure
      and currently is often started immediately after the recognition of biochemical failure in
      the absence of symptoms. ADT is associated with side effects that can impact on quality of
      life. It is unclear whether ADT reduces prostate-specific mortality. There is currently
      insufficient evidence on the timing of ADT with respect to prevention of prostate cancer
      death and quality of life and cost particularly for men with fast and slow prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) doubling times.

      The general objective of the ELAAT trial is to determine the optimal timing of ADT in men
      with recurrent prostate cancer after radical radiotherapy.

      Consenting patients who have undergone prior radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer and are
      now experiencing a recurrence will be screened for eligibility. If they are determined to be
      eligible, patients will be stratified according to PSA doubling time, pre-radiation Gleason
      Score, previous radical prostatectomy and clinical centre. After stratification, patients
      will be randomized to immediate versus deferred ADT based on the 1:1 ratio between the two
      arms.

      Patients will be followed indefinitely and assessed formally at 6 month intervals after the
      date or randomization. Patients will be assessed for recurrent disease (biochemical failure),
      new primary cancer, complications of advanced malignancy, quality of life and overall
      survival.
