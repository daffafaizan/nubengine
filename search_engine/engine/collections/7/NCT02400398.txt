      with cachexia, who are receiving enteral feeding, with a peptide based diet (medical food),
      through a jejunal or gastrojejunal feeding tube. We plan to collect serum samples routinely
      and establish a cohort of patients with this clinical syndrome. Our aims are to establish the
      feasibility and efficacy of enteral nutrition and its relationship to meaningful clinical
      outcomes. Furthermore, we will assess for a correlation between cachexia, activity, and
      patient reported outcomes on domains of quality of life in an optional activity tracker
      sub-study.
