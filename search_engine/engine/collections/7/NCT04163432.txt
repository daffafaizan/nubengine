      simultaneously measuring immune activation, immune resistance and host factors. Both arms
      will consist of concurrent chemoimmunotherapy with durvalumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin,
      but in arm 1 the chemotherapy will precede the immunotherapy by a week and in arm 2 the
      immunotherapy will precede the chemotherapy by a week. Staggering these therapies still
      allows concurrent administration while allowing some degree of temporal isolation to better
      understand the contributions by chemotherapy and immunotherapy in this setting. Host and
      laboratory factors will be measured during treatment. We hypothesize that staggered dosing of
      immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy can improve clinical benefit.
