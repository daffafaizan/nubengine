      different types of treatments for cancer and so far chemotherapy is the most common one.
      However, chemotherapy damages the peripheral veins, so implanted subcutaneous port-a-caths
      are used as an alternative. Traditionally this implantation is adminstered with infiltrative
      anesthesia. Recently, USG is used in anesthesia practice world wide. Blanco R et all (1)
      defined PECS 1 block as an alternative to paravertebral block. PECS 1 block aims to
      anesthetize the medial and lateral pectoral nerves. In this study our aim is to investigate
      the effects of USG guided PECS 1 block in the administiration of an implanted port-a-cath .
