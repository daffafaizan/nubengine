3083. myocardial toxicity of contrast agents used in angiographythe myocardial toxicity of many current andsome experimental contrast agentshas been studied in dogs, by use of a previouslyunreported method of occlusionretrograde coronary venography as well as thefamiliar technique of selectivecoronary arterial catheterization.  the followingconclusions appear justified inthe light of the experiments   not only theiodine-containing radicals with which thecontrast agents are so often identified (acetrizoates,diatrizoates, iothalamates,etc.), but also the final salification products appearto be responsible for the widelydivergent degrees of myocardial toxicity of contrastagents, to the point that differ-ent salts of the same compound behave as entirelydifferent agents both chemicallyand biologically.  the results seem to indicate thedominance of sodium ion and/orthe protective effect of methylglucamine salts withrespect to the myocardial toxi-city of current radiopaque media.  reported,yet unexplained, electrocardiographicchanges occurring within one to two secondsfrom the beginning of massive cavalhigh-pressure injections appear to find acausal relationship in the myocardial ir-ritability induced by the distention of thecoronary veins and the myocardial infiltra-tion which is intentionally enhanced withour retrograde injection techniques.  a pe-culiar trait, shared in varying degrees byall radiopaque agents tested, is theirability to increase coronary blood flow.the clinical significance of this phenome-non, however, remains to be established.these studies re-emphasize the limita-tions of the standard toxicity studies conductedin animals.  it should be clear fromthe results reported that agents to beadministered into the coronary circulationdemand investigation in regard to theirpotential toxicity by the methods describedherein or variations thereof.  in fact,similar tests should be carried out for all or-gans to be subjected to radiographicexamination via the vascular bed.  the authorshope that this presentation will stimulaterenewed investigation, particularly in viewof the growing clinical applications ofselective cardiovascular opacification tech-niques.
