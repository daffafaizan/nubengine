      lidocaine: bolus of 1.5 mg/kg at induction of anesthesia followed by infusion of 1 mg/kg/h
      intraoperatively and for 24 h postoperatively. Group K: Ketamine: bolus of 0.15 mg/kg
      followed by infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/h intraoperatively and for 24 h postoperatively. Control
      Group C: an equal volume of saline. The anesthetic technique will be standardized, and the
      postoperative assessments included pain scores, opioid consumption, recovery of bowel
      function and 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) on the fourth postoperative morning. At 3 months,
      patients will be questioned for chronic postoperative pain using the Neuropathic Pain 4
      questionnaire.
