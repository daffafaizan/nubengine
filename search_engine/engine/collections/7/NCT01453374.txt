      from 4 Baltimore, MD area prisons (three for men and one for women) will receive 1 injection
      of VIVITROL prior to release from prison and will be offered 6 monthly injections of VIVITROL
      for 6 months post release. Subjects will complete follow-up visits 1 and 2 months after the
      last VIVITROL injection. Subjects will be assessed at 10 time points, and adherence to
      VIVITROL, both in prison and in the community, will be assessed.
