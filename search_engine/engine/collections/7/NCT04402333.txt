      minimally invasive robotic surgery provides maximal debulking surgery and improved patient
      outcomes.

      Null Hypothesis: Robotic surgery is not suitable for the treatment of ovarian cancer
      following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It is not possible to achieve maximal debulking surgery
      and patient outcomes are not improved.

      To assess the feasibility of obtaining consent from women and acceptability of Robotic
      interval debulking surgery for advanced ovarian cancer. Women deemed suitable for interval
      debulking surgery will be identified through the Gynaecological Oncology multidisciplinary
      team meeting. The aim is to recruit women over a period of 1 year aiming for a total of 20
      women who undergo Minimally Invasive Robotic Interval debulking surgery for advanced ovarian
      cancer. The main outcomes are feasibility of the recruitment process and acceptability of the
      questionnaires and numeric rating pain scale (NRS11) as assessed by completion rate and
      patient interviews.

      In order to be able to offer MIRRORS to as many patients as possible the investigators have
      kept the inclusion criteria wide, not restricting by Body Mass Index (BMI), patient
      comorbidities or Ca125 level.
