      prevention of postoperative emesis after breast and thyroid surgery and at the same time, the
      mechanism of action was investigated. In this prospective, randomized controlled trial it was
      hypothesized that corticosteroids exert their antiemetic effects in postoperative period via
      plasma prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 Î±) and plasma leukotriene C4 (LTC4) inhibition.
