    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 128 hospitalized smokers at BMC (64
      participants in each of two arms), to assess the effect of inpatient SDM + CHW Navigation
      (AHRQ LDCT screening decision aid + CHW + SDM discussion + smoking cessation counseling)
      compared to Enhanced Usual Care (smoking cessation counseling + decision aid) on LDCT
      screening completion at 3 months, patient knowledge, and smoking cessation at 6 months.

      The research will meet two specific aims (SA1 and SA2).

      SA1: To address barriers to engaging smokers in prevention and early detection of lung
      cancer, a pilot RCT (Pilot Study 2) will be conducted in which screen-eligible hospitalized
      smokers will be randomized to receive inpatient sdm + CHW navigation (inpatient SDM during
      smoking cessation counseling visits + CHW navigation to coordinate outpatient tobacco
      treatment, referral to LCS, and resources to address negative social determinant of health
      that present barriers to these preventive services) or Enhanced usual care (furnishing of
      LDCT screening decision aid during inpatient smoking cessation counseling visits). Compared
      to Enhanced Usual Care, it is hypothesized that inpatient sdm + CHW navigation will increase
      the number of patients completing LCS (1° outcome) and LCS knowledge, and biochemically
      validated smoking cessation at 6 months (2° outcome).

      SA2: To collect stakeholder input to inform future implementation, Fifteen primary care
      providers (PCPs) will be interviewed to assess their impressions of the intervention,
      integration into workflow, and barriers to adoption. Fifteen smokers who received the
      intervention will be interviewed to learn their impressions of its utility and suggestions
      for improvement.
