      early and midterm clinical data. However, since revisions associated with osteolysis
      typically occur after 10-year follow-up, the greatest benefits of the reduced wear associated
      with crosslinked polyethylene are expected to be reflected in lower revision rates for
      wear-related complications at long-term follow-up.

      While crosslinking has proven to substantially reduce polyethylene wear during the first
      decade in vivo, characterizing the long-term clinical performance of Marathon polyethylene
      remains important because crosslinking is accompanied by a reduction in the ultimate tensile
      strength, fatigue strength, and elongation to failure of ultra high molecular weight
      polyethylene. As a consequence, concerns have been expressed about the potential for the
      liner fracture, in vivo polyethylene oxidation or accelerated wear at long-term follow-up,
      the effects of femoral head roughening over time and the bioreactivity of crosslinked
      polyethylene debris particles. Ultimately, the best way to address these concerns is in the
      context of well-controlled, long-term clinical outcome studies. This study will evaluate
      outcome at a minimum of 14-years after surgery among the same group of patients whose outcome
      was previously reported at 10-year follow-up. As part of our efforts to follow patients
      throughout their lives to obtain long-term outcome data, we will continue to obtain routine
      follow-up every 5 years from the date of the patient's primary total hip arthroplasty for the
      duration of the patient's life or until revision of the polyethylene liner (estimated to be
      25 years). Because we anticipate that the reduced incidence of wear and osteolysis will
      result in a lower incidence of revision surgery among the patients randomized to Marathon
      liners, implant revision for reasons related to wear will be our primary outcome measure at
      long-term follow-up.
