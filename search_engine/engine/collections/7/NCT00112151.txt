      effects on body composition, muscle, bone, memory, and behavior, but the risks of chronic
      treatment, especially on the prostate, heart, and sleep quality, are not entirely clear.
      Therefore, it is most desirable to supplement into the lowest "effective" range in elderly
      men. However, the effects of lower than usual replacement T doses have not been well studied.
      Furthermore, the possible important interaction of exercise to enhance the positive effects
      of T supplementation, yet mitigate the possible side effects, has not been studied in older
      men.

      This one-year study will enroll 150 men with low-normal to slightly below normal serum total
      T levels. Participants will be randomized into one of 6 treatment groups to receive T
      supplementation (AndroGel) of 25mg/day, 50 mg/day or a placebo crossed with progressive
      resistance training (PRT) exercise 3 times a week versus none. At the end of the study,
      participants in the exercise-control group will be offered PRT.
