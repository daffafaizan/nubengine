      providers.

      During hospitalization, a neonate undergoes a number of necessary procedures that may be
      either painful or cause discomfort to the baby.

      Pain experienced during the neonatal period is known to have long term effects on the baby.

      The red-reflex test is a routine examination performed on a neonate after birth and once
      again before discharge from the hospital. The examination causes discomfort to the infant.

      Glucose has analgesic and calming effects in newborns. To date, it is not known whether the
      beneficial effects extend to care giving procedures that are performed after painful
      procedures. Our objective is to determine the effect of glucose 25% analgesia for procedural
      pain on infant pain responses during a subsequent care giving procedure.
