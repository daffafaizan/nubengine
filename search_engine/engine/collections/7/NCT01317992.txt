      particularly those containing opioids, can induce a form of secondary headache, known as
      medication overuse headache (MOH). Despite the significant clinical impact of this condition
      the mechanisms behind MOH remain poorly understood, guidelines for treatment are lacking, and
      relapse is common.

      Recently, it has been recognised that repeated opioid exposure can facilitate pain by
      activating glia, the immunocompetent cells of the central nervous system, resulting in
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH).

      The investigators hypothesise that MOH represents a form of OIH in this susceptible patient
      group - repeated activation of nociceptive pathways by frequent headaches interacts with the
      opioid induced pro-inflammatory actions of activated glia to produce chronic daily headache
      (CDH).

      This double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled pilot study will investigate the use of
      ibudilast, a know attenuator of glial activation, in the treatment of medication overuse
      headache.
