      how much - by providing different levels of LPG price subsidies. It will also ascertain if
      demand is influenced by distance by allocating participants to varying distances to points of
      LPG supply. Finally, it will assess factors that could affect the demand for LPG such as
      availability and price of other fuels for cooking, and income levels.

      In particular the objectives of the study are:

        1. To determine if demand for LPG is price elastic

        2. To determine if demand for LPG is influenced by distance

        3. To ascertain what other factors aside the price of LPG, and distance to point of LPG
           supply, determine the demand for LPG

        4. To document the successes and challenges of introducing a subsidy for LPG in rural
           settings
