    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the tumor response in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin
           lymphoma (closed to accrual as of 8/18/08), aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (closed to
           accrual as of 2/7/08 except for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, grade III follicular
           lymphoma, or transformed lymphoma), or uncommon lymphoma (closed to accrual as of
           9/2/08), including Hodgkin's lymphoma, treated with everolimus.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate overall survival, progression-free survival, and time to disease progression in
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology
      (aggressive lymphoma [closed to accrual as of 2/7/08 except for diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma, grade III follicular lymphoma, or transformed lymphoma] vs indolent lymphoma
      [closed to accrual as of 8/18/08] vs uncommon lymphoma [closed to accrual as of 9/2/08]).

      Patient receive oral everolimus daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood and tissue collection at baseline and periodically during study
      treatment for translational research studies. Blood and tissue samples are analyzed for
      biomarkers to study the effect of everolimus on lymphoma.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
