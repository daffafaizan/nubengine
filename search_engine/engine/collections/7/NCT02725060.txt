    
      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a debilitating disorder resulting from cardiovascular
      autonomic dysfunction, has many causes and is very difficult to treat effectively. The
      investigators have identified the presence of autoantibodies (immune proteins) directed
      against some receptors of the autonomic nervous system that can cause patient's symptoms on
      standing.

      The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that patients with POTS harbor
      functional autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors that lead to an excessive tachycardia
      characteristic of POTS. For this purpose, this study will define the prevalence, burden, and
      the in vivo physiological significance of these adrenergic antibodies in a well-phenotyped
      and representative cohort of patients with POTS and a matched cohort of healthy control
      subjects, and will characterize the stability of these autoantibodies over time in affected
      POTS patients.
