      patients recruited from 12 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with colorectal cancer are
      invited upon diagnosis. Upon recruitment, after 6 months, 2 years and 5 years, patients fill
      out food-frequency questionnaires; questionnaires about dietary supplement use, physical
      activity, weight, height, and quality of life; and donate blood samples. Diagnostic CT-scans
      are collected to assess cross-sectional areas of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous fat, visceral
      fat and intermuscular fat, and to assess muscle attenuation. Blood samples are biobanked to
      facilitate future analyse of biomarkers, nutrients, DNA etc. Analysis of serum 25-hydroxy
      vitamin D levels, B-vitamins and metabolomic profiles are scheduled. A subgroup of patients
      with colon cancer is asked to provide faecal samples before and at several time points after
      colon resection to study changes in gut microbiota during treatment. For all patients,
      information on vital status is retrieved by linkage with national registries. Information on
      clinical characteristics, including treatment-related toxicity and co-morbidity data, is
      gathered from linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry and with hospital databases or
      medical records. Hazard ratios will be calculated for dietary and lifestyle factors at
      diagnosis in relation to recurrence and survival. Repeated measures analyses will be
      performed to assess changes over time in dietary and other factors in relation to recurrence
      and survival.

      The aim is to recruit at least 2000 patients with available data and blood samples.
