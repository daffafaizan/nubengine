        -  Low dose hyper-radiation sensitivity response will be significantly enhanced in
           Taxotere- induced G2/M cell cycle arrest.

        -  LDFRT will render enhanced bax activation mediated mode of cell death.

        -  Erbitux will arrest the cells in G1/G0 phase leading to p21-mediated mode of cell death.

        -  The toxicity profile is expected to be minimal.

      Based on the above mentioned reasons, we propose this novel schema of treatment in recurrent
      SCCHN.
