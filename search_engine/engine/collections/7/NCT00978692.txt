      for astigmatism, using spherical reverse geometry lens designs. Toric ortho-k lenses have
      been introduced in recent years but the efficacy for astigmatic reduction and for myopic
      control in children have not been confirmed. The mechanism of myopic reduction in ortho-k
      cannot be fully explained by changes to the anterior corneal curvatures. It is therefore
      possible that other corneal parameters such as posterior corneal curvature and corneal
      biomechanics may contribute to the mechanism.

      The current study aims at investigating the efficacy of toric ortho-k lenses for correcting
      myopic astigmatism and for retarding myopic progression in children compared to children
      wearing single-vision spectacles. Long term changes to other corneal parameters such as
      posterior cornea curvatures, topographical corneal thickness, corneal hysteresis, corneal
      resistance factor, with and without ortho-k lens wear will also be investigated.
