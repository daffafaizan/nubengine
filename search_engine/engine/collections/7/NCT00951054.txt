      locally advanced non-resectable and metastatic breast cancer with ER-negative, PR negative
      and HER2-negative phenotype. NK012 will be administered by infusion over 30 minutes once
      every 28 days (on Day 1 of each cycle). Patients will be screened for UGT1A1 polymorphism
      prior to enrollment in order to determine their starting dose.
