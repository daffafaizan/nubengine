      symptoms of PD and their impact on affected individuals. Therefore therapeutic strategies to
      ameliorate these symptoms are ever more needed. Sufficient clinical data for the treatment of
      symptoms of blood pressure dysregulation is still lacking. This study is aiming at closing
      this knowledge gap by comparing the efficacy and tolerability of a promising new agent,
      pyridostigmine bromide with the standard treatment, fludrocortisone.

      The proposed target of pyridostigmine in this respect is at the autonomic ganglion in the
      efferent limb of the baroreflex. Via a reduction of acetylcholine breakdown the sympathetic
      ganglionic transmission increases upon orthostatic stress (Singer et al., 2006).

      Via the same mechanism we aim to facilitate gastrooesophageal motility and gastric emptying:
      Both relaxation and contractibility of the oesophagus are known to be affected in PD patients
      as shown in a manometric study (Sung et al., 2010). Both relaxation and contractability are
      mainly influenced by nicotinergic and muscarinergic, cholinergic vagal efferents to the
      oesophagus (Chang et al., 2003). Via a reduction of acetylcholine breakdown we aim to
      increase the cholinergic tone and thereby normalize the reduced relaxation and
      contractibility.

      We also intent to show that this faster gastric transit results in a faster absorption of
      Madopar into the bloodstream - we therefore will measure Levodopa and its metabolites during
      the first 60mins after ingestion of 125mg fast-release Madopar in serial venous blood samples
      via high-pressure liquid chromatography.
