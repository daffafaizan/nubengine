      50, and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Beta-blockers
      have been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and death in patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients
      with PAD. However, there is a theoretical risk that antihypertensive therapy may decrease
      limb perfusion pressure and therefore exacerbate symptoms of claudication or limb ischemia.
      Patients with CAD and concomitant PAD are less likely to be prescribed beta-blockers, even
      though most patients are able to tolerate antihypertensive therapy without worsening of
      symptoms.

      The third generation beta-blocker, nebivolol, has vasodilating properties in addition to
      beta-adrenergic blockade. This vasodilatory effect is mediated through the L-arginine-nitric
      oxide-dependent pathway. Nitric oxide is a critical modulator of vascular disease with
      effects that lead to vasodilatation, endothelial regeneration, inhibition of leukocyte
      chemotaxis and inhibition of platelet adhesion. This combination of beta-blockade and nitric
      oxide-dependent vasodilation may enhance effectiveness and tolerability of nebivolol versus
      other beta-blockers in patients with hypertension, CAD or high-risk state, and PAD.

      This study will be a pilot comparative effectiveness study to examine the effect of nebivolol
      versus metoprolol succinate in patients with lower-extremity PAD and at least moderate risk
      for CAD on PAD symptoms as measured by both functional and quality of life measures.
