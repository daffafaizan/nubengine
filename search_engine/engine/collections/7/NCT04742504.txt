        1. Investigators will monitor basophil miRNAs changes with benralizumab analyzing miRNAS
           profile of isolated basophil before and after benralizumab treatment.

        2. Also, in vitro characterization of benralizumab effects on functionality of human
           basophils (isolated from allergic asthmatic patients) and human cell line KU812,
           measuring apoptosis, activation, degranulation and histamine release will be performed.
