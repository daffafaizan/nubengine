      of labor in singleton women ≥ 36 weeks gestation with an unfavorable cervix is not clinically
      and statistically inferior than the reference treatment , ie intravaginal dinoprostone
      sustained release (10mg), in terms of cesarian sectionto compare the cost-effectiveness and
      to assess the differential tolerance of the two strategies.

      Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the upper limit of the 90%-bilateral confidence
      interval of the difference between cesarian section rates (misoprostol - dinosprostone) is
      below 5% in the intention-to-treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis.

      If non-inferiority is demonstrated, as a secondary analysis, superiority of misosprostol will
      be tested.

      Orther secondary objectives are to assess the cost-effectiveness, the tolerance, maternal
      satisfaction and other efficacy endpoints of the two strategies.
