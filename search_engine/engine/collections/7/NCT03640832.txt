    
      This is a single-center, non-comparative clinical 'in-use' study to determine the local
      cutaneous and ocular tolerance of a developmental cosmetic facial serum formulation in
      healthy female subjects aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) with clinically evaluated sensitive
      skin, as determined by a positive response to a Lactic Acid Sting Test (LAST), with minimal
      signs or symptoms of cutaneous irritation and no signs or symptoms of ocular irritation. A
      reference product, proven to be suitable for use in a sensitive skin population will also be
      used.
