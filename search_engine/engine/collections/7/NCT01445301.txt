      Assessment (ISGA) score of 2 or greater at baseline visit, and have both 17 to 60 facial
      inflammatory lesions (papules plus pustules) and 20 to 150 facial non-inflammatory lesions
      (open and closed comedones), including nasal lesions. The primary objectives are to
      demonstrate the superiority of GSK2585823 twice daily to CLDM twice daily in total lesion
      counts, and to demonstrate the non-inferiority of GSK2585823 once daily to CLDM twice daily
      in total lesion counts. The secondary objectives are to demonstrate the non-inferiority of
      GSK2585823 once daily to CLDM twice daily in inflammatory lesion counts, and to evaluate the
      efficacy of GSK2585823 once or twice daily compared with CLDM twice daily at each visit. A
      total of 800 subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the groups.
