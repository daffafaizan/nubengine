    
      In this prospective, comparative, masked study, patients will be randomly assigned to have
      torsional coaxial microincision cataract surgery using either the mini-flared 45-degree
      Kelman tip or reversed mini-flared 30-degree Kelman tip. Clinical measurements will include
      preoperative and 3-month postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), endothelial
      cell counts (ECC) and preoperative and 1-day postoperative central corneal thickness (CCT).
      Intraoperative measurements will include phaco time, torsional time, aspiration time, case
      time, cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) and balanced salt solution volume (BSS).

      The study was performed according to established ethical standards for clinical research
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, conducted between
      November 2010 and February of 2011. All surgeries will be performed at the University of Sao
      Paulo. Physicians conducting postoperative evaluation will not have access to patients'
      medical records. Exclusion criteria will be previous ocular surgery, central endothelial cell
      count less than 2000 cells/mm2, glaucoma or intraocular pressure greater than 21 mmHg,
      amblyopia, retinal abnormalities, steroid or immunosuppressive treatment and connective
      tissue diseases. Enrolled patients who have complicated cataract surgery (eg, posterior
      capsule rupture, vitreous loss, or an intraocular lens not placed in the capsular bag) will
      be subsequently excluded.
