      will be provided via Qualtrics. To determine eligibility, participants will be asked to fill
      out a pre-screening measure of depressive symptoms, the Personal Health Questionnaire-9
      (PHQ-9). Those who score 10 or higher will be eligible. After consenting to participate,
      participants will fill out baseline measures, be randomly assigned to a condition,
      participate in any condition related procedures, and then respond to a follow-up assessment
      one week later.

      Each brief intervention consists of watching a series of videos. After each video,
      participants in the intervention conditions will be prompted to answer a series of questions
      to practice the skills explained in the videos. For the entrée and sampler conditions,
      watching all videos and filling out any worksheets that are part of the initial intervention
      is expected to take approximately 30 minutes.

      Participants in the entrée and sampler conditions will be asked to work on a coping skills
      worksheet over the next seven days (estimated to involve about 10 minutes of work).
      Participants will receive an email seven days after participating in the brief intervention,
      asking them to take part in the following portion of the study. Before beginning the
      follow-up activity, participants in the intervention conditions will be asked to upload the
      coping skills worksheet they worked on. All participants will be asked to respond to
      follow-up assessment measures at this point.
