      clarithromycin combined to periodontal mechanical therapy in the treatment of patients with
      generalized aggressive periodontitis.Forty patients were select and randomly assigned into
      two groups: Group clarithromycin with 20 subjects that received one-stage full-mouth
      ultrasonic debridement (FMUD) associated with clarithromycin (500 mg - 12/12 hours) for 3
      days; group placebo with 20 subjects that received FMUD associated with placebo. Probing
      depth (PD), gain in clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were
      evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6 months post- operatively.
