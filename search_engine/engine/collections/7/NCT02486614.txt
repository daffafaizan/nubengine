    
      Purpose of clinical trial:

      To evaluate the effect of regional citrate anti-coagulation on different pathways of the
      coagulation system in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury.

      Patient population:

      critically ill patients with acute kidney injury requiring citrate-based continuous renal
      replacement therapy (CRRT)

      Primary objective:

      Changes from baseline in a number of measures of coagulability (platelet count; Prothrombin
      Time; Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ratio; fibrinogen; d-dimers; Thrombin generation
      assay; Clot lysis; platelet function analysis 100) in both the blood within the patient's
      systemic circulation and the CRRT circuit over the course of 72 hours of regional
      anticoagulation with citrate.

      Number of Subjects/Patients:

      12 patients with complete data.

      Trial Design:

      Prospective non-interventional study.

      Endpoints:

      Change from baseline in a number of measures of coagulability.

      Main Inclusion Criteria:

      Adult intensive care patients undergoing CRRT with citrate regional anti-coagulation for AKI.
