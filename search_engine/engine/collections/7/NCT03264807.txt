      absence of 14v lymph node dissection. Actually, if the 14v lymph node metastasis is suspected
      before surgery, it is excluded from the study. In a retrospective study conducted in our
      hospital, we compared the patients with the 14v lymphadenectomy group and those without the
      14v lymphadenectomy group, the survival rate of the 14v lymphadenectomy group was 11% higher
      than that of the 14v non-lymphadenectomy group.Previous studies have suggested that the
      presence of metastatic lymph nodes in the 14v lymph node is not good and that removal of the
      14v lymph node does not affect prognosis. However, if the lymph node is a continuous tissue
      and the transition to the 14v lymph node is confirmed microscopically, a negative prognosis
      may be expected because it is likely that the cancer has spread to the distal lymph node. In
      addition, inadequate resection of the lymphatic or 14v lymph node adjacent to the 14v lymph
      node in the absence of evidence of metastasis of the 14v lymph node under microscopic
      examination indicates that cancer may spread even after curative surgery, To prevent cancer
      metastasis.
