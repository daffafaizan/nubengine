    
      This study will be a double-blinded cross-over clinical trial design to assess the prevalence
      of cognitive effects, the efficacy, and the effect on quality of life (QOL) of two
      anticholinergic medications commonly used in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB):
      oxybutynin and darifenacin. This will be done by use of a well-established and validated
      computer-based cognitive battery. Secondary endpoints will assess efficacy of anticholinergic
      therapy on symptoms of OAB via QOL questionnaire and participant urinary diaries.
