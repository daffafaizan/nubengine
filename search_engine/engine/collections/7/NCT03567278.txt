      ACURATE TAâ„¢ which is an aortic bioprosthesis for minimal invasive implantation via
      transapical access to treat patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis where
      conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) via open heart surgery is considered to be
      associated with high surgical risk for evaluating the feasibility and performance of the
      implantation and the safety at 30-Day follow-up.
