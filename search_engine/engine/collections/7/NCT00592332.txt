      counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia exists in man. Some studies have shown that prior
      activation of GABA(A) receptors may result in blunting of counterregulatory responses during
      next day hypoglycemia.

      The Specific Aim is to determine if repeated activation of GABA(A) receptors using Alprazolam
      will result in blunting of neuroendocrine, ANS and metabolic counterregulatory mechanisms
      during next day hypoglycemia in T1DM and healthy man.
