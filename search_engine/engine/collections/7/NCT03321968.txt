    
      This randomized, observer-blind, multicenter, Phase 3 lot consistency study will be conducted
      at multiple sites in Canada. The composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine used
      in this study includes two influenza A virus strains and two influenza B virus strains based
      on the 2016-2017 recommended strains for vaccination in the Northern hemisphere.

      1,200 healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 49 years will be randomized in a 1:1:1
      ratio to one of three lots of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine (30 Î¼g/strain). Subjects
      will participate in this study for approximately 21 days, during which a first visit will be
      scheduled on Day 0 for screening, eligibility assessment, and vaccine administration; and on
      Day 21 for blood sample collection for immunogenicity assessment.
