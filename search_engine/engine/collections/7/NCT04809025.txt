      surgical resection specimens for histological type, histological grade, LAUREN type, HER-2
      expression, MSI/dMMR status and EBV status testing. However, gastric cancers treated with
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy/chemotherapy may undergo a complete pathological response
      (pCR), with no residual tumors available for testing, and neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy/chemotherapy may alter the HER-2 expression, MSI/dMMR status and EBV status
      of the gastric cancer in some instances. Importantly, testing histological type, histological
      grade, LAUREN type, HER-2 expression, MSI/dMMR status and EBV status of gastric cancer on
      endoscopic biopsy material could be initiated preoperatively, allowing resultant genetic
      information to be used in consultation with the patient to inform treatment decisions.
      Therefore, the preoperative endoscopic biopsy may be a source of suitable and reliable
      testing material. This study aims to investigate the correlation between histological type,
      histological grade, LAUREN type, HER-2 expression, MSI/dMMR status, and EBV status in
      preoperative endoscopic biopsy specimens and their corresponding surgical resection specimens
      and ascertain whether endoscopic biopsy specimen is a valid and reliable testing material for
      determining the histological type, histological grade, LAUREN type, HER-2 expression,
      MSI/dMMR status and EBV status of gastric cancer.
