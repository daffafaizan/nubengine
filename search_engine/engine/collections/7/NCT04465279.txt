      of IOLs implantations. Patients who have undergone cataract surgery with implantation of
      monofocal IOL may require spectacles to perform near-distance (e.g., reading) or
      intermediate-distance (e.g., using a computer) tasks depending on their visual
      demandsMultifocal IOLs that maintain distance focus and improve near vision have been
      developed to reduce spectacle dependence.Multifocal IOLs improve patient performance of
      near-vision tasks, such as reading crafts, hobbies, and social activities to a greater extent
      than do monofocal IOLs. However, halos and reduced contrast sensitivity have been associated
      with multifocal IOLs and are common reasons for patient's dissatisfaction.Trifocal technology
      has been developed to create intermediate focus to overcome these difficulties. Continuous
      reports of the visual outcomes of the FineVision trifocal IOLs are encouraging.
