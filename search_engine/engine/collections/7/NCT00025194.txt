        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ixabepilone combined with estramustine in
           patients with progressive androgen-independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate. (Phase I)

        -  Compare the safety and efficacy of ixabepilone with or without estramustine in this
           patient population. (Phase II)

        -  Correlate the clinical outcomes with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
           reaction-based assay for prostate-specific antigen mRNA in patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ixabepilone (phase I) followed by a randomized,
      multicenter study (phase II).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 2 and oral estramustine 3
           times daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ixabepilone until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours at the MTD on day 2 and
                estramustine as in phase I.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours at the MTD on day 1. Treatment
                in both arms repeats as in phase I.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-12 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study and a
      total of 44-92 patients (22-46 per treatment arm) will be accrued for phase II of this study
      within 12-18 months.
