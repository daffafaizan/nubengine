      incorporating neonatal NIBP technology. Specifically, NIBP measurements will be taken using a
      cuff on the patient's limb (exact location will be determined by clinician) using a variety
      of cuffs sized for neonates and pediatrics. The device utilizes oscillometric technology to
      obtain quickly and conveniently non-invasive blood pressure measurements. Results will be
      compared to invasive blood pressure measurements from patients already monitored with such
      sensors. The Device under Test will be calibrated and verified by a Mortara representative on
      site.
