      (HRT) and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) are known to be effective therapeutic
      modalities. Little is known about the effect of group therapy, the effect of combining HRT
      and ERP training, and of the long-term effect of treatment. This study therefore wanted to
      examine the effect of a combined treatment using both HRT and ERP in children and adolescents
      with CTD. The participants were randomized to treatment either in groups or in an individual
      setting. The parents were included in the training programme. The participants were asked to
      fulfill questionnaires concerning anxiety, mood, life quality, their thoughts about tics and
      the experienced premonitory urge. Furthermore, they were interviewed with the semistructured
      interview Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

      Data was obtained from patient files as to examine possible predictors of both acute and
      long-term treatment effects. The evaluators were a specialized psychologist and a child and
      adolescent psychiatrist with several years of experience in diagnosing, evaluating and
      treating tic disorders. A random sample of 10% were audiotaped and evaluated by another rater
      with extensive experience and expertise in the use of the YGTSS. The evaluator was not
      blinded to the treatment allocation, yet not involved in the treatment of the patient, and
      blinded to any previous evaluations
