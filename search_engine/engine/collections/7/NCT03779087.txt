      pylori-infected adult patients with failure of non-bismuth quadruple therapy are randomly
      assigned to either TL quadruple therapy (esomeprazole-bismuth-tetracycline-levofloxacin
      regimen) or AL quadruple therapy (esomeprazole-bismuth-amoxicillin-levofloxacin regimen) for
      10 days. Repeated endoscopy with rapid urease test, histological examination and culture or
      urea breath tests is performed at six weeks after the end of anti-H pylori therapy.
