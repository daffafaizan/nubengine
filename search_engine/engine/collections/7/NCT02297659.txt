      number of complications associated with an open abdomen.

      Research Questions:

        1. Primary Objective: Is there a higher rate of PFC among patients who undergo DCL and
           temporary abdominal closure when using HTS versus standard crystalloid resuscitation?

        2. Secondary Objectives: Does successful and faster PFC reduce ICU, ventilator and hospital
           days?

        3. Does faster and more successful PFC result in lower morbidity to include enterocutaneous
           fistula (ECF), intra-abdominal abscess (IAA), abdominal wall hernia, and anastomotic
           failure?

      DCL is a common procedure wounded warriors undergo due to blast and other blunt and
      penetrating mechanisms of injury. This results in a significant population of warriors at
      risk for all of the complications and comorbidities that accompany an open abdomen. Thus,
      finding ways to not only achieve PFC but also to decrease the time to PFC will reduce these
      unwanted events.

      The protocol design is a multi-institutional, prospective, double blind, randomized
      controlled trial of patients who undergo DCL for abdominal trauma requiring temporary
      abdominal closure and return to operating room for definitive treatment. All participating
      facilities are Level I Trauma Centers. Currently, the standard of care for damage control
      resuscitation involves all intravenous fluid solutions utilized in this study; normal saline,
      Ringer's lactate, Plasmalyte, and 3% saline (HTS). However, the type of fluid is selected
      based on surgeon preference alone. Investigators will randomize patients to normal saline at
      a resuscitation rate of 30 cc/hr or to 3% saline (HTS) at a resuscitation rate of 30cc/hr
      which will be initiated upon arrival to the ICU.
