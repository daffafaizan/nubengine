      young adult patients with sickle cell disease treated with vitamin D supplementation and
      anti-resorptive therapy (bisphosphonates). We plan to analyze data from 1 January 2010 to 31
      December 2015.

      In addition to the standard hematological analysis, the following parameters and radiologic
      exams will be evaluated:

        -  Serum levels of Ca2+, P, Vitamin D, parathormone , creatinine, blood urea nitrogen , Na,
           K, Cl

        -  Bone turnover markers: C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), N-terminal propeptide of type I
           procollagen (PINP)

        -  Bone densitometry (DXA) at lumbar spine and proximal femur

        -  Standard X-Ray at dorsal-lumbar spine in LL projection for morphometric analysis
