    
      The primary aim of the "BOOST Cohort Study" is to determine the incidence of FI symptoms at 6
      and 12 weeks postpartum in primiparous women sustaining an OASI.

      Secondary aims of the cohort study are:

        1. To determine the incidence rates of FI symptoms at 24 weeks post delivery in primiparous
           women sustaining an OASI

        2. To examine the relationship between the modified WHO sphincter tear classification types
           and FI symptoms

        3. To examine predictors (socio-demographic, physical and clinical) associated with WHO
           sphincter tear classifications (3a, 3b and 4) and predictors associated with FI symptoms

        4. To evaluate the incidence of fecal urgency and flatal incontinence at 24 weeks
           postpartum in primiparous women sustaining an OASI.
