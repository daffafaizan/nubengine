      β-hCG was done. If β-hCG was < 1000 IU/L, the woman was followed with β-hCG 2 days later.
      Women with β-hCG > 1000 IU/L or abnormal β-hCG trend (increase < 66% or decrease < 15%) were
      offered HSC. If gestational tissues were visualized, ectopic pregnancy was ruled out.
      Otherwise, the tentative diagnosis was ectopic pregnancy.
