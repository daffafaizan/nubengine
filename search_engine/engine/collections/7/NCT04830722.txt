      side treated". All subjects will receive three, single-sided injections of Sculptra
      Aesthetic, performed 1 month apart. Treatments will be provided to one side randomly assigned
      to either "right side" or "left side". The non-treatment side will receive bacteriostatic
      water, injected in the same manner as Sculptra Aesthetic. Up to four (4) vials of Sculptra
      Aesthetic, diluted at 16 mL, will be used per treatment session.
