      versus IV diphenhydramine 50 mg/mL in approximately 34 patients who require premedication for
      hypersensitivity infusion reactions associated with an anti-CD20 such as RituxanÂ® (rituximab)
      or Paclitaxel. The objectives and purpose of the study will be described to patients
      presenting at the participating infusion centers. The patients will be randomized to receive
      either IV cetirizine HCl or IV diphenhydramine.
