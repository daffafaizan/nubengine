      psychological factors, allergies and gastrointestinal disorders. Among these gastrointestinal
      disorders, are various intestinal parasitic infections.

      Given the controversy surrounding the potential association between bruxism and intestinal
      parasitic infestations, both important health issues, this study sought to evaluate the
      relationship between E. vermicularis infection and bruxism in E. vermicularis-positive and E.
      vermicularis-negative 3-10-year-olds children with bruxism.
