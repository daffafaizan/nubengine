      patency after alterations in posture, unilateral mechanical obstruction, temperature, and
      humidity.

      Eight healthy adult volunteer subjects underwent acoustic rhinometry under the following
      conditions: 1) upright, sitting position (control), 2) supine position, 3) left lateral
      recumbent position, 4) one nostril mechanically blocked, 5) icepack on neck, 6) drinking cold
      water, 7) drinking hot water, 8) nasal nebulizer, 9)oxymetazoline decongestant.

      Changes in nasal cavity volumes were detected by acoustic rhinometry after alterations in
      posture, unilateral mechanical obstruction, temperature, and humidity. Nebulizer treatment
      and hot water ingestion caused a significant decrease in nasal volume. The nose was able to
      adapt to environmental and physiological changes in order to maintain a consistent total
      nasal volume.
