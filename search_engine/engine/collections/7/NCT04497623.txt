      principles of invasive positive pressure mechanical ventilators that have existed for 80
      years. Although the effectiveness of ventilatory assistance in saving human lives was known
      since biblical times, the first mechanical ventilators only appeared in 1800 and it was in
      1900 when the first positive pressure ventilators were manufactured, which have a turning
      point in 1940 as a result of the polio epidemic, when invasive positive pressure mechanical
      ventilators were developed that could be used massively and have evolved to current models.
      These positive pressure fans completely replaced the first negative pressure models, have
      abundant support in the scientific literature, and are the most commonly used today.

      Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Colombia, the University of La Sabana, a
      multidisciplinary team in order to find solutions to deal with the disease, and its first
      project, consisted in the design and manufacture of an invasive mechanical ventilator
      (Ventilator Unisabana-Herons) able to supply the basic ventilatory needs of the patient with
      severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19 at the time when the installed capacity of classic
      commercial mechanical ventilators is exhausted. The Unisabana-Herons ventilator was built
      based on those recommended by INVIMA, the MHRA (UK Medicines and Devices Regulatory Agency)
      and the FDA, to provide efficient and safe volume controlled ventilation to patients with
      indications. of mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure according to the ventilatory
      modes already affected that have strong scientific evidence.

      This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness, usability and safety of the Unisabana-Herons
      ventilator for the management of patients with an indication for invasive mechanical
      ventilatory support, admitted to level III and IV university hospitals with Intensive Care
      services enabled through a cohort study of 5 patients with a 24-hour follow-up.
