      become a common problem in clinical practice and poses high risk to patients. The residual
      curarization incidence of Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) varies very much between
      different studies. These differences indicates the necessity of further study. In China,
      there is no common view of the harmfulness of residual curarization and its complications.
      The consensus on the necessity of neuromuscular transmission monitoring and neuromuscular
      blockade antagonist has not been reached yet. There is also no similar large-scale survey in
      China. In this case, the investigators conduct this large scale multicentre study, which is
      designed to learn the incidence of residual curarization and its complications. Further
      analysis of risk factors will also been made. All these efforts are hoped to fill the data
      gap and provide reliable evidences for rational use of NMBA.
