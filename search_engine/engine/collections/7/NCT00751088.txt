      randomized in three groups (arm 1, arm 2 and arm 3). All patients eligible will undergo
      baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric, clinical, hormonal, ultrasonographic and
      urodynamic evaluations. At time of surgery, all patients will be randomized in three surgical
      treatment groups (arm 1, 2 and 3). Patients of arm 1 will be treated with positioning of
      Ajust (Bard Urological Division, Covington, GA, USA), patients of group 2 will be treated
      with positioning of MiniArc (AMS, Minnetonka, MN, USA) and patients of arm 3 will be treated
      with positioning of TVT Secur System (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).

      During the study, the clinical outcomes, and the adverse experience will be evaluated in each
      patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
