      degeneration and hepatitis in people who do not abuse alcohol. The disease often develops in
      middle-aged women with excessive body weight, increased blood glucose and blood lipids, but
      can occur in all age groups and in both sexes. In most cases, the disease is asymptomatic.
      Laboratory data indicate an increase in the level of aminotransaminases. Ultrasound reveals
      hyperechoic tissue of the liver due to diffuse fatty infiltration. The degree of steatosis
      can also be estimated by a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP - Controlled Attenuation
      Parameter) in the fibroelastometry of liver tissue. It is also possible to verify the degree
      of fibrosis of liver tissue in its presence. Given that the mare's milk has therapeutic and
      dietary properties for various diseases of the internal organs, including liver diseases, the
      investigators decided to study its therapeutic effectiveness in NASH.

      In this clinical study, the effectiveness of mare's milk in NASH will be studied in
      comparison with control groups taking monotherapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and
      combined therapy (mare's milk and UDCA). Patients will receive a sublimated form of mare's
      milk in the appropriate dosage within 2 months, and the results of clinical laboratory and
      instrumental studies will be compared among themselves using statistical methods.
