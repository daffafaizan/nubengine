      patency studies designed to compare the long-term patency of the radial artery to the
      saphenous vein. Between 1996 and 2001, 561 patients were intraoperatively randomized to
      undergo surgery according to one of two strategies: radial-artery grafting to the circumflex
      territory and saphenous-vein grafting to the right coronary artery or radial-artery grafting
      to the right coronary artery and saphenous-vein grafting to the circumflex territory. The
      first study compared the 8-12 month angiographic patency of the radial artery with that of
      the saphenous vein as a conduit for coronary artery bypass and found that radial arteries
      were superior. The primary objective of this current study is to determine the beyond 5-year
      angiographic patency of the radial artery compared with a saphenous vein coronary bypass
      graft.

      HYPOTHESES

        1. The angiographic patency of radial artery grafts studied beyond 5 years following
           surgery exceeds that of saphenous vein grafts.

        2. Radial artery conduits studied beyond 5 years postoperatively have less graft disease
           than saphenous veins.

      SAMPLE SIZE We expect to study 350 patients, which will allow us to test for a 35% risk
      reduction from 23% occlusion rate in saphenous veins to 15% in radial arteries, assuming a 5%
      within-patient correlation, with 80% power for a 2-tailed alpha of 0.05.
