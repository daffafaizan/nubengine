    
      This prospective randomized study was designed to compare between the beginning of sleeve
      gastrectomy 2 cm versus 6 cm from the pylorus with special regards to intraoperative
      problems, weight loss, improvement of comorbidities, postoperative complications, nutritional
      and elemental deficiencies.

      Consecutive patients, who were treated for morbid obesity by laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
      (LSG) at the department of general surgery, Mansoura University, Egypt, during the period
      from January 2008 to January 2012, were eligible for the study. The exclusion criteria
      included patients above 60 or below 18 years old, history of upper laparotomy, unfit for
      anaesthesia or laparoscopy, major psychological instability, and drug abuse.

      The operation was done under general anesthesia. Patient was in supine position with
      splitting of the operating table legs.Gastric transection started 2 cm proximal to the
      pylorus using 60 mm, green endo-stapler (Ethicon, USA) (GI) or 6 cm from the pylorus (G II).
      The following staplers were placed approximately 1 cm from the bougie in the direction of the
      gastroesophageal junction.

      Group I: LSG begin the division 2 cm from the pylorus and Group II: LSG begin the division 6
      cm from the pylorus. The primary outcome measure was the % of excess weight loss (%EWL);
      secondary outcomes included operative time, day to resume oral feeding, postoperative
      morbidity and mortality, improvement of comorbidity.
