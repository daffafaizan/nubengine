      expression differences obtained from their circulating tumor cells between exceptional
      responders and non-responders to standard of care chemotherapy. This study requires a 10 mL
      heparinized peripheral blood sample from each study participant at the time of enrollment to
      isolate, enrich and profile circulating tumor cells. Data analysis of the gene expression
      profile will define genomic patterns using Nearest Template Prediction for a predetermined
      panel of therapeutic agents based on standard of care. Chemotherapy selection is
      physician-choice. Information regarding disease progression will be gathered. Data analysis
      will be performed in study participants in the setting of ongoing disease progression.
