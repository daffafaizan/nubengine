    
      Prior to the patient entering the OR, particle counters (Digital PM2.5 Air Quality detector,
      ExGizmo, China) will ensure that the OR air quality has undergone the appropriate airflow
      exchanges and thus will all read 0.

      Measurements will be taken every 30 seconds. A research assistant in the periphery of the OR
      will observe and record the following events: patient entrance into the OR, initiation of
      mask induction, intubation, rotation of OR table for surgery, initiation of surgery,
      completion of surgery, rotation of OR back to anesthesia, extubation, and patient departure
      from the OR. The particle counters will be positioned accordingly: 1) at the level of the
      patient's head, 2) at the level of the anesthesiologist/surgeon performing the AGMPs, 3) to
      the right of the patient, 4) to the left of the patient, 5) at the anesthesia workstation,
      and 6) at the circulating nurse's computer in the corner of the room. The particle counters
      will continue with measurements until the patient exits the OR. For patients randomized to
      the LEVS group, active suction will be provided through the use of a closed biohazardous
      smoke evacuation system (Neptune 3, Stryker, Michigan, USA) equipped with an internal high
      efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter capable of capturing aerosolized particles as small
      as 0.1 mm with 99.99% efficiency via suction power up to 25 cubic feet per minute air
      exchange. The active suction will be positioned near the patient's airway without interfering
      with the AGMP, and across from the location of the anesthesiologist or surgeon performing the
      AGMP such that no HCW is positioned between the patient's airway and the suction device.
