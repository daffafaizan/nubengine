      pivotal phase III trial with two parallel treatment groups. 15 German hospitals with
      specialised gastroenterology units were expected to participate in the investigation.

      Up to 360 hospital in-patients routinely scheduled to undergo complete colonoscopy were to be
      enrolled one to two days prior to the endoscopic procedure, and to be randomly allocated to
      one of the two treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1. Bowel preparation was performed using equal
      split doses of either low-volume NRL994 (two doses of 1,000 mL each) or high-volume PEG+E
      (two doses of 2,000 mL each). The first dose was to be taken in the evening before the
      procedure, the second dose on the morning of the day of the colonoscopy. The patients
      allocated to NRL994 were asked to drink at least 1L of additional clear liquid in addition to
      the study drug. During colonoscopy the cleansing of each of the five pre-defined gut segments
      was to be assessed by the physician performing the examination, using a 5-level verbal rating
      scale. Videotapes were to be recorded of all procedures in order to allow central review by a
      blinded and independent expert panel whose ratings were the primary basis for the analysis of
      efficacy. The patients enrolled in the study were asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning
      the acceptability of the preparation. A patient's participation in the study was terminated
      upon completion of the intervention by performing a final examination and filling in the
      study termination page. No interim analysis was to be performed.
