    
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blinded, controlled study in up to 700 males and
      non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. The study is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and
      immunogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur
      administered to healthy adults at different dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose)
      given with MF59 adjuvant manufactured by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics and without
      adjuvant (15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose and 45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL dose). The A/H7N9 vaccine was
      made with HA antigen derived from the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of 7 groups (up to 100 subjects per group) to receive two doses of the
      A/H7N9 vaccine with and without MF59 adjuvant delivered intramuscularly approximately 21 days
      apart. The same dosage of A/H7N9 vaccine will be given to subjects at both their first and
      second study vaccinations. The primary objectives are to: 1) assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine following receipt of two doses
      administered with and without MF59 adjuvant; and 2) assess new-onset chronic medical
      conditions following receipt of two doses of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine
      administered with and without MF59 adjuvant. The duration of the study for each subject will
      be approximately 13 months.
