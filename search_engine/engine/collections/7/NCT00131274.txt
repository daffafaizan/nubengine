    
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, randomized phase 2 study
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) in the treatment of
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). One-hundred- twenty patients will be enrolled in the
      trial in total. Subjects must have a diagnosis made by HRCT showing definite or probable IPF
      and clinical symptoms consistent with IPF with onset between 3 and 36 months prior to
      screening. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Gleevec 600 mg orally or
      placebo, once per day for approximately 2 years. The primary efficacy will be progression
      defined as a greater than 10% decline in the forced vital capacity or death. Measures of
      safety will include all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study
      medication. All adverse events and serious adverse events will be separately tabulated and
      mapped to a standard classification system and grouped by body system. Any serious adverse
      events that occur during the trial and 30 days after the end of therapy will be reported to
      the FDA within 24 hours and followed to outcome.
