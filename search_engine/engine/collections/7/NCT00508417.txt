      Infants will be identified during a village-wide census and at Expanded Program for
      Immunization (EPI) visits. After obtaining community consent, eligible infants' parents will
      be invited to bring infants to the clinic for screening. Enrolled infants will receive a
      baseline evaluation and monthly visits during the rainy season at which times they will
      receive interim evaluations and heel, toe, or finger pricks for determinations of hemoglobin,
      thick and thin blood films, malaria antibody titers (at first and last visit for each
      transmission season), and hemoglobin typing at one visit. Study subjects will also receive a
      weekly home visit to determine if they are well or ill. If ill or febrile at any visit, or if
      they present to the clinic for an unscheduled visit, subjects will receive a history and
      physical examination, heel, toe, or finger pricks for determinations of hemoglobin, thick and
      thin blood films, filter paper blood collection and an RDT for malaria. Diagnosis and
      treatment of malaria will be performed according to Mali National Malaria Control Program
      (NMCP) guidelines. Diagnosis and treatment of other conditions will be performed as
      determined by the treating clinician.
