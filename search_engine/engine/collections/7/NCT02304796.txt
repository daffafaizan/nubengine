      psychotherapies for mixed anxiety disorders: 1. unified cognitive-behavioral protocol,
      adapted to a group format. 2. combined cognitive-behavioral and dance/movement therapy.

      24 patients will be randomized to 1 of the two treatment arms and treated with 20 weekly
      1.5-2 hours therapy sessions. Independent evaluator and self-reports measures will be
      collected at intake, pre-treatment, session by session, post-treatment and and follow-up.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Both groups will show effectiveness, as revealed by reduction in anxiety severity and
           increase in valued living.

        2. Changes in process measures (proposed mechanism of change - emotion regulation, working
           alliance, fear of bodily sensations, bodily/movement awareness) will be predictive of
           change in outcome measures (anxiety severity and valued living).

        3. Changes in bodily/movement awareness will be more predictive of change in outcome
           measures in the CBT-DMT group than in the unified protocol group.
