    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, overall survival, and disease-free survival of
      patients with refractory or relapsed germ cell carcinoma treated with high-dose induction
      chemotherapy comprising carboplatin and etoposide followed by autologous bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell rescue.

      OUTLINE: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow is harvested. Patients
      receive carboplatin IV continuously and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days -5 through -3.
      Autologous PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on day 0.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
