      evaluated once for serum levels of cell adhesion molecules, chemokines and vascular
      endothelial growth factor. This study may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis
      of diabetic retinopathy and the identifying of possible targets for treatment. All study
      participants will undergo an ocular exam and ophthalmic photography. Blood is drawn for the
      analysis of these serum factors.
