      will be tried to clarify whether the patients have had ACS before, according to their
      history, ecg echo and coronary angiography findings. Patients with previous ACS or uncertain
      ACS diagnosis will not be included in the study.

      In the second stage, cardiovascular risk burdens of patients for whom the initial ACS
      diagnosis is clear will be revealed. Smoking, DM, HT, psychological stress, socio-economic
      status, migration history, cholesterol parameters will be determined. The duration and
      severity of these risk factors will be determined. In the final model, each risk factor will
      be examined in detail with its sub-tabs and the effect of each risk factor will be examined
      separately.

      Eventually, a model will be developed that allows predicting the first ACS age. The
      shortcomings of this model and the narrow scope of the definition of the population will be
      determined and the direction will be determined for the studies that improve these points.
