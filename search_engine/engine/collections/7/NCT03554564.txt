    
      This is a two center, non-blinded, 2 period randomized crossover trial. 50 patient subjects
      are planned. Patient participants will be identified and recruited from clinical environments
      (including clinics and diagnostic testing departments) at participating sites. Diagnosis and
      testing will occur through usual clinical care, and participants will not incur financial
      costs related to participation. A crossover design will be utilized, where all participants
      will use the VOICE platform with activity tracking for 35 days and usual care for 30 days.
      Randomization will determine the order in which participation in the VOICE phase versus the
      usual care phase occur. Randomization will occur using a closed envelope system. For patients
      in the VOICE platform group, data collection will occur over a total of 35 days, including an
      initial 5-day "run in" period during which participants will orient themselves to the system.
      Each provider participant will receive a single end-user survey evaluating VOICE from their
      perspective.

      Screening of patients electronic medical records will be done to determine subject
      eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria will be approached to participate.

      Total duration of subject participation will be 9 weeks during the control and intervention
      phases, with a final follow-up survey at 6 months post-enrollment.
