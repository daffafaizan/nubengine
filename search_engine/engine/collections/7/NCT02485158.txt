      three different drugs from different classes. This study used a within-subjects design (total
      N = 24). All subjects received alcohol, amphetamine and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in
      a double-blind, double-dummy fashion. Subjects completed six sessions wherein they received
      either alcohol, amphetamine, or THC, or corresponding placebos, on separate days. Subjects
      completed questionnaires about mood, general drug effects, and specific drug effects.
