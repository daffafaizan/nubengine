      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we assessed the utility of graded histologic regression of <50% as
      the criterion of treatment change. Sixty patients will be enrolled to randomize into two
      groupsï¼šreceiving modified chemotherapy and receiving the original chemotherapy. Overall
      survival and disease-free survival will be observed between two groups.
