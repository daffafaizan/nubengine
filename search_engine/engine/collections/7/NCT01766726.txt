      than healthy subjects. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly increased the lifespan of
      HIV+ patients, but their risk of CVD remains higher than normal. Previously, it has been
      shown that compared to healthy control subjects, ART-treated HIV+ patients have more
      atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in the aorta. This study is intended to determine whether
      atherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability is increased in ART-na√Øve HIV+ patients and
      whether these parameters can be improved through 6 months of newly-initiated QUAD/Stribild
      therapy. Additionally, the study will determine whether indices of immune dysregulation and
      lipid dysfunction are increased in ART-naive HIV+ patients and whether these parameters can
      also be improved through 6 months of newly initiated QUAD/Stribild therapy.
