    
      This study is a prospective cohort study involving females who present to one of two
      emergency departments (ED) between the ages of 16 and 18, who are at risk of unintended
      pregnancy.

      Our primary objective is to assess intention to initiate contraception ("high"=very/somewhat
      likely vs "low"=unsure/not likely/definitely not on Likert scale survey) among females aged
      15 to 18 years who receive emergency department-based contraceptive counseling.

      Our secondary objectives are as follows:

        1. Among the same population, assess completion of a referral for any contraceptive care,
           defined as attendance at a referral site within 4 weeks after the index ED visit.

        2. Assess the proportion who ultimately initiate contraception through electronic medical
           record documentation (i.e., visit note, procedure note, medication review) and
           participant report (follow-up calls).

        3. Use qualitative interview methodology to explore attitudes, barriers, and facilitators
           that affect decisions to A) express intention to initiate contraception, B) complete a
           referral for contraceptive care, and C) ultimately initiate contraception among this
           unique group of high-risk adolescents.
