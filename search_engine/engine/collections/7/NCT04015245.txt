      common primary liver cancer. There are a variety of therapies for treatment of HCC; among
      them, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of the most commonly used treatment
      modalities. TACE induces ischemic tumor necrosis by obstruction of hepatic artery blood flow
      and exerts an anticancer effect via chemotherapeutic agents such as adriamycin or cisplatin
      mixed with Lipiodol. In the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
      guidelines for the management of HCC, TACE is recommended for patients with
      intermediate-stage HCC according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system,
      because TACE was found to improve survival compared with the best supportive care in patients
      with unresectable HCC. Although TACE is the established standard of care only for
      intermediate-stage HCC, in recent years, TACE has been used widely even in treatment of
      advanced-stage HCC. The most frequent side effects of TACE are fever, nausea, and abdominal
      pain, and these side effects are self-limiting in the majority of patients. However, acute
      deterioration of hepatic function following TACE is a potentially life-threatening
      complication that occasionally interferes with continuation of TACE in patients with HCC.
      Although TACE has marked direct antitumor effects, it can also result in more complications
      than conservative management, because the ischemic damage caused by TACE can influence not
      only tumor tissue but non-tumorous liver tissue.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of
      SNMC on acute deterioration of hepatic function following TACE.
