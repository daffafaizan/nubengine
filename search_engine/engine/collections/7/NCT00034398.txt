      dysfunction of GABA-ergic neurons causing disinhibition originating in basal ganglia, and
      involving thalamus, frontal and prefrontal cortices and contributing to tic generation.

      The major inhibitory neurotransmitter in central nervous system is gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA), which acts mainly through the GABA A receptors. Pathological processes involving
      GABA-ergic neurons cause alterations in the density of GABA A receptors of the targeted
      neurons. These changes can be visualized and measured with Positron Emission Tomography using
      as a radioactive ligand [11C] flumazenil. We will examine changes in the density and
      distribution of GABA A receptors in 17 adult patients with a DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric
      Association 2000) diagnosis of a tic disorder and 17 control subjects. This study should
      provide new information concerning localization and degree of dysfunction of GABA-ergic
      neurons in areas involved in Tourette's syndrome, which, in turn, might open new
      possibilities in pharmacological treatment of this disorder.
