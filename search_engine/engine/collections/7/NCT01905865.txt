      efficacy among parents of children with undiagnosed medical conditions. There are many
      dimensions to uncertainty when there is no identified cause for a condition that affects one
      s child. They include illness identity, management, longevity and life planning, the meaning
      of the child s condition for the family and both the child s and the family s social
      connections. How parents of children with undiagnosed medical conditions appraise, cope and
      ultimately adapt to their child s condition in light of this uncertainty is largely
      unexplored. While high levels of perceived uncertainty may be seen as a threat to adaptation,
      there is evidence that parents find hope and opportunity in the uncertainty. The literature
      suggests that many factors affect how uncertainty is appraised, and higher levels of coping
      self-efficacy are associated with more effective coping and ultimately better adaptation.
      There is no research that systematically assesses the dimensions of uncertainty perceived by
      parents and whether overall perceptions of uncertainty or particular subsets are associated
      with coping efficacy. Further, personality traits, such as tolerance of uncertainty and
      resilience, may moderate these unexplored relationships. This study s conceptual framework is
      based on Lazarus and Folkman s Transactional Model of Stress and Coping and Mishel s
      Perceived Uncertainty in Illness Theory. A cross-sectional survey design will be used to
      quantitatively assess the relationships between dimensions of uncertainty and coping
      efficacy. Participants will be recruited through online support groups, website postings, and
      listservs. They will have the option of completing either a paper or online version of the
      survey.
