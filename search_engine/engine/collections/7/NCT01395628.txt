        -  Demonstrate the capability of primary human leukemia samples to survive and proliferate
           in the zebrafish embryo.

        -  Confirm the anti-proliferative or toxic effects of known chemotherapeutics on the
           transplanted cells in vivo.

        -  Evaluate the effect of novel anticancer drugs and/or their combinations on individual
           samples.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Cryopreserved specimens are injected into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos under anesthesia.
      After 1 hour of recovery at 28° C, embryos are maintained at 38° C and screened for
      fluorescence at the injection site. Within 48 hours post-injection, some embryos are treated
      with various chemotherapeutic drugs or dimethyl sulfoxide and incubated in protease solution.
      Proliferation of leukemia cells are monitored by live-cell microscopy. Cells with or without
      drug treatment are then extracted at 24 and 72 hours post-injection. Leukemia cells are
      counted and tested with imatinib mesylate, all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin), cytosine
      arabinose, and known bioactive chemical compounds from promising drug families, such as
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antiapoptotic agents, channel modulators, and prostaglandin
      agonists.
