      therapy for chronic prostatitis with other classes of antibacterials resulted in poor
      outcomes and prolonged time taking the medication. Levofloxacin belongs to the quinolone
      class of antibacterials and has been used to treat chronic prostatitis with 500mg of
      levofloxacin taken orally once a day for 4 weeks. This multicenter, double-blind (neither the
      patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage),
      randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance) study is designed to
      see if giving levofloxacin at a higher dose for shorter periods of time is safe and effective
      in treating chronic prostatitis. Safety analyses will involve the examination of the
      incidence, severity, and type of adverse events and changes in physical findings including
      vital signs and clinical laboratory tests. Patients will receive one of the following three
      dosing options: levofloxacin 750 mg orally administered once-a-day for 2 weeks followed by
      placebo once-a-day for two weeks for a total of 4 weeks, or levofloxacin 750 mg orally
      once-a-day for 3 weeks followed by placebo once-a-day for one week for a total of 4 weeks, or
      levofloxacin 500 mg orally once-a-day for 4 weeks.
