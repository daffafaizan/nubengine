      heart rhythm disturbances.

      Fluoroscopy is the imaging modality routinely used for cardiac device implantation and
      electrophysiological procedures.Due to the rising concern regarding the harmful effects of
      radiation exposure to both the patients and operation staffs, novel 3D mapping systems have
      been developed and implemented in electrophysiological procedure for the navigation of
      catheters inside the heart chambers.

      Ensite NavX system can be used for cardiac imaging as a reliable and safe zero-fluoroscopy
      approach for implantation of single- or dual-chamber permanent pacemaker in patients. Our
      method offered a choice for some special population of patient in whom radiation exposure
      need to be avoided or in the extreme circumstances when the X-ray machine is out-of-order.
