      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           pancreatic cancer treated with cetuximab, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the complete response and partial response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV
      over 100 minutes on day 1, and oxaliplatin IV over 2-4 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
