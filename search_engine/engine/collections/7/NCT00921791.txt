    
      Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) and Pharmaceutical care have been proposed to improve
      therapeutic compliance and to guide treatment decisions, but their effects on BP control are
      still under debate.

      This is a factorial randomized controlled trial including adult hypertensive patients under
      drug treatment but with office BP and 24h ABPM uncontrolled. Participants will be allocated
      to one of four groups: HBPM; HBPM and Pharmaceutical care; Pharmaceutical care; or control.
      All participants will receive usual care for high blood pressure. Participants will be
      followed for 60 days.
