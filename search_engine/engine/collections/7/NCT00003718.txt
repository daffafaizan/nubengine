      patients with unresectable, stage IV, or recurrent soft tissue sarcoma who have failed no
      more than 2 prior treatment regimens. II. Determine the clinical and laboratory toxicities,
      as well as patient tolerance, of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), prior
      surgery (yes vs no), prior radiotherapy (yes vs no), and prior chemotherapy regimens (0 vs 1
      vs 2). Patients receive oral temozolomide every 12 hours for 5 days. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks for at least 18 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 18 months, every 6 months for the next 18
      months, and then annually thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
