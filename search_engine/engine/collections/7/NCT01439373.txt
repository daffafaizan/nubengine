      disease. New medications are needed that are better tolerated and offer a greater chance of
      achieving sustained viral clearance compared to currently available therapy. GSK2336805 is a
      HCV NS5A inhibitor being developed for the treatment of subjects with CHC. This Phase II,
      double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will assess the safety, antiviral
      activity, and pharmacokinetics of GSK2336805 alone and in combination with peginterferon alfa
      2a and ribavirin in subjects with CHC. Subjects will be randomly allocated on a 2:1 basis to
      GSK2336805 or matching placebo and will be stratified by IL28B status and HCV viral genotype
      (genotype 1 or 4). The study consists of 2 parts. In Part 1, GSK2336805 or matching placebo
      will be given as single-dose monotherapy (Day 1). In Part 2, GSK2336805 or matching placebo
      will be co-administered with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin through 4 weeks of treatment
      (Days 2 to 28). After completion of Part 2, GSK2336805/matching placebo will be discontinued
      and subjects will be offered continued standard-of-care anti-HCV therapy.
