      toward trauma- related stimuli, subjective and emotional processing to a range of trauma-and
      non-trauma-related images and physiological reactivity to these stimuli in individuals with
      CUD and PTSD. Importantly, this study will also probe the abuse related potential of nabilone
      compared to smoked cannabis in this population, a critical aspect in determining the
      potential feasibility for its use clinically to treat CUD in PTSD populations. The effects of
      nabilone will be compared to propranolol as a positive control.
