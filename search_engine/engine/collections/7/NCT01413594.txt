    
      A new treatment involving bimanual (Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy (HABIT). The
      protocols have been developed at Columbia University to be child friendly and draws upon our
      experience since 1997 with constraint-induced movement therapy in children with cerebral
      palsy. The investigators developed HABIT in 2004 as an alternative to constraint-therapy that
      avoids use of a restraint. The interventions are performed in a 15 day day-camp setting with
      several children and at least one therapist per child. The investigators have conducted 24
      day camps to date since 2002, and are now collaborating with clinicians worldwide to expand
      our treatment availability. The aim is to promote the use of and improve the coordination of
      movement of both hands together. PARTICIPATION IS FREE. Please check out our website for more
