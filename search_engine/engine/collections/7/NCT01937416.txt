      of patients and currently the effective treatment for the disease is lacking. Bone marrow
      mononuclear cells have been proved to have multiple functions including the differentiation
      and proliferation. In animal model, bone marrow mononuclear cells could induce angiogenesis
      and may have therapeutic usage for ischemia disease. The investigators thereby design the
      study to investigate the possible therapy of diabetic lower limb ischemia with autologous
      bone marrow mononuclear cells. Patient with diabetic lower limb ischemia was treated with
      colony stimulating factor for improvement of bone marrow hematopoiesis. Then bone marrow was
      taken and mononuclear cells were isolated with deleting erythrocyte by density gradient
      centrifugation. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were transplanted into ischemia regions of
      lower limb through intramuscular injection. The investigators investigated the safety of the
      therapy with life signs like temperature, pulse, blood pressure, routine analysis of blood
      and urine etc. post the transplantation. And the efficacy was evaluated with the measurement
      of ulcer size, rest pain score, cold sensation score, resting ABI, resting TcPO2, collateral
      vessel score and skin microcirculation.
