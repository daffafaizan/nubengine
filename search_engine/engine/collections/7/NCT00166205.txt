      weight loss when more conservative measures, such as diet and exercise have failed. Not only
      can weight loss be achieved, but also reduction / resolution of a patient's co-morbidities
      associated with excess weight. Adjustable gastric banding provides a less invasive,
      reversible bariatric surgery option. The SAGB has been commercially available outside the
      United States for this indication since 1996. Commercial availability has led to extensive
      literature supporting the safety and effectiveness of the SAGB. Given the available
      literature, a prospective, single arm, multicenter, study in a heterogeneous population of
      morbidly obese subjects in the U.S. is being conducted.
