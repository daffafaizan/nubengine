    
      90 patients aged 18-65 years, of both genders, who have incurred cognitive deficits after
      frontal brain damage will be recruited in the neurosurgery department in Xiangya hospital.
      All focal lesions were confined to the frontal brain, which is verified by CT or MRI.
      Cognitive deficits will be diagnosed using the Chinese version of the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA-C). All eligible recruited patients will be randomly divided into two groups
      in a 2:1 ratio. Participants will receive a battery of cognitive tests at baseline and again
      after 4 and 12 weeks to determine the effect of sulforaphane on cognition. T1-weighted brain
      magnetic resonance images and resting-state functional MRI will be carried out using 3 Tesla
      (3T) brain MRI at these timepoints. Brain magnetic resonance spectrum will be applied to
      detect MRI markers of brain metabolites and gut microbiota will also be assessed over this
      period.
