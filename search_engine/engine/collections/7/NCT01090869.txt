      underwent a panel of tests:

        -  Cardio respiratory fitness

        -  blood pressure

        -  anthropometric measures

      At baseline and after the intervention a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp were performed to
      asses insulin sensitivity.

      Tissue and blood samples were also collected for further analysis:

        -  Total-protein analysis of selected proteins

        -  Fasting plasma glucose, insulin and free fatty acids
