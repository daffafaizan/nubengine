      which was characterized by repetitive events of complete and partial obstructions of the
      upper airway. The pathogenesis of OSA is interacted by multiple factors, primarily including
      upper airway (UA) anatomic impairment, ventilatory drive instability, and oropharyngeal
      muscle dysfunction. However, studies have proven prior oropharyngeal exercise was designed
      for those OSA patients with oropharyngeal muscle dysfunction. Unlike prior oropharyngeal
      exercise, comprehensive rehabilitation should emphasize the cardiorespiratory regulation
      capability in addition to oropharyngeal function.

      OBJECTIVES: Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore both the clinical and
      biological effects of our comprehensive rehabilitation, we used PSG data as clinical effect
      and biomarker of inflammation expression as biological effect.

      METHODS: Thirty subjects with moderate or severe OSA (AHIâ‰¥15) were randomized into
      intervention group (N=15) and control group (N=15). In intervention group, a
      12-week-intervention of out-patient rehabilitation program included oropharyngeal muscle
      training, threshold respiratory muscle training, and therapeutic exercise.

      ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The preliminary results would demonstrate promisingly clinical effects
      and biological effects of our comprehensive rehabilitation model. Therefore, the further
      studies should emphasize the methods to differentiate diagnosis for the indicated patients
      with oropharyngeal muscle dysfunction or ventilatory drive instability.
