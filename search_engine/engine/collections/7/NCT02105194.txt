      decompression illness. This study is a retrospective review of the PI's experience using
      SPECT brain imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of all phases of cerebral decompression
      illness over the past two decades. The purpose of the study is to see if the functional
      imaging is consistent with the clinical condition and cognitive testing. Chart review of
      symptoms, and physical exam findings will be compared before and after treatment to SPECT
      brain imaging radiological readings to assess concordance.
