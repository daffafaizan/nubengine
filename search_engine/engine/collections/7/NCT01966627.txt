      nutritional factors) that might affect the expression and progression of NAFLD. This study
      will determine genetic markers and their ability to convey susceptibility to NAFLD in obese
      children and adolescents. Furthermore, potential mechanisms that might contribute to the
      accumulation of hepatic Triglyceride (TG) accumulation will be, for the first time, assessed
      by genotyping. Additionally, we will examine the presence of intestinal microbiome in the
      development of fatty liver through stool collection.
