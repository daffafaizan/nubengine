      prevalence of germline mutations in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Thirty two
      genes will be analyzed, all of which have been associated with an increased risk for cancer.
      The genes are included on CancerNextTM a multi-gene next generation sequencing and array CGH
      test. The 32 genes include: APC, ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, BMPR1A, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A,
      CHEK2, EPCAM, GREM1, MLH1, MRE11A, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, NF1, PALB2, PMS2, POLD1, POLE,
      PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMAD4, SMARCA4, STK11, and TP53 .
