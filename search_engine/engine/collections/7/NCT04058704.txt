      of brain metastases, and most patients died due to the progression of brain metastases. Some
      research show that icotinib combined with radiation therapy can improve the efficiency of
      NSCLC with brain metastases, but there is still controversial about the timing of radiation
      therapy intervention . This study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled
      trial of icotinib combined with early intervention or late intervention radiation therapy for
      NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation with brain metastases. They will be treated with
      icotinib and divided into 2 groups. Group 1: the radiation therapy will start within 1 month
      after icotinib treatment; Group2: the patients will be treated with icotinib first, radiation
      therapy intervene if disease progress.
