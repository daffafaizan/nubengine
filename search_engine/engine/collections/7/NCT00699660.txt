      CAPS and WHODAS-II interviews versus the PTSD exams conducted without the CAPS and WHODAS-II
      interviews. This project will conduct a randomized controlled trial on 688 veterans to
      evaluate the effects of the CAPS/WHODAS instruments on the initial PTSD C&P examination
      process. Study outcomes include variation in assessing the DSM-IV components of PTSD,
      diagnostic accuracy, veteran perception of the exam process, VBA rater utility and resource
      utilization. This project will 1) demonstrate the feasibility of conducting program
      evaluation and intervention studies on the PTSD C&P examination process, 2) develop research
      tools, instruments and methods for C&P evaluation, 3) provide data on the value-added
      contribution of CAPS and WHODAS-II to the PTSD assessment process and examination report, and
      4) inform the business case of utilizing the CAPS and WHODAS-II in the PTSD C&P process. The
      ultimate aim is to improve the reproducibility, consistency and validity of the PTSD
      examination process while maintaining a level of efficiency and cost restraint that provides
      veterans with an exam process that is fair, accurate and equitable across VHA.
