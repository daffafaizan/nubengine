    
      The purpose of this research is to validate technique on a commonly used medical bone scan,
      called positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) along with sodium fluoride
      as the tracer for determining blood flow to the bone. Up to 12 subjects will have PET/CT
      scans so that we can determine the repeatability and reliability of the images prior to using
      PET/CT for this use on subjects in the Phase 1b part of Dr. Nancy Lane's clinical research
      study entitled "A Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Single and Multiple
      Ascending Dose Study of the Safety and Tolerability of Intravenous LLP2A-Alendronate in Adult
      Men and Women with Osteopenia Secondary to Glucocorticoids" (IRB Protocol #866350).
