      specific chemotherapeutic regime, baseline and subsequent PET/CT scans can be used to
      quantitatively determine the therapeutic effect of the regime, using the standard uptake
      value (SUV), a common metric in PET imaging. The breast PET/CT system will facilitate
      molecular imaging of breast cancer using a number of radiolabeled molecules, available both
      commercially (18-FDG) and from the research environment.
