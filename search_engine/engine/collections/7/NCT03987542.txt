      asparaginase associated toxicities still constitutes a significant problem as they, besides
      causing acute morbidity and mortality, can cause truncation of treatment with a subsequent
      increased risk of relapse.

      The most frequent toxicities causing asparaginase truncations are hypersensitivity,
      pancreatitis and thrombosis. Especially hypersensitivity constitutes a problem due to
      silencing antibodies, not only in patients with clinical hypersensitivity but also in
      patients without clinical symptoms (silent inactivation).

      In the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol asparaginase associated toxicities and truncation of
      asparaginase have been registered since the protocol opened in 2008. In addition asparaginase
      enzyme activity measurements have been done before every asparaginase administration and
      analyzed retrospectively.

      The primary aim of this study was to investigate if patients with truncation of asparaginase
      or lack of asparaginase enzyme activity had a different risk of relapse compared to patients
      who received full asparaginase treatment. Secondary we aimed to explore if patients who
      received less than 50% of their planned asparaginase dosages had a different risk of relapse
      compared to those who received 50% or more.
