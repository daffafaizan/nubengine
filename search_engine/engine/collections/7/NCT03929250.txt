        1. To assess the bioavailability and rate of clearance of Centella asiatica derived
           compounds in the plasma and urine of cognitively healthy elders over 12 hours.

        2. To determine the acute tolerability of a Centella asiatica product in cognitively
           healthy elders.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will orally consume a single administration of a standardized Centella asiatica
      water extract product (CAP). Two doses (2g and 4g CAW) will be administered on separate
      occasions, at least two weeks apart. The levels of known bioactive compounds present in
      Centella asiatica will be measured in human plasma and urine over 12 hours after
      administration of each of the doses.
