      infection rates among this group are increasing. The overall goal of the proposed Phase II
      application is to develop a culturally-sensitive, gender-specific, and age-appropriate HIV
      prevention intervention for older women, especially African American and Latino women who are
      at disproportionally high risk for HIV/STD infection. The target population is the growing
      number of divorced/separated older women for whom interventions have not been developed and,
      due to cohort and social contextual factors, are likely unaware that they are at risk, and
      more likely than single (never married) women to forgo condom use. Building on Phase I and
      ARRA study results, the Phase II objectives are to create, test, and commercialize a positive
      psychology-based "SmartWeb" intervention to promote wellbeing and safe sex practices among
      culturally diverse older divorced or separated women who are dating or planning on dating.
      Specific Phase II Aims are: 1) Create the SmartWeb intervention; 2) Evaluate its
      effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of divorced/separated women over 50; and
      3) Prepare marketing and commercialization plans for the SmartWeb intervention.

      Consistent with Phase I objectives, i.e., developing content to address Stages 1-3 of the
      M-AARM theoretical model, the proposed Phase II includes new components to address M-AARM
      Stages 4-5. The Phase II is also responsive to Phase I evaluation findings, including the
      desire for mobile access, membership; video interviews with experts in women's health,
      positive aging, HIV/STD prevention in culturally diverse communities, safe sex negotiation
      strategies, and gray divorce; online community, and positive psychology- based self-efficacy
      and affect-boosting emails, as well as expanded versions of Phase I components to reinforce
      stages 1-3 of the M-ARRM theoretical model.

      The investigators are supported in these efforts through partnerships in both Boston, MA and
      Columbia SC, the sites for the randomized controlled trial. Participating partners include
      those providing commercialization support (Global Protection Corp, USC Columbia Incubator, SC
      Launch, Moker CPCA), recruitment and marketing support in Boston (New England Association of
      HIV over 50, Massachusetts Department of Public Health Statewide Consumer Advisory Board on
      HIV/AIDS, Brigham & Women's Hospital Women's Health Center) and in Columbia (South Carolina

      Carolina, Lowcountry AIDS Services, United Way Association of South Carolina, South Carolina
      Primary Care Association, Columbia Housing Authority in South Carolina, Palmetto AIDS Life
      Support Services), and content and technology development and support (University of South
