      alternative non-surgical option for using their Baha Sound Processor. The subjects will be
      tested with there existing Baha Sound Processor on the SoftBand and will then be fitted with
      the Baha SoundArc where they will perform a one month take home trial. At the end of this
      trial, the subject will return for testing and evaluation of their experience with this new
      fitting option.
