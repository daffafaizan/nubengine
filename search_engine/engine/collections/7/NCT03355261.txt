      110 patients with local advanced breast cancer. Patients underwent breast surgery and total
      axillary lymph node dissection following 2-6 cycles of NAC. The distribution by
      intercostobrachial nerves (ICBN) of positive nodes, black-stained nodes and lymphovascular
      invasion was investigated by response to NAC.
