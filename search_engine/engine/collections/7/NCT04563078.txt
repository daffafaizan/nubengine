    
      Posttraumatic stress disorder is a psychiatric disorder that can develop in response to a
      traumatic event, and half of civilians living in inner-city areas with high levels of
      violence suffer from PTSD. The currently recommended treatment for PTSD is focused on
      discussing the trauma, but a third to half of patients cannot participate or do not benefit
      from this treatment, especially individuals with low levels of education or literacy.
      Therefore, new treatments for PTSD are needed.

      The study will (1) assess feasibility of a TMS treatment in an underserved population; (2)
      determine if this TMS treatment protocol improves PTSD symptoms and biological markers of
      PTSD such as brain functioning and startle responses; (3) define new brain targets for future
      TMS studies; (4) provide the first data for individual differences, which will help
      personalize treatment for PTSD patients; (5) improve knowledge of the neurobiology of PTSD
      and treatment response.
