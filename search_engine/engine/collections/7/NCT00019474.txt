      advanced or advanced gastrointestinal malignancy treated with intravenous hydroxyurea,
      fluorouracil, interferon alfa, and filgrastim (G-CSF). II. Determine the toxic effects of
      this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the reversal of toxic effects of this regimen
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to site of primary disease (hepatobiliary vs
      gastric vs pancreatic). Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 48 hours and hydroxyurea IV
      over 48 hours on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Patients also receive interferon alfa subcutaneously
      (SC) on days 1, 3, and 5 and filgrastim (G-CSF) SC on days 3-6 of weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-60 patients (18-33 with hepatobiliary or gastric cancer and
      13-27 with pancreatic cancer) will be accrued for this study.
