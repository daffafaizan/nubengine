    
      Migraine prevention is an area of a large unmet medical need, with existing therapies often
      having modest efficacy and poor tolerability. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor
      antagonism is a novel approach to migraine preventive therapy. Erenumab is a human monoclonal
      antibody against canonical CGRP receptor. The present study is a phase 3 trial intended to
      assess the efficacy and safety of erenumab for prevention of migraine in Japanese adults with
      episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM).

      The study consists of a screening period (up to 7 weeks, including a 4-week baseline period),
      a 24-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP), a 28-week open-label treatment period (OLTP),
      and an 8-week safety follow-up period (12 weeks after the last dose of investigational
      product).
