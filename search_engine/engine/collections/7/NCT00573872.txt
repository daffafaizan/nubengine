      especially the spinal cord. Motion and QA study will determine intrafraction motion for phase
      II portion of the study.

      Dose prescription to tumor is based upon maximal dose received by 0.5 cc of spinal cord and
      whether patient has had prior radiation therapy to that area:

      Phase I - Motion and QA Study: 20-25 Gy in 5 fractions/10-20 patients/previous RT = <50% CTV
      dose/No previous RT = <80% CTV dose.

      Phase II - 9-24 Gy in 1 fraction/30 total in order to have 20 evaluable patients (15 patients
      with prior RT and 15 without prior RT/previous RT = 8 Gy/No previous RT = 10 Gy.

      # Motion and QA study will treat CTV to 20-25 Gy in 5 fractions to study intrafraction motion
      for QA of single fraction administration. This will define treatment margins for single
      fraction radiosurgery.

      *Previous RT:

        -  greater than six months since completion of RT

        -  at least 20 Gy, but no more than 50 Gy
