      referred to as the MILD™ procedure. This percutaneous procedure is performed under
      fluoroscopic image guidance through a dorsal approach to the spine. Lumbar decompression is
      performed through the removal of tissue and bone, where indicated. All procedures are
      conducted in accordance with the product labeling and indications for use. A minimum of ten
      up to a maximum of twenty-five adult patients will be enrolled and followed for a period of
      up to 6 months. Patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis who meet the study
      enrollment criteria will be offered the MILD™ procedure as an alternative to surgery or
      continued standard non-surgical medical management.
