      of biomedical, behavioral and community-level HIV prevention interventions and services for
      men who have sex with men (MSM) in Africa. Experience implementing the prevention
      interventions and preliminary data collected regarding the acceptability of the HIV
      prevention package will be used to develop a proposal to design a larger efficacy trial to
      test the combination HIV prevention package for MSM.
