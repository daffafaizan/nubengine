      medication was addressed. Current therapeutic approaches include cyclosporine reduction or
      discontinuation. It is unclear whether discontinuation of low dose cyclosporine also has a
      beneficial effect, i.e. is there a threshold effect for cyclosporine nephrotoxicity?

      Study Design: Heart transplant patients with a moderate degree of renal failure on low dose
      cyclosporine were randomized to either a) no change; or b) discontinuation of cyclosporine
      and initiation of rapamycin immunosuppression.

      Read-Out: Renal function after 6 months; tolerability; and safety were assessed.
