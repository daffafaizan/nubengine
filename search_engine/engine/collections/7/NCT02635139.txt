    
      The duration of the study is 7 days including 3 days with controlled diet and 4 days
      (including 5 nights) in a metabolic chamber at the Institute of Nutritional Medicine at the
      University of Hohenheim.

      The study phase in the metabolic chamber consists of (i) 1 day with 3 meals/day = baseline
      day, (ii) 1 day with breakfast skipping, (iii) 1 day with dinner skipping, (iv) 1 washout day
      where the subjects leave the chamber between 7 a.m. until 7 p.m..

      Beginning on the 3rd study day macronutrient and energy intake as well as the fasting periods
      are kept constant. To achieve comparable conditions the washout day is setted before the
      baseline day.
