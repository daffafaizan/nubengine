      research targeting high school students, and particularly underrepresented minorities, in
      order to increase the entry and success of these students into careers in clinical research.

      Through the components listed in the brief summary, we hope to promote a career in clinical
      research among high achieving minority students. To determine whether TEACH research
      generates these benefits, we will recruit a larger number of candidates interested in the
      TEACH research than we have spots, then randomly assign students to TEACH Research or the
      standard more didactic enrichment programs already included in the Collegiate Scholars
      Program. In addition to determine the overall efficacy of the program, we will study how
      aspects of the program, including the didactic components, mentored research experience, and
      work experience, and characteristics of the student affect the development of the knowledge,
      attitudes, and behaviors needed for a career in clinical research.
