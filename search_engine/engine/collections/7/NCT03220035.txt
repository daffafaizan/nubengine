      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with vemurafenib with advanced solid tumors (including central
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor activating BRAF
      V600 mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with vemurafenib
      with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that
      harbor activating BRAF V600 mutations.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of vemurafenib in children with relapsed or
      refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
