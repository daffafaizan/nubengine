    
      Pre-operatively, patients routinely underwent the symptoms assessment, barium swallow, upper
      gastro-intestinal endoscopy and esophageal manometry.

      The type and severity of symptoms and the grade of reflux oesophagitis were scored using a
      questionnaire with semi-quantitative scales.

      The upper gastro-intestinal (GI) endoscopy, barium swallow and esophageal manometry were
      performed according to standard techniques; reflux esophagitis was reported according to the
      Los Angeles classification. In the absence of Los Angeles grade A or higher esophagitis,
      patient underwent a 24h pH-recording or intraluminal impedance/pH monitoring. Patients
      complaining of chronic cough were submitted to a specific work-up consisting of a chest High
      Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan, methacholine challenge test and spirometry in
      order to exclude pulmonary diseases.

      Surgery was performed in patients negative for pulmonary diseases on chest HRCT scan, on
      methacholine challenge test and spirometry, in consideration of the fact that patients had
      been referred mainly for the therapy of chronic cough.

      The study was started in 1995 and it was closed in 2010.
