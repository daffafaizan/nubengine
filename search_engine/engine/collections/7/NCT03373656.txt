      due to the disease, the chemotherapy, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or the
      splenectomy, which greatly increases their chance to get infectious diseases. In this study,
      we will assess the compliance of children with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors and
      their parents to accept vaccination after finishing treatments, follow up with untoward
      effect questionnaires to assess the safety, obtain the serum of children patients to test
      antibody titers and assess the effectivity, provide clues for the study of vaccination in
      children with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors and provide a scientific basis for the
      formulation and reunification of vaccination programs.
