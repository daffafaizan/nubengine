      Sport Psychology, 2012, 6, 85-102):

        1. a predetermined number of spheres (typically eight) are presented in a 3D dimensional
           virtual volumetric cube space. The spheres are typically all identical.

        2. a subset of spheres (typically four) is indexed via highlighting for a brief period of 1
           s.

        3. the spheres return to their original color and start moving within the restricted 3D
           virtual space. During this movement, the spheres can collide and consequently suddenly
           change direction, and they can cross over others, thus occluding their view.

        4. the spheres stop moving after a predetermined time, and the observer has to identify the
           spheres that were initially indexed with halos. The subject is then given feedback on
           the response by having the spheres identified by revealing the appropriate indexed
           stimuli.

      The main task starts at a given speed, and if all four spheres are not correctly identified,
      the next trial will be slower. If the four spheres are correctly identified, then the next
      trial will be faster. Trials are repeated like this following a staircase procedure, and
      ultimately, a speed threshold is established.
