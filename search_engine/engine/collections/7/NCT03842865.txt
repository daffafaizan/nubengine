    
      Approximately 40 subjects who had tissue procured and Vigil manufactured but fail
      manufacturing release criteria under a previous Gradalis protocol are considered for this
      study.

      Participants will be managed in an outpatient setting. Hematologic function, liver enzymes,
      renal function and electrolytes will be monitored. Blood for immune function analyses in
      response to autologous tumor antigens will be collected at screening, Day 1 (prior to Vigil
      administration) at Cycles 2, 4, and 6, end of treatment (EOT); 3 months after EOT, and every
      6 months thereafter for those in response follow up. For subjects with Ewing's sarcoma, blood
      for ctDNA analysis will be collected at screening, on Day 1 prior to Vigil administration at
      Cycles 2, 3, 4, and 6, and EOT.
