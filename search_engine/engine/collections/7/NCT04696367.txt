      identify the group as 'at risk' of malnutrition. There are also several different ways to
      measure outcomes. This pilot study will look at patients undergoing emergency laparotomy,
      investigate relationships between different selection criteria and outcome measures, and test
      feasibility of outcome measure collection.
