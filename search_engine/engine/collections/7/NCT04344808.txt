    
      This is a prospective randomized clinical trial.

      Each patient enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated to one group ( Navigation
      group or Freehand groups). Preoperative virtual planification of dental implants on a
      pre-acquired cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) will be performed for each patient using
      the same system.

      During the surgical phase, depending on which group is allocated the patient one surgical
      approach or other will be used. Then after the surgical procedure a PROMs questionnaire will
      be asked to the patients.

      Finally a postoperative CBCT will be performed and overlapped with the preoperative CBCT
      (with the implants planification) and implant position deviations between the planned and
      final position will be measured.

      The study devices are CE- (Conformité Européenne, meaning European Conformity) marked
      products and used within their intended use.
