      diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis:

        1. Anamnesis:

           acute and spontaneous oro-facial pain, pulsatile severe intensity, which could irradiate
           toward the ear and/or jaw, exacerbated by cold or hot.

        2. Clinical exams: positive vitality tests (electric test and cold pressor test)

        3. Further examination (radiography)

      The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked and the informed consent of the patient
      will be taken. The patient is then randomized in one of the group (experimental or control).
      He will fill a questionnaire (Corah's scale) for evaluating his state of anxiety during care.
      A monitoring of cardiac parameters is made during the care at defined moment.

      The patient evaluates his pain himself with the VAS (Visual Analog Score), before the
      intervention. The anesthesia is carried out by only one experimenter, with the Quickslepperâ„¢
      handpiece but different specific needles.

      Each patient receive 1.8 mL of 4% articaine 1:100 000 on a period of 2 minutes.
