      (estimated 36,000 deaths each year in the United States alone). More agents are needed in the
      armamentarium of anti-influenza medications including novel mechanisms of action and
      parenteral agents.

      This study will evaluate the safety of a novel RNA based therapeutic AVI-7100. Beginning with
      a low single-dose, subjects are randomized to receive either AVI-7100 or placebo and
      evaluated on Study Days 0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 28. The safety and tolerability is evaluated using
      symptoms, clinical laboratory tests, ECG, and pharmacokinetics. Utilizing a series of
      stopping rules and a medical monitor, the dose will be escalated as safety and tolerability
      are established. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established in the first part of
      this study (either limited by adverse effects or up to maximum anticipated dose), the safety
      and tolerability of multi-dose administration will begin (replicating anticipated clinical
      use). Subjects again are randomized to either AVI-7100 or placebo daily for 5 days, and
      evaluated on Study Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14, and 32. The dose used in the multi-dose
      cohorts will also be escalated as safety and tolerability are established.
