      patients belong to noninvasive thymoma. When feasible, complete surgical resection is the
      primary treatment. There are quite a number of thymoma patients that has lost its surgical
      indications when diagnosed. Even after complete resection, the recurrence rate can be about
      20%. For patients with unresectable or recurrent disease, radiation is routinely
      administered, often in combination with systemic chemotherapy. However, because of wide range
      of radiation, more complications of conventional radiotherapy limit its treatment dose. The
      local recurrence rates of conventional radiotherapy are up 16% to 45%. Moreover, it's not
      suitable for patients with severe heart and lung disease. Stereotactic body radiation
      therapy(SBRT) well solved the problem above. On the one hand, by improving the single dose,
      it not only shortens the total radiation treatment, but also increases the total dose of
      equivalent biological effects; On the other hand, SBRT, with more precise conformal radiation
      therapy, significantly reduces the damage to the surrounding normal tissues. Theoretically,
      SBRT can improve the local control, as well greatly reduces incidence of the radiation
      pneumonia, pericarditis, tracheitis, esophagitis and so on. However, few studies focused on
      the treatment of thymoma by SBRT, except two case reports Here we performed a prospective
      study on the treatment of thymoma by SBRT. The purpose of this prospective study was a
      preliminary evaluation of feasibility, efficacy and toxicity ofÎ³-SBRT in the treatment of
      thymoma.
