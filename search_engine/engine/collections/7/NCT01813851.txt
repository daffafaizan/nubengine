      wasting. Hypothesis 1: Patients in the exercise group will more frequently reverse the PEW
      than in the control group Aim 2: To determine the patterns of change in body composition (fat
      free mass). Hypothesis 2: Patients in the exercise group will maintain or increase their fat
      free mass and patients in the control group will decrease their fat free mass Aim 3: To
      determine the effects of exercise on muscle strength. Hypothesis 3: Patients in the exercise
      group will maintain or increase their quadriceps strength while patients in the control group
      will decrease their muscle strength Aim 4: To determine the effects of exercise on postural
      balance. Hypothesis 4: Patients in the exercise group will maintain or increase their body
      balance while patients in the control group will decrease their body balance Aim 5: To
      determine the effects of exercise on quality of life as assessed by the SF-36. Hypothesis 5:
      Patients in exercise group will maintain or increase their quality of life form while
      patients in the control group will decrease their quality of life
