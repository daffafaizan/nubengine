    
      The overarching goals of this research are to investigate: (1) neural substrates of
      approach/avoidance behaviors in remitted MDDs; (2) stress-induced signaling in remitted
      individuals with past MDD; (3) neural markers that prospectively predict disease course.

      This will be achieved through an innovative method of using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) during an approach/avoidance decision-making task.
