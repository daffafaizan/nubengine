      dcSSc or SSc-PAH. Twenty participants with SSc-PAH and 14 participants with dcSSc will be
      randomized to receive either oral ifetroban daily or matching placebo. Study participants
      will be treated for 12 months, followed by a 30-day follow-up period. The study will test
      whether ifetroban is safe and statistically superior to placebo in reducing the effects of
      their disease at month 12 and explore the ability of ifetroban to prevent or reverse
      progression in patients with early disease duration and reverse established disease in
      patients with longer disease duration.
