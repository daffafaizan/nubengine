      excessive cytokine release is associated with tissue damage in the lung. Severe inflammatory
      / oxidative stress response and severe lung injury secondary to ARDS may develop. Therefore,
      suppressing the proinflammatory response has a very important place in treatment.
      Methylprednisolone is classically an immune response suppressor, powerful anti-inflammatory
      drug and is used in the treatment of covid 19 severe infection. However, there is still not
      enough data to determine the treatment timing, dosage, duration of use and indication.

      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between drug dose and hospitalisation
      time and mortality rates in patients with pre-diagnosis of severe covid pneumonia and
      systemic methylprednisolone.

      Materials and Methods: The demographic data, symptom durations, thorax CT findings,
      methylprednisolone dose and duration of treatment, hospitalisation times, intensive care
      hospitalisations of the patients who were initiated and hospitalized in the emergency
      department will be retrospectively recorded. Finally, the fate of the patients (such as
      discharge, referral, death) will be recorded.

      In the treatment of severe Covid 19 pneumonia, methylprednisolone treatment is used in
      addition to antiviral treatment. However, there are insufficient data on the time to start
      this treatment, drug dose and duration of use in daily routine. With the results of our
      study, we hope that we can contribute to the dose, duration and timing of methylprednisolone
      use in the treatment of Covid 19 pneumonia.
