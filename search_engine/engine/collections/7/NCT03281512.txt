      hypertension and overweight are in great controversy but evidence from large population in
      China is lacking.The investigators aim to utilize the data from the China Health and
      Nutrition Survey. The investigators will calculate the cumulative average intake of SFAs
      based on 3 consecutive 24-h dietary recalls in each round.Sex-specific Cox regression models
      will be used to estimate the relative risk.Results from our work will be used to provide
      epidemiological evidence for improving recommendation on SFAs intake for Chinese in dietary
      guidelines.
