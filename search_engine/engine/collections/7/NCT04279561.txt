      I. To evaluate short- and long-term prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) imaging changes
      in response to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate PSMA imaging changes with prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics.

      II. To correlate PSMA imaging changes with progression free survival. III. To evaluate the
      changes in PSMA PET staging (miTNM Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation
      [PROMISE] criteria) under ARSI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) intravenously (IV). After
      50-100 minutes, patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)
      over 20-50 minutes. Patients undergo 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at baseline, at 1 and 2 weeks after
      initiation of ARSI, and at time of biochemical progression (within 1 year if applicable).
