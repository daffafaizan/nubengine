      Sarcopenia is one of the popular elderly-related issues. Skeletal muscle is an important
      component for sustaining physical activity and storing protein. Protein of skeletal muscle is
      used as energy substrates in cases of starvation or under stress. As being aging, physical
      condition degenerates gradually. Older adults usually have multiple chronic diseases. Lesser
      physical function results in less physical activity. As a result, more muscle mass would be
      lost. In previous study, after the age of 50 year-old, muscle mass decreases 1-2% per year.
      The velocity of muscle mass decline increases after the age of 60 year-old. Sarcopenia may
      induce decreased muscle strength, poor physical activity, even disability and increase rate
      of hospitalization and mortality. Therefore, we want to figure out the management for
      decreasing prevalence of sarcopenia in older adults.

      Exercise is an important method for preventing sarcopenia. In this study, we intend to design
      a set of exercise which is easily performed for older adults and also has preventing muscle
      mass loss effect. Towel is an important tool for exercise.

      Duration to execute is during 2017/08/01~2017/12/31. We randomize these 60 older adults into
      2 groups (experimental group and control group) and there are 30 older adults in each group.
      Those older adults are age above 65 year-old, have lower grip strength and slower walking
      speed. One assistant who doesn't know which group these older adults belonged to would record
      their basic information and is responsible for the evaluation. We will evaluate the older
      adults' functional performance three times, before training, after training, post-training
      for three months, respectively.
