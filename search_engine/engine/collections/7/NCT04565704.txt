      provide highly detailed images of tissue structures in multiple application areas including
      Cardiology, Gastroenterology, and Pulmonology. They are looking to continue the advancement
      of these various technologies under development.

      The population will include subjects who are undergoing elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      with biopsy, colonoscopy with biopsy, and/or endo-mucosal resection.The endoscopist will take
      no more than 3 biopsies in addition to the standard of care biopsies.

      The study will be optical imaging of the ex vivo GI specimens that are being collected.
      Specimens will be collected for research purposes only. Offline analysis of the samples will
      be performed, and optical imaging findings will be correlated with the pathology findings.
      This will require review of the medical record to link the findings of the imaging with the
      pertinent medical information. Samples will be de-identified and subjects will be assigned a
      unique number. The tissues will be placed in marked containers labeled "for research purposes
      only". The samples collected will be brought to the Tearney Research Laboratory for imaging
      and processing. The Optical imaging of the tissue samples will not affect the standard of
      care procedure.
