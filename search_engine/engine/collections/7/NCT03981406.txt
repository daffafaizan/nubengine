      It is universally fatal, with an average time to death between two to five years.

      Patients with IPF experience significantly diminished quality of life and increased symptom
      burden. Besides dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and deconditioning, patients with IPF experience
      significant depression and anxiety. The benefit of palliative care has been demonstrated in
      several other diseases, notably, in metastatic lung cancer. Patients with metastatic lung
      cancer who were seen by palliative care at the time of their diagnosis and throughout their
      disease course were found to have increased survival, improved quality of life, and received
      less aggressive care at the end of their life. This finding has prompted significant research
      in the role of palliative care in other diseases, including chronic lung disease. A
      non-blinded, randomized trial of a multi-disciplinary breathlessness service intervention in
      patients with advanced disease including cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD),
      interstitial lung disease (ILD), and congestive heart failure demonstrated improvement in
      breathlessness, anxiety, and even survival. Specific Aim 1: Determine if quality of life is
      improved with a palliative care intervention. Specific Aim 2: Determine if depression and
      anxiety symptoms are decreased with a palliative care intervention. Secondary aims include an
      examination of pulmonary function tests (PFT), number of hospitalizations, and overall
      mortality as an effect of a palliative care intervention.
