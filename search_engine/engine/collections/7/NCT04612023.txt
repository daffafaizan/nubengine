    
      It is a prospective, double blinded, Randomized Controlled Trial study. Data will be
      prospectively collected of all injectable acellular amniotic membrane derived allograft knee
      performed at our institute (1 vs 2 mL).

      90 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 in treatment
      arms.

      It compares the dose affect of an amniotic membrane allograft between a 1 mL dose and a 2 mL
      dose when compared to a placebo of sterile saline in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the
      knee. This will be offered as a free pain management alternative to patients who meet the
      inclusion criteria. The results will be determined by validated patient-reported outcome
      tools (KOOS, VAS, and WOMAC questionnaires) and physical examinations taken before the
      injection, one month after the injection, three months after the injection, six months after
      the injection, and one year after the injection. There will be a phone call 24 hours after
      the injection for every patient participating in the study regarding any potential adverse
      events.
