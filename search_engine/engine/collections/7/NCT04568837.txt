      pain medication use, length of stay, major complications, and time to first bowel movement)
      between subjects that receive either 20 mg of PO prednisone or 1 mL of 4 mg/mL of IV
      dexamethasone sodium phosphate and a control group.

      OUTLINE Participants are patients who elect to participate in the study prior to scheduled
      thoracic and/or lumbar spine fusion surgery at Oregon Health and Science University.
      Participants undergo their scheduled spine fusion surgery. After surgery, participants are
      randomized into either the study drug group or the control (non-treatment) group. If
      randomized into the study drug group, participants will orally take a daily dose of 20 mg of
      prednisone (1 mL of 4 mg/mL dexamethasone sodium phosphate if unable to tolerate oral
      administration) on postoperative days one and two.
