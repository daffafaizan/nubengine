      undergoing tooth extraction and socket preservation were divided into two groups: Group I:980
      nm Diode laser was used to seal the socket by photocoagulation .Group II : a non-resorbable
      dPTFE was used to seal the socket and stabilized by suturing to the soft tissue margins of
      the socket

      All patients were clinically and radiographically evaluated at the baseline and on the second
      , third and fourth weeks postoperatively.Then recalled after 4 months for the final
      radiographic examination.
