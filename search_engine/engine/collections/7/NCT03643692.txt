      recommendation (therapeutic advice), exercise and stress support, hypoglycaemia prevention
      through timely snack recommendation and behavioural change through educational support
      (lifestyle advice).

      Semi-structured focus meetings comprised of patients with T1DM, clinicians, engineers and
      experts in human-computer interaction will provide a forum to establish the essential
      usability requirements to incorporate into the ARISES mobile interface. The design will focus
      on ensuring access to decision support is intuitive and efficient while maintaining sight of
      real-time glycaemia outcomes. The design and implementation of the user-interface will be
      assessed in a series of usability validation studies.

      Clinical studies will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will be an observational
      study using wearable technologies to collect data and evaluate blood glucose correlations
      against physiological and environmental case parameters. Useful associations will assist the
      development of the CBR/machine learning algorithm and identify wearable devices for the final
      ARISES platform.
