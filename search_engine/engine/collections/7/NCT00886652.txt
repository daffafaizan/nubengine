      physiotherapeutic program of aerobic exercises on respiratory muscle strength, in patients
      with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Objective. To analyze, by means of maximum
      respiratory pressure measurements, the conditioning of the respiratory muscles after four
      months of aerobic exercise training. Summary of Background Data. AIS can change the
      respiratory dynamics and performance of the inspiratory and expiratory muscles, affecting
      ventilatory capacity.

      Methods: Patients with AIS, aged between 10 and 20 years, were randomly assigned to the
      aerobic exercise-training program group or the no treatment group. They were evaluated for
      respiratory muscle strength before and after the treatment period, by means of a manometer,
      and radiographs of the chest and spine. The physical therapy exercise protocol consisted of
      three weekly sessions, including stretching, aerobic exercises (first mild and then
      accelerated) and relaxation techniques, for a period of four months.
