    
      In this randomized controlled cross-over study, twenty HD patients (10 male/10 female, aged
      20-80) will be recruited from local dialysis clinics in Champaign-Urbana, IL. After baseline
      testing, patients will be randomized to the intervention group or placebo group
      (maltodextrin). Patients will consume inulin (females 10g/day, males 15g/day) or maltodextrin
      (females 10g/day, males 15g/day) for one month, rest for two weeks (washout period), and
      continue with the other treatment (either inulin or maltodextrin) for another month. Outcomes
      will be assessed at the beginning of each period and after a month of supplementation at both
      periods.
