    
      The study design is randomized stratified, double blind, add-on, placebo-controlled.

      A group of children and adolescents with AN will be selected and randomly assigned to two
      different conditions: treatment "as usual" plus experimental treatment (active tDCS);
      treatment "as usual" plus placebo treatment (sham tDCS).

      Similarly, a group of children and adolescents with Over-weight/Obesity (OW/OB) and BED will
      be selected and assigned with randomized stratified sampling to the following conditions:
      treatment "as usual" plus experimental treatment (active tDCS); treatment "as usual" plus
      placebo treatment (sham tDCS).

      In this project, the investigators will work to understand whether a brain-based treatment,
      with the use of tDCS, can improve the outcome of patients with eating disorders.

      The investigators will test whether tDCS treatment produces improvements in under-eating and
      over-eating diseases, such us AN and OW/OB with BED and food craving.

      Our overarching goal is to provide a scientific foundation for devising new rehabilitation
      strategies in ED.
