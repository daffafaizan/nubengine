    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of ER-MAS in promoting cocaine abstinence and ADHD
      improvement among comorbid ADHD and cocaine-dependent patients.

      Primary Hypothesis: benzoylecgonine positive urine screens will decrease with greatest to
      least reductions from 80mg>60mg>PBO (placebo).

      Hypothesis 2: ADHD-Rating Scale will decrease with greatest to least reductions from
      80mg>60mg>PBO.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of ER-MAS on improving general functioning and
      impulsivity among comorbid ADHD and cocaine-dependent patients.

      Hypothesis 4: There will be greater improved CGI (clinical global impression scale) scores in
      participants receiving d-AMPH (d-amphetamine) compared to PBO.

      Hypothesis 5: ER-MAS will decrease impulsivity as measured by several self-report (Barratts
      Impulsivity Scale) and behavioral measures (Card Sort, IMT (immediate memory task), DMT
      (delayed memory task), BART) compared to PBO.

      This 14-week, three arm (two medication doses versus PBO), prospective, parallel groups,
      randomized PBO-controlled trial with a lead-in as well as medication run-up and run down
      weeks, will provide clear data on efficacy and safety for definitive Phase III trials, which
      if successful will lead to improved treatment for A-ADHD/S-SUD.
