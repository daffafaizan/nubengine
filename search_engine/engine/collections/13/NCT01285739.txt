      through endotracheal intubation, followed by placement of a endotracheal canula. However,
      invasive ventilation is at risk of infective complications and is difficult to manage at
      home. In particular, invasive mechanical ventilation may be associated with ventilator
      associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP is usually suspected when the individual develops a new or
      progressive infiltrate on chest radiograph, leukocytosis, and purulent tracheobronchial
      secretions. When possible, we tried to put these tracheotomized patients in non invasive
      mechanical ventilation (NIMV)to avoid VAP. This population was followed for eight consecutive
      years and compared with patients in invasive home mechanical ventilation (IMV).
