    
      Cigarette smokers, who are motivated to quit smoking but who rate the inhalation aspects of
      smoking as important will be randomized to three groups: Group 1. Nicotine ENDS + nicotine
      patch; Group 2: Nicotine ENDS + placebo patch; Group 3: Placebo ENDS + Nicotine patch.
      Participants will initially receive 1 week of 21 mg nicotine (or placebo) skin patches while
      continuing to smoke their usual cigarettes ad lib, in order to assess responsiveness to
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Starting with week 2, participants will receive
      nicotine-containing (or placebo) ENDS devices (menthol or non-menthol versions in accordance
      with their baseline preference). They will also be instructed to substitute ENDS for as many
      cigarettes as possible in this week. The target quit-smoking date will occur at the beginning
      of week 3. Treatments will continue until week 8 post-quit, at which time participants will
      be instructed to reduce ENDS use over the next 4 weeks, at which time ENDS will no longer be
      dispensed. Subsequently, the nicotine patch dose will be gradually reduced according to
      standard weaning regimen from 21 mg/24 h to 14 mg/24 h for 2 weeks, and 7 mg/ 24 h for 2
      weeks. All nicotine-based treatments will end at week 16 after the quit date.
