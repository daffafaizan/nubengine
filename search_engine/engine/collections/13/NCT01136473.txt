      will be opened (capsulorhexis) and removed. The lens material will be removed. All 3
      components will be sent to the lab.

      Lens epithelial cells will be isolated and will be used in a co-culture setup with trabecular
      cells to investigate the interactions between lens cells and trabecular cells. Understanding
      the interaction between young and adult lens cells on trabecular cell will shed light on
      mechanism of infantile aphakic glaucoma.

      Aqueous humor taken out before cataract surgery and before glaucoma operation of aphakic eyes
      will be used for analysis of growth factor and cytokines in the Aphakic eye using proteins
      membrane arrays. Eyes before cataract surgery will be used as controls. Such analysis will
      shed light on the possible factors affecting trabecular cells in aphakic eye.
