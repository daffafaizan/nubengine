        -  To compare prophylactic with empirical vancomycin administration for reducing early
           viridans streptococcal bacteremia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
           (HSCT) patients.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To examine the safety and tolerability for each vancomycin administration approach.

        -  To measure the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections for
           patients managed with each of the two vancomycin administration approaches.
