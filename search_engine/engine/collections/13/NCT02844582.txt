      I. To test whether men with a poor initial response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
      have a better front line therapeutic response to cabazitaxel as compared to historical
      controls of frontline metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) therapy with
      abiraterone or enzalutamide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1
      response rate, progression free survival (PFS) by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working
      Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria, and overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate safety and toxicity profile of cabazitaxel in patients with CRPC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect serum and tumor tissue samples for molecular markers or signature predictive of
      cabazitaxel benefit (to include status of androgen receptor [AR] pathway, androgen
      biosynthetic pathway genes, adenosine triphosphate [ATP]-binding cassette sub-family B member
      1 [ABCBI], multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 [MRP1], and other mediators of taxane
      resistance).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabazitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and prednisone orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
