    
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a hemodynamic finding related to increase in pulmonary artery
      pressure. Because PH disease is a progressive, rare disease, it is important for this disease
      group to prolong the life span and to increase the quality of life and functional capacity.
      PH patients have been shown to have weakness in peripheral and respiratory muscles.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to the inspiratory muscle training and control group.
      Inspiratory muscle training will be initiated in accordance with the patient at a range of
      40-60%. Ä°nspiratory muscle training will be given based on the assessments by the
      physiotherapist. Patients with PH who come to the routine outpatient clinic and volunteer
      will be included in the study. The first session will be the evaluation session and the
      8-week inspiratory muscle training will be given, the other group will be the control group
      only. Dyspnoea, diaphragm thickness, pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle
      strength, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, physical activity, anxiety, depression and
      quality of life assessments will be repeated before and after the treatment.
