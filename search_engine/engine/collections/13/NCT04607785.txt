      on the tooth and the soft-tissue adjoining the tooth. Accumulation of dental biofilm has been
      established as the initial cause of this disease. It is determined by redness of the gum
      margins, edema, bleeding upon brushing, and loss of periodontal attachment loss. Gingivitis
      exists in both acute and chronic forms. Acute gingivitis is identified as trauma,
      micro-organisms, and specific infections while chronic inflammation is related to bacterial
      biofilm which covers the gum and adjoining the teeth. Elimination and control of plaque are
      very important in the maintenance of periodontal health. Chlorhexidine mouthwash has is a
      tremendous effect when it is used as a mouthwash for a long time; therefore, the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) recommends limiting the use of chlorhexidine mouthwash up to 6
      months to minimize or limit its side effects. Additionally, the World Health Organization
      (WHO) encouraged to consider the possible use of herb extracts and natural plants mouthwashes
      instead of chemical mouthwash just as miswak mouthwash. Miswak mouthwash is a herbal
      mouthwash that is available locally and culturally accepted. It is prepared from a plant
      called Salvadora persica which comes from a tree (Arak) that grows in Africa and west India.
