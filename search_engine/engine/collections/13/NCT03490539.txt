      evaluate immunosuppressive treatment (IS) of myasthenia gravis (MG). Patients with acquired
      autoimmune MG â‰¥ 18 years of age who are not on IS agents, and have not been on
      corticosteroids for at least 30 days will be enrolled at 20 sites in the US and Canada. These
      patients will be treated according to the physician's judgment and patient preferences as in
      routine clinical practice. Patients will be followed prospectively, with the frequency of
      clinical visits and laboratory monitoring determined by the treating physician, which may
      differ among patients. Standard outcome measures measuring efficacy and adverse effects that
      are used in clinical practice will be collected, with emphasis on patient reported outcomes.
      Informed consent will be obtained using an approved consent form. Patient identifiable /
      clinical information from the medical record, including the study outcome measures will be
      uploaded to a centralized REDCap database. The investigators plan to recruit 220 patients,
      adjusting for a 10% drop out rate, with a final sample of 200 patients for analysis.
