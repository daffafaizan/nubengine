      uncontrolled activation of mast cells. The release by mast cells of mast cell mediators
      (tryptase, histamine, prostaglandins, serotonin) results in mast cell activation symptoms,
      found in mast cell activation syndrome but also in mastocytosis. These symptoms interested
      the skin, gastrointestinal gut, pulmonary, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric organs, etc.

      In mastocytosis, along with these symptoms of mast cell activation, the infiltration of
      different organs by abnormal mast cells produces many clinical signs related to the excess of
      monoclonal mast cells present in the organs.

      According to our clinical experience, the impact of mast cell disorder on various dimensions
      of life, including economic life, seems important, but it has never accurately evaluated.
