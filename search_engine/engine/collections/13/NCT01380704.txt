    
      This is a multiple-dose study to assess the safety and pharmacology of ABT-436 in physically
      healthy subjects with mild to moderate depressive symptoms who are not taking any
      antidepressant medication. Efficacy for treatment of depressive symptoms is not a goal of
      this study. Fifty subjects will receive study drug for seven days. Thirty subjects will
      receive ABT-436 and twenty subjects will receive placebo. Blood, urine and saliva samples
      will be obtained, both before and during study drug administration, to measure ABT-436
      pharmacology. Safety will be assessed throughout the study, including at two follow-up visits
      after completion of study drug administration.
