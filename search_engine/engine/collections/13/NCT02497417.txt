    
      The ARIES C. difficile Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative
      in vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)
      nucleic acid in unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens obtained from patients suspected of
      having Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD).

      The objective of this study is to establish diagnostic accuracy of ARIES C. difficile Assay
      through a multi-site, method comparison on prospectively collected, left-over, stool
      specimens. Diagnostic accuracy will be expressed in terms of clinical sensitivity (or
      positive agreement) and specificity (or negative agreement).
