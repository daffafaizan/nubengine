      device, INVOS®(somanetics Corporation, USA ) and InSpectra™ (Hutchinson Technology, USA).
      InSpectra™ was introduced later than INVOS®.

      With InSpectra™, clinicians have used a vascular occlusion test (VOT) to evaluate dynamic
      changes in tissue oxygen saturation during ischemia and reperfusion, and thus,
      microcirculatory function. There have been little data about VOT using INVOS®, although it is
      more popular device.

      We hypothesized that there would be a difference between the values from INVOS® and
      InSpectra™. The aim of this study is to evaluate changes in tissue oxygen saturation in the
      thenar muscle during VOT using INVOS® and comapre it to InSpectra™ in a normal population.
