      Northwestern University to examine the degree of improvement of psoriatic plaques during
      systemic therapy treatment. Thirty patients with a confirmed diagnosis of "active" psoriasis
      treated with a single systemic agent will be recruited from the Northwestern Medical Faculty
      Foundation Dermatology clinic. The study population will include 15 patients receiving
      adalimumab and 15 patients receiving methotrexate.

      Eight visits will be completed for each subject: visit 0 (baseline) and visits 1-8 (week 2,
      4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24). At the baseline visit, after informed consent is obtained, a
      capillaroscopic examination will be performed to assess for evidence of characteristic
      vascular alterations. If such changes are present, the remainder of the baseline visit will
      be completed. This includes gathering personal information (age, race, gender etc.), clinical
      history (time of first diagnosis, presentation site, treatment used, biopsy results if
      previously performed, etc.) and past medical history (including current and previous
      medications). At each of the subsequent visits (visit 1-8), any changes to medical history
      and/or medications will be obtained and recorded. At each of the eight visits, a dermatologic
      physical examination, including PASI and PGA scores will be performed.
