      number of motor units in a muscle. This data can be changed by natural evolution or by
      treatment in peripheral neuropathy. Alfortunately, normal value for MUNIX variation does not
      exist. Thus, it is difficult to assume improvement or worsening of the MUNIX for an
      individual subject.

      Our objective is to calculate normal variation of MUNIX in 4 muscles: tibialis anterior,
      abductor digiti mini, abductor pollicis brevis et deltoideus. Measurement will be performed
      at inclusion and 3 monthes later in 100 healthy subjects. This trial will be prospective in
      several French centres sepecialized in neuromuscular evaluation
