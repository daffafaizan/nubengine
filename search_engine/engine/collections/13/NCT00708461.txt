      worksite intervention with strong environmental components to prevent weight gain. Six
      worksites will be randomized to either an intervention or a no-treatment control group. The
      intervention will be comprised of 1) changing the availability, portion sizes, and prices of
      foods and beverages sold to employees in their worksites in ways that encourage healthier
      food choices; 2) increasing the availability of physical activity opportunities at the
      worksite by implementing walking programs and increasing stairwell access and attractiveness;
      3) placing scales in the work environment to encourage body weight monitoring and to enable
      workers to set goals for their weight; and 4) to provide educational materials to all
      employees to make them aware of the environmental intervention and of behavioral practices
      likely to be effective in preventing weight gain. The intervention will be implemented for a
      2-year period in each intervention site. Effectiveness will be evaluated by assessing body
      weight, eating behavior and physical activity in a cohort of employees in both control and
      intervention sites at baseline and again 2 years later. Weight trends in these populations
      will also be compared to data from national and state-level annual surveys of weight in
      representative population samples. Data will be collected on the effects of specific
      intervention components via aggregate measures of food choice and physical activity.
