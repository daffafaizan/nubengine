      effects of jeju steam onion. Fifty-six healthy male and female subjects aged 20-65 years with
      normal body weight [25.0 kg/㎡ ≤ body mass index (BMI) < 30.0 kg/㎡] were recruited. The basic
      framework of the present study was based on a previous study. A 12-week (at each visit;
      screening, 6-week, 12-week), placebo-controlled, randomized study was conducted with
      overweight subjects (25.0 kg/㎡ ≤ BMI < 30 kg/㎡). Subjects participants were divided into two
      group: either Jeju steaming onion or matching placebo (the baked barley powder).
      Randomization was achieved by computer generated block randomization (placebo : test = 1 :
      1).
