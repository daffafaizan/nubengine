      by nivolumab and ipilimumab Cohort 2 (post pembrolizumab plus axitinib, pembrolizumab plus
      lenvatinib, or avelumab and axitinib): the subject who failed one prior line by PD-1/PD-L1
      inhibitors in combination with VEGF TKI Cohort 3 (post sequential immunotherapy after VEGFR
      TKI): the subject who failed the second line by immunotherapy (PD-1 antibody or PD-L1
      antibody) following the first line VEGFR TKI Subjects will receive study treatment as long as
      they continue to experience a clinical benefit in the investigator's opinion or until there
      is unacceptable toxicity or the need for subsequent systemic anticancer therapy. Treatment
      may continue after radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 as long as the investigator
      believes that the subject is still receiving clinical benefit from study treatment and that
      the potential benefit of continuing study treatment outweighs potential risks.
