    
      This is a single-blind, placebo-controlled study which will investigate the PK, safety and
      tolerability of XG005-03 topical formulation, in three ascending concentrations after single
      and multiple topical applications in healthy subjects. The trial consists of two parts: a
      single ascending dose (SAD; Part 1) and a multiple ascending dose (MAD; Part 2). The MAD
      study will begin after the SAD portion of the study is complete.

      The study will consist of 4 weeks of screening period, treatment period (1 day of dosing for
      SAD and 6.5 days for MAD), and 14 days of safety follow-up period. Each subject will serve as
      his/her own control, as the XG005-03 and placebo will be applied on contralateral legs.
      Application of XG005-03 or placebo to a particular leg will be randomly assigned.

      Approximately 36 healthy subjects will be enrolled. Eighteen healthy subjects (3 alternates
      per dose group) in Part 1 (SAD) and Part 2 (MAD), who fulfill eligibility criteria will
      receive the study drug: XG005-03 (1%, 5%, and 10%) and placebo.
