      disease; however, a link is all they have found. In a previously funded grant, using a double
      blind, randomized experimental design, the investigators explored the effect of an acute dose
      of Kuvan or an antioxidant cocktail (1000mg of vitamin C, 600IU of vitamin E, and 600mg
      alpha-lipoic acid) on vascular health in patients with COPD. Consequently, the investigators
      found in separate experiments, that a single dose of both antioxidants and Kuvan transiently
      improves vascular health in patients with COPD. The current project is an attempt to expand
      on the investigator's previous findings and explore the effects of sub-chronic use of
      antioxidants and Kuvan on sustaining the improvements in vascular health in COPD.
