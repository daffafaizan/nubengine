      of motor control in health as well as the pathophysiological modifications taking place
      during disease. To this end, we will investigate changes in regional cerebral blood flow
      (rCBF) as an index of regional neuronal activity, associated with various motor and sensory
      tasks using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The rCBF will be obtained by measuring the
      distribution of the cerebral radioactivity during emission scans following the intravenous
      bolus injection of 15O-labeled water. The very short half-life of 15O (2 minutes) allows us
      to measure rCBF repeatedly under different task conditions (see methodology and experimental
      procedures). With the comparison between PET scans performed in different conditions, we can
      detect the specific task-related activated regions. PET images will be coregistered to high
      resolution Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) to get more accurate anatomical information
      regarding the activated areas. The results will be correlated with that from other
      physiological approaches including Electroencephalography (EEG), Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (TMS), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy (MRS). These studies should provide new information not only about the executive
      component of the voluntary movements in humans but also the different organizational aspects
      of the preparatory processes that control them.
