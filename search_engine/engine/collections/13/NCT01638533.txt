      I. To establish the safety and tolerability of romidepsin given on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28
      day cycle to patients with varying degrees of liver dysfunction (mild, moderate and severe).

      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and appropriate dosing recommendations for
      romidepsin in such patients.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of romidepsin in patients with varying degrees
      of liver dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore correlations of the Child-Pugh classification of liver dysfunction with the
      observed toxicities and plasma PK of romidepsin administration.

      II. To document any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity at tolerable doses of
      romidepsin in patients with varying degrees of liver dysfunction.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
