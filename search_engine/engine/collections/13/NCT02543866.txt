      with a history of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae. Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria
      and provide written, informed consent will undergo screening studies and provide a pre-FMT
      stool sample to confirm intestinal carriage of ESC-R Enterobacteriaceae. The FMT will be
      administered by nasogastric tube in the outpatient setting by trained personnel. The subjects
      will be monitored for potential adverse events, recurrence of MDRO infections, infections
      that may be related to FMT, and worsening of existing comorbidities or development of new
      comorbidities for the 12 months post-FMT with the option of participating in long-term
      follow-up for up to 5 years post-FMT. Patients will provide stool samples 2 days, 2 weeks, 4
      weeks, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-FMT. These samples will be testing for ESC-R
      Enterobacteriaceae.
