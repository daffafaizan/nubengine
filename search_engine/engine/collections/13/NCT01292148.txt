      hypothermia(32~34 degree), maintenance, and slow rewarming phase. If core temperature
      maintained below 32 degree during TH, som complications will be developed, such as arrythmia,
      hypotension, cold diuresis, coagulopathy, and so on. Therefore correct measurement of core
      temperature during TH is very important process for successful post cardiac arrest care. we
      will know that rectal or bladder temperature are really reflect the core temperature during
      TH for post cardiac arrest care, especially rapid cooling phase, maintenance phase, and slow
      rewarming phase, respectively.
