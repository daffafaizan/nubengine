      multiple sclerosis. Clinical trials have shown evidence in the reduction of relapses and
      progression of neurological and cognitive disability with the use of Avonex, as well as
      reduction in brain atrophy and new MS lesions on MRI were observed. Despite this, Avonex does
      not abolish disease activity, therefore, there is frequent need for adjunctive therapy, such
      as short courses of corticosteroids.

      This study will research the value of adding monthly pulsed corticosteroids as adjunctive
      therapy during the first year of Avonex use to determine: a)safety and tolerability b)if this
      therapy will reduce the progression of functional impairment, and c)if this therapy will
      reduce the progression of whole brain atrophy over a 13 month observation period.
