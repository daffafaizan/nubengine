      efficacy study of Dimebon treatment in subjects with Huntington disease (HD). The study will
      evaluate Dimebon 20 mg three times daily (TID) administered orally (PO) for six months (26
      weeks) compared with matching placebo TID for the primary safety and efficacy analyses.
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by recording of adverse events and by monitoring of
      vital signs, physical examinations, safety laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead
      electrocardiogram(ECG)assessments.
