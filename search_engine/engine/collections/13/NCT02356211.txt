      assessment and treatment for community-dwelling frail elderly patients with history of falls
      referred to an active management Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment Clinic with a
      control group of patients discharged from an Acute Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM)
      Inpatient Unit during the same time period, but who were not specifically referred for falls
      assessment. We hypothesized that a population of frail elderly referred by their primary care
      physicians and who reported for evaluation to a Geriatric Multifactorial Falls Assessment
      Clinic would show a reduction in falls compared to controls, when provided a time-limited
      consult evaluation with active follow-up for 1 year.
