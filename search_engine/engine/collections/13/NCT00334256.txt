      transmission (PMTCT) of HIV-1 in countries with limited resources. However, the use of sdNVP
      results in resistance mutations with an estimated frequency at of least 15 to 70% in women at
      W4-W6 postpartum. These mutations could compromise the success of subsequent treatments of
      mother and child with antiretroviral combinations that include NVP. Pre-clinical and clinical
      studies suggest that a combination of TDF and FTC, drugs with interesting pharmacokinetic
      properties that may be a useful alternative or complement to sdNVP.

      The objectives are to study the pharmacokinetic properties, safety and viral resistance
      pattern of the combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate {TDF, 600 mg} and emtricitabine
      {FTC, 400 mg}) in HIV-1-infected pregnant women and their newborns, with a view to prevention
      of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV-1 in Africa and Asia.

      Phase II trial, multicentre, open-label will be conducted in two steps with 30 mother-infant
      pairs per step and with a balanced allocation in Abidjan (CÃ´te d'Ivoire), Soweto (South
      Africa) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia):

      Step 1: administration of TDF/FTC to the mother; Step 2: administration of TDF/FTC to the
      mother and the newborn.
