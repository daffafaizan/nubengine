      hospitalization due to moderate to severe influenza compared with mild influenza among
      children aged 6 months to 8 years who were evaluated at Children's Hospital Colorado
      emergency department and urgent care during the 2016-2017 influenza season. In addition, the
      study intended to evaluate the risk difference for other health outcomes such as ICU
      admission, antibiotic and antiviral use, caregiver and child absenteeism and recurrent (>1)
      healthcare visits, and to compare the healthcare costs associated with management of moderate
      to severe versus mild influenza in children. Children who presented to Children's Hospital
      Colorado Emergency Department (ED) and urgent care affiliated sites (North Campus urgent
      care) with an influenza-like illness from December 2016 to April 2017 and during the
      2016-2017 influenza season, were eligible for the study. Once enrolled in the study, the
      investigators collected respiratory samples (nasal swab specimens) for influenza testing by
      PCR, sociodemographic and clinical data including variables of interest outlined above, and
      followed the clinical outcome of these children for 14 days after their initial presentation.
      Some of the variables of interest the investigators collected are shown below.
