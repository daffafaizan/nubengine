      symptom is renal colic. Acute treatment is based on the administration of analgesics mainly
      those belonging to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Tramadol is an analgesic of
      the opioid class of analgesics (i.e morphine) and it is considered to cause less side effects
      with more or less the same analgesic potency. In the present study the analgesic effect of
      intramuscular Tramadol will be compared with Voltaren (NSAID)in patients attending the
      Emergency Department (ED) for acute renal colic (Stage I). Most of these patients will not
      pass their stone during their visit to the ED and they are prone to develop another attack of
      renal colic.In the second phase of the study (Stage II)patients who improved, and are ready
      to go home, will be enrolled to get Dipyrone or Tramadol orally for the prevention of further
      pain.
