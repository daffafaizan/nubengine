      protein kinase C pathway in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced vascular
      permeability, for the treatment of uveitis-associated macular edema. This will be performed
      using a double-masked, randomized study in which uveitis patients with macular edema will
      receive either alpha-tocopherol or placebo. This study should be considered a pilot study
      that will provide information on design and outcome measurement for the development of a
      larger, definitive, future study. Patients will receive 1600IU/day of Vitamin E or placebo
      for 4 months. The primary outcome will be a visual acuity increase of 10 letters or more from
      baseline to month 4. Secondary outcomes are total area of leakage and macular height as
      determined by fluorescein angiography, changes in CME as measured by stereoscopic color
      photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT), the need for periocular injections or
      additional systemic immunomodulatory medications, and the NEI VFQ summary score.
