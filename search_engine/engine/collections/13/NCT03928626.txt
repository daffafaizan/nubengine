      individuals who report alcohol drinking to the following conditions: (1) a brief training in
      cognitive regulation and (2) a control or no-training condition. Training will be delivered
      in a computerized session (approximately 60 minutes). If randomized into the cognitive
      regulation training, subjects will be trained to use a cognitive strategy while viewing
      images of alcoholic drinks. The strategy would be to follow instructions to think about the
      adverse outcomes associated with continued alcohol drinking. If randomized into the control
      condition, participants will only view non-alcohol-related images with no use of strategy.
      After all the training sessions are completed, participants will complete several follow-ups.
      The investigators will evaluate the effects of training on alcohol drinking pre- and
      post-training.
