      and freely accessible by the patients, in this pandemic and due to the current circumstances
      from closing most general hospitals in front of the public, and with the government applying
      curfew long hours, community pharmacists were the only healthcare providers available for
      most patients. Their role will not be restricted to delivering medication but expands to
      monitoring patient conditions especially those with chronic diseases and patient counseling
      and education clarifying any misunderstanding concerning covid1-19 medication. The present
      study includes a questionnaire (with detailed questions including how/when/which/for how long
      antibiotics are prescribed) that is addressed for community pharmacists who dealt with
      covid-19 patients during the pandemic.
