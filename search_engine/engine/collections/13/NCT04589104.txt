    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a 6-week, virtually-delivered
      expressive writing intervention on resilience in a cohort of individuals currently navigating
      the COVID-19 pandemic during spring 2020.

      Eligible subjects will be adults who are able to read and write in English and are
      cognitively able to provide informed consent. Potential subjects will be recruited through
      the Duke Health & Well-Being email lists. The entirely virtual 6-week expressive writing
      intervention will be delivered via Zoom, REDCap, and email, and subjects will complete
      measures at baseline, 6 weeks, and 10 weeks (1 month post-intervention). Each week of the
      intervention will invite participants to complete a series of expressive writing assignments
      designed to support emotional expression and cultivate resilience, and the assignments will
      take approximately 60-90 minutes each week to complete.

      The primary outcome is the 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Other measures
      will include a basic demographics survey, questions about COVID-19 impact, post-writing
      surveys collected after the writing assignments, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS),
      the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised, and the 21-item Post
      -Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). Participants will also have the option to share the
      content of their writing assignments with the research team if they choose.

      The risks of participation in this study are minimal and include the risk of mild sadness
      after the writing assignments and the risk of loss of confidentiality.
