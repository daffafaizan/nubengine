      been studied in women with breast and ovarian cancer.

      Before treatment starts, patients will have a complete checkup, blood tests, a CT scan, and a
      chest x-ray. Women able to have children must have a negative urine pregnancy test. Blood
      tests and a complete checkup will also be done within 3 days of starting each course of
      therapy and a month after treatment ends. Tumors will be measured by CT scans once every 2-3
      months and at the end of treatment.

      Patients in this study will take Mifepristone in the form of a pill by mouth every day. Each
      course of therapy is 4 weeks long. Patients will see their doctor for an exam and blood tests
      before they begin each 4 week course of therapy. The dose of Mifepristone may be lowered if
      the patient has side effects. Patients who have a complete response (there is no evidence of
      cancer by physical exam or x-ray) will continue taking Mifepristone for 2 years after this
      response is documented. Other patients will take Mifepristone for as long as it benefits
      them.

      This is an investigational study. At least 12 and as many as 37 patients will take part in
      this study. Patients from MD Anderson Cancer Center and Gynecologic Oncology of Houston, P.A.
      will be enrolled.
