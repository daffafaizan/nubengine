    
      This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial in 160 patients with
      recently-diagnosed T2DM. Participants will be randomized to 2 treatment groups: (a) a 16-week
      course of treatment with IDegLira, metformin and lifestyle therapy, and (b) standard diabetes
      therapy, and followed for a total of 68 weeks (1 year and 4 months). In all participants with
      HbA1C<7.3% at the 16 week visit, glucose-lowering medications will be discontinued and
      participants will be encouraged to continue with lifestyle modifications and regular glucose
      monitoring. Participants with HbA1C â‰¥ 7.3% at this visit or who experience hyperglycemia
      relapse after stopping drugs will receive standard glycemic management as informed by the
      current Canadian Diabetes Association clinical practice guidelines.
