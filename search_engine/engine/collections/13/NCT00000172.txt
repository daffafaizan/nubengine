      to 8 weeks, to target doses of either: 0 (placebo); 24 mg/day galantamine; 16 mg/day
      galantamine; or 8 mg/day galantamine, in a 2:2:2:1 randomization ratio. Double-blind
      treatment will continue for a total of 5 months. The change from baseline in ADAS-cog and
      CIVIC-plus scores at Month 5 will be the primary efficacy endpoints. Tolerability will be
      evaluated based on adverse event reports, laboratory values, ECG, and vital signs with
      particular focus on the adverse event rates in the slower titration schedule for 24 mg/day.
      Efficacy of 24 mg/day and 16 mg/day galantamine will be compared with that of placebo.
      Information on the dose response relationship of galantamine will be evaluated.
