    
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested, as part of a Post-marketing requirement
      (PMR) for new drug application (NDA) holders of extended release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids,
      to conduct a study to develop and validate a measure of the opioid-related adverse events
      misuse and abuse among patients with chronic pain prescribed long-term opioid therapy. This
      measure will be used to assess misuse and abuse in PMR Study 2065-1A and PMR Study 2065-4B.

      To date, no tool currently exists to address the needs of the PMR except for the Self-Report
      Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Prescription (Rx) Opioids questionnaire (SR-MAD) which has
      undergone several rounds of content validation but requires further validation. The SR-MAD
      has been substantially modified to meet the needs of PMR Studies 2065-1A and 2065-4B and has
      been renamed the Prescription Opioid Misuse and Abuse Questionnaire (POMAQ). The POMAQ will
      undergo content validation via qualitative interviews (Protocol 2065-2A [Qualitative]) prior
      to use in this validation study (Protocol 2065-2A [Quantitative]).

      This quantitative study will seek to further develop and validate the POMAQ following the
      general tenants according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry,
      Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling
      Claims (FDA 2009) which emphasizes the importance of conducting sound psychometric evaluation
      of patient-reported instruments through quantitative research methods. However, it should be
      noted that the POMAQ is not a typical PRO measure capturing a specific latent construct and
      the specified analytic approach to the POMAQ reflects this difference in theoretical
      frameworks.
