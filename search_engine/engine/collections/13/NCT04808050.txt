    
      This is a non-interventional, multi-country, multicentre, retrospective study designed to
      determine the treatment patterns and associated survival rate in patients with primary stage
      IA to IIIB resectable NSCLC diagnosed between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 and
      followed until at least 31 December 2020. This study will also determine the prevalence of
      EGFR mutations and PD-L1 expression, and the clinical outcomes as per the treatment patterns
      and clinico-pathological staging. Data will be collected retrospectively from the patients'
      medical records from the date of initial diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC (index date) to the
      end of follow up ie, until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction,
      whichever is the earliest. The data on treatment modalities, sociodemographic,
      clinico-pathological characteristics, and exposure and outcome variables (ie, medical and
      treatment history, disease staging, biomarker assessments, radiological findings, concomitant
      medications, survival), factor(s) for prescribing neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment and
      reason(s) for discontinuation will be extracted from patients' medical records.
