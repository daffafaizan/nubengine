      prevention of chronic pain. It has been shown that the endocannabinoid system modifies
      excitatory and inhibitory currents in structures involved in the development of chronic pain
      such as the amygdala.

      CRPS is a neuropathic pain condition, which is known to become chronic in a significant
      percentage. The study compares the effect of low dose Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (90 days)
      and placebo in acute CRPS. All patients will receive a standard treatment consisting of drug
      therapy and physiotherapy.
