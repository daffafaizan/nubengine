      two devices. A video camera will be placed in each subject room for recording the
      repositioning events to correlate the monitor signals with the actual subject repositioning
      captured by the video. The goal of the trial is to validate the ability of each of the sensor
      prototypes to accurately detect when subjects are turned, in order to reduce stationary
      positioning which contributes to the incidence of pressure ulcers and to improve compliance
      with patient repositioning trials. The repositioning events recorded by the sensor devices
      will be automatically uploaded and abstracted by the research team, along with the events
      captured by the simultaneous video recording of patient repositioning.
