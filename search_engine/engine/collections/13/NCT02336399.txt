      enrolled and observed for 96 weeks. Serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe will
      be measured every 3 months during the observation period. Their liver function and chemistry
      tests are also performed every 3 months. The liver ultrasonic examination would be taken
      every 3-6 months. The primary measurement is the percentage of patients who have positive
      HBsAg and/or a detectable level of HBV DNA. Following the completion of the study period,
      patients will be offered to participate in a long term study for further observation of
      additional 144 weeks.
