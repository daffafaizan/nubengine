      infected individuals do not require treatment to clear the virus, but the remainder can
      become chronically infected with HCV. Both resolution and protection correlate with the
      presence of HCV-specific T cells responses. The researchers believe that dendritic cells
      (DCs) play a role in determining how T-cells respond to the virus. They believe that the
      virus is able to modify the function of these cells causing the inactivation of T cells that
      would otherwise react with the virus. By characterizing the phenotype and function of DCs in
      both the patients who spontaneously resolve the infection and patients who become chronically
      infected the investigators hope to learn more about the pathogenesis of HCV.

      People interested in participating in this study will have a complete history and general
      medical examinations before beginning the study. Testing for communicable diseases, including
      hepatitis B, syphilis and HIV will be done. If a disease is found you will be informed and
      offered counseling.

      Following the screening, you will have a procedure called leukapheresis, in which white blood
      cells are removed, but your own red blood cells are returned. The procedure takes
      approximately 3 hours and is similar to blood donation. The leukapheresis is done during a
      same day admission to the hospital by an outside blood collection company with trained nurses
      and certified equipment.

      Some aspects of this study are experimental which means the fluid and cells collected will be
      studied and analyzed to determine more precisely how your body's immune system is responding
      to the virus. These tests are experimental in that they are not part of the usual routine
      care of patients.
