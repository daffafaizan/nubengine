      designs. The impact of WSS after stent implantation may impact future vessel healing after
      current generation drug-eluting stents implantation. Although previous studies used IVUS
      (intravascular ultrasound) and angiography to determine WSS from computational fluid dynamics
      (CFD) simulations, new methods using higher resolution OCT (optical coherence tomography) are
      warranted to further evaluate the impact of stent design on WSS with current generation
      drug-eluting stents.

      Methods: For these purpose, we will enroll a total of 30 patients with stable angina who are
      scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention. Those patients were randomized to
      thin-strut (81μm) 2-link Promus element (PE: n=10), thin-strut (81μm) 3-link Xience Prime
      (XP: n=10), or thick-strut (145μm) 2-link Nobori stents (NO: n=10) and underwent OCT and
      coronary CT angiography (CTA) after stenting. Post stent WSS was calculated using CFD
      simulations based on patient-specific reconstructed 3D arteries created by the fusion of OCT
      and CTA data, normalized using WSS in the proximal unstented region. Also, follow-up
      angiography and OCT are performed for the assessment of vessel healing as well as WSS
      distribution 8months after stent implantation.
