      carried out from January to July 2016.

      Trained evaluators applied the research instruments, the data were collected in the Faculty
      of Health Sciences of Trairi (FACISA). Other volunteers were responsible for conducting the
      intervention, other than those that evaluated.

      A physiotherapeutic exercise program was applied during a period of six months, twice a week,
      with duration of 1 hour each session, assessing the elders before and after six months of
      intervention.

      The same exercise program was performed, both on soil as in the swimming pool, following
      these steps: (1) measurement of vital signs at the beginning and at the end of the
      intervention: Systemic Arterial Pressure (SAP), Heart Rate (HR), Oxygen Saturation (Sp02),
      (2) Stretching from the lateral flexors of the cervical spine, elbow flexors and extensors,
      trunk lateral flexors, flexors and extensors of hip with support of 30 seconds (1x30), (3)
      aerobic workout through front and lateral gait walking for 20 minutes, (4) resisted exercise
      for upper limbs (anterior, middle and posterior deltoid, biceps, triceps) and to the lower
      limbs (abductors, flexors and extensors of hip and flexors and extensors knee, calf), using
      dumbbells and shin guards for the resistance (20 minutes), (5) balance and proprioception
      training through front and backward walking on mattresses, march in a straight line with one
      foot in front of the other, one-feet support orthostatism, touching some points marked on the
      ground with the toe (15 minutes).

      The resisted exercise was conducted based on one maximum repetition (1MR), being used a 60%
      load, increasing the number of repetitions (2 repetitions) every month, starting with 2 sets
      of 8 repetitions in the first month, 2x10, 2x12, 2x14, 2x16 in the second, third, fourth and
      fifth month, respectively, ending with 2 x 18 with 60% of 1MR load and rest time of one
      minute between each series using dumbbells and shin guards for the resistance. In the pool,
      2kg of water was used, maintaining the same series and repetitions in soil. The control group
      did not perform any of the interventions.
