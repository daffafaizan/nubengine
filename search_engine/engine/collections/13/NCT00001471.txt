      CD4 lymphopenia (ICL) and, for comparison, HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers (hereafter
      referred to as healthy volunteers), can provide insights into the pathogenesis of HIV
      infection and ICL. This protocol will provide a mechanism for sampling tissue sites. A total
      of 430 HIV-infected patients, 100 ICL patients and 105 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in
      these studies. To assess changes in viral load and immunological parameters at sites outside
      the bloodstream during therapy of HIV-infected patients, sequential tonsillar, lymph node, or
      intestinal biopsies, or bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be undertaken
      during the course of therapy. In a small number of patients, sequential or simultaneous lymph
      node biopsies will be performed. In addition, uninfected healthy volunteers will be enrolled
      to have a tonsillar or intestinal biopsy, or bronchoscopy with BAL; this will allow
      comparison of immunologic parameters in HIVinfected and uninfected tonsillar or intestinal
      tissues, or BAL fluid. Finally, ICL patients may have tissue sampling to assess lymphocyte
      distribution and possible function in tissues to better understand the pathogenesis of their
      lymphopenia. Sequential or simultaneous tissue sampling may occur and longitudinal samples
      may also be obtained to assess stability in tissue compartments or effect of possible
      immunomodulatory treatments.
