    
      All patients with chronic periodontitis (age 30 years and older) attending the selected
      Public Dental clinics in VG are eligible. The patients should have at least 8 teeth with
      pathological pockets (probing pocket depth ≥5 mm and bleeding on probing). Only patients
      providing signed informed consent are included.

      Reported data in the study by Wennström et al. (J Clin Periodontol 2005) were used for power
      calculation. Thus, a total sample of 834 patients will provide a power of 95% at a
      significance level of p<0.05 to detect a difference of 5% in proportion of sites with "pocket
      closure" i.e. PPD ≤4 mm and BoP negative (primary efficacy variable) between treatment
      groups. For a power of 80% a total sample of 506 patients is required.
