    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center, phase 1 study in normal healthy
      volunteers. Each subject will have a 60 minute exposure to two 5.0 × 5.5 cm NGX-4010 patches.
      In addition, two 5.0 × 5.5 cm comparable untreated control skin areas will be identified and
      evaluated. At baseline and prior to skin punch biopsy at Weeks 1 (± 1 day), 12 (± 3 days) and
      24 (± 7 days), QST of patch-treated and untreated control skin areas will be performed and
      evaluated. QST for cooling detection threshold and heat-pain threshold, and assessment of
      mechanical (sharp pain) sensation and tactile threshold will be performed at each of the two
      patch-treated and two untreated control skin areas. Serial skin punch biopsies of
      patch-treated and untreated control skin areas will be obtained and evaluated at Weeks 1 (± 1
      day), 12 (± 3 days), and 24 (± 7 days). Skin at the patch-treated and untreated control skin
      areas will be anesthetized with subcutaneous 1% lidocaine, and then three millimeter (mm)
      skin biopsies will be obtained with a sterile punch tool from each of the designated areas.
      Biopsy specimens will be fixed overnight, then cryoprotected in a phosphate buffered solution
      until processed. Thick sections will be cut and immunostained for localization and
      quantification of nerve fibers in the epidermis and visualization of the subepidermal plexus
      using antibodies to PGP 9.5. Antibodies to type IV collagen will be used to identify the
      basement membrane and superficial blood vessels in the biopsy microsections. Vital signs and
      adverse events (AEs) will be collected at each visit. Clinical laboratory tests will be
      performed at the Screening Visit and at the Termination Visit (Week 24).
