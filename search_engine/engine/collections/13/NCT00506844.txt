    
      Daily fractions of radiotherapy at 1.8 Gy to total of 45 Gy to tumor and draining lymph nodes
      and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy to the tumor are delivered concurrently with
      chemotherapy.

      Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 is given intravenously on D-6 (1 week before radiation), followed by 250
      mg/m2 once a week (D 1, 8, 15, 22 & 29).

      Administration of irinotecan and capecitabine starts on day 1 of radiotherapy. Capecitabine
      is administered orally at a dose of 825 mg/m2 twice daily during weekdays (Monday to Friday)
      during radiotherapy. Irinotecan 40 mg/m2 is given intravenously once a week (D 1, 8, 15, 22 &
      29).

      Four to eight weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, curative surgery is performed.

      Safety evaluation of the study will be performed after the first 6 patients treated. If more
      than 1 out of 6 patients received less than 70-80% of planned dose of capecitabine or
      irinotecan, the dosage of chemotherapy in the further study patients will be adjusted by a
      protocol amendment.
