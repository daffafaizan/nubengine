    
      1. To enroll 50 cases of patients suffering from carotid artery stenosis continuously, the
           investigators perform contrast enhanced ultrasound on patients for identifying the
           vulnerable plagues and taking high resolution MR inspection to analysis those plagues at
           the same time.

        2. All patients undergo carotid endarterectomy. The vulnerable ingredients of carotid
           plaques such as intraplaque neovascularization and bleeding are identified by
           pathological examination and immunohistochemical staining.

        3. To evaluate the accuracy of CEUS for identifying carotid vulnerable plague compared with
           high resolution MR.

        4. The investigators divide patients into the stable group and the vulnerable group based
           on the results of CEUS inspection. To analysis the incidence of postoperative
           complications such as stroke and mortality within 30 days and to compare the differences
           between the two groups.
