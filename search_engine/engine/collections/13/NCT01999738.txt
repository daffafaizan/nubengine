    
      In part A, EC1456 will be dose escalated on 4 concurrently enrolling schedules.

      Treatment 1 is EC1456 BIW on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week schedule (BIW); Treatment 2 is
      EC1456 QW on Days 1 and 8 of a 3-week schedule (QW); Treatment 3 is EC1456 QW on Days 1, 8,
      and 15 of a 3-week schedule (CWD) and Treatment 4 is EC1456 QIW on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10,
      and 11 of a 3-week schedule (QIW).

      In part B, EC1456 will be dosed on 3 concurrently enrolling schedules:

      Treatment 5 is EC1456 BIW. Once a dose is determined in Part A, Part B will begin with 3-6
      subjects who will receive consecutive day dosing on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9 of a 3-week schedule.
      If this is not tolerated, the BIW cohort will continue with dosing on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of
      a 3-week schedule; Treatment 6 is EC1456 QW on Days 1 and 8 of a 3-week schedule or CWD on
      Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 3-week schedule; Treatment 7 is EC1456 QIW on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9,
      10, and 11 of a 3-week schedule for at least two cycles. If the patient is eligible to
      continue treatment (based upon treatment response and tolerability), he/she may opt to
      continue on the QIW schedule or change to the Treatment 6 regimen schedule (once its MTD and
      schedule have been determined).
