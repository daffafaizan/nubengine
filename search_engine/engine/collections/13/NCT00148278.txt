      importance of carrying out a clinical trial to clarify the use of epinephrine, norepinephrine
      and dobutamine in the management of multiple organ failure associated with severe sepsis. The
      main objective of the study was therefore to compare the effects of the combination of
      dobutamine and norepinephrine to those of epinephrine alone in patients with septic shock. In
      this purpose, patients were randomly assigned to receive either epinephrine or norepinephrine
      plus dobutamine and drugs were titrated to maintain blood pressure over 70 mmHg. Main outcome
      was 28-day mortality.
