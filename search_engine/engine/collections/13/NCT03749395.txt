      analgesia is the onus for all anesthetists. Ineffective pain relief impedes deep breathing,
      coughing, and remobilization culminating in atelectasis and pneumonia.The erector spinae
      plane (ESP) block is a newly-described technique for treating thoracic pain, and has several
      advantages that make it an attractive alternative to these more invasive
      procedures.Ultrasound guided erector spinae (ESP) block is a regional anesthesia technique,
      recently described by (Forero; et al.) for use in thoracic neuropathic pain. ESP block is
      reported to lead to analgesic effect on somatic and visceral pain by effecting the ventral
      rami and rami communicantes that include sympathetic nerve fibers, as LA spreads through the
      paravertebral space . When performed bilaterally it has been reported to be as effective as
      thoracic epidural analgesia.ESP block leads to effective postoperative analgesia when
      performed at T 4-5 level for breast and thoracic surgery. The ESP block , will be performed
      as follow:The patient will be placed in a sitting position and the ultrasound probe will be
      placed in a longitudinal orientation 3 cm lateral to the T5 spinous process. Three muscles
      were identified superficial to the hyperechoic transverse process shadow as follows:
      trapezius, rhomboid major, and erector spinae . the needle will be inserted in a
      cephalad-to-caudad direction until the tip lay deep to erector spinae muscles, as evidenced
      by visible linear spread of fluid beneath muscle upon injection . A total of 20 mL of 0.25%
      bupivacaine will be injected here.
