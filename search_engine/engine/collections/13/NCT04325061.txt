      etiology characterized by a diffuse, severe inflammatory process of the lung leading to acute
      hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). Pulmonary infections are
      the leading causes of ARDS. Clinical and experimental research has established a strong
      association between dysregulated systemic and pulmonary inflammation and progression or
      delayed resolution of ARDS.

      The COVID-19 pandemic is a critical moment for the world. Severe pneumonia is the main
      condition leading to ARDS requiring weeks of MV with high mortality (40-60%) in COVID-19
      patients. There is no specific therapy for Covid-19, although patients are receiving drugs
      that are already approved for treating other diseases. There has been great interest in the
      role of corticosteroids to attenuate the pulmonary and systemic damage in ARDS patients
      because of their potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. However, the efficacy
      of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial.

      We justify the need of this study based on the positive results of a recent clinical trial by
      our group, showing that dexamethasone for 10 days was able to reduce the duration of
      mechanical ventilation (MV) and increase hospital survival in patients with ARDS from
      multiple causes (Villar J et al. Lancet Respir Med 2020). Dexamethasone has never been
      evaluated in viral ARDS in a randomized controlled fashion. Our goal in this study is to
      examine the effects of dexamethasone on hospital mortality and on ventilator-free days in
      patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS due to confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted into a
      network of Spanish intensive care units (ICUs).
