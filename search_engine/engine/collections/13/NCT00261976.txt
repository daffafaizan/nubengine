    
      The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety information on infliximab (Remicade)
      from patients who participate in research studies using those drugs. All patients in these
      studies are being asked to participate in this long-term safety follow-up study which will
      provide important information about the study drug. The long-term effect of the study drug on
      survival, serious infections, new malignancies and new autoimmune diseases will be measured
      from data collected over a 5-year period. Additional information about possible delayed
      allergic reactions (possible fever, rash, fatigue, joint pain) will also be collected if you
      received infliximab (Remicade) after the end of the primary study. Study participation in
      this research study is 5 years after the end of the primary study. Questionnaires will be
      completed about patient's health and the occurrence of these safety events at intervals of 6
      months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years after patients complete participation
      in the primary study.
