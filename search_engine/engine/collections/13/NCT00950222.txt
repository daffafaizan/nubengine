      the case for ventilator-associated pneumonia, frequently occurring during intensive care unit
      (ICU) hospitalization, and whose 48 first hours of treatment are decisive.

      It is well established that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of antibiotics are
      correlated with their clinical and microbiological effectiveness. However in ICU patients,
      pharmacokinetic parameters of antibiotics suffer great variations, and bacteria responsible
      for these infections are usually less sensitive to antibiotics, especially Gram negative
      bacilli (GNB). An important pharmacodynamic variability may occur at the initial phase of the
      antibiotic treatment, decisive for the infection's outcome.

      We propose to evaluate the correlation between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of
      the empirical antibiotic therapy and the microbiological and clinical outcome of VAP.
