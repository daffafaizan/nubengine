           NEUROLAC® nerve guide, is indicated to protect a peripheral nerve end and to separate
           the nerve from surrounding environment to reduce the development of a symptomatic
           neuroma. NEUROCAP® is composed of the same biocompatible, bioresorbable copolyester
           composing the NEUROLAC® nerve guide, Poly(68/32[15/85 D/L] Lactide-Ԑ-Caprolactone)
           (PLCL).

        2. Objective This post-market surveillance study is conducted to provide post market
           surveillance information regarding long-term performance and ease of use of the
           Polyganics nerve capping device (NEUROCAP®) for reduction of the development of
           peripheral symptomatic end-neuroma.

        3. Study design This post-market surveillance study consists of a cohort study to provide
           post market surveillance information regarding long-term performance and ease of use of
           the NEUROCAP® for reduction of the development of peripheral symptomatic end-neuroma in
           the upper and lower extremity. Sub analyses will be performed regarding demographics and
           medical background.
