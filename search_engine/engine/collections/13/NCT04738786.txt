    
      Randomization

        -  The randomized allocation table was made by stratified block randomization methods with
           1:1 ratio according to each participating surgeon and tumor stage.

        -  Baseline number (BN) should be provided to the subjects in the order of the date of
           surgery.

      Surgical Procedure

        -  The study includes T1-2N0 oral tongue cancer patients. For the management of the primary
           lesion, wide resection with 1.0- or 1.5-cm surgical safety margin should be performed
           according to the results of study allocation.

        -  Neck management can be resection of primary tumor without neck dissection, with
           ipsilateral or bilateral neck dissection (guided by tumor location) or with sentinel
           lymph node biopsy, according to the NCCN guideline (version 1.2021).

      Evaluation of the surgical safety margin

        -  The surgical safety margin should be meticulously evaluated in the pathology specimens
           in all directions.

        -  The surgical margins less than 0.3 or 0.5 cm in final pathology results are considered
           as the close surgical margin.

      Adjuvant Treatment

        -  The adjuvant treatments either radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy are conducted if
           indicated following the NCCN guideline.

        -  The follow-up after completion of the definitive treatment are made following the NCCN
           guideline.

      Efficacy evaluation

        -  The primary outcomes are determined with 2-year local control rates after the completion
           of the curative treatments.

        -  The secondary outcomes are determined with the 5-year disease-free survival rates and
           speech/articulation functional analysis.
