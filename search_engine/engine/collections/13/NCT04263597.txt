    
      This phase I/IIa study is a single center prospective study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital
      Medical Center (CCHMC).

      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of various doses of 2FL. Eligible patients
      will be allocated to the following arms as determined by age at enrollment:

      Arm 1: 0-5 years; Arm 2: 5.1-10 years; Arm 3: >10 years

      The investigators will enroll 5 patients of ages â‰¥10 years undergoing allogeneic HSCT. 2'-FL
      will be administered to these patients from day-7 until day+30 after HSCT at the starting
      dose. Once safety is determined the investigators will then enroll an additional 5 patients
      of ages 5-10 years and administer 2'FL to these patients at the proposed dose for this age
      group from day-7 to day+30 after HSCT. Once safety is determined, the investigators will
      enroll 5 patients of ages 0-5 years and administer 2'FL at starting doses to children from
      day-7 to day+30 after HSCT. Once safety is established in these patients we will proceed with
      the randomized portion of the study.

      Patients will be enrolled in each arm and randomized 1:1 to either receive 2FL or placebo (2
      g oral glucose). After 20 patients are enrolled at the first dose level for an arm,
      enrollment of that arm will be paused and all patients will be evaluated for safety and
      tolerability. The randomization for the 20 patients will be unblinded and the safety and
      tolerability of 2FL doses will be compared to placebo for that arm. If 6/10 patients can take
      80% of their planned doses, that dose level will be determined as tolerable and a dose
      escalation will be performed. If 5/10 patients are unable to take at least 80% of planned
      doses the dose will be determined to not be well tolerated and a dose de-escalation will be
      done.
