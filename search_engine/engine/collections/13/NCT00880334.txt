           considered equally likely to work, participants will be randomized into one of two study
           groups: docetaxel plus Vandetanib or docetaxel plus placebo.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts three weeks during which time the participant will be taking
           Vandetanib or placebo once a day, every day. On Day 1 of each cycle (a cycle is 21
           days), participants will receive docetaxel as an infusion through a vein in the arm over
           one hour.

        -  On Day 1 of every cycle the following tests and procedures will be performed: physical
           exam and blood tests. On day 1 and on Day 8 of the first cycle only, participants will
           have an ECG. Every 6-9 weeks (every 2 to 3 cycles), the participants tumor will be
           assessed by x-ray, CT scan, bone scan, and/or MRI.
