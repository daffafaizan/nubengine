      Patients in group A will have previously failed a VEGF receptor inhibitor but not an mTOR
      inhibitor, while patients in group B will have failed both a VEGF receptor inhibitor and an
      mTOR inhibitor. Evaluation of each group will be performed separately. The goals of this
      study are:

        1. To measure clinical benefit defined as an objective tumor response using RESIST or
           progression-free survival for more than 12 weeks in patients with metastatic carcinoma
           of the kidney who have failed or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor

        2. To evaluate the safety of perifosine in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the kidney
           who have failed or have progressed on a VEGF receptor inhibitor.

      Treatment Phase/duration of treatment: All patients will be treated with daily perifosine at
      100 mg PO daily until tumor progression (by the RECIST criteria) or unacceptable toxicity.
      Once radiological disease progression has been documented by the treating physician, the
      patient will go off study. Patients are encouraged to have two measurements for confirmation
      of progression.

      Follow-Up Phase: All patients will be followed-up for SAEs until at least 30 days after
      discontinuation of perifosine. All patients who are discontinued from perifosine for any
      reason other than disease progression will continue to have tumor assessments until the
      patient has documented disease progression or has begun other therapies.
