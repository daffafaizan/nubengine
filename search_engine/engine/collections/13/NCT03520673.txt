      older. GPs follow standard processes to investigate signs of cancer, or more serious
      conditions but do not have access to tools to identify and manage more common symptoms of
      LUTS. This means men are likely to be referred to a urologist in secondary care, where they
      will receive advice or treatment that could have been given in primary care if GPs had more
      access to better diagnostic tools. The PriMUS Study will compare the results of the simple
      index tests, with the results of the urodynamic reference test, to identify which combination
      of simple index tests give the best prediction of the urodynamics diagnosis. The top
      performing simple index tests will be incorporated into the clinical decision support tool so
      that GPs can manage patients without needing invasive urodynamics. Follow up will be
      conducted 6 months post involvement; collating the treatment and management decisions made as
      a result of these procedures. The study will also consider and explore practicalities and
      acceptability of the urodynamic procedure and clinical decision support tool for both
      patients and clinical staff by conducting separate qualitative work.
