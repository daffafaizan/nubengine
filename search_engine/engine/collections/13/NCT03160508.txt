      fracture of the femur treated with the TFNA. Post-operatively patients will be asked to wear
      a sensor insole in their shoes for up to 3 months after surgical treatment. The sensor insole
      will be used in both feet and will not have any impact in patient's activities of daily
      living while allowing real time measurements of weight bearing.

      In addition to weight bearing measurements, perceived pain (numeric rating scale), mobility
      (Parker Mobility Score and Time Up and Go Test) will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks after
      surgical treatment and in conjunction with the standard (routine) of care follow up schedule.
      In order to investigate the relationship between these variables and the weight bearing
      measurements, patients or their care takers or assisting family members will be asked to
      document the daily use of the insole in a diary.

      Finally, over the course of the study, anticipated adverse events (AE) that may affect the
      healing process will be collected. Special attention will be given to implant- or
      bone-related AEs. Images from patients with implant- or bone related AEs will be collected as
      per standard of care
