      thoracolumbosacral orthoses (TLSOs, braces) commonly used to prevent continued curve
      progression in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). The brace applies
      corrective forces to the muscular and bony structures of the spine while preserving range of
      motion (ROM). The orthosis is prefabricated and adjusted for each patient. A series of
      semi-rigid segments encircle the patient's torso in close contact and are joined by a
      structure of flexible elements. These flexible (or elastic) elements generate stabilizing
      forces, providing the necessary immobilization while allowing relative motion of the
      semi-rigid segments. To date, this brace has been tested in the lab on healthy volunteers.

      This study will recruit patients currently using a TLSO and compare the curve correction
      achieved in the GSM brace to that in their current brace. After 3 months in the GSM brace,
      the out-of-brace Cobb angle will be measured and compared to that at enrollment. Safety will
      be continually assessed. Brace-related quality of life (comfort, stress, interference with
      activities) will be self-reported. Adherence to the brace prescription will be measured using
      an in-brace temperature monitor.
