    
      Step 1 - Practice based pharmacist and medical review using database search for the
      following:

        -  Anti-parkinson drug therapy (excluding anticholinergic monotherapy).

        -  Disease codes to identify Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism, and exclude other
           diagnoses where anti-parkinson therapy may be used, although both are expected to be
           very small numbers (pituitary tumour, restless leg syndrome)

        -  To identify the duration of parkinsonism from the date of entry of the disease code.

        -  Pharmacy re-fill data to identify intermittent usage of treatment as an indicator of it
           being unlikely that the patient has idiopathic or dopa responsive parkinsonism.

        -  To identify patients on monotherapy with anti-parkinson therapy e.g. Selegiline for a
           prolonged duration as this is likely to suggest an alternative diagnosis.

        -  To record drug dosage over time, e.g. on an annual basis, again to identify whether
           patients fit in with the expected rates of change for degenerative parkinsonism where
           increasing combinations of drugs at higher doses are used over time.

      Step 2 - Review of case records:

      · Parkinson's disease nurse specialist and medical review of case records to identify
      additional clinical features of the condition and assist in identifying cases where it
      appears likely that anti-parkinson drug treatment is not helping the patient's condition.

      Step 3 - Specialist out-patient review and follow-up:

      · Invitation to the patient to attend the combined neurology/medicine for the elderly
      movement disorder clinic service where scoring against diagnostic clinical criteria would be
      undertaken, and where appropriate tapering of anti-parkinson therapy gradually under
      continued specialist observation.
