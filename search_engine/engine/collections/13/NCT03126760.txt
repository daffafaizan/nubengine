      stopped at all sites because of COVID-19. Overall Recruitment Status is "Active, Not
      Recruiting". The Actual Number of Participants is still "Anticipated". When it is safe,
      Overall Recruiting Status will change back to "Recruiting". When that happens, look at
      Locations to see which sites have started recruiting again.

      Subjects with RRMS who have experienced a relapse and who will receive 3 to 5 (given over a
      period of up to 7 days) days of treatment with high dose steroids (oral or IV) within 14 days
      of the onset of relapse symptoms are candidates for the current study. At 14 (Â± 1) days
      following the initiation of high dose steroids, subjects will be re-assessed with the
      Expanded Disability Status Scale/Functional Systems Score (EDSS/FSS) and subjects who do not
      improve by at least 1 point on the FSS will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive
      subcutaneous (SC) Acthar 1 mL (80 U) once a day (QD) or SC matching placebo 1 mL QD for 14
      days. Follow-up visits then occur at 14, 28 and 42 days.
