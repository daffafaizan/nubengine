    
      NutriNet-Santé is a large-scale (n=170,000) web-based cohort coordinated by EREN, launched in
      France in 2009 to investigate nutrition and health relationships. All required ethics
      authorisations have been obtained (listed here). NutriNet-Santé participants regularly fill
      questionnaires through a dedicated and secure website, providing extensive, high-quality
      nutritional and non-nutritional data, including repeated data on socio-demographics and
      lifestyle (yearly), anthropometrics (every 6 months), dietary intake (every 6 months),
      physical activity (IPAQ questionnaire, yearly)5 and health status (every 6 months).
      NutriNet-Santé is characterised by a very detailed and up-to-date assessment of nutritional
      exposure and dietary behaviours. Usual dietary intakes are assessed at baseline and every 6
      months thereafter through a series of 3 non-consecutive randomly assigned 24h dietary
      records. Daily energy, alcohol, micro- and macronutrient intakes are calculated using the
      published NutriNet-Santé food composition database (>3,500 generic items). All major health
      events (e.g., cancers, cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases) are reported by the participants
      and validated by an expert committee of physicians based on medical records, and/or retrieved
      from the French National Health Insurance medico-administrative databases to limit potential
      reporting bias. In turn, mortality data are obtained from the exhaustive French National
      Mortality Registry (CépiDC). The number of incident events already registered is as follows:
      3,800 cancers and 1,240 deaths. A sub-sample of the cohort (n=20,000) provided blood and
      urine samples, currently stored at -80°C in EREN's biobank.
