    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent and important contributor to symptoms and morbidity in
      patients with mitral valve (MV) disease.Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the left atrium (LA)
      during open- heart surgery has emerged as a novel surgical modality for the treatment of AF.
      Although RFA therapy of the LA is being increasingly offered to patients with chronic AF
      undergoing MV surgery, its efficacy has not been tested in the context of an adequately
      powered randomized study. The aim of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to
      evaluate the early and late outcome following left atrial RFA during MV surgery for the
      treatment of continuous AF and to assess the functional effects of restoration of SR.

      Patients were randomized to undergo MV surgery or MV surgery plus RFA of the LA. Additional
      cardiac procedures were performed as required.

      The primary outcome endpoint was the presence of SR at 12 months. Secondary endpoints
      included patient functional status and exercise capacity, LA contractility, and LA and left
      ventricular (LV) dimension and function and plasma levels of B-Type natriuretic peptide
      (BNP).
