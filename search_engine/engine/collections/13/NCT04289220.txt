    
      Using piggyBac transposon/transposase system to deliver genes into primary human T cells -
      example expression of CD19 CAR.CARs specific to the human CD19 antigen were used. All CARs
      contained the scFv against human CD19 (clone FMC-63), The third BBz CD28z CAR consisted of
      the scFv linked to the intracellular domains of CD28, 4-1BB and CD3z through a CD28
      transmembrane domain;

      Subjects with relapsed/refractory CD19-positive B-cell Lymphoma or B-ALL can participate if
      all eligibility criteria are met. All patients received chemotherapy with fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide before the infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells.. After the infusion, subjects
      will accept follow-up for side effects and effect of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells.

      Follow-up :

      Safety and adverse events (safety and tolerability of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy within 14
      days): The number and severity of adverse events, an evaluation of their association with the
      anti-CD19 CAR-T cell treatment, and the outcome of the adverse events. Possible adverse
      events include cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, reversible neurotoxicity,
      hypogammaglobulinemia, etc. CT was used to evaluate B-lymphoma lesions. B-ALL bone marrow
      samples were collected by bone marrow aspiration to assess minimal residual disease. Flow
      cytometry was used to detect proportion of T cells, B cells, and NK cells in the blood, and
      expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, anti-CD19 CAR to determine the effect of anti-CD19 CAR-T
      treatment. Plasma levels of the cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-Î±, IL-2, GM-CSF, IL-10, and IL-6
      were also determined.

      Data analysis:

      Overall survival and progress free survival were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, using
      all enrolled patients to determine overall survival.

      Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized.
