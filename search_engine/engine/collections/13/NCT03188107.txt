      crying, discomfort ect. But with "Infant Motor Profile (IMP)" it is possible to assess motor
      behavior of risky infants in their daily environment. The assessment relays on video
      recordings so after recording the motor behavior many people can score the same children many
      times to have a certain idea about the infant. With this tool it could be easier to set a
      therapy program after determining the basic motor problem. In Turkey there are a lot of risky
      infants which later have diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy, Metabolic Disorders and other
      diseases. Also there are a lot of infants with Down Syndrome (DS) and Spina Bifida (SB). It
      has been known motor development is impaired with different childhood conditions but there is
      less information in literature about motor development of children with SB, DS and other
      diseases. With this study motor status of risky infants between 3- 24 months old will be
      explored, interrater and intrarater reliability of Infant Motor Profile will be analyzed.
