      I. To determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma
      treated with vorinostat and bortezomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Evaluate the
      progression-free survival and median overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily on days 1-14. Patients also receive
      bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 2 years.
      (As of Addendum 7, patient follow-up no longer required.)
