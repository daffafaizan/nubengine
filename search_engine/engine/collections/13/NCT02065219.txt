    
      This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in subjects with severe
      pain after open groin hernia, examines the effect of an ultra-sound guided local anesthetic
      block of a trigger-point, situated near the spermatic cord at the superficial inguinal ring.
      In order to compare effects and distribution of the blocks in patients vs. healthy subjects,
      the block is tested and examined in volunteers using a similar methodology.
