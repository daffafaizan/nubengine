      the dose of 1 ml syringe with 100mg/ml. TXA will be prepared under sterile conditions.

      injection will be repeated every two weeks for three months. The other side of the face will
      be randomly assigned to low power fractional CO2 laser with a power of 12 watts, spacing 700
      micrometers (low density), and dwell time 300 microsecond every four weeks for three months.
