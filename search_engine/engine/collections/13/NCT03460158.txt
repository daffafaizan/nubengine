      including facial volume loss, and attenuation of the static and dynamic rhytid. Despite
      widespread use of volumizing fillers there is little data quantifying the subjective benefit
      of these minimally invasive treatments from the patient perspective. Furthermore, there is
      little data comparing the subjective benefit with true objective volumetric results. Such
      data will provide much needed information for patient counselling and treatment optimization
      for patient perceived outcomes.

      This study is to determine the patient reported outcomes of three different dermal fillers
      and establish the volumetric changes over 90 days. Screening will be performed during the
      patient's office visit. Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled. Patients will
      participate up to 90 days (Day 1, 14 days, 28 days, and 90 days).
