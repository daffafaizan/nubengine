    
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study of Volitinib (HMPL-504)
      administered orally once every day(QD) to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors.There are two stages to this study : a dose-escalation stage and a dose-expansion
      stage. The dose-escalation stage is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of single dose and repeat doses of HMPL-504 given once every day (QD). An
      alternative dosing schedule of twice every day (BID) may be investigated if pharmacokinetic
      studies indicate faster than anticipated clearance of HMPL-504.

      All patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for
      30 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects of this study will be permitted to
      continue therapy with only safety monitoring and bimonthly assessments for progression, if
      the product is well tolerated and the subject has stable disease or better.
