      21% in 2004. Although the indications for labor induction vary, labor inductions as an
      obstetrical practice are associated with an increased risk of Cesarean delivery. As such, the
      rise in labor inductions has been paralleled by a rise in the cesarean rate to an all time
      high of 30%. The risk of cesarean can be mitigated with the use of cervical ripening agents
      in the setting of an unfavorable cervix. Both pharmacological ripening agents and mechanical
      methods are currently available for cervical priming. Methods available for mechanical
      dilation include, but are not limited to transcervical foley catheter alone and transcervical
      foley catheter with an extra-amniotic saline infusion or EASI. The potential advantage of
      EASI to transcervical foley catheter alone is the promotion of endogenous prostaglandin
      release by membrane stripping and supplying additional mechanical force. It may be
      disadvantageous by increasing the risk of chorioamnionitis or by diluting the prostaglandins
      that are released by membrane stripping. There have been two randomized trials comparing
      foley alone to foley with EASI. Because the results of these two trials are conflicting, we
      chose to conduct a randomized clinical trial of foley catheter compared to foley catheter
      with an EASI for labor induction and cervical ripening in women with an unfavorable cervix.
