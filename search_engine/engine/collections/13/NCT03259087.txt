    
      This is an open-label, 2-part single dose study: Part 1 will include participants with mild,
      moderate, and severe renal impairment (as well as healthy control participants), and Part 2
      will include participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing HD. Participants in
      Part 1 will receive a single IV dose of MK-3866, and plasma and urine samples will be
      collected over pre-specified time intervals. Participants in Part 2 will receive a single IV
      dose of MK-3866 on two separate occasions: in Period 1 immediately following their
      normally-scheduled HD, and in Period 2 approximately 30 minutes prior to their
      normally-scheduled HD. Plasma, urine, and dialysate samples will be collected over
      pre-specified time intervals for Part 2.
