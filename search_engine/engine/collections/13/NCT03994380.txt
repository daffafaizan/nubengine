      asthma remains poorly controlled despite adherence to guideline-based therapy. Currently, no
      targeted biologic therapies are available for neutrophilic asthma. The role of Recombinant
      human deoxyriboneuclease (rhDNase) has not been investigated in refractory asthma. rhDNase
      cleaves extracellular DNA released by neutrophils and other granulocytes, thereby reducing
      the viscosity of mucus. It is known that patients with asthma have higher levels of
      extracellular DNA than normals; however, these levels are lower than DNA levels found in the
      sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis. The benefits of rhDNase in cystic fibrosis have been
      well described. In these patients, use of daily nebulized rhDNase has shown improvement in
      lung function and reduction in exacerbations. Very little is known about DNAse use in
      asthmatics. Case reports have shown benefit when used in acute asthma exacerbations, but
      there are no data on its use as a therapy for neutrophilic asthma.
