      1% of the adult population. The disease is characterised by inflammation of synovial tissue
      (ST) in multiple joints, which often leads to destruction of joint integrity, contributing to
      serious functional impairment and disability. The contributors to its pathology include joint
      inflammation, abnormal cellular and humoral responses, and synovial hyperplasia.
      Ultrasonography is a powerful, non-invasive, and feasible way to evaluate synovial
      hyperplasia and guide its collection by biopsy.
