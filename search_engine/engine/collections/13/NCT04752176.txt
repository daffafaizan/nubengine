    
      Tinnitus is a clinical symptom indicative of abnormal stimulation of the auditory system
      characterized by the perception of chronic sound in the absence of an external sound source
      and that only the affected subject perceives intrusively.Its presence can occur independently
      unilaterally, bilaterally, or be described as perceived in the center of the head and can be
      heard continuously or intermittently at varying levels of intensity and frequency. There are
      two types of tinnitus depending on whether it can be detected with a stethoscope by the
      doctor (objective tinnitus) or only heard by the subject (subjective tinnitus). Many
      consequences, such as anxiety, depression and sleep disorders, linked to suffering from
      tinnitus will impact daily life in different forms.

      Both types of tinnitus may be accompanied by a higher intolerance to noise which is called
      hyperacusis.Hyperacusis is defined as an intolerance (and not a finer sensitivity to sounds)
      to environmental sound levels, the intensity of which, of varying intensity, represents
      neither risk nor inconvenience for people with normal hearing, but which induces discomfort
      or pain in people with hyperacusis.

      In these clinical situations, the ØREBLUE® method is an innovative treatment with the
      objective of eliminating the symptoms of tinnitus and hyperacusis depending on the group to
      which the subject belongs. Its innovative character is based on the design of a sound signal
      processing device, CE marked as medical device, developed by Mayfair Developments. This
      technological innovation has been developed to respond specifically to the hearing profile of
      each subject and to provide personalized rehabilitation of their hearing sphere.
