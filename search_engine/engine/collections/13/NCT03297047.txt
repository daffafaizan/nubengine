      this study. By drawing lots either an immobilization with an upper arm or forearm combicast
      will be performed. Regular controls after 5, 10, 28 days, 4 weeks and 7 weeks will be
      performed to check the rate of displacement, consolidation time, wearing comfort and movement
      of the elbow joint after taking off the cast.
