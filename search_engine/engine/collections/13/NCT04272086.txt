      Abdominal Plane (TAP) vs standard bupivacaine TAP. Blocks will occur post induction and pre
      incision. Only the block team (not the anesthesia team nor the care team) will be unblinded
      and they will not have any impact on the data collection. The entire care team and the
      patient will be blinded. A standardized anesthetic regimen will be employed followed by a
      prescriptive post-operative pain management plan aimed at enhanced recovery. Patients will be
      followed for up to 96 hours and asked about their opiate consumption, pain scores, side
      effects, and recovery.
