      disease, and great attention has been paid to the development of practicable means of
      immunomonitoring. Human activated protein C (Drotrecogin alfa (activated)), an important
      coagulation inhibitor plays a major role in regulating microvascular coagulation,
      inflammation and immunology. Little is known about prognostic vascular biomarkers during the
      time course of patients with severe sepsis.
