      help to re-innovate the fabrication of complete dentures , which would greatly influence
      completely edentulous Patient satisfaction. The introduction of rapid prototyping (RP)Stereo
      lithography (SLA) technology has many advantage as high accuracy, high mechanical strength,
      smooth surface finish with close tolerance and fine details printing, but it has some
      limitation as it is only limited Material, in addition to the high material and equipment
      cost.

      SLA has been used in dental fields like maxillofacial prosthesis , wax pattern fabrication
      for crown bridge , removable partial denture 19, but still complete denture was reported in a
      very few reports indicating that RP is not yet successfully applied in Complete denture
      manufacturing 19-21A randomised trial is therefore needed to asses accurately wether the
      introduction of rapid prototyping in complete denture fabrication is successful or not in
      comparison to the conventional technique and to discover the possible challenges in this
      recent technique and the ways to overcome it.

      Retention of complete dentures and patient satisfaction has been reported in many
      studies22-26. Patients have showed a higher satisfaction, as retention of both maxillary and
      mandibular complete dentures increased.
