      double masked, single site study. A new formulation of an artificial tear containing glycerin
      1% as an active with polylysine-graft-polyethylene glycol as an excipient was compared
      against a leading commercial product with propylene glycol (0.3%) and polyethylene glycol
      (0.4%) as active ingredients with hydroxypropyl-guar as a gelling agent. The primary outcome
      was a comparison of tear film stability after eye drop instillation.
