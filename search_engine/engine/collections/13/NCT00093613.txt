      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY 43-9006 when administered to adults
      with recurrent malignant glioma, receiving (Group A) or not receiving (Group B)
      anticonvulsants known to be metabolized by the P450 hepatic enzyme complex.

      II. To assess and estimate the dose-related toxicities. III. To describe the pharmacokinetics
      of this route of administration, measuring BAY 43-9006, and to assess the pharmacokinetic
      difference between patients taking enzyme-inducing agents and those who are not.

      IV. To estimate overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      the concurrent use of cytochrome P450-inducing anticonvulsants (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28 (once daily on day 1 of course 1
      only). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.
