      laparoscopic and robotic assisted rectal resection for rectal cancer

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the bladder and sexual functions of
      patients who undergo laparoscopic and robotic assisted resection for rectal cancer through a
      randomized controlled trial.

      The secondary outcome measures include

        1. The operative outcome in terms of the complication rate, hospital stay and reoperation
           of the two groups;

        2. The quality of life of the patients and the cost of the two groups

        3. The quality of the resected specimens

        4. The local recurrence rates at two years after the surgery
