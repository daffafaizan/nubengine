      cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between
      rewarming rate during cardiopulmonary bypass and clinical prognosis in patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery. Infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass are randomly
      assigned to either a slow rewarming strategy (0.24 degrees C/min) or a fast rewarming
      strategy (0.5 degrees C/min).
