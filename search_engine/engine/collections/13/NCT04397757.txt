    
      This open-label, randomized, controlled, phase 1 trial will assess the safety and efficacy of
      convalescent plasma in severely ill, hospitalized participants with pneumonia due to
      COVID-19. This study will enroll adults 18 years old and older, including pregnant women.

      A total of 80 eligible participants will be randomized to receive either 2 units of
      convalescent plasma collected from ABO-compatible donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and
      standard of care (treatment arm) or standard of care alone (control arm). Participants in the
      treatment arm will receive 2 units of convalescent plasma on Study Day 1 in addition to
      standard of care.

      Participants will be assessed on study Day 1 (pre-dose), 30 minutes after each unit of
      plasma, on all Study Days while hospitalized, and Study Days 15, 22, 29, and 60. All
      participants will undergo a series of safety and efficacy, assessments. Blood samples will be
      collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma administration), 3, 8, 15, 29, and 60. Oropharyngeal or
      endotracheal samples will be collected on Days 1 (prior to plasma administration), 3, 5, 8,
      11, and 15.
