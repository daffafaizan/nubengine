      brain structural integrity) from baseline (within 30 days of ADT initiation or 90 days of
      diagnosis) to 6- and 12-month follow-up.

      Aim 2: Examine group differences in components of frailty (e.g., lean mass, muscle strength,
      physical function, fatigue, physical activity) from baseline to 6- and 12-month follow-up.

      Men will be recruited for this study if they are (1) recently diagnosed with PCa and
      scheduled to receive 6-months or more of ADT (ADT+ group, n=20), (2) recently diagnosed with
      PCa and under active surveillance (ADT- group, n=20), or (3) healthy men without a history of
      cancer (PCa- group, n=20). Eligible men (N=60) will be scheduled for two or three testing
      appointments at each testing timepoint. To assess Aim 1, participants will complete measures
      at baseline (M0), 6-month follow-up (M6), and 12-month follow-up (M12). Aim 1 measures
      include: neurocognitive tasks, functional magnetic resonance imaging (optional; n=10 ADT+ and
      n=10 ADT- only), and questionnaires. To assess Aim 2, outcomes indicated as components of
      frailty syndrome will be measured, including: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (e.g.,
      appendicular lean mass), upper and lower body dynamometry, physical function and functional
      capacity, questionnaires (i.e., fatigue surveys), and physical activity monitoring (i.e.,
      accelerometry). Findings from this study will build upon the scientific framework for the
      potential frailty pathway of cancer-associated cognitive decline in PCa patients in order to
      develop future evidence-based interventions to manage cognitive impairment in men diagnosed
      with PCa.
