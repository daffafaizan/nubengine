      I. To test the feasibility (recruitment, attrition, adherence, logistical issues) of
      delivering the hypnosis (hypnotherapy) intervention to cancer survivors with chronic pain.

      II. To evaluate the acceptability of the hypnosis intervention among cancer survivors with
      chronic pain.

      III. To explore preliminary efficacy (estimate effect size) of hypnosis in relieving pain and
      improving associated anxiety and functional performance at 4 weeks and 8 weeks compared to a
      wait-list control.

      minutes using a standardized script for pain reduction that contains post-hypnotic
      suggestions for permanence of hypnotherapy benefits. The hypnotherapy session is recorded and
