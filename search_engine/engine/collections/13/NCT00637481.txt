      I. To determine the minimum biological effective dose (MBED) of atorvastatin required to
      induce modulation in the proliferation marker, Ki-67, in breast tissue of women who are at
      high risk to develop breast cancer. We will evaluate pre- and post atorvastatin treatment (4
      dose levels) expression of Ki-67 in samples obtained via FNA from breast tissue of women at
      high risk for breast cancer. This specific aim tests the hypothesis that treatment with
      atorvastatin will induce a decrease in Ki-67.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate atorvastatin induced modulation of breast cancer biomarkers markers (EGFR,
      P-EGFR, ER, p21, p27, bcl-2, CC3, cytology) and drug related markers (LXR, total cholesterol,
      LDL, HDL, CRP) in women who are at high risk to develop breast cancer.

      II. To determine plasma and tissue levels of atorvastatin and two of its hydroxylated
      metabolites (ohydroxyatorvastatin and p-hydroxyatorvastatin) in women who are treated with
      atorvastatin and to correlate these levels with Ki-67 levels. III. To correlate changes in
      Ki-67 and the above-described panel of biomarkers with HMG-CoA reductase genotype.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive oral atorvastatin once daily for 3 months.

      ARM II: Participants receive oral atorvastatin (at a higher dose than in arm I) once daily
      for 3 months.

      ARM III: Participants receive oral atorvastatin (at a higher dose than in arm II) once daily
      for 3 months.

      ARM IV: Participants do not receive treatment. Participants undergo blood sample collection
      and fine needle aspiration of breast tissue at baseline and at 3 months for correlative
      biomarker studies.
