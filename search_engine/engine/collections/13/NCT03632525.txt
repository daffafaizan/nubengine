      outcomes. Oral iron supplementation is poorly tolerated and may be ineffective. In some
      centres, intravenous iron is used to correct iron deficiency, but concerns have been raised
      about the safety of this treatment in the setting of chronic airways infection. The
      investigators are therefore planning a pilot interventional cohort study examining the
      effects of intravenous iron in a group of adults with cystic fibrosis. Patients will be
      recruited in Oxford and studied prospectively over 16 weeks, with iron given at week 4. The
      primary focus of this single-centre pilot/feasibility study is safety, specifically in
      relation to infection.
