      deterioration in muscle mass, strength and physical performance. Periods of disuse caused by
      illness or hospitalization cause rapid loss of muscle mass and strength, which negatively
      impact physical function upon re-ambulation. The impact of type 2 diabetes on acute muscle
      atrophy and recovery from disuse is a critical issue that has not been investigated.

      The overall objectives of this study are to employ highly innovative methods in muscle biopsy
      specimens in order to decipher the temporal sequence by which mitochondrial dysfunction and
      lipotoxicity in older adults with T2D impact atrophy and recovery of muscle mass, strength
      and physical function following bed rest. Older adults with and without T2D will complete 10
      days of strict bed rest followed by 4 weeks of ambulatory recovery. During bed rest muscle
      biopsies will be collected to determine mitochondrial function and lipid profile. During the
      recovery period the recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function will be
      determined.
