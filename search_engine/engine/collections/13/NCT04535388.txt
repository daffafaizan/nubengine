      sizes, all of which have been proven to be clinically beneficial in a wide spectrum of
      diseases. Especially in the management of intractable ocular surface diseases, scleral lenses
      with large diameters are commonly used so that the lens entirely rests on the sclera with
      sufficient tear reservoir. PROSE devices (Boston Foundation for Sight, Needham, MA), one of
      the first and representative scleral lenses shown to have long-term clinical benefits for
      complex corneal diseases, have large diameters of 17.5 to 23.0 mm. However, in Republic of
      Korea, only scleral lenses with small diameters are currently available. SoClearⓇ and OnefitⓇ
      scleral lenses, two of the most commonly used scleral lenses in Republic of Korea, possess
      diameters ranging from 14.1 to 15.5 mm and 13.3 to 15.0 mm, respectively, and are not
      actually fully scleral but more of a corneoscleral type lenses. Furthermore, Asians have
      smaller palpebral fissures with tighter eyelids than the Western population, which may
      restrict patients' tolerability of wearing a large scleral lens and limit its clinical
      benefits. Therefore, a more suitable scleral lens for Asians with larger diameter is
      required.

      Accordingly, this study investigates the efficacy and safety of the LK scleral lens (Lucid
      Korea LTD, Seoul, Republic of Korea), which has been newly manufactured to have larger
      diameters than currently available commercial lenses, and determines their suitability in
      Asian patients with intractable ocular surface diseases.
