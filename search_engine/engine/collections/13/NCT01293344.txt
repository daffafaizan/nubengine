      (MedDiet) are known to have significant and beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk profile. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that women respond
      differently to diet than men. No study has yet compared men and women metabolic response to
      the MedDiet in a controlled metabolic context in which all foods and drinks consumed are
      provided to the participant prepared by the research team. Therefore, we do not know whether
      being fed a MedDiet in controlled conditions would have similar health benefits in men and
      women. The purpose of this study is to document differences between men and women in changes
      in metabolic variables associated with cardiovascular risk in response to a 4 weeks
      isocaloric controlled nutritional intervention based on the MedDiet in which all foods and
      drinks are provided to subjects. We hypothesize that the decrease in LDL-cholesterol will be
      more important in men than in women. In this parallel controlled trial, both men and women
      are assigned to the same 4 weeks experimental diet formulated to be concordant with
      characteristics of the traditional MedDiet. Data will be collected before and after the
      controlled nutritional intervention based on the MedDiet.
