    
      On Day 1, a single dose of VIS649 or placebo will be administered IV. Pharmacokinetics
      sampling will start with a collection prior to the start of infusion and at multiple
      timepoints throughout the study. Pharmacodynamics sampling will occur at baseline and
      multiple timepoints throughout the study.

      Sentinel subjects will be utilized; the first two subjects in each cohort will be randomized
      to receive either VIS649 or placebo and will receive study drug at least 24 hours before the
      remaining subjects in the cohort are dosed.

      The safety profile of these subjects over the 24 hour post-administration period will be
      reviewed to determine whether it is appropriate to proceed with enrollment of the remaining
      subjects in the cohort as planned. This will occur for each dose escalation.

      The maximum duration of participation (Screening through End-of-study) for individual
      subjects will be approximately 20 weeks (5 months). The scheduled final visit will occur 16
      weeks post-dosing (112 days).
