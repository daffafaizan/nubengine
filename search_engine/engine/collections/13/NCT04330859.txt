      Aim 1: Enroll 60 preterm infants (<32 weeks' gestation and/or â‰¤1500 grams) with abnormal GMA
      into a pilot randomized control trial to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility
      (practicality) and fidelity (adherence, exposure and engagement) of a multimodal GA
      appropriate rehabilitation program during NICU hospitalization compared to standard of care.
      The investigators will evaluate:

        -  Acceptability using recruitment, refusal, retention, and follow-up rates as well as
           weekly interviews with parental participants

        -  Feasibility (practicality) using direct observations and weekly interviews with parental
           participants

        -  Fidelity (adherence, exposure and engagement) using visitation data, activity logs,
           direct observations, and weekly interviews.

      Aim 2: Examine the effect of a multimodal NICU-based rehabilitation program on short-term
      motor outcomes (general movements, cranial nerves, posture, movements, tone, and reflexes) of
      premature infants at risk for cerebral palsy (CP) at discharge from the NICU and at 3 months
      corrected age. The investigators hypothesize that this type of GA appropriate multimodal
      NICU-based rehabilitation program will positively impact short-term motor outcomes by
      normalizing general movements and improving TIMP and HINE scores.
