        -  To establish and maintain a database of clinical material (i.e., blood, urine, and
           tissue) and information on patients with amyloid diseases.

      OUTLINE: Blood, urine, tissue, and bone marrow samples are collected during standard
      laboratory evaluations to maintain a repository of biospecimens in the Gerry Amyloid Research
      Laboratory, to permit the correlation of clinical results with measured biological events,
      and for future research studies. Bone marrow RNA samples are examined for immunoglobulin
      light-chain gene sequences and amino acids by polymerase chain reaction and positional
      cloning. Blood serum and urine samples are evaluated for amyloid protein stability by
      high-resolution calorimetry, isothermal-titration calorimetry, and far- and near-UV circular
      dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Urine samples are also examined for
      post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation, sulfation, and cross-linking) to
      identify common features unique to amyloid proteins. Tissue samples are analyzed for
      biochemical and biophysical properties and for post-translational modifications in light
      chains.

      Quality of life is assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36).
