      achieve a clinical response in mild to moderate UC as an adjunctive treatment to current
      medical therapies. The proposed RCT will be used to evaluate the efficacy of a lacto-ovo
      vegetarian diet together with its effect on the microbiota to create an enhanced
      understanding of the role diet plays in the management of UC. Using a socially acceptable
      diet it is anticipated that food-related quality-of-life measures will improve for
      participants. Dietary modification could be a more economical, safer and more effective means
      of reducing symptoms and flare-ups compared to pharmacological therapy.
