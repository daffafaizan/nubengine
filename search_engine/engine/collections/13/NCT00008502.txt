      beyond the boundaries of injury. Keloids occur in people of all racial backgrounds; however,
      individuals of African descent are more susceptible to the disease. A familial disposition to
      keloid formation has long been recognized, but the genetic basis for this racial and familial
      predisposition has not been identified. We hypothesize that the increased risk is a direct
      result of one or more disease susceptibility genes. We will pursue two approaches, which are
      presented as two study modules. In module 1, we will carry out a family study. We will
      identify affected pedigrees, each containing at least 3 individuals with keloids. Blood will
      be obtained and Epstein Barr virus-transformed permanent B cell lines will be established. We
      anticipate taking two analytic strategies. We will use candidate gene analysis, focusing
      initially on the CBP and TGF1B genes and a recently identified locus on chromosome 14, and we
      will use genome-wide markers to identify possible disease gene loci. In module 2, we will
      perform a genome scan to address the hypothesis that one or more African origin genetic
      variants account for the excess prevalence of keloids among African Americans. We will carry
      out a mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium (MALD) scan, in order to find genetic
      regions where differences in the distribution of particular tagging single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) between keloid cases and controls indicate excess African ancestry.
      Further analysis of these loci will be carried out to identify the causative genetic
      variants.
