      phases: a preliminary phase to 'optimize the imaging algorithm for each apparatus installed
      at each centre', where 15 healthy volunteers in each centre will be examined by MammoWave. In
      the second phase, the remaining people will be enrolled (Breast Lesions pts will be about 70%
      of total) and examined by MammoWave by the clinical investigator, and results will be
      compared with the effective diagnosis already obtained by standard clinical methods. BL
      includes malignant lesions (BC) and benign lesions, and may be palpable or non-palpable
      lesions. BL includes also isolated clustered microcalcifications.

      At the end of the study, in each centre the clinical investigators will compare MammoWave
      output against the radiologist study output obtained using conventional exams.

      In addition, at the end of the study, the MammoWave output will be centrally reviewed in
      blind by an independent radiologist in order to confirm the data and confirm centrally the
      comparisons performed locally. The primary goal of the clinical study is to assess
      Mammowave's ability in BL detection and differentiation.
