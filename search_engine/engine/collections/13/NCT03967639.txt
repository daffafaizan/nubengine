    
      Our study is a retrospective analysis of patient records from all patients undergoing
      elective cardiac surgery between January 2007 to December 2018 at the Second Department of
      Internal Medicine and Cardiology Centre Cardiac Surgical Unit, University of Szeged.

      Electronic and paper documentation will be examined and anonymously analysed for the
      following information:

        1. date of cardiac surgery,

        2. type of cardiac surgery procedure,

        3. demographic data (age, height, weight),

        4. presence of T2DM (previous diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose level, glycated haemoglobin
           [HbA1C]),

        5. presence of respiratory co-morbidities (e.g. asthma, COPD, etc.),

        6. presence of other circulatory co-mobidities (e.g. hypertension, previous stroke,
           vascular stenosis)

      6. respiratory mechanical parameters before and after cardiac surgery, 7. presence of
      perioperative respiratory complications, 8. history of smoking 9. blood gas measurements
      before, during and after surgery

      Time series statistical analysis of all data will be carried out to discover the presence of
      seasonal trends in both diabetic and control patients. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be
      carried out to explore global differences between diabetic and control patients.
