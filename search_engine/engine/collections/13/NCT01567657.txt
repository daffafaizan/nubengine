      informed consent. The average time for a TEE study is about 30 minutes. Data collection
      occurs during this time frame. ECG monitoring and data collection (blood pressure, heart
      rate, SO2) for the study protocol starts 6 minutes before the application of the sedation. At
      -6, -4, -2 minutes before the application of the sedation, baseline data are collected. The
      average systolic blood pressure of these three measures is taken as the reference blood
      pressure. This is the reference value to calculate the blood pressure drop during the
      examination. Blood pressure, pulse oxymetry, heart rate are taken every 2 minutes until the
      examination (TEE) is finished. The questionnaire (for second end points) is filled out by the
      patient within two hours after the examination. The patient will be followed for the duration
      of about one hour after the examination, if he is from the outpatient clinic. Patients from
      the hospital (inpatients) will be followed routinely in the clinic.
