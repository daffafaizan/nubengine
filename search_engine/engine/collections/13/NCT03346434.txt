    
      1. Part A (open-label, single-ascending-dose, sequential cohort phase 2 study):

             -  Primary objective is to characterize the safety and PK of dupilumab administered as
                a single dose in pediatric participants, 6 months to less than 6 years of age, with
                severe AD.

             -  Secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and immunogenicity of a single dose
                of dupilumab in participants 6 months to less than 6 years of age with severe AD.

        2. Part B (randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3 study):

             -  Primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of multiple doses of dupilumab
                over 16 weeks of treatment when administered concomitantly with topical
                corticosteroids (TCS) in pediatric participants, 6 months to less than 6 years of
                age, with moderate-to-severe AD.

             -  Secondary objective is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of multiple doses of
                dupilumab over 16 weeks of treatment when administered concomitantly with TCS in
                participants 6 months to less than 6 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD.
