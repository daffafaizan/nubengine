      health outcomes and decreased use of acute and crisis-based mental health care services by
      randomly assigning 300 people with serious mental illness (SMI) and psychiatric instability
      receiving services at 1 of 2 community mental health centers (CMHCs), each of which offers
      integrated behavioral and primary health care, to either Health Home Usual Care alone or
      telehealth plus Health Home Usual Care for 12 months, with assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and
      12 months.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an automated, algorithmically-driven,
      customizable telehealth platform that provides education, teaches illness self-management,
      prompts users to enact coping strategies, and monitors symptoms on a daily basis to remotely
      detect early warning signs among people with SMI, moving beyond the existing telehealth
      approaches (mainly educational websites and videoconferencing) for assessing and providing
      education and therapy to people with SMI.

      This study has two specific aims. Aim 1 is to compare the effectiveness of telehealth with
      Health Home Usual Care by measuring improvements at 6 and 12 months in illness
      self-management, psychiatric symptoms, and health self-efficacy. Aim 2 is to compare the
      effectiveness of telehealth with Health Home Usual Care by comparing total cost of emergency
      room visits and hospital days during the 12 months prior to baseline to total costs of
      emergency room visits and hospital days during the 12 months after baseline.

      This study will evaluate a widely used automated telehealth program that has been modified
      and upgraded by the research team to incorporate curriculum drawn from illness
      self-management interventions for SMI developed by the investigators (i.e., Integrated
      Illness Management and Recovery (I-IMR) and HOPES). Unlike other telehealth devices, it does
      not require an internet connection and is an efficient and innovative way to provide illness
      self-monitoring and self-management education. Responses are entered by the user and
      forwarded to a secure server via cellular signal. The telehealth specialist will access the
      server daily through a secure website using a username and password.
