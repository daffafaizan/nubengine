      primary position on improving play activities. It is a known fact that late acquisition of
      sitting posture has negative effects on gross motor skills such as crawling and walking as
      well as fine motor skills. The extent to which trunk development affects the developmental
      stages of the child and his performance in motor behaviors and skills should be evaluated. At
      the same time, trunk control should be evaluated at various periods in order to determine
      early intervention and treatment strategies in babies with Down syndrome who are at risk for
      motor development.
