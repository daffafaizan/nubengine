      inhibitor(GPI) is now a recommended drug as the standard dual antiplatelet regimen in
      patients with acute coronary syndrome(1).

      Ticagrelor is a newly developed oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. It shows faster, greater and
      more consistent platelet inhibition as compared with previous P2Y12 receptor antagonist
      clopidogrel(2) and it also shows better clinical outcome and similar risk for bleeding as
      compared with clopidogrel(3).Interestingly, pharmacodynamic data of some studies showed
      excellent effect of ticagrelor in terms of inhibiting platelet activation apparently as high
      as that of GPI(2,4).

      Primary hypothesis: Ticagrelor have a comparable efficacy in platelet inhibition to GPI in
      patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome.
