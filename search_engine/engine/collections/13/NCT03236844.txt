    
      This multi-center, randomized, open-label, single dose, parallel-group study will assess the
      relative bioavailability and the safety and tolerability of gantenerumab produced with the G4
      process in comparison to gantenerumab produced with the G3 process. All participants will
      receive single SC dose of gantenerumab (manufactured by either the G3 or G4 process) on Day
      1. The total duration of the study for each participant will be up to 21 weeks: Screening (up
      to 8 weeks); In-clinic period (Days -1 to 3); Out-patient period (Days 4 up to 68); and
      Safety Follow-up (up to 90 days after dosing).
