      this study imaging agent, 18F-fluciclovine, for use in imaging bladder cancer.

      Staging of muscle invasive bladder cancer is currently done using computed tomography (CT)
      and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both CT and MRI are useful to determine the extent
      of bladder cancer, but some studies show that up to 40% of patients with negative CT or MRI
      scans for disease outside the bladder are found to have disease outside the bladder (in lymph
      nodes near the bladder) at the time of surgery.

      Given the limitations of the imaging exams currently used for staging bladder cancer, new
      techniques and imaging agents that can better identify metastatic lesions, especially within
      the pelvis, are desired and would be very useful.

      18F-fluciclovine is a new radiotracer that was recently approved to evaluate lesions in
      recurrent prostate cancer (but not for bladder cancer). This radiotracer targets amino-acid
      receptors, which are overexpressed in multiple cancers. Studies have shown that
      18F-fluciclovine PET/CT can visualize other types of cancers, such as breast cancer. A major
      advantage of 18F-fluciclovine is that it does not get into the bladder during the time of
      imaging. This may make it easier to see disease in the pelvis that is outside the bladder.

      The purpose of this study to determine whether 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT can better stage
      muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to conventional CT or MRI. A secondary aim of this
      study is to determine whether 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT can reveal the pathologic grade of the
      bladder cancer, which is only determined from pathology specimens obtained at surgery.
