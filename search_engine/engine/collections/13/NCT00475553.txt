      utilizes a combination estrogen and progestin therapy for 21 days followed by 7 days of a
      hormone-free interval (HFI). It is well documented that women may experience a higher
      incidence of mood changes, headaches and cramping that begin prior to and during this 7 day
      HFI. By reducing the HFI and extending the active combination contraceptive therapy, it is
      hoped that women will experience greater satisfaction with their contraceptive regimen and
      will experience fewer negative side effects associated with a HFI.

      The most common reason for discontinuation of an extended contraception regimen is irregular
      bleeding. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the best way to manage this
      breakthrough spotting and bleeding. Ease of use and acceptability of a flexible regimen of
      NuvaRing will also be evaluated. A comparison of cyclic mood symptoms, pelvic pain, and
      headaches will be made between a standard 21/7 regimen and an extended regimen.

      The contraceptive ring used in this study contains both an estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and a
      progestin (etonogestrel). These are synthetic (man-made) hormones. The amount of ethinyl
      estrogen released into the bloodstream each day is 120mcg and the amount of etonogestrel is
      150mcg. The NuvaRingÂ®, by Organon, is FDA approved for contraception, but is not approved for
      use in an extended regimen. Therefore its use in this study is considered investigational.
