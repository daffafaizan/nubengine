    
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 study to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), and antitumor activity of JCAR017 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse
      large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), follicular
      lymphoma Grade 3B, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). This study will evaluate and refine the
      dose and schedule of JCAR017 to optimize safety and antitumor activity. A dose-confirmation
      group or groups will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of JCAR017 at the recommended
      regimen(s).

      Upon successful generation of JCAR017 product, participants will receive treatment with one
      or more cycles of JCAR017 therapy. Each cycle will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy
      followed by one or two doses of JCAR017 administered by intravenous (IV) injection.

      The follow-up period for each participant is approximately 24 months after the final JCAR017
      infusion. Long-term follow-up for survival, toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue
      under a separate long-term follow-up protocol per health regulatory authority guidelines,
      currently up to 15 years after the last JCAR017 infusion.
