    
      Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      intra-arterial and intravenous injection of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells in
      patients in the acute and sub-acute phase (> 3 and < 90 days after symptoms onset) of
      ischemic cerebral infarct in the middle cerebral artery territory.

      Methods: 15 patients with cerebral infarct within the middle cerebral artery territory will
      be enrolled in this prospective, nonrandomized, open-labeled study. Up to 10 patients will
      receive up to 500x 10 6 autologous bone marrow cells injected intra-arterially into the
      middle cerebral artery through percutaneous approach. The procedure is monitored by
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and electroencephalogram (EEG). Other 5 patients will receive up
      to 500x 10 6 autologous bone marrow cells injected intravenously. Changes in neurological
      deficits and improvements in functions will be evaluated at baseline and at regular intervals
      during follow-up ( 4 months). EEG and neuroimaging exams will be performed at baseline and at
      regular intervals during the follow-up period.
