    
      Aim of the research: In this study investigators want to examine the effectiveness of the use
      of ketofol and a mixture of ketofol and lidocaine on the total consumption of opioids and on
      the postoperative recovery of pediatric patients. Investigators will evaluate the safety,
      efficacy, and outcomes of the anesthesia procedure with respect to the administration of
      different anesthetics, specific pharmakocinetic profiles and compare the length of recovery
      between patients in two groups.

      Including criteria: children aged 1 to 12 years who underwent short surgery (up to 60 min).

      Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome of this study will be extubation
      time and the secondary outcome will be time spend in PACU.

      Description of the study: Each subject included in the study will be given general anesthesia
      with ketofol or ketofol and lidocaine, with the addition of fentanyl. After 20 s the LMA will
      be placed. Maintenance of anesthesia will be performed using an air / oxygen mixture (50% /
      50%) and an infusion of ketofol or ketofol and lidocaine. Ketofol will be prepare in a ratio
      of 1: 4 for induction and 1: 7 for maintenance. The same mixtures of ketofol will be added 1
      ml of 2% lidocaine for the second group of patients. After extubation, patients will be
      transferred to the PACU.
