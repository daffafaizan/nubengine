      corresponds to those of the ROTEMÂ® Sigma (ROTEM). Additionally, the time required for
      delivery of final results (turnaround time) of all parameters of the Quantra will be
      examined. Significant differences in the turnaround time between both devices are of high
      interest as timing is a crucial factor in the diagnosis-based treatment.

      Comparison of the coagulation process measurements in turnaround time and results of the
      ROTEM INTEM CT, HEPTEM CT, EXTEM A10 FIBTEM A10 with corresponding Quantra parameters such as
      CT, CTH, CTR, CS, PCS, FCS.

      The primary aim of the study is to examine whether the two methods of hemostasis analysis are
      equivalent and how far they correlate.

      Secondary aims are to examine the turnaround time of test results in both devices and to
      examine whether these results would have led to the same therapeutic decisions in a
      retrospective review of data.

      For both devices following data is documented:

        -  Time for cartridge insertion

        -  Time first results available

        -  Time measurement finished

      Quantra clot stiffness values are expressed in hectoPascals (hPa), whereas corresponding
      ROTEM values are expressed as an amplitude in mm. The relationship between amplitude (A in
      mm) and shear modulus (G in Pascals) is not linear. For a proper comparison the ROTEM
      amplitude (mm) needs to be converted to Pascals by following formula:

      G (Pascals) = (500 x A) / (100 - A),

      as described by Solomon C et al, Anaesth Analg 2015; 121:868-78.

      The Quantra data that are collected during the study are only observational and will not be
      used to guide therapeutic interventions
