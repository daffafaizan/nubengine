      preparations during UV (ultraviolet) administration. Both riboflavin preparations currently
      are in general use worldwide and in U.S. clinical trials of corneal collagen crosslinking.
      The first preparation contains riboflavin in a dextran solution, which may tend to dehydrate
      the cornea and keep it thinner. The second preparation contains riboflavin in a solution
      without dextran; in this case, the relative hypotonicity may tend to keep the cornea better
      hydrated and thicker. The primary goal of the study is to see if the use of hypotonic
      riboflavin (rather than riboflavin with dextran) better maintains consistent corneal
      thickness during the CXL procedure. The second goal of the study is to determine if better
      maintenance of corneal thickness potentially could have benefits of better consistency of the
      procedure, decrease in corneal haze formation, and improved safety of the endothelial cells.
      Safety and efficacy outcomes will then be compared between the groups. In particular, we will
      compare the corneal thickness measured by ultrasonic pachymetry immediately after the CXL
      procedure in the randomized eyes. Secondary outcomes will include visual acuity, longer term
      corneal thickness changes, and corneal steepness changes. Safety assessments will include a
      tabulation of adverse events, patient symptoms, loss of visual acuity, changes in endothelial
      cell density, slit lamp examination of the cornea and lens, and contact lens tolerance for
      contact lens wearers
