    
      Prospective, multicenter, multinational non-comparative study.

      Primary Endpoint: Primary hernia recurrence* rate at 24 month follow-up. The evaluation of
      hernia recurrence will be performed during a physical examination and by ultrasonography.

      Secondary Endpoints: Primary hernia recurrence* rate at 1, 6 and 12 month follow-up. The
      evaluation of hernia recurrence will be performed during a physical examination and confirmed
      by ultrasonography.

      (*Recurrence is defined as a clinically manifested bulge or a protrusion exacerbated by a
      Valsalva maneuver.)

      Safety Parameters:
