      general anesthesia. The primary end point of the study is the improvement of the lung
      compliance measured as volume difference/pressure difference (dv/dp) or ml/cmH2O after the
      recruitment maneuver. The investigators used 2 groups of patients. In the first group the
      investigators used pressure control ventilation for the recruitment maneuver. After the
      ventilator was switched to pressure control mode the investigators increased the inspiratory
      time to 50% and the inspiratory pressure above Positive End Expiratory Pressure (Ppeak) to 20
      cmH2O. Then the investigators progressively increased Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)
      to have a peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) to 45 cm H2O. The whole recruitment maneuver
      lasts 2 minutes. After the recruitment maneuver the investigators used volume control
      ventilation again (with the baseline settings)and PEEP step wised decreased to 8 cmH20but.
      PEEP (8cmH2O) was left until the end of the operation. In the second group the investigators
      did not used lung recruitment maneuver at all. In both groups lung compliance was measured
      (dynamic and static)as dv/dp (ml/cmH2O). Measures were assessed 1 minute after delivery (but
      before recruitment), 3 minutes after recruitment (first group) at 10 and at 20 minutes after
      recruitment. The investigators also measured Ppeak (cmH2O) and Pplateau (cmH2O)inspiratory
      pressures , blood pressure (mmHG), beats per minute, oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2
      according to the above time frame, blood Gases before and 3 minutes after recruitment etc.
