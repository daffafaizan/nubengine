    
      Relay is a novel program that engages and intervenes with individuals in the ED following an
      opioid OD and for the next 90 days, with the goal of preventing subsequent OD events. Relay
      is delivered by trained peer navigators, who are DOHMH staff with lived substance use
      experience. Relay navigators provide counseling, linkage to services, and OD prevention
      education.
