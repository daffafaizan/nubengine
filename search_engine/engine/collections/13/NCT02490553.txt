      of Airflow obstruction is through Functional Tests Lung. In the 1950s, high pollution levels
      were associated with increased mortality. Despite a reduction of air pollution, it has been
      established that pollution peaks have short-term effects on acute respiratory episodes. The
      Urban Community of Dunkirk (CUD) focuses many large pollutant emitters. The long term effects
      of industrial pollution on TVO are unknown.

      The main objective of the project is to compare the prevalence of Airflow obstruction in the
      Urban Community of Dunkirk affected by industrial pollution compared to that found in the
      Urban Community of Lille (CUDL) less industrialized. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess
      the relationship between air pollution from industrial and biological markers, particularly
      the plasma concentrations of heavy metals 2) To assess the prevalence of TVO general
      population in French populations 3) Establish a baseline epidemiological and biological bank.
