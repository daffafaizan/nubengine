      Extension of the knee. To address this type of pathology, a trochlear lengthening osteotomy
      was described. To date only case reports describing the clinical outcome of this new
      osteotomy exist and information on functional outcome regarding muscle strength and
      electromyography (EMG) data is lacking. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      functional and clinical outcome of this new lengthening osteotomy of the lateral trochlea in
      patients with patella instability, trochlear dysplasia Dejour type A or B, short lateral
      articular trochlea quantified by the lateral condyle index and presence of a lateral
      trochlear bump.
