      a feed-back and motivational coaching to the user, 2) relevant clinical parameters to the
      healthcare professionals in order to support the patient's follow-up, and 3) supporting the
      detection of preliminary signs of functional loss. The device consists of a smart, removable
      insole. It measures dynamic characteristics of gait (e.g., speed, variability, distance) as
      well as body weight modifications with minimal invasiveness. The insole transmits wireless
      the collected data to a storage server through a touchpad. Data will then be available for at
      distance consultations by users (i.e., patients or physicians). The investigators will
      conduct a wide range of evaluations of the device (technical, clinical, social, ergonomic,
      and economic), which will allow the optimization of the prototype. The evaluation of the
      prototypes will preliminary takes place at the Blagnac smart house. 10 healthy volunteers
      will test the device. The second evaluation phase will involve 60 frail community-dwelling
      subjects, with 30 of them which will use the smart insoles for 3 months. Comprehensive
      assessments will be conducted to highlight the feasibility, acceptability, interoperability,
      integration in healthcare network, and clinical relevance of the technological device in
      comparison to usual care.
