      promote behavior change through peer and self-modeling photo/video activities.

      In this study, we will implement an abbreviated 2-month version of the intervention with a
      single peer group of up to 10 mothers. We will assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      both the intervention and our intended outcome measures, in preparation for a randomized
      pilot trial of the full intervention.
