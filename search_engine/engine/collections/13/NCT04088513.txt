      ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with G6PD deficiency will be randomized to receive a 3-month
      regimen of aspirin 100mg/d or clopidogrel 75mg/d. The primary end point is the proportion of
      protocol-defined hemolysis at 90 days. Protocol-defined hemolysis is defined as one or more
      of the following conditions: a) Hemoglobin level declined ≥2.5 g/dL from baseline, meanwhile
      ruling out bleeding events. b) Hemoglobin level declined ≥25% from baseline, meanwhile ruling
      out bleeding events. c) Clinically relevant hemolytic events, could manifested as fatigue,
      back pain, anemia, dark urine and jaundice. The study consists of five visits including the
      day of randomization, day 4, day10±3days, day27±3days, day90±7days.
