    
      Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is increasingly acknowledged as a common, potentially
      disabling psychiatric condition. Despite this, there are currently no empirically supported
      behavioral treatments for patients with IED. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess
      the short-term and long-term efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT), previously
      found to be successful in treating dysfunctional anger, for treating IED. Secondary goals of
      the project are to:

        1. explore mechanisms involved in the successful treatment of IED, and

        2. examine individual differences associated with treatment response.

      Seventy-two subjects meeting for both research and DSM IED criteria will be randomly assigned
      to either 12 weeks of individual CBT, 12 weeks of group CBT or 12 weeks of a wait-list
      control condition. Subjects will be assessed before and after therapy/wait-list as well as at
      3 month and 6 month follow-up. Primary outcome measures will assess aggressive behavior,
      anger, and the presence of an IED diagnosis at post-treatment, 6-month follow-up and 12-month
      follow-up. Social and emotional information processing will be evaluated as potential
      mechanism of change. Trait aggression will be assessed as a potential moderating variable.
