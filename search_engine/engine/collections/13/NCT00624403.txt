      Airway devices are safe and their morbidity rate is very low. The i-gel (Intersurgical Ltd,
      Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) is a new single-use non-inflatable supraglottic airway device that
      has not been evaluated in a comparative study.

      The aim of this study is to compare i-gel with the LMA ProSeal in a randomized study.
      Anesthesia protocol is standardized. The supraglottic devices are compared in term of
      insertion success rate, leak pressure, ventilatory parameters and adverse events. The aim is
      to demonstrate an enhancement in term of insertion success rate and a diminution of the
      adverse events. Statistical analysis will used percentage, confidence interval and chi 2 or
      Fischer's exact test for qualitative data. Quantitative data will be analyzed in mean,
      standard deviation. Comparison will be made with a student t test or a wilcoxon test. P <
      0,05 is statistically significant.
