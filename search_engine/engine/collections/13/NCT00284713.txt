      progenitor cells (BMC) may enhance left ventricular functional recovery in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction. It is unknown, however, whether such a strategy might also be
      applicable to patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Therefore, we
      initiated the TOPCARE-DCM - trial (Transplantation Of Progenitor Cells And Recovery of Left
      Ventricular Function in Patients with non ischemic Dilatative CardioMyopathy) aiming to
      regionally improve left ventricular contractility by selective infusion of BMC into the left
      anterior descending coronary artery.

      Patients will be randomized 2:1 (20/10) BMC Infusion versus standard medical therapy
