    
      This is a prospective study involving several palliative care units in France. Glycemia and
      glycosuria will be measured in the same patients. Symptoms that could be related to
      hyperglycemia will be assessed in relation with the concomitant blood glucose level.

      Main investigations :

      Glycosuria and cetonuria will be measured using a dip stix during each nursing care.

      Glycemia will be measured before breakfast and before diner. Pain caused by finger pricking
      for the measurement of glycemia will be evaluated using a verbal scale.

      Symptoms will be evaluated at the time of each glucose measurement first with open questions
      then with a list of potential symptoms of hyperglycemia.
