    
      Undetected residual neuromuscular blockade is common in the post-anesthesia care

      unit (PACU). In fact, 16%-42% of patients receiving intermediate-acting muscle

      relaxants in the operating room have T4/T1 ratios <0.7-0.8 in the PACU. Respiratory and
      pharyngeal muscle function can be adversely affected during minimal neuromuscular blockade.
      Studies in awake volunteers and surgical patients have demonstrated that T4/T1 ratios of 0.7
      - 0.9 are associated with impaired airway protective reflexes, upper airway obstruction, a
      decreased hypoxic ventilatory response, and post-operative hypoxemia. The incidence and
      severity of residual neuromuscular blockade at the time of tracheal extubation will be
      evaluated to determine how these influence the length of stay in the operating room and PACU.
