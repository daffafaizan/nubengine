      through the Central Nervous System. It has been proved that this male innervation pattern are
      often related to a to the spine asymmetrical muscular activation. Biomechanically, both the
      asymmetric muscular activation as well as the prolonged activation of the muscles causes
      additional stress to the already damaged structures resulting in additional pain. Technical
      aids like back orthoses or bandages are supposed to relax the painful muscles and reduce pain
      in this way. However, no studies are available which analyze systematically the effect of
      such technical aids on the activation pattern of the back muscles.

      Aim of the study is to analyze systematically the effect of the dynamic flexion orthosis
      Dynaflex® and of the back bandage Lumbo Sensa® on the activation of the back muscles via
      surface EMG. On the one hand it shall be proven that the analyzed technical aids have an
      immediate impact on the activation of the back muscles which reduces the pain symptoms
      continuously. On the other hand it shall be demonstrated that surface EMG is a suitable
      approach to examine the effect of technical aids on the muscular activation of the back
      muscles focusing everyday situations or movements for the first time. From the results it
      shall be concluded on the everyday effect of orthosis or bandages for the discharge of the
      back muscles.
