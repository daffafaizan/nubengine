      Although there are various pharmacological choices, many patients fail to adhere to them.
      Therefore, adjunctive non-pharmacological treatment is a promising approach. Foot Reflexology
      is one of the complementary therapies that has been proved for its ability to decrease blood
      pressure (BP), however, there is limited data in patients with stage-2 HT.

      Objective To examine the effectiveness of foot reflexology as adjunctive therapy for BP
      lowering.

      Methods This was a single-center randomized clinical trial. Hypertensive patients who were
      regularly followed up at the hypertension clinic were enrolled and randomized into the
      intervention group (n=47) and control group (n=47). Foot reflexology was performed in the
      intervention group during a clinical visit. Office BP and pulse rate (PR) were measured
      before and immediately at 15 minutes (min) and 30 min after the procedure in the intervention
      group and after resting in the control group.
