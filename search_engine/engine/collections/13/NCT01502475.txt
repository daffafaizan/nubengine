      steady and steep rise over the past two decades. A national survey of over 31,000 adults
      found that 36% of respondents had used CAM therapies in the last month, and this estimate
      increased to 62% when prayer for health reasons was included. Second, this same survey showed
      that CAM is often used to treat symptoms and illnesses associated with stress such as
      depression, anxiety, back and neck pain, and gastrointestinal disorders. Finally, many
      individuals experiencing high levels of stress lack access to conventional medicine due to
      lack of medical insurance, possibly increasing the attractiveness of CAM for these
      individuals. This ongoing systematic characterization of CAM usage patterns in civilian
      populations has not been mirrored in active military and military Veteran populations across
      the United States. Data from the less than handful of studies that have been conducted thus
      far, suggest that CAM usage patterns in military and military Veteran populations are
      influenced by demographics and certain medical conditions, as well as dissatisfaction with
      certain aspects of conventional care. While there appears to be some similarity between
      civilian and non-civilians populations, there remains much to be known in the latter
      population.
