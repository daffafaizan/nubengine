      vaginal rings releasing Nestorone® and escalating doses of estradiol in normal cycling women.
      The primary objective is to evaluate one-month data on the serum estradiol (E2) levels of
      three different contraceptive vaginal rings containing a fixed dose of Nestorone® (NES) and
      escalating doses of estradiol as the basis for selecting a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR)
      dose for a contraceptive efficacy trial. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects
      of three different estradiol doses of a NES- E2 CVR on progesterone levels, bleeding and side
      effects during one month of use and to evaluate the effects of a hormone-free internal on
      bleeding patterns. Nestorone serum levels will further be measured as an indication of
      compliance with the continuous use of the ring.
