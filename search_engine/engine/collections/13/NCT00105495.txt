    
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial. The study
      population is participants with thalassemia major who are receiving regular chelation therapy
      with deferoxamine. A total of sixty (60) participants will be enrolled among the
      investigative sites.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether deferiprone exhibits superior
      efficacy in removing excess iron from the heart compared to that of the standard therapy,
      deferoxamine.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the relative efficacy of deferiprone with respect to
      that of deferoxamine as assessed by serum ferritin concentration and liver iron
      concentration.

      The primary efficacy measure in this study will be the participants' cardiac iron status, as
      determined by heart MRI T2* assessments.

      The secondary efficacy measure will be by serum ferritin concentration and liver iron
      concentration. This will be measured by the Superconducting Quantum-Interference Device
      (SQUID) BioSusceptometer.

      The duration of treatment is 12 months.
