      of concern in developing countries because of the high prevalence of iron and zinc deficiency
      in these countries. In this study, we investigated the effect of habitual consumption of a
      high phytate diet on the inhibitory effect of phytate on nonheme iron absorption. Thirty-two
      non-anemic female subjects with ferritin ≤ 30µg/L were randomized into two groups, after
      matching for ferritin concentration. Each group consumed either high or low phytate foods
      that were provided for 8 wk. Iron bioavailability from a high phytate test meal was measured
      using area under the curve (AUC) for serum iron at baseline and after the intervention.
