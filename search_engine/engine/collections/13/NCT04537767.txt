      that affects millions of people each year, resulting in high mortality rates. Septic
      responses have an extremely complex chain of events including inflammatory and
      anti-inflammatory processes, humoral and cellular reactions, and cardiocirculatory
      abnormalities. Esmolol may have some potential in treating septic shock and sepsis. The
      investigators conduct an RCT to explore the efficacy of esmolol in patients with septic shock
      and sepsis.
