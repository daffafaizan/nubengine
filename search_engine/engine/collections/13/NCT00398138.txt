      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and immunogenicity of the Wilms tumor-1 analog peptide vaccine in
           patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, non-small cell lung
           cancer, or mesothelioma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to disease type (acute
      myeloid leukemia [AML] or myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS] vs non-small cell lung cancer or
      mesothelioma).

      Patients receive vaccine comprising Wilms-tumor 1 (WT-1) analog peptide emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) once in weeks 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) SC twice in weeks 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (on the day of and 2 days prior to each
      vaccination). Patients who have an immunologic response and have no disease progression may
      receive up to 6 more vaccinations approximately 1 month apart.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, week 8, and week 14. Samples are examined by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure levels of WT-1 and by T-cell proliferative
      response, delayed-type hypersensitivity against WT-1 peptides, or ELISPOT to measure immune
      response.

      Bone marrow samples are collected from patients with AML or MDS at baseline and week 14.
      Samples are examined by PCR to measure levels of WT-1 and by multiparameter flow cytometry to
      measure residual disease.
