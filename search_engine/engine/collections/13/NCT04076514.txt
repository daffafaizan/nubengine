      carcinoma. Recurrence rate is still high. The standard management is total thyroidectomy.
      regional lymph node metastasis is noted in recurrent cases. Some studies stated benefits of
      central neck dissection in orevention of recurrence and others said there is no benefits. so
      prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) remain controversial in clinically node-negative
      (cN0) papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
