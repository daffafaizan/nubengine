    
      Patients, who have an elective cardiac surgical intervention with an expected CBP duration
      >120 minutes (e.g.: valve surgery, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), combined procedures)
      will be enrolled to the study after given informed consent.

      Patients, who decline will be asked to collect their secondary outcome data to create a "real
      - life" group and increase the number of patients in the control group. In this "real - life"
      group no additional blood samples will be taken.
