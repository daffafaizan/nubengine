      one of the causes of skin cancers.

      Until recently, the genotoxic effects of UV-A radiation, were poorly identified, in
      particular their capacity to lead to the dimerization of pyrimidine bases .

      It is well known that the response to UV-A and UV-B radiations is different depending on the
      cutaneous phototype.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the correlation between cutaneous phototype and
      the quantity and nature (CPD or oxidative lesions) of damage caused to cutaneous DNA after an
      ex-vivo exposure to UV-A and UV-B radiations.
