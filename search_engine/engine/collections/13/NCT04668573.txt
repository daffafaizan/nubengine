      stroke and healthy subjects are asked their demographic data and assessed for turning
      performance (stepping patterns and electromyography data of trunk muscles), trunk control
      (muscle strength, active range of motion, muscle mass and motor control in trunk) and motor
      function (recovery of extremities and balance function). The second part is a randomized
      controlled trial. Stroke participants are randomly allocated into trunk exercise and control
      groups. Trunk exercise group receives trunk exercise including trunk muscles stretching,
      trunk muscles strengthening, and task-related trunk control training for 30 minutes per
      session, twice a week for 12 weeks while control group remains their regular activities.
      Turning performance, trunk control and motor function are evaluated before and after training
      session.
