      device (NeReBot) as an alternative to the conventional rehabilitation treatment. NeReBot is a
      3-degree-of-freedom robotic device, which can be programmed by the therapist to perform
      repetitive assistive movements (flexion and extension, adduction and abduction, pronation and
      supination, circular) of the upper limb (shoulder and elbow), combined with a visual and
      acoustic display. Acute and subacute stroke patients (â‰¤20 days post-stroke) will be
      randomized into two groups with a procedure by a computer program: the experimental group
      (EG) and the control group (CG). Both groups will receive a total daily treatment time of 120
      minutes for five days a week and for five weeks. The EG will perform the conventional
      functional rehabilitation (proprioceptive exercises, verticalization, gait training, paretic
      hand and wrist mobilization, without mobilizing the proximal paretic arm) and occupational
      therapy for 80 minutes a day, while the proximal paretic arm will be treated by NeReBot for
      40 minutes a day. For the CG, NeReBot therapy is substituted by 40 minutes of conventional
      mobilization of the proximal paretic arm by the therapist.
