    
      CefalivÂ® is a combination of 3 drugs: dihydroergotamine mesylate, dipyrone sodium, and
      caffeine. The dihydroergotamine mesylate interacts with the serotonergic, dopaminergic and
      noradrenergic receptors, but it's mechanism is not totally known. The dipyrone is a
      non-steroidal antiinflammatory which has an analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic
      effect. And the caffeine presents mechanisms that are not totally clear, but it may relieves
      the pain by activating of the central noradenosine pathway (pain suppressing system).
