      The biopsies will divided into 3 strips that will be stored overnight in chilled NaCl 0.9%.
      The following morning each strip will be mounted isometrically with one end fixed to a holder
      and the other end to a force transducer. One strip will be maintained in a solution
      containing 140mmol/L Na,acting as control, whereas the other two strips will be placed in
      fluids with diminishing Na concentration, from 140 mmol/L, to 130 mmol/L and 120 mmol/L.
      Contractility will be measured with force transducers and a polygraph
