      stress responses to personal stress imagery, food cue imagery, and to neutral-relaxing
      imagery. Subjects will be distributed into 3 groups stratified by BMI category. Subject
      recruitment, eligibility determination, baseline assessments and script development will be
      conducted at the Yale Stress Center. Subjects will complete a variety of diagnostic,
      cognitive and psychological assessments, a comprehensive physical examination and blood work
      and will be involved in development of imagery scripts from personal stress, food cue and
      neutral-relaxing situations. Subjects will then be scheduled for three laboratory sessions at
      the Yale Stress Center. Subjects will also participate in an imagery and relaxation training
      session followed by three laboratory sessions. The three laboratory sessions will be
      conducted within a brief interval of days, when subjects will be exposed to a personal
      stress, a food cue and a neutral-relaxing imagery condition, one condition per day. The order
      of imagery conditions will be randomly assigned and counterbalanced across subjects in order
      to balance any influences due to order of imagery conditions.
