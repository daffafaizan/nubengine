        -  Screening period: up to 4 weeks,

        -  Placebo-controlled treatment period: up to 108 weeks (at least 24 weeks for participants
           who experienced conversion to CDMS),

        -  Extension treatment period (without placebo-control): the extension period continued
           until teriflunomide was commercially available in participant's country of residence.

        -  Post-treatment washout period: 4 weeks after last treatment intake.

      The maximal duration of the study period per participant was expected to be 116 weeks if
      he/she did not continue in the extension treatment period.
