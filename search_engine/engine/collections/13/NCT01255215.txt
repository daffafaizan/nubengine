      artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy has improved outcomes in severe malaria, the mortality
      rate remains high. Adjunctive therapies that target the underlying pathophysiology of severe
      malaria may further reduce morbidity and mortality. Endothelial activation plays a central
      role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria, of which the angiogenic factors angiopoietin-1
      (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) have recently been shown to function as key regulators.
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a major inhibitor of Ang-2 release from endothelium and has been shown
      to decrease endothelial inflammation and reduce the adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes.
      Low-flow inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) is a US FDA-approved treatment for hypoxic
      respiratory failure in neonates. Based on compelling data on the efficacy of iNO in
      experimental cerebral malaria in animal models, coupled with the documented safety of iNO in
      clinical practice and trials for other diseases, we propose a randomized clinical trial of
      iNO for the adjunctive treatment of severe malaria in Ugandan children.
