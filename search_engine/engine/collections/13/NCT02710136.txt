      feasibility of cockroach nasal allergen challenge in children with asthma. This pilot study
      will occur in two phases:

        -  Phase 1 will enroll 10 cockroach sensitive adults with asthma who will undergo a nasal
           allergen challenge with increasing doses of cockroach allergen. Phase 1 will consist of
           two parts, Phase 1a and Phase 1b. In Phase 1a, participants will undergo a nasal
           allergen challenge. In Phase 1b, participants will undergo a repeat nasal allergen
           challenge to assess reproducibility of the NAC with cockroach allergen in a population
           with asthma. The data from Phase 1a will be used to identify a range of doses that is
           safe and elicits a threshold of nasal symptoms (TNSS â‰¥8).

        -  Phase 2 will enroll 25 cockroach sensitive children with asthma ages 8-14 years who will
           undergo a nasal allergen challenge using the dose range identified in Phase 1a.

      Study mandated procedures include: blood draws (venipuncture); pulmonary function testing
      (PFTs); nasal allergen challenge (NAC); allergen skin testing; and peak expiratory flow.
