      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR-CMR).

      Coordinating Prinicpal Investigator: Prof. Bernhard Metzler, University Clinic of Internal
      Medicine III, Cardiology and Angiology, Innsbruck Medical University.

      Planned Study Period: 2017-2020.

      Objective: To investigate, for the first time, the non-inferiority of TAVR-CMR to
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (TAVR-CT) regarding efficacy and safety end-points.

      Design: Prospective, randomized, open-label, multi-centre trial.

      Patients (planned): 250 patients.

      Diagnosis / Inclusion Criteria: Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis scheduled for TAVR based
      on a local heart-team decision.

      Methods: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive a predefined TAVR-CMR
      protocol or to receive a standard TAVR-CT protocol within two weeks after inclusion.

      Main Outcome Measure: Follow-up will be performed at hospital discharge after TAVR and after
      6 months. The primary efficacy outcome is device implantation success at discharge. The
      secondary endpoints are a combined safety endpoint and a combined clinical efficacy endpoint
      at baseline and at 6 months, as well as a comparison of imaging procedure related variables
      (see section 5.11.2). Endpoint definitions are based on the updated 2012 VARC-2 consensus
      document.
