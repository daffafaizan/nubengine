        -  Investigate the relative importance of having a consistent inpatient lay care-partner
           for patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a 30-minute quality of life questionnaire in order to measure
      their psychosocial health while in the bone marrow transplant program, including Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), Profile of Mood State (POMS), and Brief COPE
      questionnaires, at the baseline (pre-transplant) appointment, at the first physician's visit
      after discharge, at day 100 post-transplant, and then at 6 months and 1 year post-transplant.
      Caregivers complete a 30-minute coping questionnaire at the pre-transplant appointment, at
      the first physician's visit after discharge, and then at day 100 post-transplant. Caregivers
      also keep a weekly log of the time spent with the patient in the hospital.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
