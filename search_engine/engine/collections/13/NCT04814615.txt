      89Zr-DFO-daratumumab immunoPET. 60 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and a plan for
      daratumumab containing combination therapy will be enrolled. Prior to therapy, current
      standard of care (SoC), as well as a research 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab PET/CT, tests will be
      performed. Patients will then undergo standard of care therapy for myeloma as defined by a
      medical oncologist and SoC response assessments as defined by the International Myeloma
      Working Group (IMWG). Upon suspected complete response (CR) or completion of 12 cycles of
      therapy, a repeat research 89Zr-DFO-daratumumab PET/CT will be repeated and standard of care
      minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment will be performed. This design will determine how
      89Zr-DFO-daratumumab immunoPET compares with current methods of measuring and localizing
      disease prior to therapy, if immunoPET can predict response to therapy, and how immunoPET
      compares with current methods of detecting MRD after therapy.

      The therapy in this trial is standard of care. The research component is the addition of a
      novel immunoPET imaging test before and after standard of care therapy, to determine if the
      novel imaging test adds value over current measures of myeloma disease burden.
