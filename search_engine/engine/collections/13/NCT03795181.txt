      (MPNs). We have developed a web-based mathematic model (PKUM model) by using a multi-centric
      database from three institutions (Peking University People's Hospital, Haidian Section of
      Peking University Third Hospital, People's Hospital Affiliated to Hebei Medical University)
      to predict the probability of a nodule to be malignant in patients with MPNs. This
      prospectively observational study will recruit patients with MPNs between January 2019 and
      March 2019, allowing radiologists, surgeons, and a predictive model (PKUM model) to
      discriminate malignancy from benign nodules, and compare their sensitivity, specificity, and
      accuracy.
