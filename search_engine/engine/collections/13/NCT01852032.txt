    
      The primary aim of this study is the comparison of Beta values of several different CT and
      Tomosynthesis views (Beta of CT Sagittal View, Beta of CT Coronal View, Beta of CT Axial
      View, Beta of Tomosynthesis Craniocaudal View, Beta of Tomosynthesis Medial Lateral Oblique
      View). Lower Beta values correspond to better image quality (less noise, increased cancer
      detection).
