      Aim 1 is to conduct an outpatient study testing multiple configurations of the bionic
      pancreas in 24 adult subjects with type 1 diabetes in a random cross-over study versus usual
      care with an insulin pump. These bionic pancreas configurations include the insulin only BP
      at 145 mg/dl set point, 130 mg/dl set point, 120 mg/dl set point and 110 mg/dl set point and
      the bihormonal BP at 130 mg/dl set point, 115 mg/dl set point and 110 mg/dl set point. These
      arms are all compared to usual care.

      Aim 2 is to evaluate the incremental utility of glucagon in the context of automated insulin
      delivery by the bionic pancreas in preventing hypoglycemia during exercise in the fasted
      state. The 130 mg/dl set points and 110 mg/dl set points also participate in this fasted
      exercise visit. These two set points are double blinded, so neither the subjects nor the
      study staff are aware which arm is bihormonal and which arm is insulin only.
