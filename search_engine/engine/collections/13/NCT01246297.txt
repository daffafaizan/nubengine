        -  whether patients who have undergone curative surgical resection for lung cancer benefit
           from 8 weeks of early outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (started within 2 weeks of
           hospital discharge).

        -  to identify potential barriers to this approach

      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is the most effective non-pharmacological treatment for
      patients with chronic respiratory diseases, especially COPD. Many patients with lung cancer
      have co-existing smoking-related lung disorders such as COPD. To date there have been no
      randomised controlled trials of PR in post-resection lung cancer survivors. However there is
      indirect evidence that PR may be of benefit in this patient cohort. Cesario et al
      (2007)reported a 32% improvement in exercise capacity with in-patient PR, and Spruit et al
      (2009) demonstrated a 43% improvement in six minute walk distance following an 8-week
      in-patient PR programme. However, both studies had small numbers, and no randomised control
      group. Furthermore, inpatient PR is not an economically justifiable intervention in the NHS
      where emphasis is on self-management and ambulatory care.
