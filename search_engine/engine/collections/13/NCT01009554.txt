      design to assess the oral tissue tolerance of a potassium oxalate containing mouthrinse.
      Subjects will have their oral soft/hard tissues assessed and will be evaluated for stain
      levels and tooth color shades at Screening/Baseline (Visit 1), Week 4 (Visit 2), Week 6
      (Visit 3) and Week 8 (Visit 4). Subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth two times
      daily in their usual manner using the provided sodium fluoride toothpaste. Subjects assigned
      to the mouthrinse group will be instructed to rinse twice daily after brushing.
