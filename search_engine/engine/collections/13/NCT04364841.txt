      behavioral changes that will help them cope with health problems are in need of training and
      counseling. In this process, nurses -being in close and continuous contact with individuals-
      play counselor role as a part of their educator roles. It is stated that nurses need to
      understand, empathize with and support individuals who suffer from different problems while
      they play this role. In presence of obesity, which is a psychophysiological condition; nurses
      should also consider the fact that obese individuals who face bitter criticisms and social
      exclusion may show low self-esteem and impaired body image due to excessive weight and
      therefore they should give these individuals opportunities to express their feelings as to
      how they perceive themselves. The studies in literature that investigated the correlation
      between body mass index (BMI) and self-esteem and body perception report that obese
      individuals demonstrate relatively lower self-esteem and body perception as compared to the
      normal individuals. Psychological and hormonal disorders, impaired body image and chronic
      diseases that develop with obesity influence sexual life negatively, too. Therefore; sexual
      desire may decrease among obese individuals who feel worthless and therefore there may be
      behaviors that avoid sexuality. Sexuality, one of the activities of daily life, is an issue
      that is affected by cultural norms and rules and individuals have difficulties expressing
      their sexual problems comfortably.
