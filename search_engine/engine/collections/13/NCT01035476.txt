      adherence (apnea/hypopnea index, mask leak, minute ventilation); but to date data card
      monitoring has not yet been incorporated fully into ALS clinic practice. We will limit our
      focus to patients who meet Medicare-reimbursement criteria or AAN-recommended practice
      parameters for initiating NIPPV. The larger question guiding this research is whether data
      card monitoring and communication of these results to clinicians and patient families
      promotes "optimal use" of NIPPV. We define optimal use as (i) high acceptance, as indicated
      by daily night time use greater than 4 hours, and (ii) high adherence, as indicated by
      apnea/hypopnea index, mask leak, and minute ventilation. We will test whether timely
      reporting of acceptance and adherence values to patients and clinicians increases the
      likelihood of (i) changes in orofacial masks and settings on devices and continued use of
      devices, and (ii) positive patient mood and sleep quality and lower caregiver burden over
      follow-up.
