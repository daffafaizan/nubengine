      of a therapeutic method called Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients suffering from
      severe, treatment-resistant depression, i.e. in patients who have not sufficiently improved
      under established antidepressant therapies (such as psychotherapy, antidepressant drug
      therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy).

      DBS, also known as "brain pacemaker" therapy, is a neurosurgical therapeutic method that is
      widely established for the treatment of other conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
      However, DBS is not yet approved for the treatment of patients with depression.

      In order to initiate DBS treatment, a neurosurgical procedure is performed in which
      electrodes are placed in a brain region termed 'medial forebrain bundle' (MFB). The
      electrodes are then used to stimulate this region with electric pulses. From previous
      investigations and studies with small numbers of patients, it is believed that DBS might have
      a positive effect on depressive symptoms in patients treated with the method.
