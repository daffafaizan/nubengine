        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and phase II dose of inhaled doxorubicin in
           patients with advanced solid tumors affecting the lungs.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of inhaled doxorubicin in blood in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between pharmacodynamic parameters and toxic effects of this
           regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive inhaled doxorubicin every 3 weeks for up to 3 doses. Patients with stable or
      responding disease may receive additional doses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
