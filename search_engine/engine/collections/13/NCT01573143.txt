      post-operative atrial fibrillation and improve clinical outcome in patients undergoing
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or major vascular surgery has been largely generated by
      observational studies. In a recent meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials (of which only 2 had
      postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) as a predefined outcome) evaluating the use of
      perioperative statin treatment in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (n=651 patients in
      total - study size between 40 and 200 patients), statin use was found to reduce the patients'
      relative risk of developing postoperative AF by 43% (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.45,0.72) and their
      absolute risk by 14% (95% CI 8%,20%). Although these findings would be consistent with a
      rapid and, possibly, lipid-independent antiarrhythmic effect of statins, they have important
      limitations (e.g., single-centre, small size, lack of continuous ECG monitoring, mostly
      "ancillary" findings") and less bearing on current clinical practice, as they mostly included
      statin-na√Øve patients. For these reasons, the recent guidelines for the management of AF have
      not given a strong recommendation for the use of statins in the prevention of postoperative
      AF. Thus, whether intensive statin treatment in the perioperative period is associated with
      prevention of AF, cardio protection, and improved clinical outcome remains to be
      demonstrated.
