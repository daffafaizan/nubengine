      balance. The main cause of this inflammation is smoking. After smoking cessation, this
      inflammation and shifted oxidant/antioxidant balance continues. This causes an increased
      deterioration of lung function compared to healthy persons of matching age.

      The ongoing inflammation appears to be relatively insensitive to corticosteroid therapy.

      Until now, there is no therapy for this inflammation. Both in vitro and in vivo studies show
      that carbon monoxide has, besides an antioxidant capacity, anti-inflammatory properties. The
      aim of this trial is to study whether the inflammation can be reduced by inhalation of carbon
      monoxide.
