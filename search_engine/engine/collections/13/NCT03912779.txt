      self-efficacy for hearing aid(s), readiness for action and hearing aid knowledge in first
      time hearing aid users.

      Objectives:

      Primary research question:

      - Does the early delivery of interactive hearing aid self-management education improve
      self-efficacy for hearing aid(s) compared with standard care in first-time hearing aid users?

      Secondary research questions:

      i. Does the early delivery of interactive hearing aid self-management education improve
      readiness for hearing aids (their chosen intervention) compared with standard care in
      first-time hearing aid users?

      ii. Does the early delivery of interactive hearing aid education improve hearing aid
      knowledge compared with standard care in first-time hearing aid users?

      Study design:

      A single centre, prospective study with two randomised arms; intervention group (access to
      RLOs in DVD/ or online format, patients' preference) and control (standard hearing aid
      education booklet).

      Prospective first-time hearing aid users will be invited to take part in the study at hearing
      assessment, where they will be randomised to either the control or intervention group.
      Following 6-8 weeks of independent use prior to receiving hearing aids, study investigators
      will assess the impact of each education type on individuals self-efficacy for hearing aids,
      readiness for action and hearing aid knowledge.

      Comparisons will be made to previous evaluation of the RLOs to allow exploration of the
      impact of earlier hearing aid self-management education on self-report measures.
