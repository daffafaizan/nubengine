      and randomly divided into three groups, 20 in each group.The data was collected through
      general demographic questionnaire, rapid assessment of physical activity (RAPA) to determine
      physical activity level and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) to determine
      the level of pain severity, stiffness, functional activities, recreational activities and
      Quality of life for enhancing functional independence while having osteoarthritis. For
      between-group analysis, one way ANOVA was used and for within-group analysis longitudinal
      repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was
      used.
