    
      This is a three-part, multicenter study that will enroll a total of 80 eligible, HIV-1
      subjects who are virologically suppressed and stable on daily oral combination antiretroviral
      therapy. The study will be conducted in three parts.

      Part 1 and Part 2 are the dose-ranging portions of the study. In Part 1, 30 eligible subjects
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 16 weeks of combination treatment with
      albuvirtide and 3BNC117 or continue on the existing ART regimen under one of the three
      cohorts as follows:

        -  Cohort 1: albuvirtide 0.32 g and 3BNC117 2 g every 2 weeks

        -  Cohort 2: albuvirtide 0.32 g and 3BNC117 2 g every 4 weeks

        -  Control Arm 1: Subjects continuing on baseline ART

      In Part 2 of the study, 20 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 16
      weeks of combination treatment with albuvirtide and 3BNC117 under one of the two cohorts as
      follows:

        -  Cohort 3: albuvirtide 0.32 g and 3BNC117 0.8 g every 4 weeks

        -  Cohort 4: albuvirtide 0.16 g and 3BNC117 0.8 g every 4 weeks

      Part 3 of this study will enroll an additional 30 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive up to 28
      weeks of combination treatment with optimal dose of albuvirtide and 3BNC117 or continue on
      the existing ART regimen as follows:

        -  Optimal Dose: albuvirtide and 3BNC11 every 2 or 4 weeks

        -  Control Arm 2: Subjects continuing on baseline ART All consenting patients, in Cohort 1
           and 2 (Part 1) and Cohort 3 and 4 (Part 2) of the study, will be shifted from daily oral
           combination antiretroviral regimen to an intravenous infusion of ABT and 3BNC117. The
           total treatmentduration with the ABT and 3BNC117 combination regimen will be up to 16
           weeks (for Part 1 and Part 2) or 28 weeks (for Part 3) with a two week overlap of the
           baseline oral antiretroviral regimen and the ABT-3BNC117 combination regimen at the
           beginning of the study treatment and at the end of the treatment phase in subjects who
           do not experience virologic rebound. During the two week overlap of baseline oral
           antiretrovirals and ABT-3BNC117 combination regimen at the beginning of the study
           treatment, subject will receive weekly doses of ABT and 3BNC117 as intravenous
           infusions. Beyond the overlap period, subjects in Cohort 1 will receive study treatments
           every two weeks and subjects in Cohort 2, 3, and 4 will receive study treatments every
           four weeks.

      Study participants will be monitored for viral rebound every two weeks following initiation
      of ABT-3BNC117 combination and will re-initiate an oral antiretroviral regimen if virologic
      rebound is confirmed with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels above 200 copies/ml on two consecutive
      blood draws.

      Pharmacokinetics of ABT and 3BNC117 will be assessed in this study.
