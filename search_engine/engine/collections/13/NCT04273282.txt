      of investigators to receive one of two treatment groups, either experimental or control in
      the first eye. The second eye will undergo cataract surgery approximately 2 weeks later and
      will be treated with the other treatment group:

      Dexycu Group: A total of 30 study subjects will have Dexycu intracameral dexamethasone placed
      in their scheduled surgical eye at the time of surgery and will receive 50 micrograms of
      intracameral moxifloxacin at the conclusion of the procedure. They will take Prolensa each
      day after surgery for 4 weeks.

      Control Group: A total of 30 study subjects will receive topical moxifloxacin 0.5% four times
      per day 1 day prior to surgery and for ten days postoperatively, Prolensa every day 1 day
      prior to surgery and for 4 weeks postoperatively, and prednisolone acetate 1.0% four times
      per day starting at the conclusion of cataract surgery for 2 weeks and twice per day for 2
      weeks in their scheduled surgical eye.
