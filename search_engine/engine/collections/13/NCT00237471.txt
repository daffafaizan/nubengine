      >=10mmol/L within 24 hours of pain onset, to either tight glucose control (aiming BGLs 4.5 -
      7mmol/L) with an insulin infusion (for 24 hours) followed by subcutaneous insulin or standard
      control (BGL 6 - 12mmol/L) without the use of an insulin infusion. Serial myocardial contrast
      echocardiography will measure changes in myocardial perfusion and function from baseline to 3
      months between each group. We will also measure changes in inflammatory and endothelial
      markers over this time to see whether tight glucose control improves these surrogate
      endpoints.
