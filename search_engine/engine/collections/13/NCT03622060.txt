      in all patients. The absence or presence of antegrade flow in the radial artery will be
      examined while compressing the ulnar artery as previously described.

      The internal lumen radial artery diameter was evaluated by doppler ultrasound as the distance
      between the inner walls of the artery by personnel that are blinded to the study protocol.

      Radial artery angiogram was performed soon after radial sheath insertion and the radial
      artery diameter was measured in AP projection in all patients.
