      eclampsia and fetal neuroprotection. In these clinical settings, after delivery, oxytocin is
      often given to prevent or treat PPH. There is evidence that patients with preeclampsia
      already have a higher risk of PPH than non-preeclamptic patients. In the presence of the
      effects of MgSO4 treatment on the uterus, PPH could be worse in theory. If patients have had
      oxytocin-augmented labor, then the desensitization effect on the uterus also comes into play.
      Performing this study in vitro will allow us to assess the effects on the uterine muscle of
      MgSO4 in oxytocin-desensitized tissue samples.

      Scientific evidence on pregnancy outcomes in these patients is timely and important. A study
      of myometrial contractility under controlled conditions is likely to provide us with
      information on the interactions between oxytocin and MgSO4 that occurs in many clinical
      scenarios, eliminating any confounders that could be encountered in clinical settings. The
      investigators hope to determine the myometrial contraction patterns induced by oxytocin in
      the presence of MgSO4, including in myometrial specimens pre-treated with oxytocin plus
      MgSO4, to mimic the clinical scenarios in preeclampsia and fetal neuroprotection. This will
      expand the depth of our understanding of the desensitization phenomenon, and could provide
      valuable insight into the mechanism responsible for PPH in these patient populations. This
      study will form a basis for future modifications in oxytocin augmentation regimens and
      pharmacotherapy for control of uterine atony and PPH in these patient populations being
      simultaneously treated with MgSO4.
