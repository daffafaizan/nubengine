      growth by the same criteria as women of normal and tall stature. The objective of the
      following study is to evaluate fetal growth patterns parallel to women's height and try to
      make conclusions regarding possible definitions of subjective Intra-uterine growth
      restriction.

      Informed consent is not required due to the retrospective nature of the study. Patient
