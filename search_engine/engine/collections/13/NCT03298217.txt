      flows. This device has been widely adopted in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and for
      interhospital transport of critically ill children, as the system is easily set up and is
      well tolerated by patients. In the context of AVB, retrospective audits and observational
      studies have suggested promising outcomes on both physiological and clinical variables.
      However, in less than 6 months old infants with moderate to severe AVB, the failure rate with
      this device - defined as worsening of respiratory failure or the occurrence of discomfort or
      severe apnea - remains high, from 30% to 50% in key studies.

      HFNC flow setting remains empiric, 2 L/kg/min being used by most teams. A potential
      explanation for this high failure rate is that the flow usually used is lower than the
      patient's inspiratory flow. The aim of this study is to determine peak tidal inspiratory flow
      (PTIF) values in infants up to 6 months old with moderate to severe AVB.

      PTIF will be evaluated with a spirometer connected to a face mask during 20 cycles of
      spontaneous ventilation. The measurements will be performed within the first 24 hours of
      hospitalization in the department of Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care of Arnaud de
      Villeneuve University Hospital at Montpellier (France).

      Statistical analysis Relation between the DIP and Silverman score, mWCAS, RR, LOS will be
      expressed with parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients according to the
      distribution of the data.
