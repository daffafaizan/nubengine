      in abdominal wall reconstruction. It is single-blind (patients are blinded to the type of
      mesh used while surgeons are not).

      Our goals in this study are:

        1. PRIMARY OUTCOME: To compare the overall complication rates between two non-cross-linked
           porcine dermal matrices (XenMatrix and Strattice) at 30 days and 1 year postoperatively

        2. SECONDARY OUTCOMES

      i. To compare the rate of Surgical Site Occurrences (SSOs) between XenMatrix and Strattice in
      abdominal wall reconstruction at 30 days and 1 year postoperatively

        1. Infection

        2. Seroma

        3. Hematoma

        4. Wound dehiscence

        5. Skin necrosis

        6. Formation of enterocutaneous fistula

        7. Mesh infection ii. To compare the hernia recurrence rate between XenMatrix and Strattice
           at 30 days and 1 year postoperatively iii. To compare the bulge rate between XenMatrix
           and Strattice at 30 days and 1 year postoperatively iv. To compare to changes in patient
           pain, physical functioning and quality of life after hernia repair between XenMatrix and
           Strattice, preoperatively, and at 1 year postoperatively A. Pain assessment: Patient
           Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Intensity survey, PROMIS
           Pain Interference survey B. Physical functioning assessment: PROMIS Physical Function C.
           Quality of life assessment: Hernia-Related Quality-of-Life (HerQLes) survey
