      current acellular pertussis vaccines. Use of novel adjuvants is one approach to such
      improvement. TQL1055 is a rationally designed, semisynthetic analog of the licensed Quillaja
      saponin (QS)-21. It has been designed to maintain adjuvant activity with improved
      tolerability and greater ease of manufacture.

      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double blind, active-controlled sequential-group study,
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the combination of
      TQL1055 and acellular pertussis vaccine. The dose of TQL1055 will increase by group.
