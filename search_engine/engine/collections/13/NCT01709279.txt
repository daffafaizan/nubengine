      radical treatment for them is heart transplantation: however, the number of giving donor is
      extremely limited. Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into
      mesodermal-lineage cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as myocardial cell. They
      reside in the mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues. The latter
      tissues are relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow cells. In
      this study, the ischemic heart failure patients will undergo intracoronary administration of
      autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells through cardiac catheterization.
