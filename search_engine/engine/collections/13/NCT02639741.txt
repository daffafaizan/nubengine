      effect of preoperative single dose of oral melatonin and vitamin C administration on
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery. One
      hundred-sixty five ASA I-II adult patients between 18-65 years of age, undergoing elective
      major abdominal surgery with general anesthesia will be included in this double blinded,
      randomised, controlled study. Patients will randomly divided into equal (n=55) three groups.
      Preoperatively, one hour before surgery, patients will receive melatonin (6 mg) in group M,
      vitamin C (2 gr) in group C or placebo tablet in group P orally. A standard anesthetic
      protocol will be administered to all patients. At the end of surgery, postoperative pain
      control will be provided via a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device including morphine
      in all groups. Hemodynamic parameters, pain, sedation, patient satisfaction, total morphine
      consumption, supplement analgesic requirement, incidence of nausea and vomiting and other
      side effects will be recorded at 5, 10, 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hr after surgery.
