      simple, bedside examination, repetitive, generally available, cheap, no exposure to X-rays,
      no need to transport the patient to the CT laboratory

      Differential diagnosis:

      Widening of the size of the optic nerve sheath outside of increased intracranial pressure may
      occur in the following pathologies:

      optic neuritis optic nerve injuries meningioma of the optic nerve arachnoid cyst around the
      optic nerve tumors of the cavernous sinus Blood edema may occur due to impaired blood flow.
      The research is to determine whether the patient's position for urological procedures is safe
      for the patients and whether as a result of staying in such a position there is no
      development of cerebral edema.
