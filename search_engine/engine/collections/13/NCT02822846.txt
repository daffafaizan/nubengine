      hypoxemia, atelectasis etcâ€¦ It's not rare in paediatric intubation. The prevalence of
      malposition of endotracheal tube is 30 to 40% in babies and infants less than 1 year old.
      Currently doctors try to detect malposition of intra-tracheal tube by auscultation and
      capnograms and chest radiography is needed to confirm it. The Chest X ray is the gold
      standard.

      The aim of the study is to confirm the good positioning of the tube with a lung
      ultrasonography.

      After each intra-tracheal intubation, for patients with qualifying criteria, a lung
      ultrasonography will be performed, in bed, by two trained doctors (senior and junior) to
      determine if the position is right. Then, the chest radiography will be performed as usual.
