      loss of muscles. The guidelines recommend a minimal protein's intake of 60g per day. But this
      goal is achieved only for 55 to 60 % patients 4 months after surgery and 50 Ã  65 % patients
      at one year.

      Protein assistant is a software which can calculate the amount of proteins eaten per day and
      can propose solutions if the intake is insufficient.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the use of Protein Assistant on
      the daily protein intake in obese patients who underwent a bariatric surgery (in the 3 months
      following surgery).

      Protein Assistant is suggested 1 month after bariatric surgery on a digital tablet. The
      patient is educated to use Protein Assistant. The patient has to complete a dietary record
      every 2 weeks during 2 months. The aim is to intake 60g per day. If the aim is not reached,
      Protein assistant suggests qualitative and/or quantitative solutions.
