      surgical procedures are enrolled in the study after checking for inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Patients are randomised to either LMA group for blind tracheal intubation with
      either a standard PVC tracheal tube, or a specifically for the LMA Fastrach developed tube,
      yielding 4 subgroups.

      After a standardised anaesthesia induction, blind intubation is performed in each study
      group. Different time intervals are documented, such as time to first adequate lung
      ventilation, or f.e. time for laryngeal mask placement. A crossover-design is performed after
      unsuccessful intubation, using the alternate LMA or the other tracheal tube. LMA placement is
      visualised by fibreoptic control.

      An estimated success rate for blind intubation of 60% in the Aura-i group versus 90% in the
      Fastrach group yields a sample size of n= 38. To compensate for dropouts, n=40 subjects are
      enrolled in each group.
