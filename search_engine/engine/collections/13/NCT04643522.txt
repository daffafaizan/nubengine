      parameters of the infertile male patients who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, through the
      comparison of the spermiogram results which were reported before and after the diagnosis of
      COVID-19. The investigators also aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the sex-related
      hormone levels as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and
      testosterone (T). The current study is conducted in Ankara City Hospital, the highest
      capacity tertiary health care center of the capital town of Turkey. The study included 21
      patients who applied to Ankara City Hospital, Andrology Clinic for male infertility up to 05
      October, 2020 and have had the semen analyses reported before and after the clinically
      confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 through reverse transcriptase PCR. Besides the semen
      analyses, 8 of these 21 patients have also the had the reported levels of T, FSH and LH which
