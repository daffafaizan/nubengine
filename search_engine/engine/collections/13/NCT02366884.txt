      conducted at two sites in patients who have tried conventional therapy and failed or have
      refused conventional therapy. This study is being conducted to determine the efficacy of
      combinations of marketed drugs against unicellular organisms in cancer treatment. The
      products under investigation include FDA- and SSA-approved anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and
      anti-protozoan drugs with documented anti-cancer properties. The drugs under study are
      compatible with each other, and used at pharmacological dosages known to be tolerable and
      safe in humans and/or cancer patients with limited adverse effects. Patients receive
      treatment for 10 to 12 months. The duration of treatment is depended on the drugs
      investigated. It is hypothesized that regression will occur within 6 months and treatment
      will be continued with the assumption that this may prevent recurrences. Outcomes will be
      measured objectively and assessments appropriate for the type of cancer treated. Outcome
      measures may include 1) Changes in signs and symptoms; (2) Visual inspection of tumors using
      weekly photographs and measurements (as appropriate); (3)Monthly chest X-rays to monitor lung
      tumors, lung metastases and/or fluid in the chest; (4) Ultrasound to evaluate abdominal
      tumors (e.g., liver metastases), and breast and armpit lymph nodes; (5) CT, MRI and PET
      scans; (6) Tumor markers in blood such as Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), CA-15.3, CA-19-9,
      etc. and other laboratory studies to monitor response. The overall goal of this study is to
      understand the efficacy of atavistic chemotherapy that may mediate metastatic or terminal
      cancer regression or cure.
