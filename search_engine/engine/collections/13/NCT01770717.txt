      Imaging which can identify the tissue regions that are at risk of developing pressure ulcers
      prior to development of irreversible tissue damage. The Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging can
      identify metabolic and biochemical differences in the tissues near bony prominences which are
      at risk for developing pressure ulcers.
