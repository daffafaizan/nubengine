      (NSCLC) can increase local control rates and improve overall survival. Compared with
      conventional fractionated radiotherapy, accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy can yield
      higher BED, shorten the total treatment time, and theoretically obtain better efficacy.
      However, currently, there is no optimal hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen. Based on phase
      I trial results, we performed this phase II trial to further evaluate the safety and
      preliminary efficacy of accelerated hypofractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation
      therapy(3-DCRT) combined with concurrent chemotherapy for patients with unresectable stage
      III NSCLC.

      Patients with previously untreated unresectable stage III NSCLC received 3-DCRT with a total
      dose of 69 Gy, delivered at 3 Gy per fraction, once daily, five fractions per week, completed
      within 4.6 weeks. At the same time, platinum doublet chemotherapy was applied.
