      enter the double blind (DB) period Cycle 1. Subjects who are eligible for retreatment will
      then be offered to enter open label (OL) Cycles 2 to 5 as DB roll-over subjects. Once
      recruitment of the DB period is complete, the study will enrol additional BTX-na√Øve subjects
      (hereafter referred to as OL de novo subjects) into the OL period Cycle 1. All OL de novo
      subjects who are eligible for retreatment will also be offered to enter OL Cycles 2 to 5. A
      total of 580 subjects (180 subjects randomised in the DB period and an additional 400 de novo
      subjects in the OL period) are planned to complete the study.
