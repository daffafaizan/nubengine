    
      We propose to adapt an existing symptomatic adverse event tool, the Patient-Reported Outcomes
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), to be content appropriate and
      clinically meaningful for adult survivors of childhood cancer using two well-established
      childhood cancer survivor cohorts. Psychometric methodologies will be used to validate this
      tool by incorporating objective clinical anchors collected from medical evaluations. Our
      symptomatic AE tool has the potential to augment the Children Oncology Group Survivorship
      Care Guidelines by implementing risk-based symptom screening to track and anticipate adverse
      health events.
