      These lesions are precursors to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and are treated to
      prevent progression to SCC. First-line therapy for AK include cryotherapy and curettage,
      which target clinically visible lesions but do not address the subclinical lesions in the
      field of ultraviolet radiation damage. Field therapy includes topical chemotherapy,
      immunotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. Ingenol mebutate is the active compound found in
      Euphorbia peplus sap, and has been approved for treatment of AK in immunocompetent patients.
      Ingenol mebutate 0.015% is favored over other topical treatments for treatment of AK on the
      face due to the brief treatment course, high clearance rate, and resolution without sequelae.

      Solid organ transplant recipients (OTR) have a high incidence of AK and high risk of
      developing SCC, and require frequent field therapy. In addition, OTR generally have a higher
      burden of AK and require treatment of a larger surface area than the 25 cm2 area labeled for
      ingenol mebutate 0.015%. The investigators plan to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      ingenol mebutate 0.015% in OTR, with a treatment area up to 100cm2.

      This is a single arm, open-label interventional study of ingenol mebutate 0.015% in solid
      organ transplant recipients. The investigators plan to treat 20 subjects, 10 kidney
      transplant recipients and 10 lung transplant recipients. The investigators have selected
      these two populations as the represent the spectrum of solid organ transplantation: kidney
      transplant recipients are the largest transplant population, but have lower levels of
      immunosuppression and skin cancer risk. Lung transplant recipients have the highest burden of
      skin cancer and actinic keratoses.
