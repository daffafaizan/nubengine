      I. To determine the acute toxicity (=< 90 days from protocol treatment start) from
      chemoradiotherapy including paclitaxel +/- trastuzumab and irradiation in non-cystectomy
      patients with or without her2/neu overexpression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ability of patients with bladder cancer who are non-cystectomy candidates
      to complete this treatment program.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of this treatment program in achieving a complete response of
      the primary tumor.

      III. To measure the 5-year disease-free and overall survival of patients with bladder cancer
      treated with transurethral resection of the bladder followed by chemoradiotherapy.

      IV. To estimate the value of tumor and/or serum biomarkers as predictors of initial tumor
      response and recurrence-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups according to HER2/neu status (HER2/neu 2+ or 3+ staining [group 1] vs
      HER2/neu 0 or 1+ staining [group 2]).

      GROUP I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29,
      36, and 43 and trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and then over 30 minutes
      on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5,
      8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, 43-47, and 50. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive paclitaxel and undergo radiotherapy as in group 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-5 weeks, every 3 months for 1
      year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
