    
      Type of study: multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled clinical
      trial.

      Number of centers: 9 French centers in Auvergne and Rhône-Alpes regions

      Medical product Ethanol 40% + Enoxaparine 400UI/ml Versus Vancomycin 5 mg/ml + Héparine
      2500UI/ml

      Patients

      Patients eligible for inclusion will be randomized to one of the two groups:

        -  Experimental group: 90 patients will receive 10 injections of ethanol lock solution in
           implantable venous access port during the first 10 days of the study.

        -  Control group: 90 patients will receive 10 injections of vancomycin lock solution in
           implantable venous access port during the first 10 days of the study.

        -  For each group, in case of bacteraemia, the lock therapy is associated with a systemic
           antibiotic therapy using another venous line and optimized by a specialist in infectious
           diseases.

      Study Performance

      Patients will be assessed at baseline D0, 3 days (D3), 10 days (D10), 14 weeks (W14) after D0
      as follows:

      Visit 1 (D0 - baseline):

        -  Signature of an informed consent form.

        -  Demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, age, disease associated with implantable
           venous access port, implantable venous access port infection data, bacteraemia data)

      Days 1 to 10

        -  Injection of ethanol or vancomycin lock solution in implantable venous access port

        -  Ethanolemia 30 minutes after injection, on first day

        -  Side effects evaluation

      Visit 2 (D3) and Visit 3 (D10)

        -  Side effects evaluation

        -  Blood culture

        -  Bacteraemia data (antibiotic therapy modification)

      Phone contact each week from week 2 to week 13

      End Visit (W14)

        -  Side effects evaluation

        -  Blood culture

        -  Bacteraemia data (antibiotic therapy modification)
