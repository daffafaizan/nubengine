      unit. The following data will also be recorded: patient demographics (age, gender, BMI),
      surgical procedure, length of procedure and anesthetic, and smoking exposure. Based on
      differences in postoperative outcomes (e.g., supplemental oxygen requirement in the PACU)
      observed in the derivation cohort for the 6-item questionnaire, the study will enroll 1,000
      patients to attain sufficient power for evaluating the 6-item questionnaire in the overall
      cohort and in demographically or clinically defined subgroups.
