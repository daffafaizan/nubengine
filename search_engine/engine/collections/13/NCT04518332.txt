      complications in pediatric living donor liver transplantation patients. In this prospective
      observational clinical study, the investigators aim to investigate the correlation between
      the intraoperative cerebral and renal tissue oxygen saturation and the incidence of
      developmental and socioemotional delay and postoperative complications. This study will
      enroll patients aged from 6 to 36 months old who are scheduled for elective standard
      living-donor liver transplantation and have signed informed consent before the surgery.
