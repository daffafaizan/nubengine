    
      Study Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.

      Objective: To investigate the effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) compared to placebo in low-risk
      adult patients undergoing elective minor lumbar spine surgery on operative time, estimated
      blood loss and complications.

      Summary of Background Data: Studies have shown that TXA reduces blood loss during major spine
      surgery. There are no studies on the effect of TXA in minor lumbar spine surgery on operative
      time, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss and complications.

      Methods: We enrolled patients with ASA grades 1 to 2, scheduled to undergo lumbar
      decompressive surgery at Middelfart Hospital. Patients with thromboembolic disease,
      coagulopathy, hypersensitivity to TXA or history of convulsion were excluded. Patients were
      randomized, in blocks of 10, to two groups: TXA or placebo. Anticoagulation therapy was
      discontinued 2-7 days preoperatively. Prior to the incision, patients received either a bolus
      of TXA (10mg/kg), or an equivalent volume of saline solution (placebo).
