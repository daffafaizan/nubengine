    
      Patients with locally advanced, N2 and N3 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) will
      be recruited. All subjects receiving induction chemotherapy will undergo a baseline
      integrated [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography (PET/CT) scan before the start of concurrent chemoradiation. This baseline
      assessment is optional in patients not receiving neo-adjuvant treatment.

      All patients will undergo a dedicated FDG PET/CT protocol 12 weeks after the end of
      chemoradiation (primary endpoint). In PET/CT negative patients, 2 monthly control visits will
      be performed complemented with additional imaging as required. All patients will undergo
      PET/CT 1 year after completing chemoradiation unless recurrent/residual disease was already
      proven pathologically. Patients with a PET/CT suspected for residual nodal disease must have
      pathological proof of nodal involvement (fine needle aspiration in non-operable patients or
      neck dissection in the others) before salvage chemotherapy is started.

      In a subset of patients receiving induction chemotherapy prior to concurrent chemoradiation,
      an additional FDG PET/CT scan will be performed at baseline and after 1 cycle of chemotherapy
      to evaluate the metabolic response to the treatment (secondary endpoint).
