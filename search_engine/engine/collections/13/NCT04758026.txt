    
      The purpose of this study is to provide knowledge on late effects and mortality risk after
      modern treatment in long-term survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC). This will allow
      adjustments of treatment planning and improved treatment decisions for patients at risk, and
      improve information and follow up for future patients. For head and neck cancer (HNC)
      survivors of today, with the rising proportion of HPV induced cancer and with improved modern
      treatment, the late effects and mortality risk has changed compared to survivors previous
      decades.

      The investigators will assess the prevalence and severity of a broad range of late effects
      and identify associated risk factors for the following late effects;

        -  Chronic fatigue

        -  Hearing loss and tinnitus

        -  Oral late effects, including taste and smell disturbances and osteoradionecrosis

        -  Dysphagia and malnutrition

        -  Body image, intimacy and endocrine dysfunction

      In addition,possible biological explanatory mechanisms for fatigue and possibly other
      selected late effects will be explored. Data will be compared to age and gender matched
      reference data for those where this is available.

      Design: a cross-sectional study

      Assessments: Patient-reported questionnaires, blood sample with biomarkers, clinical
      examination, audiometry, oral radiological examination and oral examination. Data on
      patients' medical history collected from medical records including radiology images and
      digital radiotherapy plans.
