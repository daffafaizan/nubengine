      nodes, typically contributes to confer them a heterogeneous aspect during endosonographic
      B-mode examination, but a possible association between calcifications and metastatic
      involvement has never been systematically evaluated. The most likely reason why this possible
      association has been overlooked up to now is that the presence of calcifications in
      intrathoracic lymph nodes has long been thought to be the consequence of the prior
      involvement from granulomatous diseases (i.e., tuberculosis or sarcoidosis), and as such has
      been considered a sign of benignity. However, the presence of lymph node calcifications at
      ultrasound examination is a known predictor of lymph node metastasis in patients with some
      specific tumours, such as the papillary thyroid carcinoma or the squamous cell carcinoma of
      head or neck. Furthermore, recent radiological-pathological studies have shown that
      metastatic foci from lung cancer are observed in up to 19% calcified mediastinal lymph nodes
      identified at CT in surgical candidates. Finally, a recently published EBUS study has
      reported, for the first time, a very strong association between a very specific pattern of
      mediastinal lymph node calcification, known as "starry sky sign", and metastasis from
      pulmonary, colonic and breast adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, the starry sky sign is
      characterized by the presence of few to countless dot-like calcifications which are too small
      to be seen at CT and can be identified only during EBUS B-mode examination.

      To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been carried out to assess the correlation
      between the presence and the ultrasound pattern of lymph node calcifications and lymph node
      metastasis from lung cancer.
