      recruited into 4 groups: Hypnotherapy, Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), both hypnotherapy
      and NRT, and self-quit group. All patients received self-help brochures and in-hospital
      counseling. Intervention groups received more extensive counseling, free NRT supply for a
      month and/or a 90 minute hypnotherapy session within 2 weeks of discharge. They also had
      follow up telephone counseling at 1,2,4,8 and 12 weeks after discharge. 7 day prevalence of
      tobacco abstinence rates at 26 weeks after hospitalization were verified by self report and
      urinary Cotinine levels.
