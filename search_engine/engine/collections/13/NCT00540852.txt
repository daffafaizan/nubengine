      non-invasive optical technique that utilizes intensity-modulated, near-infrared light to
      quantitatively measure optical properties in thick tissues.

      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging can images tissue hemoglobin , oxygen saturation, blood
      volume fraction, water content, fat content and cellular structure. The measurements provide
      quantitative optical property values that reflect changes in tissue perfusion, oxygen
      consumption, and cell/matrix development.

      There is no therapeutic benefit to the subject, especially none that might influence the
      indication for the diagnostic procedure as indicated. However, information obtained may lead
      to a new form of non-invasive imaging for the early detection of breast cancer.
