      randomized, prospective, single-blinded study. After catheter ablation (isolation) of the
      pulmonary veins (PVI) and while still in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory, all
      patients will be randomized to either PVI alone or the combination of PVI + posterior left
      atrial wall isolation (PWI). For patients randomized to PVI, their ablation procedure will be
      completed at that time. For those patients randomized to PVI + PWI, they will have additional
      ablation to achieve PWI.

      All study patients will have the same follow-up after their ablation procedure, including
      clinic visits at 3, 6, and 12 months and a heart event monitor for 7-14 days before these
      visits. An echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) is performed at 6 to 12 months after the
      ablation. Blood thinners are recommended for two months after ablation and then the need for
      continued use of blood thinners will be based on individual patient's medical history, stroke
      risk and the decision of the study doctor. Information about the patients' medical history,
      heart arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation will be collected during the study which will be
      analyzed.
