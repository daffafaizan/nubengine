      growing prevalence of chronic medical conditions that contribute to workplace pain, fatigue,
      task limitations, and reduced productivity. The proposed multi-site study is a randomized,
      controlled trial of a multi-session group intervention program targeting workers with chronic
      health concerns (N = 300). The primary outcome measures will be self-report measures of work
      limitations and work engagement measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up.
      Secondary outcomes will include turnover intention, sickness absence, job satisfaction, and
      healthcare utilization. Process variables and covariates will include assessment of
      self-efficacy, work-related fatigue, emotional distress, work characteristics, general health
      status, and basic demographic variables. The study should provide an assessment of whether
      principles of symptom self-management can be successfully applied to workplace problems and
      delivered in a group workshop format to reduce the disabling effects of chronic medical
      conditions.
