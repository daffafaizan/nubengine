      respond well to that cycle will be started on radiation therapy along with chemotherapy and
      those that don't respond well to the initial cycle of chemotherapy, will undergo a total
      laryngectomy (surgery to remove the voice box) followed by radiation therapy. The initial
      cycle of chemotherapy consists of the drugs Taxotere, Cisplatin, and 5-Fluorouracil (this
      combination is known as TPF). Then on Day 20 of the study, the subjects will be administered
      another chemotherapy agent called cetuximab (a.k.a. C-225). It will then be determined if the
      patient's response to the chemotherapy was favorable by examining the patient's tumor with an
      endoscopy. If the response is determined to be good, then the patient will continue with a
      chemotherapy regimen with the addition of radiation therapy combination. If the patient's
      response to the chemotherapy is determined to be less than favorable, then the patient will
      be advised to undergo salvage surgery (a.k.a. laryngectomy) to remove their voice box and
      then undergo radiation therapy treatment. Additionally, tumor tissue samples and blood will
      be studied to see if there are special molecular markers that help predict when a tumor will
      respond to chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
