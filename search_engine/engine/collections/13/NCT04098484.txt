      them, 15 will be normal weight and 15 will suffer from fatty liver disease (BMI 29-35 kg/m2,
      waist size >102 cm). The exclusion criteria will be a) medication, b) musculoskeletal
      problems that will prevent participation in the training program, c) known condition or
      medical condition preventing participation in the program e.g. hypertension, d) BMI> 35kg /
      m2, (e) a severe family medical history up to first degree relatives with cardiovascular
      disease and / or diabetes at the age of less than 65 for women and less than 55 years for men
      and (f) smoking. After informing and receiving a questionnaire and medical history,
      volunteers will sign for their participation in the survey.

      A two-trial repeated measures design will be applied in this investigation. Both control and
      exercise trials will last for 3 months. During the week preceding the commencement of the
      study, participants will complete dietary recalls and will have their habitual physical
      activity monitored, by utilizing accelerometers. Thereafter, body composition, ultrasound
      imaging of muscle and liver, biochemical and hematological markers will be measured. The same
      measurements will be repeated at the end of each month, in both trials. Control trial will be
      executed prior to exercise trial. An exercise intervention program, combining strength and
      cardiovascular exercises performed three times a week, will take place in the exercise trial.
