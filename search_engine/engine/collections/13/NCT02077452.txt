    
      This will be a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study with multiple oral doses
      of HMS5552 given to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who never accepted anti-diabetic
      drug for treatment before.

      The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of HMS5552 following
      multiple ascending doses in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after BID dosing for 8
      days.

      The secondary objectives include:

        1. To determine the single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics of HMS5552 in patients
           with type 2 diabetes

        2. To evaluate the single dose and steady state pharmacodynamics of HMS5552 in patients
           with type 2 diabetes

        3. To further explore food-effect on HMS5552 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

      A maximum total of 80 patients (10 in each dose group and assuming a maximum of 5~8 dose
      levels). There will be 8 active and 2 placebo patients in each dose group. The safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data after each dose cohort will be
      reviewed in blinded fashion before escalation to the next dose cohort.
