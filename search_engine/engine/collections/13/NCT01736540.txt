    
      This study was designed to collect information about a large cohort of patients with anaemias
      including MDS, aplastic anemia, Diamond-Blackfan, myeloproliferative disorder, as well as
      haemoglobinopathies (e.g. thalassaemia major, SCD) or other anaemias requiring chronic red
      blood cell transfusions.

      Clinical data was collected retrospectively (if available), unless specified by this protocol
      (e.g. serum ferritin within less than one month prior to enrollment). All assessments
      required for this protocol were performed after the patient informed consent is signed. The
      data was gathered by all study centers and was combined in one central database.

      Data was recorded using an electronic case report form (eCRF) at each study site. Adverse
      events and serious adverse events were recorded for all patients from the date of signed
      patient informed consent until the MRI tests are performed.
