      incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Regularizing the heart rate and avoiding bradycardias
      by rate responsive pacing may be a way to reduce these arrhythmias.

      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized multicenter study. Inclusion criteria: Patients
      with an indication for an ICD according to the AHA/ACC-guidelines who get a rate response
      system and have more than 5 % rate adaptive pacing during a one month screening phase may be
      included if they have given written informed consent. Rate adaptive pacing must not be
      contraindicated, patients must be able to perform a 6 min walk test, must not be NYHA IV and
      should have a life expectancy of more than 18 months.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to 6 months of rate responsive pacing followed by 6 months
      of no rate responsive pacing, vice versa respectively. At 6 and 12 months follow ups, ICD
      stored data, arrhythmic episodes, medication, anamnesis, quality of life, 6 min walktest,
      echocardiographic parameters and optionally spiroergomatry will be evaluated and compared."
