      and health information from the participant or the participant's medical record.

      Study participants will have blood drawn at each study visit (approximately 2 tablespoons).
      The participant will be asked to partake in 4 study visits over the course of 1 year. The
      first visit will be within the first 0-14 days of SCI. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th visits will be
      3, 6, and 12 months after their spinal cord injury.

      At study visits 2, 3 and 4, a study investigator will also perform some clinical evaluations
      for research purposes to test how the participant is recovering the ability to perform
      activities of daily living and move after spinal cord injury.
