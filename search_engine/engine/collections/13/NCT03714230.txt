      outcome (e.g functional status) and several covariates (e.g., cognition, anxiety and
      depression, PTSD, QOL, general symptoms, frailty). To retrieve baseline data from prior ICU
      admission, family members will be used as proxy reporters at inclusion. During treatment in
      the ICU, patients will be mapped for 5 pre-selected symptoms every day for 7 days, or until
      death or ICU discharge. Several clinical variables (e.g., SOFA score, pain score, level of
      sedation, mobilization, medication, mouth care) will be collected daily until maximum 7 days.
      Follow-up data will be collected at 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU admission using self-report
      questionnaires.

      The predictive value of pre-morbid condition prior to ICU admission on functional status
      during the first year after an ICU admission will be investigated, when controlled for
      various clinical and demographic variables. As a secondary analyses, the present study will
      identify both the occurrence of symptoms as well as the severity and distress of each
      symptom, while in the ICU. Another secondary outcome that will be measured in this
      longitudinal study is the association between cognitive function one year after an ICU
      admission and various mental health variables (PTSD, anxiety and depression).
