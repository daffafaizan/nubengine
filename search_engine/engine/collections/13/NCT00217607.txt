      Primary

        -  Determine the 2-month objective response rate in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic, unresectable soft tissue angiosarcoma or lymphangiosarcoma treated with
           paclitaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 4- and 6-month response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression and overall survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the clinical criteria predicting response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate the efficacy of this drug with the expression of genes involved in
           angiogenesis regulation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
