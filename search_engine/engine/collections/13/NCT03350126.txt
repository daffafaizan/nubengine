      colorectal cancer with a dMMR tumor. The association nivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated
      encouraging results with durable responses in these patients.

      The criteria for assessing responses for solid tumors are currently based on RECIST 1.1,
      which are well correlated with the clinical response to chemotherapy. However, in patients
      treated with immunotherapy, such criteria are less accurate, as already demonstrated in the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma, but not yet in other malignant tumors.

      Therefore, we hope with this study, to identify more accurate imaging criteria that could
      help oncologists to make optimal decisions for treatment.
