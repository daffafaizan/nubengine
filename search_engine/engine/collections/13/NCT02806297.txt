      laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) within 24 hours of
      presentation versus after clinical resolution during index admission for mild gallstone
      pancreatitis on clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, this study aims to
      determine patients' values and preferences that influence decision-making regarding treatment
      options for gallstone pancreatitis. Hypothesis: During index admission for mild gallstone
      pancreatitis, early cholecystectomy within 24 hours of presentation regardless of symptoms or
      laboratory values versus after clinical resolution results in a shorter 30-day total hospital
      length of stay.
