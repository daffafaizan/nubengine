      organs and systems. The treatment for SLE mainly depends on long-term use of glucocorticoids.
      For many patients with SLE, facial telangiectasia is a commonly seen side effect of long-term
      use of glucocorticoids. Featured by facial erythema with or without flushing or burning
      sensation, facial telangiectasia seriously affects the quality of life of patients. However,
      up to now, there has been little attention paid to this condition in SLE patients. There have
      been a lack of effective treatment options for tackling this problem.

      Intense pulsed light (IPL) is a non-laser light source used to treat a variety of vascular
      and pigmented lesions. Unlike ultraviolet that is harmful to patients with SLE, application
      of IPL may be a safe and effective treatment for SLE patients with facial telangiectasia.
      This study intends to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPL in the treatment of facial
      telangiectasia for SLE patients that has been treated with long-term corticosteroids.
