    
      This randomized controlled trial examines the impacts of a phased-in integrated technology
      -behavior change intervention on women's health with a focus on gender-based violence. In a
      population of approximately 1500 Congolese households in Kigeme refugee camp in Rwanda, two
      interventions are randomly deployed in the camp. The first intervention is the Inyenyeri
      cookstove/pellet fuel system, a Tier 4 clean cookstove system; the second intervention is a
      behavior change intervention (referred to as I-ACT, Individual-Agency-Centered Training)
      designed to foster personal agency and empowerment, given to women and, if applicable, their
      male partner. Analyses will be done with interviews on 1500 women (ages 18-45) from these
      households that may have received one, both or none of the interventions, either as the full
      sample or the sub-sample of partnered-only women.
