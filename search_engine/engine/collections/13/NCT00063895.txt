      I. To determine if a significant correlation exists between the length of the CA dinucleotide
      repeat polymorphism in the EGFR gene and observed toxicity in patients treated with OSI-774.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the pharmacodynamic effects of OSI-774 on EGFR activity and MAP kinase signaling
      using skin as a surrogate tissue.

      II. To determine if interindividual variation of OSI-774 pharmacokinetics is related to a
      previously described CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism.

      III. To evaluate whether toxicity or inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation correlates with
      OSI-774 AUC in patients treated with OSI-774.

      IV. To describe the observed anti-tumor response and toxicities in patients with advanced
      solid tumors treated with single agent fixed dose of OSI-774.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to length of CA
      dinucleotide repeat polymorphism (short vs medium vs long).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
