    
      The overarching purpose of this study is to develop a single, standardized measurement scale
      of participant influenza symptoms for use in clinical studies involving adult and pediatric
      participants. The development of an instrument for participant reported outcomes of influenza
      was composed of three stages, as described below:

      Stage I. Elicitation interviews in a group of volunteers with laboratory-confirmed influenza
      to inform the development of the instrument, including its content and structure (item
      phrasing, length, response options, recall).

      Stage II. Evaluative interviews with a second set of volunteers with laboratory-confirmed
      influenza to assess comprehension and interpretability of the instrument and draft item pool
      from the respondent's perspective.

      Stage III. Item reduction and instrument validation in a third set of volunteers to evaluate
      item properties and quantitatively validate the performance of the final measure.

      This protocol will describe the rationale, design, data collection procedures, and analysis
      methods for Stage III - Item Reduction and Instrument Validation.
