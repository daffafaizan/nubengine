      velocity waveforms non-invasively. Blood flow velocity waveforms require the use of invasive
      catheters, thus precluding clinical use. Such information would allow the researcher /
      practitioner the ability to continuously measure blood flow, pulse pressure, and the
      pulsatility index of any vascular structure accessible by ultrasound with minimal additional
      risk to the subject / patient. This data, when combined with arterial blood pressure data,
      could also be used to measure peripheral pressure volume loops as well as aortic vascular
      impedance, both of which cannot be currently measured in vivo.

      The ability to measure blood flow velocity waveforms at high temporal resolution would
      provide clinicians with new tools for hemodynamic optimization (both a novel means of
      estimating myocardial oxygen consumption [pressure volume area] as well as afterload [aortic
      vascular impedance]) and researchers with the ability to conduct hemodynamic experiments that
      were not previously possible. This work will serve as the foundation for several other
      related projects which depend on the ability to continuously record blood flow velocity
      waveforms.
