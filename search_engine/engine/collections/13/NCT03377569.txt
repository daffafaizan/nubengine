      function. Sleep problems are common in the U.S. adult population (>50 million), and have a
      negative impact on quality of life, productivity, and healthcare. A major obstacle to
      understanding how the brain is involved in human sleep disorders has been the lack of
      recordings of brain function, from inside the brain, during the known sleep states; non-rapid
      eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM). It is very common for patients with
      Parkinson's disease (PD) to also have sleep disorders, such as insomnia,
      restless-leg-syndrome and REM-behavior disorder. One treatment for PD patients is deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS). Despite evidence showing that STN-DBS
      improves several aspects of sleep behavior in PD subjects, few studies have examined the
      relationship between brain activity and sleep regulation in human subjects. In this proposal,
      the investigators will examine sleep in humans by recording brain activity from STN of PD
      patients who have undergone DBS surgery. The investigators will also test the hypothesis that
      STN contributes to both the regulation and disruption of normal sleep behavior.
