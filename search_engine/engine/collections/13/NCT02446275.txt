      therapy offers an attractive option as an alternative to medical treatment or used in
      combination therewith. Treatment focused on the soft tissues of the suboccitpital region has
      been studied in other types of headaches but not in migraine.

      Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of suboccipital inhibitory
      manual therapy treatment in migraine compared to treatment based on Myofascial Trigger Points
      (MTrPs) and their stretching, often being hypersensitive in patients with migraine.

      Material and methods: 27 patients in two groups participated in the study: a) the control
      group received combined techniques based on MTrPs and bilateral stretching in the trapezius
      and sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM); b) the experimental group was applied the same
      techniques as those applied in the control group plus suboccipital inhibition. The treatment
      lasted for 8 weeks and the impact, disability and quality of life were assessed in both
      groups.
