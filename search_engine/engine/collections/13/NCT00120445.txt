      and expansile gas in pneumatic retinopexy. The investigators hypothesize that both air and
      expansile gas have the same properties of gas and remain in the eye for 5-6 days which is
      long enough to have moderate chorioretinal adhesion to seal the retinal break. If the
      investigators can prove that air is equivalent to expansile gas in this procedure, it can
      save a lot of money for the country. Therefore, the investigators are conducting a randomised
      controlled double-blind study to compare the results of using air and perfluoropropane in
      pneumatic retinopexy for treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.
