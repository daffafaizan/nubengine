      taking their medications. Non-adherence is the most important reason for organ rejection in
      long term survivors of pediatric liver transplantation. In order to address this important
      risk-factor effectively, the first step is to evaluate a method that would identify
      non-adherence in these children. Medication blood levels that are obtained as a part of
      clinical practice in transplant centers can be used to determine whether the patient is
      adherent or not. This multi-center observational study tests the ability of an objective
      measure of adherence to immunosuppressant medications that involves the use of routinely
      obtained tacrolimus blood levels to predict organ rejection in children who had a liver
      transplant.
