      fall into the prediabetes category by hemoglobin A1c level of 5.7 to 6.4%, fasting plasma
      glucose of greater than or equal to 100 to 125, or oral glucose tolerance test of greater
      than or equal to 140 to less than 200 before 14 weeks gestation will be approached for
      consent in our randomized trial.

      Once consent is obtained, the subjects will be randomized 1:1 into two parallel groups, the
      metformin treatment group and the standard of care treatment group (routine prenatal care). A
      random number generator will allocate the participants to the study groups.

      Women taking metformin will continue twice daily dosing for the duration of their pregnancy
      after randomization. Those in the standard of care group will receive routine prenatal care.
      Both groups will undergo routine gestational diabetes testing by 28 weeks. Obstetric,
      maternal, and neonatal outcomes will then be assessed of both groups until the 6 week
      postpartum visit.
