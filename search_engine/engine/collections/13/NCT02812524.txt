      Cytotoxic T-Lmphocyte-Associated Protein 4 [CTLA-4]) 7-10 days prior to planned surgical
      resection of tumor and involved lymph nodes in patients with SCCHN. Tissue, peripheral blood,
      saliva and stool samples will be obtained for immunologic end points. The primary objective
      is to assess safety, as determined by the number of surgeries that are delayed.
