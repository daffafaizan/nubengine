      the body. In this study the aim is to evaluate the concordance between cytokine rise
      (specifically monitoring the following cytokines: Interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis
      factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL) -1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-17) and
      postoperative ileus (a condition where bowel function slows causing build up of faecal
      matter) following robotic radical cystectomy and the pneumoperitoneum (gas insufflation of
      the abdomen) pressures that were required intra-operatively.

      This study includes patients undergoing radical cystectomy. The study will measure
      pre-anaesthetic, post-anaesthetic, immediately post-operatively and two further
      post-operative serum cytokines levels and compare them with the pneumoperitoneal pressures
      required intra-operatively and the outcome of whether a clinical diagnosis of paralytic ileus
      was made.

      Serum cytokine levels will be taken on five occasions:

        1. st Sample (Baseline)-Before induction of anaesthetic

        2. nd Sample-Immediately after induction of anaesthetic

        3. rd Sample-Immediately post-operative

        4. th Sample - 2 hours post-operative

        5. th Sample - 1 day post-operative

      No alterations will be made to the care of the patient, this is purely an observational
      study.
