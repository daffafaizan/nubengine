      Surgeries done in the United States annually. This procedure can vary from intense to
      moderate pain and as such it is difficult to properly gauge and treat postoperative pain in
      these patients. Commonly used in these cases, opioid drugs are given to provide adequate
      analgesia, however higher opioid usage is observed to cause increased Post-Anesthesia Care
      Unit (PACU) stays, respiratory complications and Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV).
      Acetaminophen is commonly used as an adjunct in these circumstances because of its opioid
      sparing properties.

      Acetaminophen is a synthetic nonopioid p-aminophenol derivative available over the counter.
      Its properties include analgesic and antipyretic qualities and it is listed on the world
      health organization's list of essential medicines. The potential risks include liver damage,
      skin reactions and drug interactions when used with blood thinners at high doses.
      Acetaminophen has been extensively researched, in vitro and in vivo studies have found the
      drug to be safe when used at proper doses. Recently intravenous use of acetaminophen has
      gained popularity due to ease of use and ability to be given intraoperatively. This form of
      acetaminophen, although convenient, is around sixty two times the cost of oral acetaminophen.
      Due to this increased cost it is imperative that the investigators compare the two routes of
      administration in order to determine if the additional cost is justified.
