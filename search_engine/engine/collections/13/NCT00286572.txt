      coronary artery disease. Patients with CAD have a worse prognosis if they have diabetes
      mellitus. But it is not known whether the treatment of Dm has an influence on mortality or
      morbidity.

      In face of the high number of patients with Dm and the therapeutic consequences this
      prospective study wants to compare short-time and long-time morbidity in Patients with Dm
      undergoing major non-vascular surgery. Inclusion criteria are medically treated Dm (insulin
      or oral antidiabetics) and major non cardiac surgery.

      The "normal" perioperative treatment of the study is not changed by the study itself.
