      have not been satisfactory. This study will show whether the combination of chemotherapy,
      radiation, and AZT is more effective and less toxic than previously used treatments.

      All patients will receive combination chemotherapy and AZT. The combination chemotherapy will
      be repeated every 3 to 4 weeks for a maximum total of 6 cycles. Each cycle will consist of
      doxorubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine on day 1, dexamethasone on days
      1-5, and methotrexate on day 15. Patients with meningeal or bone marrow disease will receive
      radiation and intrathecal cytarabine (ARA-C) while those without will receive ARA-C without
      radiation. Patients with documented lymphomas in the central nervous system at initial workup
      will start radiation as soon as possible and intrathecal ARA-C (t.i.w. until cerebrospinal
      fluid is clear then every month for 1 year); patients with normal lumbar puncture, brain
      scan, and bone marrow at first diagnosis will begin radiation on day 1 of cycle 3 of
      chemotherapy. Lumbar punctures for evaluation will be done four times during the first cycle,
      on days 1, 8, 21, and 28. AZT will be administered every 4 hours, 7 days a week, beginning at
      the completion of combined chemotherapy, once the patient has achieved a complete remission
      of the lymphoma, and continuing for 1 year.
