      Paclitaxelï¼š150 mg/m2 i.v.3h , given on the first day. Apatinib, oral ,initial dose :500mg,
      QD, after meal ( try to take the medicine at the same time of the day ).

      Dose adjustment: Down-regulate the dosage to 250 mg per day at the first time. If the patient
      totally recovers from the toxic reaction after the regulation, we could up-regulate the
      dosage back to the former level. If the down-regulation occurs again according to the
      protocol , then the up-regulation will be forbidden.

      S-1 dosage: According to the body surface area, the initial dosage of S-1 is decided by the
      following criteria. Take the medicine twice daily (after breakfast and supper) for 2 weeks,
      then suspend for 1 week.

      Preventive medication: To prevent serious allergic reaction of Paclitaxel, preventive
      medication should be given in advance. We usually give dexamethasone 20mg orally 12 and 6
      hours before the Paclitaxel, and diphenhydramine (or something analogous) 50 mg, cimetidine
      300mg (or ranitidine 50mg) I.V. 30-60 minutes before the Paclitaxel.

      Repeat the therapeutic schedule every 3 weeks. 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before
      surgery, stop Apatinib in the last cycle.
