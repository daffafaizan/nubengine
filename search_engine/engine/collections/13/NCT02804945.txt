      MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many
      different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases. The MSCs used in
      this study were collected from healthy donors and are stored and grown in a laboratory at MD
      Anderson. The product you will receive is from a healthy donor that is not related to you.

      MSC Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive MSCs by vein
      over about 1-2 hours 1 time on Day 1.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 1 and 3:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your heart,
           kidney, and liver function, and for biomarker testing.

        -  Blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn to check the oxygen level in your blood.

      On Days 14 and 30:

      °Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your heart, kidney,
      and liver function, and for biomarker testing.

      On Days 30 and 60:

      °You will be checked for possible reactions to your treatment, including graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD - a reaction of the donor's immune cells against your body). This will be
      checked by physical exam, by the doctor reviewing your side effects, and blood from standard
      of care blood draws.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will end after the Day 60 study visit. You will be taken off
      study early if you are not able to receive the MSC infusion(s), if intolerable side effects
      occur, if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.
