      development and progression of acute leukemia, such as FLT3-ITD, the RAS and RAF gene
      families, KIT, and the VEGF and PDGF receptors. Recently, two back-to-back randomized
      controlled trials both reveal that sorafenib maintenance after allo-HSCT could prevent
      relapse in patients with FLT3-ITD AML, resulting in a survival benefit. Sorafenib has also
      been explored in the treatment of acute leukemia without FLT3 mutations and shown promising
      results. Currently, relapse remains the major cause of transplant failure, especially for
      high-risk and refractory acute leukemia patients. Once patients relapse after allo-HSCT, the
      prognosis is dismal. Therefore, prevention of relapse is of great importance to improve the
      prognosis. Based on the current research status, we plan to conduct a prospective,
      multicenter, phase 2 randomized controlled trial to explore the efficacy and safety of
      sorafenib maintenance after allo-HSCT in FLT3-negative acute leukemia patients.
