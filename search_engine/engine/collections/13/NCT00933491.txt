      Regulators of peri-implant bone loss in patients with diabetes appear to involve multiple
      risk factors that have not been clearly elucidated. This study was conducted to explore
      putative local etiologic factors on implant bone loss in relation to type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, including clinical, microbial, salivary biomarker, and psychosocial factors.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS:

      Thirty-two subjects (divided into type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic controls), having
      at least one functional implant and six teeth, were enrolled in a 1-year longitudinal
      investigation. Analyses of clinical measurements and standardized intra-oral radiographs,
      saliva and serum biomarkers (via protein arrays for 20 selected markers), and plaque biofilm
      (via qPCR for eight periodontal pathogens) were performed at baseline and 1 year. In
      addition, the subjects were asked to respond to questionnaires to assess behavioral and
      psychosocial variables.
