    
      This is a single-center, non-randomized, open-label, prospective clinical trial to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of CNCT19 infusion following high-dose chemotherapy and autologous
      stem-cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.
      CNCT19 cells will be infused on day +3 (±1d) with a fixed dose of 2×10^6/kg. The study will
      assess the safety and efficacy of this combinational therapy, including the incidence and
      severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity
      syndrome (ICANS), hematological, and other non-hematological toxicities, and objective
      response rates and complete response rates and survivals of the subjects.
