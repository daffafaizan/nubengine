        -  Evaluate the toxicity of murine monoclonal antibody Mik-beta-1 (MOAB Mik-beta-1) in
           patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia associated with
           granulocytopenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia.

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Assess the effect of this drug on the number of circulating CD3+, CD8+ expressing
           granular lymphocytes and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, red blood cells,
           and platelets in this patient population.

        -  Monitor patients for the time course of decline in circulating infused MOAB Mik-beta-1
           and for the production of human antibodies to IV infused murine MOAB Mik-beta-1.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Mik-beta-1 (MOAB Mik-beta-1) IV over 2 hours on days 1,
      4, 7, and 10. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) may
      receive 1 additional course beginning no sooner than 4 weeks after completion of the first
      course, in the absence of antibodies to MOAB Mik-beta-1. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or severe allergic reaction.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MOAB Mik-beta-1 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 6-10 days and at 4-6 weeks after therapy. Patients with a PR or CR
      may be followed every 6 months for 2 years or until relapse. All patients are followed for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
