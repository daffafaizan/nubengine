      dose escalation study. It will evaluate the safety and PK of single IV doses of ETI-204
      administered to approximately 108 healthy male and female subjects. At each dose level, 30
      healthy subjects, including at least 4 females, will be randomly assigned to active drug, and
      at least 6 healthy subjects of both genders will be randomly assigned to matching placebo.

      Description of Agent: ETI-204 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to protective antigen (PA) from
      Bacillus anthracis.

      The study will consist of 3 phases: Screening, Inpatient, and Outpatient Follow-up.
      Enrollment criteria will be determined during the 21-day Screening Phase (Visit 1), following
      by a 3 night inpatient phase where eligible subjects will receive a single dose of IV ETI-204
      or matching placebo as described above and undergo routine safety monitoring, dermatologic
      assessments, and blood draws at pre-specified time points. Subjects will be discharged from
      the center after collection of the 48-hour PK sample. During the subsequent 70-day outpatient
      follow-up phase, subjects will return to the center on Days 8, 15, 29, 43 and 71 for clinical
      laboratory testing (hematology and clinical chemistry), physical examinations and vital signs
      measurements, and routine safety monitoring. Blood samples for PK and anti-drug antibodies
      (ADA)will also be collected. The 70 day post-dosing follow-up in this study was selected to
      allow characterization for the PK profile of ETI-204 and the potential development of ADA.
