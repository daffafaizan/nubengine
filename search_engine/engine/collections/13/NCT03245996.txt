        -  To investigate the role of non-pharmacological heart rate change on central hemodynamics
           in the first part of the study, the investigators acutely change pacing rate from atrial
           paced-atrial sensed (AAI)-mode 60 to 40 to 90 bpm and obtain hemodynamic parameters
           noninvasively after a short stabilisation period after each pacemaker rate change.

        -  Subsequently, to investigate the acute effects of beta-blockers or ivabradine on central
           hemodynamics in the second part of the study, the investigators obtain central
           hemodynamic parameters noninvasively after acute administration of atenolol, nebivolol
           or ivabradine at the same pacing rate levels used in the first part of the study
           (AAI-mode 60, 40 and 90 bpm).
