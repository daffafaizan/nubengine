      explosive devices (IEDs). Like civilian TBI, blast-related TBI can result from mechanical
      forces in which objects in motion strike the head or the head is forcefully put into motion
      and strikes an object. TBI from exposure to an explosive blast may also result from a third
      cause: barotrauma. Blasts produce wave-induced changes in atmospheric pressure, which in turn
      produce characteristic injuries to vulnerable bodily regions at air-fluid interfaces, such as
      the middle ear. It is unknown whether the neural and cognitive sequelae of blast-related TBI
      differ from those resulting from mechanically-induced TBI commonly observed in civilian
      accidents. Understanding the potentially unique sequelae of blast-related TBI is critical for
      accurate diagnosis and designing effective pharamacological and neurorehabilitation
      interventions.

      In the proposed cross-sectional study, we aim to apply neurobehavioral testing and advanced
      MRI techniques [task-activated functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)] to
      gain a comprehensive understanding of the neural changes underlying blast-related MTBI. This
      will be accomplished by comparing neurobehavioral and neuroimaging findings obtained from
      military personnel who have experienced a blast injury with those obtained from civilians who
      have experienced TBI from motor vehicle accidents and from military and civilian control
      participants with orthopedic injuries. We will accomplish this goal by conducting advanced
      neuroimaging (task-activated fMRI and DTI fiber tracking) and neurobehavioral testing
      (computerized assessment and standard neuropsychological testing) on 120 chronic trauma
      patients: 30 military MTBI patients who have experienced blast injuries, 30 civilian MTBI
      patients with mechanical closed head injuries, and 30 military and 30 civilian patients with
      orthopedic injuries.
