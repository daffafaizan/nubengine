    
      This is a phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study to assess the efficacy
      and safety of AZD9291 versus placebo in patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) with centrally confirmed, most common sensitising EGFR mutations (Ex19Del and
      L858R) either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations as confirmed by a central
      test, who have had complete tumour resection, with or without postoperative adjuvant
      chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should have consisted of a platinum based doublet given
      for a maximum of 4 cycles.
