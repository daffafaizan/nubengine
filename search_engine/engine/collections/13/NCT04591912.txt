      second leading cause of mental health disability among young women. Given that eating
      disorders have their peak onset during adolescence (ages 16-19), prevention efforts among
      adolescent women are critical in order to avert the onset of these chronic and disabling
      disorders. The mbv program targets body image and appearance related pressures, awareness of
      body sensations, and agency and community building skills. The program consists of 10 weekly
      sessions and is delivered by peer facilitators. This study will implement and evaluate the
      mbv program at the high school level in order to examine the extent to which the program
      influences young women's mental health and well-being, particularly related to eating
      disorder risk factors and symptoms.

      Utilizing a randomized controlled trial, the study seeks to address the following aims:

        1. To examine the impact of the mbv program on key aspects of mental health and well-being;
           specifically, body image and disordered eating symptoms, identity and agency, social and
           self- constructs, physical health and mood among participating high school women.

        2. To explore young women's experiences of participating in the program, including
           strengths and limitations and perspectives on specific activities.
