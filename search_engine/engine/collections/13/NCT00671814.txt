      (Part A) and multiple (Part B) ascending dose safety, tolerance, and PK when administered as
      a capsule in normal, healthy adult volunteers. The study will be sequential between Part A
      and Part B (i.e., not staggered or leap frogged), with slight overlap between last cohort in
      Part A and first cohort in Part B.
