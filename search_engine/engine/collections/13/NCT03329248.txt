      described below. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Treatment in
      the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences progressive disease (PD) or
      unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the
      Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
      Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance
      phase of the study. Subjects may remain on the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1
      year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject experiences PD or
      unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the
      Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. The
      maximum time on study treatment, including both the induction and maintenance phases, is 2
      years.
