    
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by mindreading deficits,
      or Theory of Mind deficits. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes task (abbreviated as the Eyes
      task) was developed to assess the mindreading deficits as a hallmark of social deficits of
      ASD. This study aims to investigate the ability of reading emotions by the Eyes task in
      adults with ASD, and examine the gazing pattern and frontal activation during the task. We
      plan to recruit 50 adults with ASD and 50 typically-developing adults. All the participants
      will complete clinical measures and the Eyes task. Eye-tracking and frontal activation
      (measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy) will be examined during the Eyes task.
