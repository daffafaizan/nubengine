      I. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with persistent or recurrent
      ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated with bevacizumab.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. III.
      Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the frequency of clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

      V. Determine the effect of this drug on initial performance status, age, and mucinous or
      clear cell histology in these patients.

      VI. Correlate biological and imaging markers with 6-month progression-free survival of
      patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
