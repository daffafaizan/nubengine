      units.Therefore, strategies preventing the need for reintubation are needed.

      Non invasive ventilation has been proposed as useful therapy to wean patients after
      unsuccessful weaning trials and to avoid reintubation in adults, though controversy exists at
      this concern.

      This technique is increasingly being used in pediatric patients over the last years. The
      objective of the present study was to determine post extubation Non invasive ventilation
      characteristics and to identify risk factors of post extubation Non invasive ventilation
      failure in children
