    
      This is a single-agent, open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study in adult patients with
      advanced or recurrent solid tumors or lymphoma. Patients will receive orally administered
      AR-12 once daily for 28 consecutive days. The first dosing cycle will be followed by at least
      a 7 day off-treatment period; however, no off-treatment period will be scheduled between
      subsequent treatment cycles. If daily dosing is not tolerated by the study population,
      alternative dosing schedules may be pursued (eg, 21 consecutive days of dosing followed by 7
      days off treatment), as indicated by the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data;
      all changes to the protocol-specified dosing schedule must be agreed upon by the
      investigators and the medical monitor. If individual patients respond to AR-12 treatment with
      an objective response or stable disease according to RECIST criteria and meet pre-specified
      retreatment criteria, they may continue to receive cycles of AR-12 in the absence of untoward
      or serious toxicity; however, no patient is permitted to start a subsequent cycle after each
      bi-monthly disease evaluation until it is confirmed that disease progression has not
      occurred.
