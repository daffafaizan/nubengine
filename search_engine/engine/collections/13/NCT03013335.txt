      Cell Carcinoma. The overall study population consists of 450 adult patients.

      In France, 10600 patients were diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2010. At the time of their
      diagnosis, approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease, with 90 to 95% of
      that metastatic disease being of the clear-cell histology.

      The present study is a multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, phase II safety study in
      patients who are suffering from metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma and who have progressed
      during or after one prior systemic anti-angiogenic treatment. Patients intolerant to prior
      systemic anti-angiogenic treatment can also be eligible.

      The dose and schedule of nivolumab in this study will be 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Nivolumab
      will be administered every 2 weeks until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of the informed consent. 450 patients should be included over a period of 1 year
