      measures. They will then be followed at predetermined intervals post-operatively. All
      subjects will begin the study related physical therapy 6 weeks post-operatively and continue
      for 12 sessions. At the conclusion of 12 sessions, subjects will be retested to determine
      improvement. Subjects will then be followed for two years post-operative.
