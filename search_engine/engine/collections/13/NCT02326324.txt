      patients will undergo approximately 5 minutes of extra CMR scanning. Cardiovascular
      anatomical, structural and functional data will be recorded, including data pertaining to
      myocardial characteristics (e.g. extracellular volume, oedema, fibrosis, infarction,
      function, perfusion), pericardial disease; valvular disease; vascular structure and function.

      Blood sampling will be performed on the same day as CMR scanning for assessment of
      serum/plasma markers of cardiovascular disease and health status, and DNA analysis. Health
      questionnaires will be completed on the day of CMR scanning.

      Follow-up information regarding health status, demographics and concurrent medical conditions
      and treatments will be obtained over a 10 year period following CMR scanning.
