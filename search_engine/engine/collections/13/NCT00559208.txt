      over 18,000. Ontario spends over $1.1 billion a year on direct child welfare services, more
      than twice as much as spent in the late 1990s, with the majority of these resources spent on
      investigation instead of treatment. In response to this situation, Differential Response
      models, sometimes called alternative, multiple or integrated system responses, have been
      implemented in the US, Australia and Canada and are all at the beginning stages of systematic
      evaluation. These models will help prevent maltreatment cases from becoming ongoing
      protection cases, or the children ending up in out of home or community placements, and
      reduce the amount of time in Children's Aid Society care. This research will show the
      benefits and costs of a Differential Response approach to Children's Aid Society care,
      specifically in the Hamilton-Niagara Region
