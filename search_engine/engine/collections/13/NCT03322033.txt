      patients with ascending aortic pathologies including type A aortic dissection, retrograde
      type A aortic dissection, who are suitable for endovascular repair with the Valiant PS-IDE
      Stent Graft device. The investigators propose to study patients with Dissections affecting
      the aorta between the Sinus of Valsalva and the innominate artery orifice (with no
      involvement of aortic valve). In these patients, the ascending aorta will be repaired using
      the stent graft. For patients with type A aortic dissection, the investigators expect to
      reroute the blood to the true lumen by covering the proximal tear. In patients with
      retrograde type A aortic dissection, there might or might not be additional tears in the
      ascending aorta. If they are tears in ascending aorta, these dissections behave similarly
      like a type A aortic dissection, in which all the tears in the ascending aorta need to be
      covered. If the proximal tear is only in the descending thoracic aorta, these patients will
      require coverage in the ascending aorta with the stent graft along with coverage of proximal
      tear in the descending thoracic aorta using Valiant stent graft.

      Patients will be selected from a high-risk surgical cohort. The total number of enrolled
      subjects is planned to be 20.
