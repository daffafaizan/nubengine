    
      Uncorrected refractive error (URE) is the leading cause of visual impairment among Chinese
      children, accounting for 90% or more of poor vision, and Chinese children have among the
      highest rates of myopia in the world. Despite the fact that the problem of URE is safely and
      inexpensively treated with glasses, only 15-40% of children needing them own and wear glasses
      sufficient to provide good vision in rural China.

      PRICE (Potentiating Rural Investment in Children's Eyecare) will use a randomized, controlled
      design across 4 groups of all 138 schools in Yunnan (one of China's poorest provinces) and
      Guangdong (one of the richest) to optimize the model of "free glasses for all with an
      optional upgrade." The selection of free spectacles and cost of the "upgrade" options will be
      varied between groups in order to find the optimal balance between high rates of purchase of
      upgrade glasses on the one hand and good acceptance and wear of free spectacles among those
      selecting them on the other.
