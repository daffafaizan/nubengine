      in two parts; a limited feasibility-oriented part 1 including 154 patients and 3 treatment
      cohorts (mutation/drug) and part 2 that will include an expanded cohort of patients and
      treatment cohorts. The overall aims of the study are to test the feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of comprehensive genomic profiling on fresh tumor biopsies as a basis for treatment
      decision making and to compare two different sequencing, bioinformatics and decision-making
      platforms (part 1). Also to evaluate the efficacy and safety of off-label treatment with
      cancer drugs in patients selected based on genomic biomarker matching.
