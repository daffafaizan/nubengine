      Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Neurophysiological are the parameters measured with
      EEG amplifier before and after 30 sessions.

      Work hypothesis is that the tRNS Group will present better motor functionality after 30
      sessions of 30 minutes of duration of electrical brain stimulation administered during
      physiotherapy exercises 2 days per week than the Group that only receives treatment with
      physiotherapy during 30 minutes 2 days per week without tRNS.
