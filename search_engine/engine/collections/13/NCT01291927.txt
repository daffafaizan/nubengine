      years, morbidity and mortality rates following PD have decreased, but the operative stress
      induced by pancreatectomy is considerable. Less-invasive surgery should thus be elected for
      PC without pancreatic and diffuse lymph node involvement. From the perspective of
      organ-preserving resection, pancreas-sparing duodenectomy (PSD) represents an attractive
      option for selected periampullary tumors, and offers an alternative to PD.

      Previous reports have described PSD for benign, premalignant and some selected malignant
      conditions of duodenum, and have emphasized this procedure as a safe and effective treatment
      associated with good quality of life. However, use of PSD for PC is still
      controversial.Available data about PSD for PC and published data from the follow-up
      evaluation in the literature are still limited.

      Given the fact that 20%-60% pT1/pT2 patients have regional lymph node metastasis, regional
      lymph node dissection should be essential for PC. However, lymphadenectomy has never been
      promoted as a regular procedure of PSD.The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      feasibility, safety, and long-term results of PSD with regional lymphadenectomy for
      early-stage (pTis/pT1/pT2) periampullary cancers.
