      immune response caused by inhalation of foreign substances, such as molds, dusts, and organic
      particles, causing alveoli inflammation and in the chronic forms the disease has high rate of
      mortality, due to the big number of patients who develop progressive interstitial fibrosis
      and eventually they curse with respiratory insufficiency who cause the death of the patient.

      Pirfenidone has been studied over the world for the treatment of Idiophatic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis (IPF), disease who constitute the most aggressive of the fibrotic diseases of the
      lung. Additionally Pirfenidone has been showed potential results in the treatment of fibrotic
      diseases in other organs, as Liver, Kidney, Hearth, etc. Pirfenidone has been described as a
      modulator of the fibrotic process due to his action over TGF-beta and MMPÂ´s and also has
      into-inflammatory actions acting over TNF-alfa and IL-1 and IL-6.

      Actually HP has been treated with Prednisone and occasionally with Azathioprine, but a high
      number of patients will develop irreversibly to a interstitial fibrosis with pulmonary
      parenchyma destruction. Unfortunately the investigators have not an effective treatment for
      this cases. Due to the positive results obtained with Pirfenidone in the treatment of IPF and
      other kind of organ fibrosis, the investigators propose to evaluate the addition of
      Pirfenidone to the treatment with Prednisone and Azathioprine in the treatment of patients
      with Pulmonary Fibrosis secondary to a Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis.
