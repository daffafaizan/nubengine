      original treatment plan, IL-2 1 million units was administered subcutaneously five days every
      week for 4 weeks and then once a week for 8 weeks. All patients were followed up for 3 months
      after treatment. The clinical symptoms, disease score scale, laboratory parameters, immune
      cell subsets and cytokines should be monitored during the treatment and follow-up.
