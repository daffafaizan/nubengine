      In Rett syndrome brain cells aren't actually lost, instead poor maturation of connections
      between brain cells (synapses) prevents effective neurological functioning, and is the main
      morphological feature of the disease. The MeCP2 gene plays a major role in transcriptional
      regulation of other genes, one of which is the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF).

      The disease progression and severity of symptoms is directly affected by the level of BDNF
      expression. An increase of BDNF levels (by genetic manipulations or pharmacological agents)
      leads to delayed onset of Rett syndrome-like symptoms in experimental models; rescued
      gait/mobility, improved quality of life and increased survival rates.

      Copaxone treatment by subcutaneous injection caused elevation of BDNF levels. Quantitative
      immunofluorescence assays showed about a twofold increase in neuronal expression of BDNF
      following Copaxone treatment.

      We expect that an increase in BDNF levels with Copaxone administration will stimulate
      communication between brain cells (synaptic maturation), which will lead to amelioration of
      symptoms (motor functions/gait, cognitive functions, breathing, encephalopathy and improve
      quality of life) for girls with Rett syndrome.
