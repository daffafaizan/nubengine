    
      A surgery in a posterior sextant will be performed per patient. The surgical procedures being
      compared for their post-operative healing patterns are:

        1. Simplified Papilla Preservation Flap (SPPF) which is a conservative flap aiming at
           preserving the tissues between teeth.

        2. Resective Periodontal Flap with Osseous Recontouring (RPFO) which is a conventional
           surgery which involves hard and soft tissues resection.

      Geometric (3D) surface imaging and thermal (2D) surface imaging will be used to assess the
      post-operative healing patterns and comorbidities (facial swelling, oedema and inflammation)
      following either of the surgical procedures.
