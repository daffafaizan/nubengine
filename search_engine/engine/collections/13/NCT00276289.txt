      Ten patients who have had multiple kidney stones primarily due to hypercalciuria and who are
      currently on stable dose of thiazide or thiazide plus amiloride will be enrolled in the
      study. In addition, pts have to require at least 60mEq of K supplementation a day or be on
      40mEq and be hypokalemic and unable to tolerate increased K supplements. We will then give
      them 50mg a day of spironolactone for four weeks. A complete 24-hour urine stone profile will
      be obtained before and after the drug is administered. After four weeks the patients' serum
      potassium will be rechecked, and their dose will be lowered according to a nomogram.

      Primary end point is the mean change in serum K before and after spironolactone. Secondary
      endpoints are the change in urine calcium on and off the drug and the mean reduction in K
      dose on the drug.
