      undergo limb allotransplantation. We will study patients after they have been trained on the
      use of a prosthetic limb device prior to transplantation. We will treat them with
      immunosuppression known to prevent the rejection of other allografted tissues and designed to
      minimize their dependence on chronic maintenance immunosuppression. These patients will be
      studied to determine whether the transplanted limb functions better, worse or the same as a
      prosthetic hand, and to quantify those differences
