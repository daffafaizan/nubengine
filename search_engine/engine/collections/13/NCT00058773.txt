      cell line called a lymphoblastoid cell line or LCL by infecting the subjects blood with a
      laboratory strain of EBV called B95. We will then use use this EBV infected cell line (which
      have been treated with radiation so that they cannot grow) as stimulator cells and mix it
      with more blood. This stimulation will train the T cells to kill EBV infected cells and
      result in the growth of an EBV specific T cell line. We will then test the T cells to make
      sure that they kill the EBV infected cells and not your normal cells and freeze them.

      The cells will be thawed and injected into subjects over 10 minutes, after pretreatment with
      Tylenol and Benadryl. A total of two doses will be given two weeks apart. All of the
      treatments will be given at Texas Children's Hospital or The Methodist Hospital.

      We will follow subjects in the clinic after the injections. At each visit about 10ml (2
      teaspoonfuls) of blood will be taken every other week for 6 weeks after the injection and
      then every 3 months for 1 year to monitor the subjects blood chemistry and hematology.

      To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the subjects body, an extra 40mls (8
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken pre-infusion, 3-4 days post infusion (optional) and at 1,
      2, 4 and 6 weeks post-infusion and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The blood may be drawn
      from the subjects central line at the time of their regular blood tests.
