      compared with standard tissue biopsy analysis for detection of genomic alterations in
      patients with advanced lung cancer. Once selected for the study and with full informed
      consent, patients will have a blood draw to allow the detection of cancer-related genomic
      alterations that are detectable within the blood sample. These results will be compared to
      results obtained from genomic profiling via standard tissue biopsy taken as part of routine
      care to help determine whether such 'liquid biopsies' can be used to guide treatments in
      future patients. The results of the liquid biopsy will not be used to guide treatment
      decisions in study participants.

      In addition there is data-collection of treatments received for non small cell lung cancer
      and the response to these treatments during the first 6 months post tissue and blood
      analysis, though no additional visits or procedures are required for the patient beyond the
      initial blood draw.
