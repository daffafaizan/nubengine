      The role of the microcirculation is increasingly being recognized in the etiopathogenesis of
      cardiovascular disease. Delays in this recognition are in part due to the difficulty of
      studying the microcirculation non-invasively, in large numbers of individuals. Retinal
      vessels provide an easily accessible "window" to the microcirculation. Abnormalities of the
      retinal vasculature have been shown to be associated with cardiovascular risk factors and all
      cause mortality. Non-invasive assessment of the retinal circulation presents a valuable
      opportunity to study the structure and function of the microvasculature

      Aims of the project

      To compare geometry of retinal microvasculature of 1) hypertensive vs normotensive adults, 2)
      children aged 10 to 14 years of hypertensive parent (test group) versus normotensive parent
      (control group), and, 3) to assess the impact of blood pressure lowering on these changes
      over 2 years.

      Primary outcome would be abnormal retinal geometry defined as the composite outcome of a)
      abnormal arteriolar length: diameter ratios (a measure of relative arteriolar narrowing), b)
      narrowed branching angles (an indicator of arteriolar rarefaction), or c) disturbed junction
      exponents (a marker of endothelial dysfunction.

      Significance of the study

      If successful, this work could be extended to address future questions, including the
      predictive value of these abnormalities for development of diabetes and hypertension as well
      as CVD; to explore further the role of microvascular disturbances in disease etiology, and to
      assess the impact of drug therapy on these abnormalities and their relationship to outcomes
