    
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major health problem, occurring in about 1 in
      1,500 adults in the developed countries each year. Although layperson CPR and defibrillation
      are crucial components of chain of survival, layperson CPR rate and it's quality is low and
      public-access defibrillation (PAD) program is not cost-effective.If trained bystanders can
      know the information of occurrence of OHCA and nearest place for automated external
      defibrillator (AED) at the same time by dispatch center, these neighborhoods could run and
      give high quality CPR and early defibrillation. If this protocol ,Dispatcher-Activated
      Neighborhood Access Defibrillation and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation(NAD-CPR), is introduced
      to community, it may improve survival of OHCA.
