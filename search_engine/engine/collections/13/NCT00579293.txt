      routine screening measure for the survivor population. Specifically, to determine patient
      acceptance, time to completion, and burden associated with the CASS. To examine the potential
      utility of the CASS as a routine screening measure in the survivor population. To validate
      the CASS against the SCL-90-R screening measure. Calculate the sensitivity,specificity,
      positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic agreement and ROC curve of the CASS
      compared to the SCL-90. Determine the optimal cut-off scores to optimize agreement between
      the CASS and the SCL-90.
