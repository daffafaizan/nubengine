      implantation), Doppler velocimetry of the uterine arteries, and trophoblastic invasion at
      histological and immunohistochemical evaluation.

      Changes in clinical and biochemical data under treatment, pattern of Doppler velocimetry at
      the uterine arteries, and trophoblastic invasion were evaluated.
