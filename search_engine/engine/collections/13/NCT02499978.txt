      have numerous toxicities partly due to the fact that they are analogs of naturally occurring
      nucleotides and interfere with the activity of numerous cellular functions. In highly
      treatment-experienced individuals with more than two active drugs in their salvage regimens,
      an NRTI-sparing regimen has been shown to be non-inferior to an NRTI-containing regimen [33].
      However, studies with NRTI-sparing regimens not consisting of more than two active
      medications have generally been disappointing.

      One limitation of earlier NRTI-sparing regimens has been a higher pill burden than more
      standard regimens. However, the approvals of DTG and the co-formulated DRV/COBI, both with
      well-established antiviral activities, may allow for a compact, effective, NRTI-sparing
      regimen. A switch to DTG/DRV/COBI in virologically suppressed HIV-infected individuals has
      the potential to avoid NRTI-associated toxicity while maintaining virologic suppression.
