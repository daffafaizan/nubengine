      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). PONV is related to surgical, anesthetic and patient
      factors.

      We want to test the efficacy of these anesthetic antiemetic measures collectively with or
      without ondansetron or dexamethasone, in the prevention of PONV in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Three groups to be studied : (Group O) will receive 4 mg ondansetron, (Group D) will receive
      8 mg dexamethasone and (Group P) will receive normal saline .
