      improve quality of life for patients with tendon injury [e.g. tendinopathy of the elbow
      (medial or lateral], Achilles tendon, or patellar tendon) will be assessed. During the 7-week
      protocol, participants will receive 4 continuous hours of therapy daily.

      For the first week, baseline data will be collected as participants report pain scores (VAS)
      in the morning, noon, and night. During the next 6 weeks, participants will self-apply the
      device each day and record their pain score (VAS) before and treatment; and record their pain
      score (VAS) while performing specified movements designed to evaluate tendon rehabilitation.
      At bi-weekly site visits, strength measurements will be performed on the injured and
      uninjured limb. Participants will also complete a standardized questionnaire to assess
      disability due to the specific tendon injury at baseline and study conclusion.
