      concern due to increasing prevalence and rising health care costs. The prognosis remains poor
      despite improvement in survival due to treatment with ACE-inhibitors and beta-receptor
      antagonists. HF has a high rate of readmission and hospitalisation. Some readmissions are
      ascribed to patients' lack of compliance, insufficient knowledge about diet, medication and
      symptoms of heart failure. Education of patients has become an important component in order
      to increase the patients' self-care and compliance. Intense education and counselling of
      patients is recommended in both European and American guidelines for HF.

      Several systematic reviews of studies on strategies for improvement of outcomes of heart
      failure patients after discharge have been published, but very little emphasis has been put
      on methodological issues, e.g. methods of education. In most programs the methods and
      equipment used for education and information have only consisted of verbal and written
      material; computer-based tools seem to be relatively new.

      Interactive CD-ROM programs for HF patients can increase patients' knowledge about heart
      failure and its treatment. However, no studies have examined the clinical outcome, e.g. rate
      of readmission.

      Comparison: Extra educated patients (interactive CD-ROM education) compared to standard
      educated patients on readmission rate or death during 6 months.
