      washout period, a 2-week treatment period, another 1-week washout and a final 2-week
      treatment period. The study will assess the overall patient preference Movantik versus
      Polyethylene Glycol 3350 for the treatment of their opioid-induced constipation. This study
      will also evaluate the reasons for patient preference (only among subjects who indicate a
      preference), patient global impression of change, and change in bowel function over the
      treatment periods measured by Bowel Function Index. Patient's bowel movement diary will also
      be collected during the study.
