      enrolled in this clinical trial. Those who is in an acute inflammatory phase and diagnosed
      with hemorrhagic disease should are excluded, so are those unwilling to carry the continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM) device. When the dose of prednisolone is applied 15mg per day
      steadily and is going to be decreased, the CGM is conducted. At the same time, blood tests
      evaluating the glucose metabolism are measured, including HbA1c, GA, fasting insulin and
      fasting glucose. After taking 7.5mg prednisolone per day for 3 months, participants do the
      CGM and blood tests again to evaluate the glucose metabolism during this period. The CGM data
      could be used for the glucose evaluation, which can manifest the glucose characteristics in
      the circumstances of glucocorticoid use. By comparing the CGM data and the blood tests, the
      investigators hope to find the different features of the glucose metabolism due to different
      doses.
