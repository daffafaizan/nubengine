      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in combination
      with docetaxel. II. Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. III.
      Determine the duration of response to this treatment regimen in these patients. IV. Determine
      the time to progression in these patients after receiving this treatment regimen. V. Compare
      HER2-neu overexpression as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) versus
      immunohistochemistry, and correlate these findings with response to this treatment regimen in
      these patients. VI. Correlate HER2-neu activation by immunohistochemistry and the
      extracellular domain of HER2-neu by ELISA with response to this treatment regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes weekly
      for 6 weeks plus trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment
      continues every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 9 months, and then every 6
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-34 patients will be accrued for this study.
