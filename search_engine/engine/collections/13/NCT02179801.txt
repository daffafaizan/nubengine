      requiring treatment of coronary heart disaese compared to standard population. In women,
      however, the prevalence was not increased. Thus, the SCAN project addresses male patients who
      underwent coronary artery intervention in order to screen them for the presence of an AAA
      using duplex sonography.

      The SCAN project involves the following elements:

        1. Informing the patient with cardiovascular risk factors about the clinical picture of AAA

        2. An ultrasound scan of the abdominal aorta in patients with an increased risk for AAA

        3. Acquisition of patient data followed by a correlation analysis for the parameters
           presence of AAA and cardiovascular diseases

      The cohort study is part of the SCAN project which is also conducted in an similar way by
      Catharina Ziekenhuis Eindhoven ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT01643317.
