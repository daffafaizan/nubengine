    
      This study consists of two visits, from three to fifteen days apart. Patients with different
      levels of insulin resistance will be enrolled in this study.

      The level of insulin resistance will be estimated with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
      that will be performed at the second visit.

      The first visit :

        -  Subjects will be on an empty stomach

        -  A blood test including HbA1C, C-Peptid, lipid profile, creatinine,urea, hepatic workup

        -  An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 3 hours will be performed. Blood samples will
           be taken two time (T-15', T0) 15 minutes apart at Baseline (before taking the glucose).
           And then after the glucose intake, blood sample will be taken every 15 minutes (T15',
           T30', T 45', T60', T75', T90', T105', T120' and 180') to measure insulinemia, blood
           sugar, and IRAP concentration.

      The second visit includes a 3-hours hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp.
