      with early stage resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma will be enrolled into the study.
      Patients will have a baseline PET scan. Patients on the study will receive IMRT for
      approximately 1 week of 5 daily treatments. 1 week post-RT, they will proceed with an
      extrapleural pneumonectomy. If the mediastinal lymph nodes that are removed during surgery
      are positive for tumour cells, 3 cycles of chemotherapy, consisting of raltitrexed and
      cisplatin OR Pemetrexed and cisplatin, will be given 6-12 weeks post-surgery. Before and
      during treatment, side effects will be assessed. After treatment, follow up visits will be
      conducted every 1 to 2 months for the first year, and every 3 months for the second year. At
      each visit, a history and physical examination will be performed and ECOG performance status
      will be assessed. Routine tests will include CBC, liver profile, creatinine and chest x-ray.
      CT thorax and abdomen will be done at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Additional test may be
      done at the discretion of the oncologist if the patient becomes symptomatic. The study will
      evaluate the feasibility and safety of short pre-operative RT, and may help confirm the
      intraoperative seeding hypothesis. Preoperative RT may also reduce the risk of both local and
      distant spread and, ultimately, improve overall survival. By shortening overall treatment
      time, it may also improve patient compliance and convenience. We may be able to give
      chemotherapy only to patients that are at highest risk and avoid it in others.
