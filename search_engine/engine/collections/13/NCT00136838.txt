      on the effects of nicotine on the brain and behavior presents an opportunity to advance
      medication development. The goal of this study is to develop a laboratory model for
      early-stage testing of new and existing compounds for the treatment of tobacco and nicotine
      addiction. In addition, the objective of this study is to develop a laboratory model of
      relapse induced by cigarette exposure that would reproduce the psychological and
      physiological processes that are involved when abstinent individuals progress from initial
      cigarette smoking (lapse) to a pre-abstinence level of use (relapse). Such a model may be
      used to study the mechanisms of relapse and to screen medications that might be effective in
      preventing relapse in treatment seekers.

      This study will consist of two phases. Each phase will consist of a 5-day inpatient stay.
      During the first portion of inpatient stay, participants will not be permitted to smoke.
      During the second portion of inpatient stay, smoking reinstatement will be modeled, as
      participant will have opportunity to smoke, following the exposure to tobacco-related or
      control cues. A variety of behavioral, subjective, physiological, and performance measures
      will be assessed throughout the study.
