    
      This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomy before definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in Patients with Esophageal
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma(ESCC) by assessing their weight, nutritional status, performance
      status and treatment response.

      All patients will receive definitive radiotherapy combined with three cycles of S-1 (40mg/2,
      BID, po) on D1-14, D22-35, D43-56. The primary endpoint is percentage of recent weight loss
      at the end of CCRT. The secondary endpoints are nutrition status, objective response rate,
      overall survival, toxicity and intestinal flora changes in blood, urine and stool specimens.
