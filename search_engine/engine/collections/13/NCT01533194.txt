      I. Determine safety and tolerability of Reolysin in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.

      II. Obtain evidence of Reovirus replication by immunohistochemical co-localization of
      Reovirus and tubulin staining in marrow clot sections obtained on cycle 1 day 8.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary data on response as determined by International Myeloma Working Group
      criteria after infusion of Reolysin as a single agent. (Clinical) II. Obtain pilot overall
      and progression free survival data for all treated patients. (Clinical) III. Assess
      neutralizing anti-reovirus assay (NARA) results on days 1, 8, 15, and once days 22-28 during
      cycle 1. (Correlative) IV. Assess feasibility of staining for RAF/MEK/ERK in CD138+ cells
      using marrow clot sections obtained from pre-treatment specimen. (Correlative) V.
      Cryopreserve PBMCs for future ancillary studies focused initially on lymphocyte subset(s) and
      myeloid derived suppressor cell changes after Reolysin infusion during cycle 1. (Correlative)
      VI. Cryopreserve CD138+-selected cells at screening and after treatment for future ancillary
      studies of genetic and epigenetic changes focused in part on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
      stress. (Correlative)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate at baseline and periodically during study for
      RAF/MEK/ERK expression and wild-type reovirus replication analysis by immunohistochemistry.
      Blood and cryopreserved CD138+ selected cell samples are also collected for future ancillary
      studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
