      patients, but effects of these extracts have not been studied adequately. Based on previous
      results in experimental animal, the investigators have selected the plant Gynostemma
      pentapyllum (GP), which grows in the mountain region of Northern Vietnam. GP extract had a
      hypoglycemic effect on mice and rat. In addition, GP has been shown to reduce both
      hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetic Zucker fatty rats.The present study aimed at
      investigating effect of Gynostemma pentapyllum (GP) extract, administered as a "tea", as
      add-on therapy with Sulfonylurea (SU) in drug-naive patients with newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetes.In addition to monitoring effects plasma glucose regulation, the investigators also
      studied possible effects on plasma lipids, kidney and liver function as well as body weight
      and blood pressure.
