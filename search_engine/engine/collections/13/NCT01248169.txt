    
      Pregnant patients with severe acute hypertension due either to superimposed preeclampsia,
      severe preeclampsia or severe gestational hypertension will be randomized to receive either
      of two antihypertensive agents (hydralazine or labetalol). Just before drug administration
      and immediately thereafter impedance cardiography of the patient will be undertaken and the
      results analyzed relative to the cardiac profile and the drug administered to reduce the
      severe hypertension.
