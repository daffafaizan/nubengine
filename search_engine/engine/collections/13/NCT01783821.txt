      budesonide (0.5 mg) and formoterol (20 mcg) twice daily, with at least 6 hours between doses,
      for 5 calendar days for a total of 10 doses or until hospital discharge or death. Local
      hospital pharmacies prepared identical appearing solutions and drug was delivered by
      respiratory therapists blinded to randomization by using standard jet nebulizers that produce
      aerosol particle size within the respirable range (<5.5 microns). The first dose was
      administered within 4 hours after randomization.
