      among the elderly population. Although its main clinical feature is the bilateral,
      predominantly postural-kinetic tremor, newer studies suggest that ET is a spectrum of
      clinical features with both motor and nonmotor elements not homogeneously distributed.

      Despite its high occurrence, the pharmacological treatment of ET is limited. Although the
      mainline drugs, propranolol and primidone, can provide good clinical benefit in a portion of
      cases, >50% of the patients stop the medication due to inefficacy or side-effects.
      Hypotension, dizziness, bradycardia, cognitive impairment, fatigue and erectile dysfunction
      are the most common side-effects contributing to medication discontinuation.

      In an open-label pilot study, the investigators previously demonstrated that 2.1 mg/day
      pramipexole extended-release improved both the severity of tremor (by 52%) and health-related
      quality of life.

      The present study aims to confirm this hypothesis in a double-blind, crossover,
      placebo-controlled multicenter study.
