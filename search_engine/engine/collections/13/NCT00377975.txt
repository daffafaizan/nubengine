      thiazolidinediones via PPARÎ³ control lipid metabolism have been implicated in body weight
      regulation. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the simultaneous activation
      of these two signaling systems might synergize to exert beneficial effects on the expression
      of key genes involved in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis in subcutaneous fat in
      healthy, non-diabetic subjects. Fifty seven non-diabetic women and men were randomized into
      four groups: 1) placebo/placebo (PP); 2) ephedrine plus caffeine/placebo (ECP); 3)
      placebo/pioglitazone (PPio); 4) ephedrine plus caffeine/pioglitazone (ECPio). Adipose tissue
      samples were obtained after 12 weeks of treatment to determine gene expression by real time
      RT-PCR.
