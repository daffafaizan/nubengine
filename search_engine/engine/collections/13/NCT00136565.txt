    
      This is a multicentric, open-label, non-randomized, non-competitive clinical study,
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of V-ACVBP chemotherapy in previously untreated patients
      aged from 18 to 65 years with peripheral T-lymphoma.

      It is anticipated that 60 subjects will be enrolled over two years (from June 2005 to May
      2007).

      The duration of the treatment period is approximately 28 weeks and patients are followed
      until death.

      The total duration of the study is expected to be 5 years (from June 2005 to May 2010).
