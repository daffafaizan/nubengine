      version of the attachment-based compassion therapy, and 2) Waiting list control group.

      The corresponding evaluations of the outcomes will be carried out at different moments of the
      process: baseline, post-test (three months) and follow up assessment (six months).

      This study will use the internet version of attachment-based compassion therapy (iABCT) for
      improving quality of life in a population with chronic medical illness.
