      left ventricular dysfunction who are candidates and eligible for HTx. The primary endpoint is
      the composite of all-cause mortality, worsening of HF requiring a high urgent transplantation
      or LVAD implantation. The secondary study endpoints are all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
      mortality, cerebrovascular accidents, worsening of HF requiring unplanned hospitalization, AF
      burden reduction, unplanned hospitalization due to cardiovascular reason, all-cause
      hospitalization, QoL, number of delivered implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)
      therapies, time to first ICD therapy, number of device-detected ventricular
      tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation episodes, LV function, exercise tolerance, and
      percentage of right ventricular pacing. Ventricular myocardial tissue will be obtained from
      patients who will undergo LVAD implantation or HTx to assess the effect of catheter ablation
      on human HF myocardium.
