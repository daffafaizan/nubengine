      conventional monitoring protocol, complemented with real-time patient notification of
      symptoms, certain variables will be collected, such as:

        -  Age, sex, date of COVID-19 positive diagnosis (PCR or antigen test).

        -  Stage of clinical progression of the disease: according to the Primary Care COVID-19
           management

        -  Information collected in the telephone clinical assessment questionnaire in the home
           follow-up of the patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection

      Variables generated by the study follow-up:

        -  Vital signs covered by the Bakeey E66 smartwatch device: temperature, respiration rate
           (RR), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SatO2)

        -  Clinical symptoms covered by the Home App for submission by the patient: cough, fever,
