      and Varicella zoster skin infections will be collected (in a clinical routine setting). The
      specimen will be stained with methylene blue in addition to the Giemsa stain. Polymerase
      chain reaction study for herpes antigen will be performed in some of the specimens. The
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value will be
      calculated from the results of the study.
