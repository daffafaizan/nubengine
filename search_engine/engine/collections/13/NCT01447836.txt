      outcome. However, changes of transaminase or bilirubin are always not significant during the
      early phase of sepsis. As another sort of measurement of liver function, plasma clearance
      rate of indocyanine green (PDR-ICG) always decreased during the early phase of sepsis. So the
      investigators hypotheses include: PDR-ICG may be lower in sepsis patients than non-septic
      patients in ICU; PDR-ICG may be lower in abdominal sepsis patients than non-abdominal sepsis
      patients in ICU; PDR-ICG correlates with abdominal perfusion pressure; change of PDR-ICG in
      early phase may correlate with change of transaminase or bilirubin in late phase of sepsis.
      Through this study we also plan to calculate the range of abdominal perfusion pressure that
      can maintain normal PDR-ICG and the range of PDR-ICG that can maintain normal transaminase or
      bilirubin level in sepsis patients.
