    
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases
      in Brazil. It has a significantly increasing incidence today and is considered an important
      global health problem. It affects approximately 20 to 30% of the adult population and
      increases according to the severity of the risk factors. The diagnosis of this disease
      usually occurs in 10 to 20% of the non-obese individuals, 50% in the overweight and 80 to 90%
      in the obese, being twice as present in individuals with Metabolic Syndrome. Pharmacological
      treatment options for NAFLD are still limited and Silybum marianum, one of the most
      sought-after herbal remedies in patients with liver disease, is commonly used by patients
      because of the claim of the hepatoprotective effect of silymarin. Studies have demonstrated
      the therapeutic potential of silymarin in patients with NAFLD, but clinical trials with more
      judicious methodological designs is still needed to prove these effects. Thus, this project
      aims to evaluate the effect of silymarin on laboratory markers and clinical evolution of
      adult patients with DHGNA seen at the Clinic of Nutrition and Hepatology of Edgard Santos
      Hospital, as well as to identify the dietary pattern of these individuals. It is also
      intended to develop and validate a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) for this patient
      population. A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial lasting 12 weeks will be
      performed.
