      The patients enrolled on this will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide
      (1 day) followed by fludarabine (5 days) Each patient will receive IL-2 on alternate days
      starting 1 day before infusion of NK cells for a total of 6 doses.

      Patient will undergo imaging MRI or PET or CT scan one month after the infusion to assess
      response to the NK cell infusion.

      In our study we aim to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of expanded, activated
      NK cells in patients with EWS and RMS .

      We will also study the persistence and phenotype of expanded NK cells in research
      participants with EWS and RMS .

      The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that infusion of expanded, activated
      haploidentical NK cells can produce measurable clinical responses in patients with EWS and
      RMS .
