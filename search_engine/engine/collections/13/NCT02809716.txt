      I. To determine the level of correlation between solid tumor touch preparations and liquid
      biopsies (circulating tumor cells [CTCs]) from patients with surgically resected colorectal
      cancer (CRC) metastases to the liver using single-cell high-content analysis, including gene
      copy number variation (CNV) and to establish one or more bio-signatures that represent the
      liquid and solid biopsy correlation for each patient and for the patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the technical validity and reproducibility of the bio-signatures by
      comparing the two pre-resection liquid biopsy samples drawn one week prior to and on the day
      of surgery.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare biosignatures between pre-surgical and post-surgical blood samples. II. Compare
      biosignatures between resected metastatic liver tumor tissue, primary colon tumor tissue (if
      available), and pre-surgical blood samples.

      III. Compare biosignatures between blood samples prior to resection with those obtained after
      resection and at the time of recurrence.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo blood collection 1 week prior surgery, before and after surgery on the same
      day, and 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Patients also undergo tissue collection during
      the surgery. Blood and tissue samples are processed for high definition single cell analysis
      including whole-genome CNV profiles, protein expression, and cell morphology.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 2 years.
