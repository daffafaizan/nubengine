    
      Treatment cohort will be determined based on three parameters:

        -  Serum albumin level at baseline,

        -  ECOG Performance Status,

        -  Mini GDS.

      The "Candidate" group will be defined according to (all the following criteria must be
      fulfilled):

        -  Serum albumin level ≥ 30g/L,

        -  ECOG PS 0-1 (whatever mini GDS score) or ECOG PS 2 with mini GDS 0 (ie, no depression).

      The "Non-candidate" cohort group will be defined according to (at least one of those
      parameters is fulfilled):

        -  Serum albumin level < 30g/L.

        -  And/ or ECOG PS 2 and mini GDS ≥ 1 (ie, depression).

      Patients in the "Candidate group" will be randomized to:

        -  OPTIMOX bevacizumab (arm A),

        -  Capecitabine + bevacizumab (arm B), in priority followed by FOLFOX-bevacizumab at first
           progression.

      Patients in the "Non-candidate" group cohort

      - Not randomized, follow-up patients receiving: capecitabine + bevacizumab
