      all in- and out-patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). All consecutive
      adult patients with known AF who developed ischaemic stroke or TIA in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016
      and 2018 (i.e. 5 full yearly time-points) and categorize the patients according to their
      anticoagulation status (elaborated below) with the inclusion and exclusion criteria stated
      will be recruited.

      All demographic data, blood results, imaging and assessment data will be retrieved from
      electronic patient record (CMS system) and stroke registry. All-cause mortality at 1 year
      will be verified via CMS system too.
