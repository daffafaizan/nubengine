      infusion of 0.3mcg/kg/hr)on Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction when administered to patients
      during surgery with one lung ventilated thoracic procedures. Dexmedetomidine has both
      vasoconstricting and vasodilatatory effect on peripheral vasculature but its effect on
      pulmonary vessels is not known. If it is predominantly a vasodilator on pulmonary vessels it
      can inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and will increase shunting of venous blood to
      arterial circulation without oxygenation. If our study proves it to be a vasodilator for
      pulmonary vessels then it will not be wise to use it in thoracic procedure with one lung
      ventilation. If our study proves that it is a vasoconstrictor for pulmonary vessels, then it
      will be an excellent adjunct to other anesthetic agents during one lung ventilation.
