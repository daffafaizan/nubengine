      will attend a two hour orientation to complete baseline assessments, learn how to access and
      use the software, and participate in a training session. Study participants will be asked to
      complete assessments online at least twice per week, but no more than once daily. The
      software may still be accessed by participants as many times as desired to review advice and
      graphs. After the four week evaluation phase, participants will return for a two hour
      debriefing and completion of assessment surveys. This approach permits users to be adequately
      trained while also evaluating the software within their typical environment rather than in a
      lab setting.
