      audiological performance and usability as well as features and functions in comparison to the
      hearing aid already CE marked. Furthermore, it is important to identify unexpected or
      unwanted behavior from the devices. This clinical investigation is a validation testing and
      is designed to evaluate the new hearing instrument system. As human subjects are involved,
      this validation test falls under the definition of a clinical investigation. The validation
      addresses the performance of the device with new functionality, and additionally addresses
      whether the end user can understand speech as well as with the current marketed device.

      End users will be tested in the lab with speech tests and usability tests. They will also
      participate in field tests after which they will answer questionnaires concerning their
      experience with the instruments. Evaluating the overall performance of the hearing instrument
      is important to verify that the end user is satisfied with the device and that all user
      requirements are fulfilled. Many of the features available in the new device have already
      been validated and are used in devices currently on the market.

      The purpose of this research is to show that the performance of the new device is as good as
      or better than the current device. Furthermore, speech should not be negatively affected with
      the addition of new features, the usability of the devices (that end users are able to handle
      the devices) should be as good as the current device, and there should be no artifacts or
      unwanted noises. Some measurements serve as quality control prior to product launch.
