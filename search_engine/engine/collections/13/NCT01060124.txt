    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm,
      multicenter (conducted in more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), prospective (study following participants forward in time) study conducted
      to assess the efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl D-trans in cancer participants of Korea
      with inadequately controlled pain by non-narcotic analgesics and for participant's
      satisfaction. The participants will receive the initial dose of TTS-fentanyl D-trans patch
      releasing 12 micrograms per hour (12 mcg/hr) of fentanyl and will be increased by 12 mcg/hr
      or 25 mcg/hr, every 3 days depending on the participant's pain control. Efficacy will
      primarily be evaluated by participant's satisfaction with pain treatment. Participant's
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
