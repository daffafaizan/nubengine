      technique to pre-oxygenate and provide apneic oxygenation in hypoxic patients undergoing
      emergency airway management. This study aims to evaluate preoxygenation by quantifying
      end-tidal oxygen (etO2) concentration resulting from nasal cannula placement underneath a
      noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) mask. This is a prospective randomized
      cross over study of healthy volunteers undergoing continuous positive airway pressure
      ventilation via a noninvasive ventilation (NIV) mask with and without the addition of nasal
      cannulas. End-tidal oxygen concentration will be measured by an oxygen sensor following three
      minutes of NIPPV with and without the addition of a nasal cannula, with each subject serving
      as his or her own control.
