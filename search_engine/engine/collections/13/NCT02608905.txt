      inflammatory pathways affecting skeletal muscle which is the primary site of whole body
      insulin resistance. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines
      which ultimately impair skeletal muscle insulin signaling and fatty acid oxidation; its
      activity reflects overall inflammatory tone in skeletal muscle. Recent human studies confirm
      that NFkappaB is elevated in the skeletal muscle of T2DM human subjects. Furthermore, the
      same inflammatory processes and signaling impairments contribute to worsening endothelial
      dysfunction, which is an independent predictor for future cardiovascular events in T2DM. In
      addition, these SGLT-2 Inhibitors reduce body weight, visceral adiposity, systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure, microalbuminuria, and oxidative stress. However, there are no
      studies examining the effects of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy on NFkappaB and other inflammatory
      mediators in humans with T2DM. Moreover, no studies have examined the effect of SGLT-2
      inhibitor therapy on endothelial function in this population. In the present study the
      investigators will assess whether dapagliflozin treatment for 12 weeks reduces monocyte
      inflammation and improves endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes on
      metformin monotherapy.
