      treatment, involving secondary damage to the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, which
      may lead to obesity. The weight gain is uncontrolled and not receptive to diet and exercise
      interventions. The rate of long-term obesity in children diagnosed with craniopharyngioma can
      be as high as 50%. Exenatide, a drug indicated for diabetes, is an incretin mimicking agent
      that mimics the enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion and several other
      antihyperglycemic actions of incretins has resulted in weight loss when given to diabetics.
      Exenatide shows potential to benefit patients suffering from hypothalamic obesity by slowing
      gastric emptying and therefore reducing food intake. Also increasing the glucagon-like
      peptide 1 (GLP-1) circulation, decreased due to obesity, at the already compromised GLP-1
      receptor site of the hypothalamus could potentially help with regulation of appetite.
