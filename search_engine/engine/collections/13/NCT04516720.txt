      central nervous system structures, meninges and the origin of the cranial and paraspinal
      nerves. They have a malignant, benign, or borderline evolution. TPSNC represent a
      heterogeneous group of tumors, with more than 140 subtypes described in the WHO
      classification. The causes, prognostic factors, and therapeutic management differ according
      to the histological subtype.

      The incidence of all of TPSNCs ranges from 17.6 to 22.0/105 in North American and European
      studies. However, because of the high number of different histological subtypes, most of them
      must be considered as rare tumors. Moreover, they represent a major public health problem due
      to high morbidity [8] and mortality.

      In this context, the creation of a clinical database including data for all PCNST patients is
      of high interest. This database will allow us to develop clinical studies on:

        -  The clinical, radiological and biological presentation of tumors, the impact of
           oncological treatments and the evaluation of survival for the different subtypes of
           PCNST. This is particularly important for rare histological subtypes of PCNST for which
           the current knowledge is scarce;

        -  Clinical, radiological and biological factors predictive of tumor response to
           treatments;

        -  Prognostic factors.

      The database will also allow us to develop or participate in multicentric clinical studies,
      at the national or international level, as well as to facilitate the identification of
      patients for inclusion in translational studies
