      with men who meet the eligibility criteria for low risk prostate cancer and elected to
      participate in the active surveillance program at The Center for Cancer Prevention and
      Treatment at St. Joseph Hospital. We hope to demonstrate that men who are compliant with a
      closely monitored active surveillance program for low risk prostate cancer will achieve
      favorable outcomes by: 1) avoiding the side effects of definitive therapy that may not be
      necessary; 2) retaining quality of life (QOL) and normal activities; 3) avoiding unnecessary
      treatment; and 4) decreased health care costs. In addition, we will monitor the possible
      adverse outcomes that may be associated with the active surveillance program including
      suboptimal response and/or greater side effects due to delayed initiation of therapy;
      psychological impact on the patients and caregivers due to anxiety of living with an
      untreated cancer and/or the requirement for frequent medical examination and periodic
      prostate biopsies.
