      outcomes after 90Y resin microsphere radioembolization for metastatic colorectal liver
      metastases in the USA. The target is for at least 1,000 evaluable patients with 12+ weeks
      follow up. Objectives:

      Independent data collection and reporting of pre treatment and 12 week post treatment
      clinical, radiographic and radiation parameters and outcomes in patients treated in the USA
      from 2002-2010. Data beyond 12 weeks will be collected and highly desirable, however as a
      minimum all patients will have 12 week follow up.
