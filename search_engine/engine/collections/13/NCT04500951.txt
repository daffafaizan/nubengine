      The aim is to identify differences in quality of rest as reflected by clinical evaluation,
      pulse rate, motor activity and autonomic balance between the optimized resting environment
      (ORE) and the standard resting environment (SR).

      Method: A Randomized controlled time-series study. Randomization to either SR or ORE for each
      of the 9 resting periods during a three-day recording session. A period of three days will
      allow collection of sufficient data. This will also allow the analysis to take the random
      effects of time and weekday into account. Outcome measures will be differences in mean heart
      rate during daytime resting periods, aggregated measures of heart rate variability and
      proportion of resting minutes according to accelerometry.
