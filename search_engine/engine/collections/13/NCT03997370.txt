      I. Evaluate the success of targeting a carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) with our
      current approach to dosing carboplatin.

      II. Assess the performance of Cockcroft-Gault (CG), four-variable Modification of Diet in
      Renal Disease (MDRD-4), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) based
      on isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) calibrated serum creatinine in predicting
      measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) in patients with cancer.

      III. Define the relationship of mGFR and carboplatin clearance in patients with cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the divergence of estimated (e)GFR from mGFR based on patient demographic and
      other characteristics, thus identifying those most likely to benefit from determination of
      mGFR over use of eGFR.

      II. Determine the success rate of achieving the target carboplatin AUC in patients in whom
      the carboplatin dose is capped.

      III. Evaluate the relationship between carboplatin exposure and toxicity. IV. Assess the
      ability of markers other than creatinine in pre-treatment serum to better estimate kidney
      function in patients with cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive iohexol intravenously (IV) over 30-60 seconds. Patients then receive
      standard of care carboplatin IV. Patients also undergo collection of 7-8 blood samples for
      analysis.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3-4 weeks.
