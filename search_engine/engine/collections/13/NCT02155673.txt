      adverse outcomes. Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate a reduction
      in structural and functional deficits in the kidney. GCS-100 is a galectin-3 antagonist that
      has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of galectin-3 and
      fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at treating
      patients with CKD.

      Study GCS-100-CS-4002 is an ongoing randomized, placebo controlled study of GCS-100 in Stage
      3b and 4 CKD. The objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 8 weekly
      injections of GCS-100 on eGFR. Patients who have completed that study without adverse safety
      events, may be asked to participate in this study to test the safety of prolonged
      administration of study drug.
