      confirmatory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP015K alone or in combination
      with DMARDs in participants with RA who had an inadequate response to DMARDs.

      Etanercept was also administered as the reference drug in an open-label manner. The study
      drug was orally administered once daily (QD) after breakfast for 52 weeks. Etanercept was
      administered subcutaneously QD for 52 weeks. At Week 12, participants in the placebo group
      were switched to ASP015K.

      The dose of ASP015K to be started at Week 12 for the placebo group was determined randomly at
      baseline in advance and switched in a blinded manner.

      Participants in ASP015K group or placebo groups who had completed the study were eligible for
      participation in an open-label extension study (015K-CL-RAJ2).
