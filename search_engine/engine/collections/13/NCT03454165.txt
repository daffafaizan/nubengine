      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib inhibits the pro-survival
      BCR signaling of CLL cells in the stromal niche resulting in their egress to the periphery.
      Importantly, if administration of ibrutinib is stopped, the CLL cells rapidly return to the
      lymph node. In some patients, the drug-induced increase in circulating CLL cells has been
      seen for more than a year reflecting the fact that the cells do not readily die once they
      exit the lymph node. Resistance to ibrutinib has been observed as mutations in the
      drug-binding cysteine in its target, BTK. This resistance is likely to become far more
      prevalent as patients remain on ibrutinib for months or years. We propose that ibrutinib will
      have far greater efficacy when it is combined with drugs that kill the CLL cells in
      peripheral circulation, thereby preventing them from returning to the protective lymph node
      niche. BNC105P works through an entirely different mechanism, i.e. tipping the balance of
      pro-survival and pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member proteins toward the latter, resulting in
      cell death. This pathway of apoptosis occurs at all stages of the cell cycle which is
      important considering that the majority of peripheral CLL cells are non-cycling (in G0).

      The study consists of a Screening Period with baseline tumor assessment before BNC105P
      administration, a Treatment Period with up to six 21-day cycles and Follow-up Period.
      Subjects will receive a total of six cycles of therapy unless treatment is discontinued.
