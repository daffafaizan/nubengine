      program on the pulmonary function and muscle mass. Moreover, the effects on exercise
      tolerance, inflammatory response, quality of live and overall survival will be explored.

      Patients will be randomized into intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). Patients in
      the IG will be scheduled to receive 12 sessions of PR over a period of 4-6 weeks (2-3
      session/week). CG will receive information and recommendations on physical activity. Both
      groups will receive nutritional assessment and intervention as needed.
