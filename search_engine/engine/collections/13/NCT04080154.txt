      proliferative signaling. The prime targets of anlotinib include receptor tyrosine kinases
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor1 to 3 (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor
      receptor 1 to 4 (FGFR1-4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α and β (PDGFR α, β), and
      stem cell factor receptor.
