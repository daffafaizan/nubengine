      not harmonized. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient's circadian rhythm is almost inevitably
      upset as a result of their disease and/or medical intervention. There are numerous animal
      studies prove that circadian rhythm and periodic dynamics are directly related to healing
      time and hence, mortality rate. Although, one of the main messengers of circadian
      synchronization is melatonin, it is overridden by temperature, and a number of other factors
      from e.g. the digestive tract. If the circadian rhythm is disturbed, the function of
      different organ systems becomes desynchronized and chaotic.

      ICU environment and patient-care activities brings major drawbacks as well mainly by
      necessary presence of noise and light. It has been shown that ICU settings have an impact on
      patients' sleep, which can easily lead to delirium and circadian disruption. There are
      significant data showing strong correlation between delirium and ICU length of stay/
      mortality.

      The focus of this study is the environmental modulation at the ICU with controlled light,
      noise and nutrition conditions. Controlled light conditions are created with artificial light
      during daytime and sleeping mask during night time. Earplugs are used during night time for
      controlled noise conditions. Nutrition is carried out only during daytime both in case of
      enteral and parenteral feeding.
