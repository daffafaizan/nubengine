      (PSP), a relatively rare neurodegenerative disease that presents late in life with relentless
      progressive postural balance disturbances, non-levodopa responsive parkinsonism, supranuclear
      vertical gaze palsy, pseudobulbar palsy, and frontal behavioral and dysexecutive symptoms. In
      light of currently proposed etiopathogenic mechanisms in PSP and based on successful
      experiments inhibiting cellular neurotoxicity, it is hypothesized that preservation of brain
      energy homeostasis may allow endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms to reverse or impede free
      radical injury or other neurotoxic events leading to neurodegeneration in this disease. An
      emerging literature has described the neuroprotective effects of pyruvate, (as a neuronal
      energy fuel and free radical scavenger); niacinamide, (which boosts cofactor NAD), and
      creatine, (which buffers and selectively parcels cellular energy utilization) in various
      animal models of brain injury or degeneration.

      Ajay Verma et al. have further demonstrated a synergistic neuroprotective effect of these
      three nutrients in various neural injury models. We thus propose using these nutrients as a
      novel and safe neuroprotective approach for treating PSP patients. This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo, control pilot study will test the safety and tolerance of this
      nutrient combination over 6 months in patients with PSP, and will measure their transport
      across the blood brain barrier. In addition to clinical and neuropsychological outcome
      measures, brain creatine will also be evaluated using magnetic resonance spectroscopy before
      and after therapy
