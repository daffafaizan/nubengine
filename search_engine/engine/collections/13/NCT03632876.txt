      (SCD-SS) and associated with hospitalizations and poor growth and hematological status.
      Preliminary data in children with SCD-SS show that vit A supplementation at the dose
      recommended for healthy children failed to improve vit A status, resulting in no change in
      hospitalizations, growth or dark adaptation. This indicates an increased vit A requirement
      most likely due to chronic inflammation, low vit A intake and possible stool or urine loss.
      The dose of vit A needed to optimize vit A status in subjects with SCD-SS is unknown.
