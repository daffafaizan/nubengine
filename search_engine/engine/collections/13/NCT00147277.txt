      strategies for the termination of ventricular tachycardia (with Cycle Lenght (CL) of
      240ms-320ms) from baseline to 12 months post randomisation in patients who are treated with
      ATP -8 pulses, 88% versus patients who are treated with ATP -15 pulses, 88%

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Estimate the efficacy of ATP in successfully treating FVT episodes for patients in
           primary and secondary prevention

        -  Estimate acceleration rate or degeneration of ATP therapy for treating spontaneous FVT
           episodes in the ATP 15 vs 8 arm

        -  Compare the likelihood of syncopal events associated with spontaneous FVT episodes

        -  Estimate the percent reduction in number of shocks delivered per patient for treating
           spontaneous FVT episodes

        -  Evaluate different possible predictors of ATP success: VT rate, underlying disease,
           Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs (AAD), infarct zone, etc.
