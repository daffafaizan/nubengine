      liposomal bupivacaine (ExparelÂ®) compared to patients not receiving the drug. It is a
      prospective, randomized clinical trial with two cohorts: Group A: standard of care (SOC) plus
      liposomal bupivacaine (n=30) and Group B: SOC (n=30). All subjects will undergo open
      single-level posterior decompression and instrumented fusion for degenerative
      spondylolisthesis. The surgery is not an experimental procedure. Prior to closing the
      surgical wound, liposomal bupivacaine will be administered to Group A. The administration of
      the drug is a study procedure, but note that this is an indicated use of the drug.
      Postoperatively, subjects will be assessed for pain and opioid consumption. The
      investigator's hypothesis for statistical analysis is that there will be a 30% decrease in
      pain medication requirement for the experimental group (Group A: Liposomal bupivacaine )
      versus the control group (Group B: No Liposomal bupivacaine).
