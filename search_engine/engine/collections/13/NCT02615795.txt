      disease (COPD) disease. Telemedicine, for monitoring disease exacerbation, is the focus area
      of our research. The patient monitoring offers the possibility of early initiation of
      treatment of patients who has evidence of COPD exacerbation or pulmonary infection. The
      self-monitoring of potential exacerbation is started after a hospitalization, and is done by
      the patient on a daily (not on weekends) basis initially. After one month the monitoring is
      made at least three times weekly during the rest of the intervention period of six months.
      With the help of the monitoring equipment, the patient answers a short series of health
      related questions, and makes simple measurements of oxygen saturation, heart rate, lung
      function and weight. Data is sent to the hospital, and here the staff can assess the data and
      respond to them the same day, with a phone call to the patient, if the patient's condition
      has changed. The selected telemonitoring-equipment, consists of a monitoring systems for the
      assessment of key clinical parameters and symptoms. All patients, in the intervention group
      as well as in the control group, are trained in the use of a standardized self-treatment
      plan. It is expected that the monitoring of symptoms and signs will support patient
      empowerment.

      The investigation is planned to assess the clinical and economic effects of the intervention.
