    
      This study is a phase 1/2 study to assess safety and hematologic response rate of Ixazomib
      (MLN) in combination with Cyclophosphamide (CTX) and Dexamethasone (DEX). This is an open
      label multi-center, dose escalation safety study for patients with newly diagnosed AL
      Amyloidosis.

      A 3+3 design will be utilized to determine the MTD for MLN + CTX + DEX in 28-day treatment
      cycle. Treatment cycles will be repeated up to 6 cycles or until disease progression or until
      development of significant treatment-related toxicities. A total of up to 30 patients are
      planned to enroll into the study, with a maximum of 18 patients in the dose escalation arm
      and 18 patients in the MTD expansion arm. The cohort of 6 patients treated at the MTD during
      the dose expansion phase will also serve as the initial 6 patients for the expansion Phase II
      cohort. These 6 patients will contribute data to both the phase I dose escalation study and
      the phase II expansion study. To complete the Phase II cohort, an additional 12 new patients
      will need to be enrolled.

      MLN will be taken orally on days 1, 8, and 15 at doses of 3 mg or 4 mg. CTX will be taken
      orally on the same days with dose escalation from 300 mg up to 500 mg. DEX will be taken
      orally on days 1, 8, 15, 22 at 20 mg in the 28-day cycle.
