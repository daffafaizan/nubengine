    
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by the repetitive occurrence of
      partial or complete pharyngeal obstructions during sleep.Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (CPAP) is the first line treatment of OSAS.

      The aim of the prospective monocentric two steps pilot study SPIRI+ is to validate the
      efficacy of a new CPAP brand developed by Sleepinnov©.

        -  the first step will validate the capability of the algorithm to appropriately detect of
           abnormal repiratory events during sleep.the metrics will be a comparison of the total
           number of events detected by the CPAP Sleepinnov© with data arising from a concurrent
           polysomnography.

        -  the second step will check overall clinical efficacy of the new CPAP device by assessing
           the percentage of OSAS with an index of residual events below 10 and 5 per hour.
