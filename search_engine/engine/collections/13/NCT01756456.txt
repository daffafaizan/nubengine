      regimens (10 µg/ml or 20 µg/ml 6 times a day) of recombinant human nerve growth factor
      (rhNGF) eye drops solution compared to vehicle for inducing a complete healing of stage 2
      (persistent epithelial defect) and 3 (corneal ulcer) neurotrophic keratitis (NK) as measured
      by the Reading Center evaluating the clinical pictures of corneal fluorescein staining.

      Secondary objectives of the study are to assess the duration of complete healing, improvement
      in visual acuity and improvement in corneal sensitivity following treatment with rhNGF eye
      drops solution

      This is a combined phase I/II study. The phase I and II segments of the study will be
      conducted as an 8 week, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled, parallel group study
      (referred to as the controlled treatment period) followed by a 48 or 56 week follow-up period
      The design of the phase I and phase II segments of the study are identical with the exception
      that in the phase I segment of the study the randomization scheme is different and patients
      will be followed with additional safety assessments and blood samples for PK
      (pharmacokinetic) profiling In the ascending dose Phase I segment of the study two doses of
      rhNGF 10 and 20 µg/ml will be evaluated in a sequential manner
