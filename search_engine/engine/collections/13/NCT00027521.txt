      bleomycin in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. II. Determine the overall and
      progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bleomycin intratumorally during laparotomy. Approximately 15
      minutes after the intratumoral injection, patients receive bleomycin IV over 10 minutes.
      Approximately 5 minutes after the IV injection, patients undergo electroporation therapy
      comprising electrical pulses directly to the pancreas and surrounding tissues. Patients are
      followed weekly for 4-6 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
