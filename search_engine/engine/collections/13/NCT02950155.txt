      auto-antibodies. MG is characterized by weakness in skeletal muscles and occurs in all ages,
      but mostly among young adult women and in people of both sexes over the age of 60 years. The
      disease has a wide variation in severity, where in milder cases only symptom-relieving
      choline esterase blockers may be sufficient. In many cases, however, immunomodulatory drugs
      are required. Traditionally MG has been treated with high doses of corticosteroids over
      longer time periods, which causes significant risks of side effects. Therefore, since several
      decades, oral immunosuppressive drugs have been used in order to reduce the need for
      steroids. This group includes azathioprine, cyclosporine and mycophenolate. However, none of
      these drugs has been approved for use in MG and the effect is usually delayed. There is thus
      a great need to develop newer treatment algorithms for MG, for example including more
      effective biological drugs. Several small observational studies have shown that rituximab, an
      anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that eliminate B cells, can have good effects in treatment
      refractory MG. The aim of the present study is to study the effect of rituximab compared to
      placebo in the treatment of new onset MG of moderate to severe symptomatology.
