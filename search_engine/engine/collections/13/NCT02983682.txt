      chronic pain that has been resistant to other therapies, with minimal side effects. The
      investigators would like to determine whether severity of pain and degree of chronic-pain
      related disability could be reduced with lidocaine infusion in children and to understand
      whether the dose of lidocaine correlates with blood levels in the same manner as it does in
      adults. The investigators will recruit 24 patients aged 8-18 with chronic pain that has not
      been relieved by standard therapies. Each patient will receive a lidocaine infusion over 2
      hours. Blood will be drawn for lidocaine concentration before the beginning of the infusion,
      immediately after and 0.5, 2 and 4 hours after. Severity of pain and degree of disability
      will be recorded using a questionnaire measuring pain scores, sleep disruption, social
      disruption, physical abilities and school attendance before the infusion, weekly for 2 weeks
      and then 4 weeks after. This study will help the investigators better understand the
      effectiveness and safety of intravenous lidocaine for chronic pain in children.
