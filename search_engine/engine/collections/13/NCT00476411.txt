      %. No data of isolated anti-HBc is reported. Anti-HBc antigen is observed in 10%-20% of
      individuals from low endemic areas of HBV infection. The prevalence of isolated antiHBc
      antigen is expected to be higher in endemic areas of HBV infection. There is conflicting data
      of occult HBV infection in HIV-infected patients. In Thailand, perinatal transmission is the
      main route of HBV transmission, different from developed countries. Therefore, isolated
      anti-HBc in Thai people has longer duration than low prevalence regions. Moreover, HBV
      genotype C and B is common in this region. HBV genotype C is correlated with more cirrhosis
      and hepatoma than genotype B. A study from Taiwan demonstrated that HBV DNA > 100,000
      copies/ml is correlated with cirrhosis and hepatoma. Sustained reduction of HBV replication
      lowers the risk of hepatoma in HBV related cirrhosis. If the HBV vaccination could eliminate
      an occult HBV infection in these individuals, the liver related mortality will be reduced.

      The prevalence and its clinical importance of isolated anti-HBc in the Thai population has
      not been investigated yet. There is also limited data of HBV vaccine response in this
      setting.
