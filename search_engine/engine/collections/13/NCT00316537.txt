      surface of chronic diabetic ulcer. The goals of the study are to evaluate safety and
      tolerability (particularly at the wound site) of a gel formulation containing low-dose
      nicotine, and to obtain preliminary information on its effects on accelerating wound closure.
      The study will be carried out on a background of conventional wound therapy in patients with
      Type II diabetes mellitus. Patients will be randomized to receive either study medication
      (ATG002), vehicle gel, or standard-of-care.
