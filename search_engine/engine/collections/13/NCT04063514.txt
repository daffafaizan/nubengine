      delivery of drugs, particulates and cellular elements such as stem cells to the central
      nervous system (CNS). This limitation is often circumvented with neurosurgical techniques,
      however, less invasive approaches may be desirable particularly for widespread or multifocal
      disease and when long term and repetitive administration is required.

      The diagnosis for the participants will be either low grade gliomas. A baseline fMRI and
      follow up routine fMRI's will be taken and evaluated for any changes in perfusion. During the
      scans, The ultrasound placement will last for one hour.

      This study seeks to investigate the efficacy of focused ultrasound in opening the blood brain
      barrier. This physiological effect would have significant clinical applications. The ability
      to open the blood brain barrier has the potential to revolutionize the delivery of
      therapeutic agents to the brain, allowing for more localized and efficient delivery. There
      are no immediate benefits for patients who choose to participate; however, the information
      gained from this study will contribute to the research base and help patients in similar
      situations in the future.
