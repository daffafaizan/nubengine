    
      Primary Aim: Determine the change in pain intensity in children with moderate to severe pain
      who receive intranasal hydromorphone one hour after administration.

      Secondary Aim(s): Describe the incidence of minor and major adverse events associated with
      intranasal hydromorphone in children with acute pain.

      The investigators will assess the patient's pain at baseline (prior to study drug
      administration), then after study drug administration: 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45
      minutes, 60 minutes, and then every 30 minutes thereafter until 6 hours; administration of
      non-protocolized rescue medication administration (i.e. administered after first two rescue
      doses of IN hydromorphone); or discharge from emergency department (whichever comes first).
      The pain score at 60 minutes will be the primary outcome.

      The investigators will evaluate qualitative improvement in pain intensity at 15- and
      30-minutes after study drug administration. If there is no improvement, or worsening of pain
      intensity, at each assessment, an additional rescue dose rescue dose of intranasal
      hydromorphone will be administered. After 60 minutes, the treating physician may administer
      any additional rescue medications at their discretion to treat the child's pain.

      The patient will be assessed for minor and major adverse events for the duration of the
      study.
