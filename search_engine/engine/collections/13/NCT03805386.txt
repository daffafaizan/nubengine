      evaluated the success of shared decision making in the care of the patient. Currently, there
      is strong research and clinical emphasis trying to determine how, as surgeons, we can assist
      in minimizing the misuse of opioid medications. Several studies have shown significant
      over-prescribing and under-utilizing of the pain medications that are prescribed to patients
      after surgery. One such study by As-Sanie et al showed that about half of medications were
      utilized for pain after surgery, with typically 200 oral morphine equivalents prescribed.

      A recent prospective cohort study by Prabhu et al showed that shared decision making in the
      prescription of narcotic pain medications after cesarean section decreased opioid use without
      impacting patient satisfaction.

      We propose a randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of shared decision making in
      the prescribing of pain medications after minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. For adult
      female patients who are undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy, we will randomize them to
      either standard care or patient directed treatment. Our standard arm will receive 150 oral
      morphine equivalents, or 30 tablets of oxycodone, whereas our patient directed arm will
      receive a prescription with as many pills is determined after discussion with the patient.

      We hope to contribute to identifying the optimized opioid prescription for post surgical
      patients.
