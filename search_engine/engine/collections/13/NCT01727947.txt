      under high magnification, named "motile sperm organellar morphology examination" (MSOME) was
      developed. This magnification provides an accurate description of spermatozoa abnormalities,
      particularly the presence of head vacuoles, which is indicative of abnormal chromatin
      packaging in spermatozoa. However, the influence of sperm with large nuclear vacuoles (SLV)
      on ART outcomes is still a matter of debate. The goals for this study were to identify
      whether there is a connection between SLV under high magnification and ICSI outcomes.
