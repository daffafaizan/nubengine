    
      Methodology:

      This will be a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study in subjects 18-70 years of age with acute, painful, muscle spasm of the lower back. The
      study consists of a baseline screening (Study Day 1), during which subjects will be evaluated
      for inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a 7-day double-blind treatment period (Study Day 1
      through Study Day 7). Subjects will be randomly assigned to be dosed twice daily with one of
      the following double-blind treatments: SR carisoprodol 500-mg tablets, SR carisoprodol 700-mg
      tablets, or placebo.

      Subjects will be evaluated in the clinic on Study Days 1, 3 and 7. Subjects who remain
      symptomatic on Study Day 7 will be allowed to continue in the study for a 7-day, double-blind
      extension period at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects will be contacted by
      telephone for a safety follow-up 7 days after the last dose of study medication.

      A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy will be conducted at selected sites. These sites will obtain
      blood samples for PK analysis at the end of the 7-day treatment period and the 14-day
      treatment period, if applicable.
