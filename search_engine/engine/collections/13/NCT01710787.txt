      parallel-groups design to assess the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist delivered
      intranasally for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth numbers 4 to 13 (maxillary
      right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar) sufficient to allow completion of
      the Study Dental Procedure.

      The intent is to treat 110 subjects, with enrollment balanced evenly between the 2 study
      sites, 2:2:1 randomization within each study site and an overall goal of 44 subjects treated
      with Kovacaine Mist, 44 treated with Tetracaine alone, and 22 treated with Placebo.
      Recruitment will be from diverse dental patient populations.
