      participate. A medical and demographic questionnaire and the Sensory Responsiveness
      Questionnaire-Intensity Scale (SRQ-IS) will be applied to screen for participation
      eligibility. Outcome measures will be conducted at 4-time points (1. baseline- 3 weeks
      pre-treatment; 2. before the first treatment session; 3. after the last treatment session;
      and 4. a month post-treatment) applying: The Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), the P300
      component using a neurophysiological assessment of the 'Oddball paradigm', the alpha power
      using electroencephalogram resting state, and electronic versions of the Satisfaction with
      Life Scale, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, and the Pain
      Sensitivity Questionnaire. Sixteen individually therapy sessions of 45 minutes each, twice a
      week, will be held at the same time of day.
