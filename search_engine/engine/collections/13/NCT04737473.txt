      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II women who will undergo elective myomectomy,
      hysterectomy, ovarian cystectomy and mastectomy between June 2021 to September 2021 at the
      Yaounde Gynaeco-Obstetric and Pediatric Hospital of Cameroon. Participants will be matched
      for age and parity in a ratio of 1:1 into an Opiod Free Anesthesia (OFA) group and a general
      anesthesia (GA) group. The primary endpoints shall be the success rate of OFA. The secondary
      endpoints shall be the mumber or frequency of postoperative complications like respiratory
      distress, nausea and vomiting, paralitic ileus and severe postoperative pain. The threshold
      for statistical significance will be set at 0.05.
