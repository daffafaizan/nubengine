      maintain their functionality and long life span, berry seeds need to contain cell stabilizing
      ingredients such as vitamins and polyphenols. Since it seems to be a valuable source of
      health beneficial substances in human nutrition, commercial use should be found. Therefore,
      seeds were pressed (seed press residue), ground and baked into bread for consumption.

      Black currant seed press residues are rich in tocopherols and also contain anthocyanins; both
      act as antioxidants. Additionally there is 50% fibre in the residue, soluble and insoluble
      fibre in equal shares.
