    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a local perianal block performed during a
      proctological intervention can reduce the postoperative pain.

      All patients will undergo surgery under general or spinal anesthesia. At the end of the
      surgery, the surgeon will perform a perianal block using the local anesthetic or the placebo
      upon randomisation. The experimental group will receive a local anesthetics and the control
      group a normal saline injection. All injections will be perianal, peripheral to the external
      anal sphincter.
