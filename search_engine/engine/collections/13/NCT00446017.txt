    
      Following preoperative written informed consent, patients presenting with a cardiac-index
      (CI) < 2.2 l/min/m2 upon ICU-admission - despite adequate mean arterial (titrated with
      noradrenaline or sodium-nitroprusside) and filling pressures - will be randomized to 14 hour
      treatment with adrenaline or milrinone to achieve a CI > 3.0 l/min/m2.

      A group of patients not needing inotropes will be used as controls. Hemodynamics, metabolism
      (plasma lactate, pyruvate, glucose, acid-base status, insulin requirements) and renal
      function (urinary excretion of alpha-1-microglobulin, creatinine clearance, plasma cystatin-C
      levels) will be determined during the treatment period and up to 48 hours after surgery
      (follow up period).

      The study is designed as a pilot study including 20 patients per group.
