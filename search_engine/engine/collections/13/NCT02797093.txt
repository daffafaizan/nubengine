      adherence, measured by an objective biomarker, could have significant clinical and
      therapeutic implications for ART and HIV cure.

        1. First, this aim will quantify levels of CA-RNA, CA-DNA, and plasma residual viremia in
           suppressed, HIV infected individuals and correlate them with levels of TFV-DP in DBS as
           a measure of cumulate drug exposure (adherence).

        2. Second, this study will evaluate the changes in the HIV reservoir in relation to changes
           in ART adherence over time.
