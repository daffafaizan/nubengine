      cyclophosphamide) are established adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early stage breast
      cancer. TAC, however, due to the inclusion of the anthracycline doxorubicin, carries a high
      risk of hematologic and cardiotoxic adverse effects. Substantial evidence supports the
      concept that early stage HER2-negative breast cancers will benefit similarly from
      anthracycline-based adjuvant and non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

      Further, approximately 0 to 9% of HER2-negative breast cancers have alterations in the TOP2A
      gene, which may predict for benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

      We hypothesize that 6 cycles of TC versus 6 cycles of TAC will have similar efficacy in the
      treatment of early stage HER2-negative breast cancer and that TC will have less toxicity. If
      this hypothesis were upheld and the anthracycline doxorubicin could be eliminated from the
      regimen while obtaining similar efficacy in this population of patients, it would not only be
      an important advance in the understanding of the biology of cancer, but it would also be of
      significant clinical benefit to women with breast cancer.
