      ability to breathe normally. ICS reduce airway inflammation and are often prescribed to treat
      these conditions. However, poor medication adherence is a common problem that can lead to
      treatment failure, hospitalization, or death. A telephone-based system that uses interactive
      voice recognition technology to remind individuals to follow their medication regimen may
      prove beneficial in promoting adherence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of such a telephone-based intervention at improving adherence to inhaled
      corticosteroid regimens among individuals with asthma. If this study proves successful,
      telephone-based interventions may be developed to promote treatment adherence for other
      chronic medical conditions.

      This 19-month study will enroll approximately 14,000 members of the Kaiser Permanente
      Northwest or Hawaii health system. Participants will be randomly assigned to either take part
      in the telephone intervention or receive usual medical care. Over the 19-month period,
      participants in the intervention group will receive between one and eight phone calls that
      will remind them to refill their prescriptions and offer education about ICS. If needed, the
      call may also offer a transfer to a pharmacy refill line or to speak with a pharmacist.
      Approximately 2,000 participants will complete questionnaires at study entry and at the end
      of the 19-month intervention period. The questionnaires will assess quality of life,
      respiratory health, asthma control, depression, inhaler use beliefs, and satisfaction with
      the intervention. Electronic medical record data and questionnaires will be used to determine
      adherence rates.
