    
      GSK2140944 belongs to the Bacterial Type II Topoisomerase Inhibitor (BTI) class of
      antibiotics. GSK2140944 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against Gram positive
      pathogens including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative
      pathogens associated with respiratory tract, skin and soft issue infections including
      isolates resistant to existing classes of antimicrobials. This study will be the first
      administration of GSK2140944 as an intravenous (IV) formulation in humans and will be
      conducted in two (2) parts. Single IV doses will be explored in Part A and repeat IV doses
      will be explored in Part B. In addition, this study will evaluate the absolute
      bioavailability of an oral capsule formulation as compared to the IV formulation in Part A.
      Both study parts will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of
      GSK2140944 in healthy adult subjects.
