      of subjects with moderately or severely impaired renal function or normal renal function
      matched with regard to sex, age, race and weight. PK blood and urine sampling for
      determination of vilaprisan concentrations in plasma and urine, respectively, will be
      preformed at pre-defined time points up to 14 days post-dose. Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed through adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 12-lead
      electrocardiograms and physical examinations.
