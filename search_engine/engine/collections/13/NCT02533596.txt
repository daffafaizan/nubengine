      consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) sessions during the study. Plasma exchange
      therapy was performed using either the Spectra Optia® or the Octo Nova® apheresis system.
      Anticoagulation was applied either by heparin or citrate. The prescribed dose of exchange
      volume of every TPE treatment was 1.1-times the individual calculated total plasma volume,
      using the Nadler-Allen equation. A substitute fluid with 5% albumin concentration was used in
      every treatment. Blood samples for measurement of different adipokines (resistin, leptin,
      soluble ICAM-1, soluble CD40 ligand, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), soluble
      tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNF-R) as well as cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and
      routine chemistry were drawn before (pre-TPE) and at the end (post-TPE) of the first and
      second TPE session.
