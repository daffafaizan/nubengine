      which will include participants with diabetes and gastrointestinal (GI) problems. These
      problems may be manifestations of diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

      Participants are randomised to received either active non-invasive transcutaneous vagal nerve
      stimulation (tVNS) or inactive sham stimulation. The study period is divided in two phases.
      The first phase investigates the effects of short-term, high-intensity tVNS treatment on GI
      symptoms. The second phase investigates the effects of long-term, middle-intensity tVNS
      treatment. The primary outcome of both phases is subjective patient evaluation of GI symptoms
      by the use of validated questionnaires.

      A third phase, conducted only on participants, who proved to be responsive to tVNS treatment,
      will investigate the acute endocrine and metabolic response to short-term tVNS in a
      randomised cross-over design.

      Lastly, healthy volunteers will be included in a cross-sectional, descriptive study in order
      to provide a comparable baseline dataset.
