    
      Preterm infants diagnosed with a hemodynamically-significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSPDA)
      will be included. Specific criteria will be followed to determine if a patent ductus
      arteriosus (PDA) is "hemodynamically significant". Infants will be randomized to two
      different approaches for management of the PDA. The first will be catheter-based closure
      (intervention) and the second will be conservative management (non-intervention). Both
      procedures are standard practice at many institutions, including Nationwide Children's
      Hospital. Infants randomized to receive intervention will undergo a procedure in which a
      catheter is used to place an FDA-approved device within the PDA, to close it (like a plug).
      Infants randomized to the conservative management (non-intervention) group will be permitted
      time to see if the PDA closes on its own, naturally. However, if the PDA remains open and
      intervention is deemed medically necessary, they will also undergo the catheter closure
      procedure.
