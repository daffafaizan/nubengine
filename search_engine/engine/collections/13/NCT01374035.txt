      interview with four mixed groups of health professionals (both Primary and Specialised Care),
      patient representatives and managers will be conducted. The groups will give input on
      firstly, what information they think is important to include in the referral letters, and
      secondly, what impact they think improved referral letters can have for the organisation and
      care within Specialised Mental Health Care. Within step two a validated check-list to assess
      the quality of referral letters will be developed. Within step three outcome measures will be
      developed and tested. Both step two and three will make use of the results from step one in
      addition to existing literature and testing. Step four is the intervention study where
      measures from the former steps will be used.
