           water, the oil phase gives the cream shine and pearl look because of stearic acid in the
           oil. To form an emulsion, the alkali will react with stearic acid to form stearate soap.
           Then mix sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to give cream hard and
           soft properties.

        2. Preparation of cream containing silver nanoparticles Silver nanoparticles will be
           produced by using the reduction reaction method. The reaction involves heating silver
           nitrate at a high temperature with adding a reducing agent, the particles will produce
           as silver nanoparticles in liquid form.

        3. Characterization of the Vanishing cream containing drug:

           3.1. Drug content: The amount of drug in cream will be determined by taking 100 mg of
           the cream formulation and dissolve it in 10 mL of methanol after that it will be
           filtrated. In addition, it will be analyzed the content of drug spectrophotometrically
           using (UV-VIS) at specific Î»max.

           3.2. Irritation to skin: In this test, the cream formulation will be applied to four
           healthy volunteers which they should not have any sensitivity to the drug. They will
           inform about the nature of the formulation and obtain a written approval from them about
           the irritation effect of the formulated cream.

        4. Anti-microbial studies:

      The antifungal action for formula will be studied using different 6 groups volunteers The
      inhibition microbial activity for all formulae were compared with known standard
      antimicrobial drugs.
