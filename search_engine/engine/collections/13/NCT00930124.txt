      patients and is related to a combination of congenital reduction in midfacial growth and the
      surgical scar from the repair of the cleft palate. Therefore CLP patients commonly present
      with short midface and narrow hard palate and severe malocclusion.

      Conventional orthognathic surgery can advance, expand and lengthen the maxilla to a normal
      position in relation to the skull and the occlusion. However, such immediate surgical
      transposition of the cleft maxilla is technically difficult due to the severe deformity
      demanding large surgical movement and the tension from the palatal scar. Studies have
      demonstrated that the repositioned maxilla is rather unstable in the long term. In addition,
      velopharyngeal competence could be compromised by this immediate advancement technique
      resulting in abnormally nasal speech.

      The feasibility of gradual lengthening of the under-developed mandible in syndromal patients
      by distraction osteogenesis has been proven. The gradual movement of the maxilla activated by
      the implanted distractors can theoretically overcome the tension from the palatal scar and
      the soft palate musculature. This may reduce the long term skeletal relapse of the cleft
      maxilla and the speech distortion. On the other hand, the distraction procedures involve the
      surgical insertion and removal operations and the retention of the devices over a two month
      period. This may increase the chance of infection, social inconvenience and ultimately affect
      the patient's satisfaction.
