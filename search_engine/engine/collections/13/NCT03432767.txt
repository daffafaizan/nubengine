      monitoring, will be useful to identify PPH and the immediate need for pharmacotherapy, as
      well as the need for transfusion in obstetric patients undergoing vaginal deliveries. The
      investigators expect shock index to increase and SpHb levels to decrease with increasing
      blood loss after delivery. The compensatory hemodynamic response may start early, however, Hb
      variation may be delayed unless the patient is transfused with crystalloids. Also
      autotransfusion after delivery may influence these measures. It is unknown which one of the
      two indicators, SI or SpHb, has a stronger association with blood loss after vaginal
      delivery.

      It is already established that both SI and SpHb are independent, clinically useful markers
      indicating significant blood loss in elective cesarean delivery and trauma. This study would
      assess their utility in the recognition and management of obstetric hemorrhage following
      normal vaginal delivery, where early recognition and resuscitation reduces the risk of
      progressing to hemorrhagic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and death.
