      for eating disorders is a "rapid response" - or a 65% drop in symptoms such as binge eating
      or purging - in the first four weeks of Cognitive Behavior Treatment (CBT). Research is only
      now beginning to look at whether it is possible to increase the number of rapid responders by
      directly encouraging this behavior in patients. This study has two aims: 1) to validate
      information obtained about symptoms in a Weekly Symptom Checklist (WSC) against information
      obtained in clinical interview; and 2) to examine whether, in a context where rapid response
      is being discussed and actively encouraged, the rates of rapid response can be improved by
      providing patients with visual of symptom change in the first weeks of treatment.
      Investigators hypothesize that there will be significant correspondence between the WSC and
      clinical interview. Investigators also hypothesize that being given a visual of symptom
      change in the first weeks of treatment will result in higher rates of rapid response in
      patients being encouraged to achieve these objectives; and that rapid response will be
      related to higher rates of symptom remission at the end of treatment. Participants will be 40
      patients diagnosed with Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder or Purging Disorder. These
      patients will be spread across 6 treatment groups. Three groups will be randomly selected
      (balanced across clinicians) to either receive or not receive visual feedback on change in
      frequency of symptoms based on their responses to the Weekly Symptom Checklist (WSC).
