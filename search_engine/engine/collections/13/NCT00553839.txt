      procedures (eg., surgery or cardiac catheterization) at Stanford and Lucile Packard
      Children's hospital in California and at The Children's Hospital in Denver, CO. Patients with
      abnormal kidney or liver functions will be excluded from the study as the dysfunction in
      these organs affects the clearance of medications from the body and affects dosing. Preterm
      neonates will also be excluded. All patients will be premedicated and anesthetised at the
      discretion of the anesthesia faculty providing clinical care for the child. Once the
      patient's procedure is underway, a 0.5 cc blood sample will be drawn from an intravenous
      line. This is the preload blood sample (T0). Following this a 2mg/kg intravenous bolus of
      Ketamine will be administered over 5 minutes (this is the usual dose and manner in which
      ketamine is administered). Five minutes after the bolus, timed blood samples will be drawn at
      the following intervals: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 and 720 minutes
      after bolus. (Total 14 blood samples; total blood required is 7 mls for the entire study).
      When the procedure is completed the anesthesiologist will awaken the patient as per their
      usual practice. Blood samples that still need drawing will be done in the post-anesthesia
      recovery room or intensive care or ward-any location where the patient is likely to remain
      after the surgery.
