      It is suspected that the current need for repeated islets transplantation to treat diabetes
      type I is dependent on an early destruction of the islets when infused into the portal vein.

      Aim:

      To trace the fate of the islet at and after infusion into the portal vein.

      Method:

      Islets are labelled in vitro with a radioactive tracer that can be measured with positron
      emission tomography. 10-20 percent of the graft is labelled. Just prior to start of infusion
      labelled islets are mixed with unlabelled islets (80-90 percent of the graft). The tracer
      used is FDG and stands for 2-[18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose. At infusion the patient is placed in
      the combined computer tomography and PET camera to follow the infusion. The imaging is almost
      continuous for 2 h at and after infusion.

      Expected results:

      Calculations of proportion of surviving islets and rate of destruction. Localisation and
      distribution of islets in the liver of the recipient.
