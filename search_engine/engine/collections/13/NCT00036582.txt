    
      Bipolar disorder (BPD) in children and adolescents is a serious illness that carries a high
      risk for chronicity, impairing comorbidities, and completed suicide. Treatment options are
      often limited by inefficacy or intolerable side effects. Open trials in adult bipolar
      subjects and several case series in children and adolescents provide preliminary evidence
      that clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, may be effective in treatment-resistant bipolar
      disorder. The first specific aim of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of
      clozapine compared to placebo in a double-blind study of children and adolescents with
      treatment refractory BPD. Other specific aims involve exploring the pathophysiology of
      early-onset BPD by 1) testing the hypotheses that, compared to controls, children with BPD
      have increased psychophysiological reactivity to emotional stimuli and decreased prepulse
      inhibition; 2) obtaining samples of genetic material from affected probands and their parents
      for later analysis; and 3) identifying anatomic changes in the brains of children with BPD
      using structural MRI.
