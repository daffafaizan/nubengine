    
      This prospective un-blinded randomized trial will follow patients with respiratory failure
      and ALI/ARDS who require invasive mechanical ventilation in select ICUs. Patients will be
      allocated to respiratory support with either APRV mode or volume control (AC) mode of
      mechanical ventilation. Qualifying patients will be randomized by permuted block
      randomization within 24 hours of admission to the ICU. Identical ventilation and oxygenation
      thresholds will be utilized to guide titration of each ventilator protocol. Patients will
      remain on the assigned mode of ventilation until they are extubated and discharged from the
      ICU.

      Procedures for treatment evaluation include daily monitoring of the Ventilator protocol in
      each arm. Clinical coordinator and study respiratory therapist will perform 2 daily checks of
      the study patients to determine compliance with the protocol and if patient meets weaning
      criteria. The previously published ARDS Network continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      weaning protocol will be used for all patients enrolled.
