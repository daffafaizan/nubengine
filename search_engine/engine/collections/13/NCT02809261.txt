      randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received
      one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose and control group
      received one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with normal saline. No additional
      treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog
      scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire
      (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory nerve conduction velocity of
      the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as
      well as on the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24th week after the treatment.
