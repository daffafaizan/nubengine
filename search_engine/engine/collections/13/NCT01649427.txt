      recruitment timespan. Eighty-one patients were recruited to Phase I and only 45 of the
      required 54 patients were available for PK analysis. To complete Phase II, 245 (in addition
      to 81) patients were to be required to achieve calculated sample size. Therefore the protocol
      was amended to stop recruitment and analyze Phase I patient data of CERL080ADE27 (PK-Phase
      I). Patients that were still ongoing were scheduled for an end of study (EOS) visit. During
      this visit patients were informed by the investigator about the end of study and advised
      about further treatment course.
