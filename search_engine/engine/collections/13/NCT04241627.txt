      efficacy of CPS delivered by phone calls or text messages to AYAs with two distinct chronic
      illnesses, in preparation for an R01 proposal to conduct a multisite,
      effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial. We propose 1) assessing the feasibility,
      acceptability, and efficacy of CPS for improving medication adherence, 2) investigating the
      impact of delivering CPS through live text messages versus phone calls using quantitative and
      qualitative methods, and 3) evaluating patient and provider views of CPS to guide future
      implementation work. The proposed research follows the conceptual model, illustrated below,
      positing that CPS will promote adherence through engaging AYAs in calls or texts with a human
      AF providing social support. We predict that delivering CPS by text message will increase
      feasibility and acceptability, perceived social support, and adherence compared to voice
      delivery.
