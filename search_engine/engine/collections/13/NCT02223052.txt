    
      Stage I - Pharmacokinetics (Bioequivalence)

      Subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 300 mg orally on each of the two
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study days based on the dosing sequences they are randomized to:

      Dosing Sequence 1: 2x150 mg tablets followed by 1x30 mg tablet. Dosing Sequence 2: 1x300 mg
      tablet followed by 2x150 mg tablets. Each dose will be administered in the clinic at least 48
      hours apart between PK dosing day 1 and PK dosing day 2 over a period no longer than 10 days
      under fasted conditions.

      Stage II - Pharmacokinetics (Food Effect)

      Subjects will be randomized to receive CC-486 300 mg orally on each of the two PK study days
      based on the dosing sequences they are randomized to:

      Dosing Sequence 1: 1x300 mg tablet under fasted condition followed by 1x300 mg tablet under
      fed condition.

      Dosing Sequence 2: 1x300 mg tablet under fed condition followed by 1x300 mg tablet under
      fasted condition.

      Each dose will be administered in the clinic at least 48 hours apart between PK dosing day 1
      and PK dosing day 2 over a period no longer than 10 days. The sponsor will generate the
      randomization scheme and assign subjects upon enrollment to the appropriate sequence for
      dosing:

      Fasted condition: following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will ingest oral
      Azacitidine with 240 mL of room temperature water. Subjects must fast for a minimum of 4
      hours following oral Azacitidine administration. Subjects may drink water as desired, except
      for 1 hour before and 1 hour after oral Azacitidine administration.

      Fed condition: following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours and following the performance
      of all required pre-dose assessments, subjects randomized to receive test medication in a fed
      state will begin ingesting a breakfast meal 30 (±5) minutes prior to the planned
      administration of oral Azacitidine. They will continue the entire meal within 20 to 25
      minutes (no less than 20 minutes) from the time the meal is served. Subjects will then ingest
      oral Azacitidine with 240 mL of room temperature water. Subjects must fast a minimum of 4
      hours following oral Azacitidine administration. Subjects may drink water as desired, except
      for 1 hour before and 1 hour after administration of oral Azacitidine.

      Extension Phase (for subjects who have completed PK Stage I or Stage II) Subjects continuing
      beyond the pharmacokinetics phase (Stage I or Stage II) will enter the extension phase of the
      study at the discretion of the investigator to receive < 6 (four-week) cycles of Vidaza 75
      mg/m2 IV or SC daily for 7 days in the clinic and repeat every 4 weeks per prescribed label
      at the discretion of the investigator for ≤ 6 (four-week) cycles.
