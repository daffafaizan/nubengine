      muscle derived cells as therapy for stress urinary incontinence. A total of 10 women in whom
      stress urinary incontinence had not improved underwent intra-sphincter injection of low doses
      30Ã—106 of autologous muscle derived cells, which will be derived from biopsies of their
      deltoid muscle. Assessments will be made at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after cell injection.
      Changes in stress urinary incontinence severity were evaluated by pad test, diary of
      incontinence episodes and quality of life surveys.
