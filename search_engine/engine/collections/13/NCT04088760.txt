      and is the biggest barrier to successful allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT)
      outcomes. Improved methods of acute GVHD prevention are needed. TCRαβ+/CD19+ depletion of
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell products offers an opportunity to limit the risk of acute
      GVHD by removing TCRαβ+ T cells and CD19+ B cells which participate in acute GVHD initiation
      and perpetuation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      TCRαβ+/CD19+ depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for malignant and
      non-malignant disorders in children and adolescent/young adult patients using the CliniMACS®
      immunomagnetic selection device (Miltenyi Biotec).
