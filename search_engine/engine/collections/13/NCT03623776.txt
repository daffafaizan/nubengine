      therapeutic approach for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      However, the prognosis of early-stage NSCLC remains to be improved, with 5-year survival
      rates ranging from 50% for stage IA to 20% for stage IIIA. Antibodies that block the PD-1
      protein have provided a major treatment advance in patients with cancer. JS001 (Toripalimab)
      is a recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, which has shown its efficacy in the
      treatment of a variety of malignancies. This study is to studying neoadjuvant JS001, or JS001
      in combination with chemotherapy to see how well it works in treating patients with
      resectable NSCLC.
