        1. Derivation and Retrospective Validation.

             -  Select all adult patients with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain
                reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 beginning March 1,
                2020 until approximately 1000 patients are included.

             -  Use 75% of this cohort to develop a simple risk-score that prognosticates a
                patient's suitability for discharge (no supplemental oxygen, no intensive care
                unit, and no death). Use multivariable logistic regression with forward selection
                informed by clinical judgement to choose variables a priori that emphasizes readily
                available data and easy calculation for use at the point of care.

             -  Use 25% of this cohort to retrospectively validate the risk-score.

        2. Prospective Validation.

             -  Select all adult patients with a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain
                reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as soon as the
                derivation cohort in step 1 is assembled. Include approximately 250 patients.

             -  Use this sample to prospectively validate the risk-score developed in part 1.
