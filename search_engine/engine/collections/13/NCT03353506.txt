    
      This prospective double blind randomized pilot study will enroll 40 subjects with recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infection in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LSFF or LFMT by capsules.

      Subjects will receive 15 capsules at week 0 and be assessed at Weeks 1, 4, 12 and 24. If
      treatment fails, subjects will be given open label LFMT from the same donor. If treatment
      fails again, another FMT will be offered and the form and route of FMT delivery will be at
      the discretion of the treating physician.
