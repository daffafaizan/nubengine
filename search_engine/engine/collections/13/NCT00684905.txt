        -  Determine the feasibility and patient tolerance of interstitial brachytherapy combined
           with androgen-deprivation therapy for patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer
           after prior external-beam irradiation.

        -  Determine the toxicity of interstitial brachytherapy combined with androgen-deprivation
           therapy in these patients.

        -  Determine the tumor response to interstitial brachytherapy combined with
           androgen-deprivation therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy comprising leuprolide acetate intramuscularly
      for 3 months and oral bicalutamide once daily for 30 days, beginning on the first day of
      leuprolide acetate administration. Patients then undergo interstitial brachytherapy
      implantation with I-125. Following brachytherapy, patients receive adjuvant leuprolide
      acetate every 3 months for an additional 6 months.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at every treatment and follow-up visit.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every to
      4-6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
