      periodontitis were studied. Samples of gingival crevicular fluid were collected by paper
      strips and ELISA test was conducted to determine the total concentration of RANKL, OPG, and
      then obtain the values of the RANKL / OPG ratio. We analyzed 66 samples of gingival
      crevicular fluid obtained from active periodontal sites of 17 patients with osteopenia /
      osteoporosis and 15 samples gingival crevicular fluid obtained from active periodontal sites
      obtained of 14 controls patients with normal osseous condition.

      Statistical analyzes were computed and analyzed using Graphpad Software. To determine if the
      data correspond to a normal distribution the D'Agostino-Pearson test was used. The values of
      cytokines (RANKL and OPG) and its ratio (RANKL / OPG) were compared using Mann-Whitney Test t
      U. Analysis Spearman correlation and linear regression for statistic was also performed to
      determine whether there was any relationship between the variables analyzed. It was
      considered as statistically significant p value â‰¤ 0.05.
