    
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional cohort study with an estimated
      enrollment of 600 patients with acute DILI. According to the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, the RUCAM scale and/or expert evaluation, patients with a clinical diagnosis of
      acute DILI will be included in the study to establish a multi-center, prospective DILI
      cohort. Depending on the presence or absence of associated chronic liver disease, the
      patients will be divided into the basic DILI group with chronic liver disease and basic DILI
      group without chronic liver disease. All enrolled patients should complete at least six
      months of follow-up.

      This research will propose a new or optimized DILI diagnostic scheme based on the analysis of
      the problems existing in the practice of RUCAM scale, the clinical characteristics and
      prognosis of DILI, the exploration of biomarkers, and all the comprehensive information of
      big data from Hepatox platform, and establish a big data-based diagnosis model or auxiliary
      diagnosis decision system.
