    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study, followed by
      an open label treatment of all patients. Patients are stratified according to the
      institutional investigator and age.

      In the first phase of the study, patients receive either clozapine or placebo. The drug is
      taken orally at night, approximately 30 minutes before retiring. Therapy continues for 4
      weeks unless psychosis becomes unmanageable without hospitalization, parkinsonism worsens, or
      other adverse effects occur. It is possible that the dose may be escalated.

      In the second phase of the study, all patients are treated with open label clozapine. Therapy
      continues for 3 months unless psychiatric status or parkinsonism progress. Dose escalation is
      also possible during this phase.

      Patients are followed weekly during the first phase of the study, and monthly during the
      second phase.
