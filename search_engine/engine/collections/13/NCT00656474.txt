      Glucoprime gel (GLYC-101 gel 1.0 %) in promoting wound healing in healthy volunteer subjects
      undergoing retro-auricular Carbon Dioxide Laser Skin Resurfacing (CO2 LSR). The study will
      observe the effects of the topical agent over the course of 1 month following the treatment.
      as a preparation for study GLYC-101-1b (Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2
      Pilot Study to investigate the safety and efficacy of 1.0 % topically applied GLYC 101
      compared to placebo, in patients undergoing Carbon Dioxide Laser Skin Resurfacing).
