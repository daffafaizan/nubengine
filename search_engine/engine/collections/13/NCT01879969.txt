      procedure for orthognathic correction of facial asymmetry. The investigators compared two
      different methods of surgical planning: classical (esthetic analysis of the face,
      cephalometric study of the skull in lateral and posteroanterior cephalograms, analysis and
      surgical simulation of plaster casts mounted in semi-individual articulators, development of
      a surgical acrylic resin intermediate splint) and digital planning (cone-beam computed
      tomography, data acquisition, software-assisted virtual surgery -Maxilim; Medicim, Mechelen,
      Belgium- and CAD/CAM processing of the surgical intermediate splint).
