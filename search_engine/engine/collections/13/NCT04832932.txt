      Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and upgraded to pandemic in
      March 2020. First vaccines to prevent COVID-19 were authorized for emergency use in the US in
      December 2020, but a number of unknowns still remains. One of these unknowns is the
      relationship of the microbiota, gut dysbiosis and impaired metabolism with active immunity to
      pathogens and vaccines and tolerance to antigens. Study groups will be based on age,
      metabolism and self-reported symptoms. Data will be collected continuously via surveys and
      investigator-participant interactions, as needed. Statistical methods used will be the ones
      with the greatest power.
