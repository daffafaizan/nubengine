    
      This randomized, double-blind, study is designed to compare the effect of orticumab against
      placebo in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis and cardiometabolic risk factors. A
      total of 75 subjects will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive intravenous (IV)
      infusions either of orticumab or placebo for up to 78 days.

      Participants will be enrolled into one of the two groups: active treatment or placebo.
      Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio, orticumab to placebo and receive up to 11 weeks
      of treatment.

      Planned treatments are weekly x 4 , then monthly x 2 . The Internal Safety Review Committee
      (ISRC) will review the blinded safety data after the first subject completes the first dose
      (Day 1), the first five subjects complete the first dose (Day 1), and the first ten subjects
      complete the first dose (Day 1). The IRSC will review all adverse reactions to all
      administered doses at these times.
