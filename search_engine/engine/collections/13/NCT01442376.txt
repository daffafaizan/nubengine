      exposure and tolerability in this age group with escalating doses of palonosetron, starting
      with 3 mcg/kg to the first three or more neonates included in the study. If this dose is
      shown to be safe and well tolerated then the following three neonates will be treated with a
      dose of 10 mcg/kg. If also this dose is safe and well tolerated, then the following three
      neonates will be treated with a dose of 20 mcg/kg. If this last dose is also shown to be safe
      and well tolerated, then all the following neonates will be randomized to the main study.
