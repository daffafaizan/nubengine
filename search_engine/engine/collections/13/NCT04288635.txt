    
      In this prospective study, the investigators will include patients admitted to the medical
      ICU of Angers University Hospital and meeting the SEPSIS-3 criteria for the definition of
      septic shock (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score > 2, hyperlactatemia > 2
      mmol/L and sepsis).

      Blood samples will be collected during the usual care of initial resuscitation and analyzed
      in the laboratory INSERM (Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale) U1232
      (University Hospital of Angers).

      Mitochondrial metabolism will be analyzed in freshly isolated PBMC and after culture for 1-3
      days, with or without the addition of selected metabolites to the cell culture medium.

      The evolution of ketogenesis, mitochondrial function, acidobasic status will be assessed
      across the time (blood samples at day 2 and 4).

      Survival, renal and liver metabolism, severity scores and outcomes and the need for
      supportive care in the intensive care unit (ICU) until 28 days after admission will be
      recorded.
