    
      Objective: To compare the effect of a community-based health-social partnership program with
      usual care for discharged community-dwelling non-frail older adults on their health-related
      quality of life, activities of daily living, depressive symptoms, and use of health services.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial. Participants: Discharged community-dwelling non-frail
      older adults from an emergency medical ward in an intervention (n=37) and a control (n=38)
      group.

      Interventions: Discharged older adults were randomized to receive usual care or complex
      interventions, including structured assessment, health education, goal empowerment, and care
      coordination supported by a health-social team.

      Main measures: The outcomes were measured at pre-intervention (T1) and at three months
      post-intervention (T2) using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short Form, the Modified
      Barthel Index and the Geriatric Depression Scale.
