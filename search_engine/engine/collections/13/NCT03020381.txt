    
      This longitudinal cohort study started in 2007 and is aiming to assess 400 older persons (60
      y/o to 85 y/o) at risk of development cognitive impairment and dementia, during a 15 year of
      follow-up. The follow-up period was selected in order to cover the potential progression to
      dementia of at least two-third of the participants. For the first five years of follow up,
      assessments are conducted at baseline and every 6 months; after the visit at 60 months,
      participants will then be followed once a year for 10 years. The six months period between
      assessments during the first 5 years was selected since it is the minimum time required for
      detecting significant changes between assessments in cognitive measurements and for avoiding
      testing learning effects. If changes are not noted within the first five years, then the
      annual follow-up period will provide sufficient time periods to detect significant changes in
      cognition, gait, and balance measures.

      Blood test for genotyping (ApoE4 carrier) is being performed only at baseline assessments.
      Cognitive, gait and balance assessments are being performed in all visits. 3Tesla Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (structural and functional -resting state-) and MRI spectroscopy are being
      performed at four different time points: at baseline, month 18 and month 36, and month 60,
      following the Canadian Dementia Imaging protocol (http://www.cdip-pcid.ca.) Blood and brain
      imaging were adedd after the second wave of the study, in 2010.
