      I. To conduct a phase I, dose escalation trial with a primary objective of establishing the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effects of radiation therapy (RT), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and
      PLX3397 (at its MTD) on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the prostate biopsy after
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397.

      Patients receive multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) for 6 months, undergo radiation therapy for 2 months daily (Monday-Friday) beginning at
      month 3, and undergo ADT with leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, or degarelix injections
      in any month.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 20-30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
