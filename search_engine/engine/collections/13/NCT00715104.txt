      of sipuleucel-T prior to a scheduled radical prostatectomy (RP) surgery. To assess the immune
      response following treatment with sipuleucel-T, tissue from the prostatectomy specimen will
      be compared with tissue from the core biopsy specimen obtained prior to treatment with
      sipuleucel T. Following RP, subjects will be randomized to receive either a booster infusion
      of sipuleucel T or no further treatment with sipuleucel-T (i.e., booster: no booster).
