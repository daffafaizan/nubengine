      IIB-IVA or so called locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). However, failure rate after
      treatment is still as high as 30% to 40%.

      This is a multi-center randomized controlled trial which evaluates whether adjuvant
      chemotherapy (ACT) after CCRT will improve treatment outcome comparing to CCRT alone.
