      inoperable and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), the majority will
      eventually progress after a median of 20-26 months. Standard second-line treatment with
      sunitinib has a response rate of 7%, and third-line treatment with regorafenib has a response
      rate of only 5%. More effective treatments for imatinib-refractory GIST are needed.

      This study aims to assess the efficacy of combined IDO and PD-1 inhibition with epacadostat
      (IDO inhibitor) and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) in patients with imatinib-refractory
      GIST.
