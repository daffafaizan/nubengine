      is the primary sensory nerve of the occipital region. The response to GON blockade was not
      simply dependent on the direct local anesthetic effect of the injection . The mechanism of
      action might have been via changes in brain nociceptive pathways. Another possible
      explanation for these findings is, therefore, that GON injections initiated diffuse noxious
      inhibitory controls, independent of anesthetic effect . Neurophysiological and clinical data
      suggest there is a functional connection between the sensory occipital segments and the
      trigeminal nociceptive system in humans.
