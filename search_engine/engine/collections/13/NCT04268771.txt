    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter, Phase 3 transition study in
      subjects with active RA who are eligible for the subsequent treatment course with
      US-rituximab or EU-rituximab according to the clinical judgment of the investigator.

      Subjects will then be randomized by interactive web response system (IWRS) to receive either
      two 1000 mg infusions of DRL_RI (Arm A) or US-rituximab/EU-rituximab (Arm B) on Day 1 and Day
      15.

      Subjects randomized to Arm A will receive DRL_RI and subjects randomized to Arm B will
      continue to receive either US-rituximab or EU-rituximab.

      The study will consist of a screening period (Days -14 to 0) and a double-blind period (Day 1
      to Week 12). Subjects will attend a screening visit followed by a visit at Weeks 0 (Day 1),
      2, 4, 8, and 12 after randomization

      It is planned that approximately 50 sites will be initiated for this study in up to 7
      countries (including but not restricted to United States). There has been no randomization of
      patients till date for this study.

      The study endpoints include:

      The immunogenicity endpoint is:

      â€¢ The incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), including titer and neutralizing antibodies
      (NAb).

      The primary safety endpoints are:

        -  Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events
           (SAEs).

        -  Incidence of anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and IRRs.
