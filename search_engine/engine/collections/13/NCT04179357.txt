      maintaining normal blood flow elsewhere in the circulation. Blood loss is stopped by
      formation of a hemostatic plug. The endothelium in blood vessels maintains an anticoagulant
      surface that serves to maintain blood in its fluid state, but if the blood vessel is damaged
      components of the subendothelial matrix are exposed to the blood. Several of these components
      activate the two main processes of hemostasis to initiate formation of a blood clot, composed
      primarily of platelets and fibrin.

      Many critically ill patients develop hemostatic abnormalities, ranging from isolated
      thrombocytopenia to complex defects, such as DIC. Coagulation abnormalities are commonly
      found in critically ill patients. Prompt and proper identification of the underlying cause of
      these coagulation abnormalities is required, since each coagulation disorder necessitates
      very different therapeutic management strategies.

      Management of coagulopathy The key basic management principle of all coagulopathies is that
      the decision to transfuse blood products should not be based on the results of coagulation
      tests alone, rather an individualized approach is warranted. It is imperative to synthesizes
      all the available clinical data and treat the underlying cause.

      In summary, hemostatic disorders are very common in the critically ill. Blood product support
      is frequently required, but there is only a very limited evidence-base to support its use. In
      many cases, no specific product support is required and the key management step is the
      treatment of the condition underlying the coagulopathy .
