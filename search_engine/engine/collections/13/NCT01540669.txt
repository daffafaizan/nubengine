      particularly polydextrose, on symptoms of functional constipation, the objective of this
      clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 2-week supplementation of a
      proprietary polydextrose fiber product, in a dose-ranging fashion, on whole gut transit time
      and gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with functional constipation.
