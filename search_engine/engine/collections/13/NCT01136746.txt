      to non-critically ill adult patients with hyperglycemia and without known history of diabetes
      who are admitted to non-intensive care unit (ICU) general medical hospital services.
      Basal-bolus therapy, considered the gold standard for glucose control in patients with known
      diabetes, will be compared with sliding scale insulin, a commonly used method of glucose
      control (prevailing standard practice) in hospitalized patients. In this study, basal-bolus
      therapy will consist of once-daily glargine plus lispro 3 to 4 times daily adjusted to
      achieve pre-meal capillary plasma glucose <140 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and bedtime
      capillary plasma glucose <180 mg/dL for patients who are eating [predose plasma glucose <140
      mg/dL for patients with nil per os (NPO) orders]; sliding scale insulin will be administered
      using human regular insulin 4 times daily as needed adjusted to achieve predose capillary
      plasma glucose target <140 mg/dL in patients who are eating or have NPO orders.
