      ultrasound guided PEC II field block injections. The design of the study randomly assigns the
      side of injection of the study drugs into each patient. All patients are having bilateral
      mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. Visual analog pain scores (VAS) will be recorded
      serially for both sides of the patient's chest in hopes of determining a difference in
      duration and efficacy of the two drugs. In addition to VAS scores, a subjective, binary
      question will be our primary outcome: does one side of your chest have more surgical pain
      than the other? We hope that his question, despite being entirely subjective, overcomes
      interpatient variability of numerical pain score reporting.
