      now well documented. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, accessibility to rehabilitation services
      and exercise training programs are limited. Quarantine measures can induce collateral damages
      to cardiovascular and psychological health, in particular in clinical population.
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are associated with cognitive deficits and increased risk of
      dementia later in life. Specifically for CVD, physical inactivity and excessive sedentary
      lifestyle induced by confinement decrease cardiorespiratory capacity, increase the risk of
      acute events and rehospitalization. Maintaining a minimum of physical activity during a
      health crisis is fundamental. In this context, our team has developed an innovative program
      of exercise and cognitive training at home. Considering the added benefits of combining
      cognitive training to physical exercise to further enhance health and cognition in seniors
      with CVD, this project also addresses the added benefits of a multidomain intervention
      combining a home-based physical exercise intervention with a cognitive training.
