      implanted in the same patient with multiple de novo coronary artery lesions undergoing
      elective PCI. From february 2009 to may 2009 we aim to enroll 20 patients with at least two
      de novo significant angiographic stenoses in different coronary segments who will have
      similar diameter and length. The primary end point will be the evaluation of endothelial
      dysfunction at 6 months follow-up by measuring the change in vessel diameter in 5 points of
      the stent and peri-stent site after infusion of acetylcholine.
