      I. To evaluate the efficacy of low dose radiation in the management of cutaneous mycosis
      fungoides (MF), measured as any local control for each lesion at 12 (+/- 2) weeks after the
      treatment, in patients with stage IA - IVB cutaneous MF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate complete response (CR) rates at 12 (+2) weeks and beyond. II. To evaluate the
      persistence of response (CR, partial response [PR], stable disease, or progressive disease)
      in the treated lesion beyond 12 (+2) weeks.

      III. To evaluate overall survival. IV. To evaluate progression free survival. V. To evaluate
      patient symptom relief. VI. To evaluate the toxicity of radiation to the skin. VII. To assess
      if number of previous therapies including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, topical therapy, or
      total skin radiation affects the response.

      VIII. To characterize the microbiome of mycosis fungoides patient within both the lesion and
      unaffected skin.

      IX. To characterize shifts in the microbiome that occur after radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ultra low dose radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 and 10-14 weeks, every 3
      months for 6-8 months, then every 6-12 months for up to 2 years.
