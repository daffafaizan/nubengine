      adolescents with ASD which aims to improve communication, social interaction skills, reduce
      the severity of ASD symptoms, improve the ability to empathise and adapt in a group setting.
      A large randomized controlled trial in Sweden found that adolescents who participated in
      KONTAKT demonstrated improvements in social skills, behaviour, reduced stress and improved
      overall functioning as reported by parents immediately following and at three months after
      the program. However, social skills are at least in part influenced by social cultural
      contexts and there is a need to understand the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness
      of KONTAKT in an Australian context. Moreover, in the previous studies, the social skills
      groups were compared to treatment as usual groups. Therefore, this study evaluates the
      KONTAKT social skills group training in Australian adolescents on the autism spectrum
      compared to an active control group which is a group cooking class
