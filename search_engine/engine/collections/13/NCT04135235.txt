      insurance and is more expensive, and there are factors such as renal function damage and the
      risk factors that can not use tenofovir, it is difficult to conduct randomized controlled
      cases. The subject will select 440 cases of pregnant women with high hepatitis B virus load.
      After signing the informed consent form, according to the patient's wishes, one group will
      take the mother-infant blockade of propofol fumarate, and one group will take fumaric acid.
      In the case of maternal and child blockade of benifovir, the incidence of maternal and child
      block failure and the incidence of maternal and child adverse events were compared between
      the two groups, and propofol fumarate was used for maternal and child blockade of hepatitis
      B. The effectiveness and safety of the treatment.
