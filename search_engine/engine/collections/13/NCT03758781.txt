      Nivolumab. The IRX-2 Regimen is a 21-day regimen of cyclophosophamide on Day 1 and
      subcutaneous IRX-2 injections for 10 days between Days 4 and 18. If no dose limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment, the enrollment will
      continue in a dose expansion phase. If there is a study treatment related DLT in 1 of 6
      patients, the same dose will be investigated at the dose expansion cohorts. If study
      treatment related DLT is observed in 2 of 6 patients, accrual will be stopped and new dose
      levels or treatment sequences will be considered.
