    
      The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the usefulness of a heated lidocaine 70 mg and
      tetracaine 70 mg topical patch for the treatment of pain associated with myofascial trigger
      points. The study will consist of a 2-week, open-label treatment period followed by a 2 week
      follow-up period conducted at a single study site. Eligible patients must have a clinical
      diagnosis of pain (minimum 1-month duration) associated with up to 3 identifiable myofascial
      trigger points. A number of efficacy variables will be employed to evaluate their utility for
      assessing painful responses in this population.
