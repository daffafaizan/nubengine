      resident /PWID population.

      In the secondary aim the HCV positive subjects are randomised to traditional referral pathway
      (HCV positive cases attend primary care facilities to get referral to specialist clinic in
      hospital) and 'direct' open access where the HCV positive cases has direct open access to
      specialist clinic as above (by passing primary care physicians). We observe the no. of
      subjects being linkage to specialist care, and HCV treatment
