      care unit PICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 2018 to December 2019.
      Children who had positive cultures for any Enterobacteriaceae species before their admission
      will be excluded. Children with a PICU length of day less than 48h will also be excluded.
      According to their clinical cultures results, they will be divided into non-CRE„ÄÅCRE
      colonization and CRE infection. CRE was defined according to the 2015 Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) definition as an isolate resistant to imipenem, meropenem, or
      ertapenem. Clinical and demographic data will be collected from the electronic health record.
