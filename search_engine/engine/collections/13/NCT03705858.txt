      has demonstrated significant tumor effects in AML. Because therapy is selectively targeted to
      leukemic blasts, it has the potential advantage of less extramedullary toxicity than
      conventional systemic agents. Moreover, the unique radiobiological features of α particle
      emissions may permit more efficient tumor cell kill with greater specificity than treatment
      with β particle-emitting radioisotopes. Objective responses in AML following treatment with
      225Ac-lintuzumab have been seen in cytoreduced disease, either following chemotherapy or
      using a fractionated dosing scheme.

      The presence of MRD detectable by cytogenetic techniques and flow cytometric assays indicates
      a high risk of relapse for AML patients, despite achieving a clinical complete remission. The
      high linear energy and short range of α emissions make them ideally suited to eradicate MRD,
      as suggested by the clinical responses observed in earlier studies. To date, 225Ac-lintuzumab
      has only been studied in patients with overt leukemia. The aim of this phase 1 study is to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 225Ac-lintuzumab that can be given safely to AML
      patients in the postremission setting in order to eliminate detectable MRD and ultimately
      prolong PFS and OS.
