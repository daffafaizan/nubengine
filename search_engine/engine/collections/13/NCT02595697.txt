      model that has been demonstrated to be effective with other populations.

      The J-EMT communication intervention is tailored to the specific social communication
      characteristics of children with ASD and is delivered during a critical period in early
      communication development for these children.

      In this study, the investigators compare this blended intervention (J-EMT) to a business as
      usual (BAU) comparison group. Children assigned to the J-EMT group will receive a total of
      48, 1-hour direct intervention sessions over six months that will include teaching their
      parents to implement J-EMT procedures across daily activities.

      The investigators will examine social communication and child vocalizations, expressive and
      receptive language, symbolic play, and symbol-infused joint engagement to determine whether
      J-EMT changes both a primary functional outcome and the underlying specific skills that
      contribute to effective social communication in children with ASD.

      Results from this study will indicate the efficacy of this variation of
      parent-plus-therapist-implemented EMT (i.e., J-EMT) specifically tailored to the
      characteristics of young children with ASD.
