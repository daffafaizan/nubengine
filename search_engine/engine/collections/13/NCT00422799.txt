    
      -  Participants will receive 6 cycles of the study treatment with bortezomib and rituximab.
           Each cycle is 28 days long (4 weeks).

        -  Participants will receive Rituximab intravenously once a week for the first and fourth
           cycles only. Participants will receive bortezomib once a week for three weeks on and one
           week off every cycle, for a total of 6 cycles.

        -  During the rituximab infusion, the participants blood pressure and pulse will be
           monitored frequently. The rate of infusion may be decreased depending upon the side
           effects that are experienced.

        -  Blood samples will be collected before the first dose and on follow up with every cycle.
           Blood counts will also be performed every week.

        -  Routine physical exams will be performed at each evaluation. A PET/CAT scan of the
           chest, abdomen and pelvis at the end of treatment. This scan is required to assess the
           response of the participants disease.

        -  In order to learn more on how bortezomib and rituximab affect WM, a bone marrow biopsy
           will be performed.

        -  We anticipate that participants will complete the active therapy over a period of 6
           cycles provided that they are benefiting from therapy and have not had any serious side
           effects. The participant will be followed every three months for 2 years for office
           visits and laboratory tests.
