      cohorts of patients with H-TAD with and without mutations in known H-TAD genes, define the
      phenotype associated with these genes, determine genetic and environmental modifiers and
      other biomarkers of H-TAD, as well as rapidly and efficiently identify novel genes.
      Recruitment of large numbers of patients world-wide will improve the precision of data used
      to predict disease risks. Retrospective and prospective study designs will be used to fully
      characterize the different stages of H-TAD (i.e. susceptibility, presymptomatic, and
      symptomatic) and other complications associated with the H-TAD genes, and examine clinical
      and environmental factors that define risk of aortic dissections. The data from MAC will
      provide the critical clinical information for precise management of thoracic aortic disease
      and other complications caused by mutations of these genes and improve the medical management
      and outcome of patients with genetically triggered, lethal vascular diseases.
