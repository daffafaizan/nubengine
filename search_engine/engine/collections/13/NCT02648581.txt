    
      BehcÌ§et disease (BD) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder at the crossroad between
      autoimmune and autoinflammatory syndromes. Two recent large genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS) conducted in Turkey and Japan reported association between single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-23R/IL-12RB2 genes and BD. Interleukin-12
      and interleukin-23, cytokines that induce naive CD4+ lymphocytes to differentiate into type 1
      helper T cells (Th1 cells) and type 17 helper T cells (Th17 cells), respectively, have been
      identified as key mediators of BD. Promotion of Th1 and Th17 responses and suppression of
      regulatory T cells correlate with BD activity.

      Due to the lack of an etiologic agent, the treatment is symptomatic without consensus. The
      goals are the functional recovery of a visceral involvement (eye, central nervous system) and
      prevention of relapse(s). The risks of BD are an increased mortality especially in case of
      arterial involvement, and a high morbidity due to the cumulative sequelae of ocular and
      neurological involvement. Steroids are the corner stone of the antiinflammatory agents
      administered topically or systemically. Relapses are frequently seen after discontinuation of
      steroids, and corticodependence is frequently observed leading to the use of
      immunosuppressive drugs.

      Biologic agents that selectively block steps in the inflammatory cascade could provide
      additional therapies for BD.
