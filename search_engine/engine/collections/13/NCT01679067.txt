      ART in HIV-1 infected 'late presenters'. The investigator further wants to investigate the
      longitudinal dynamics of the innate and adaptive immunity restoration in the GALT and
      peripheral blood of HIV infected patients under ART. In particular the investigators want to
      longitudinally assess DCs, NK-cells, CD4+ T-cells und CD45RO+-T-cells as well as the levels
      of IFNγ, IFNα, TNFα, and IL-12 in the GALT and peripheral blood by flow cytometry and by
      real-time PCR and correlate these data with laboratory and clinical parameters.

      The investigators expect that this longitudinal study and experiments outlined in the
      protocol will provide valuable information about several important issues of the clinical
      outcome of patients under ART as well as understanding immunopathology during HIV-infection.
