        -  Determine the incidence and timing of ovarian dysfunction/damage in younger
           premenopausal women undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer.

        -  Determine the feasibility of a prospective, randomized study to assess if gonadotropin
           analogues can protect the ovary from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the number of patients required for adequate power to test the hypothesis.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, prospective study.

      Patients undergo a transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound to measure the ovarian volume
      and count the number of antral follicles at baseline, 3 months after beginning cytotoxic
      chemotherapy, and at 6 months after completion of treatment. Patients undergo blood
      collection at the same time points for follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, and inhibin B
      levels. Patients are also asked to fill out questionnaires on estrogen-depletion symptoms at
      those times. Patients also keep a calendar of menstrual bleeding and hormonal medications.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study.
