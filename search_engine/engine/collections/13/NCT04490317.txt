      the study is to evaluate therapeutic effects of various treatments, including hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy (HBO), therapeutic hypothermia (TH), and additional drugs, and short and
      long-term outcomes, such as neurocognitive sequelae or mortality, in CO poisoned patients. In
      addition, complications of brain and heart susceptible to CO are investigated through a
      variety of ways, such as magnetic resonance image (MRI), computed tomography (CT),
      ultrasound, and laboratory test, and the association between various complications and the
      patient's prognosis is also investigated. All subjects will be regularly monitored by
      physicians participating in this study.
