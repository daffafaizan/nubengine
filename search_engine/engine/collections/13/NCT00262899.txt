        -  Compare the impact of rapid genetic counseling (RGC) vs usual care on the medical
           decisions of women with newly diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I-IIIA breast
           cancer.

        -  Compare the impact of these interventions on the quality of life and psychological well
           being of these patients.

        -  Determine baseline factors that predict who is most and least likely to benefit from RGC
           in patients undergoing these interventions.

        -  Compare the cost per quality adjusted life year saved from a societal perspective in
           patients undergoing these interventions.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating site. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 interventional arms.

        -  Arm I (rapid genetic counseling): Patients undergo a 1Â½ hour genetic counseling session
           either in person or by telephone. Patients who undergo telephone counseling receive a
           booklet of visual aids and educational materials. Patient preferences and values are
           assessed immediately after counseling. Some patients may undergo BRCA1/2 status
           determination. Patients undergo follow-up telephone interviews at 1, 6, and 12 months.

        -  Arm II (usual care): Patients receive a packet of breast cancer treatment educational
           materials. Patient preferences and values are assessed 2 weeks later. Patients undergo
           follow-up telephone interviews as in arm I.

      In both arms, quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 months.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients will be accrued for this study.
