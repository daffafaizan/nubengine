      of surgery) and randomized on a one-on-one basis to (1) a supervised therapeutic exercise
      program for the neck and shoulder (serving as standard care) or (2) a combined therapeutic
      and lower body resistance exercise program. The randomization sequence will be generated by
      staff in the Rehabilitation Research Centre at Corbett Hall and placed in sealed opaque
      envelopes.

      The exercise program will be offered in a group setting. Participants will exercise 2 times
      per week for a 10-week session and will have the option to continue for an additional 10-week
      maintenance session. The primary outcome for the study will be quality of life as measured by
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue Scale at 12-weeks.

      At each measurement point following the baseline assessment, including the 12-week and
      24-week and one year follow-ups, an Independent Assessor will perform the objective fitness
      measurements. The Independent Assessor will also administer the Neck Dissection Impairment
      Questionnaire and the FACT-Fatigue quality of life questionnaires. The Physical Activity
      Adherence Diary will be collected by a Research Coordinator at each follow-up visit.
