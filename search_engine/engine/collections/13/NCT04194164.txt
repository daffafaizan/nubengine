      those patients who are identified to have large fluid weight gains, as defined by a greater
      than 4% increase in interdialytic weight.

      There will be two parts to the full scale trial. In the first part of the full scale study,
      denoted as the active phase, which will last for two months, study participants will be
      encouraged to use the app on a daily basis and will meet with the study coordinator on weeks
      1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 to further assist the participant in decreasing fluid intake between
      dialysis sessions. In the second portion of the study, denoted as the passive phase, which
      will last for six months, the patient will use the app and meet with the study coordinator
      only when requested by the patient. The number of these sessions will be recorded. At the end
      of the six month passive phase, the participant will meet for the last time with the study
      coordinator. During each study visit, subjects will be asked to transfer the data from the
      App to the study coordinator via the data export function of the app.
