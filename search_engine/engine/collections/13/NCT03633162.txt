      have found that through placental material exchange, mammals may transfer maternal
      immune-related factors vertically, thus promoting the protection of "non-heredited maternal
      antigenic traits". Thus, the transmission of reproductive information across generations is
      realized. Since the unusual genetic pattern of the X chromosome, grandmother's influence may
      be gender specific. Since grandchildren were usually took care by grandparents in China, it
      could be achievable to attach and recruit maternal grandmother together with mother and
      children. Cohort including three generations of women is rare in Asia at present. In the
      MGBIG, extensive information including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, history of
      diseases, mental health, and behaviors is collected from the participants. Longitudinal
      follow up and surveillance of common chronic diseases are also to be conducted. The MGBIG
      intends to recruit maternal grandmothers to study the effects of maternal genetic and
      environmental exposure on the health of their children and grandchildren.
