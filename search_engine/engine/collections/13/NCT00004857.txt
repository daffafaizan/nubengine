      stage I, II, III, or IV B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia when treated with fludarabine
      induction followed by alemtuzumab consolidation. II. Determine the infectious toxic effects
      and feasibility of this regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the
      treatment-related toxic effects, including infection and injection site reactions, of
      subcutaneous vs intravenous alemtuzumab in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine
      the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine
      the immunologic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes 5 days a week. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression. Patients undergo clinical
      staging after completion of course 4 of fludarabine followed by 2 months of observation.
      Patients with stable or responding disease receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously 3 days a week
      for 6 weeks. Patients undergo clinical staging again after completion of 6 weeks of
      alemtuzumab followed by 2 more months of observation. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 1 year and then every 6 months for 8 years.
