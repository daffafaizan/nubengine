      of surgeries predicted to climb as the population there, as well as around the world, ages.
      Currently, phacoemulsification alone is the conventional cataract surgery. The femtosecond
      laser-assisted cataract surgery has to be compared with the standard process to provide
      information on how it could benefit the patient population treated every year for cataract
      surgery. This economic study has received a grant from the French Ministry of Health to
      evaluate the economic impact of femtosecond laser-assisted process for the French healthcare
      system. For this goal, this prospective, randomized, parallel, multicenter and simple blind
      study will determine the incremental cost/effectiveness ratio for femtosecond laser-assisted
      process versus phacoemulsification surgery. Visual acuity results and intraoperative or
      postoperative complication rate will be compared between both groups. The learning curve of
      the femtosecond laser assisted cataract surgery will be also evaluated for each surgeon
      involved in the study.

      Ethic and regulatory autority authorisations were obtained at 19/Dec/2012 and 15/Feb/2013,
      respectively. Date of first inclusion: 9/Oct/2013. Date of first NCT release: 13/Nov/2013. 30
      patients were included between this period. French regulatory process dos not require NCT
      registration before first inclusion.
