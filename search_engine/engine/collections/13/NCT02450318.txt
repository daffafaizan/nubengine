      this study is to examine the acute effect of exercise on vascular function in women with
      nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Endothelium-dependent and -independent dilation,
      arterial stiffness and wave reflection will be measured at baseline and after walking on a
      treadmill at a slow pace for 47 minutes. Endothelium-dependent dilation will be measured
      using brachial artery flow-mediated dilation via high resolution ultrasonography.
      Endothelium-independent dilation will be measured using brachial artery dilation to
      sublingual nitroglycerin. Arterial stiffness and wave reflection will measured using
      applanation tonometry.
