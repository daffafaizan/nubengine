    
      This is a randomized waitlist-controlled trial of 60 participants examining the effects of a
      proposed competency-based model on self-harm relative to those of OSW alone. In the online
      survey (T0), subjects with self-harm or suicidal ideation will be invited to give informed
      consent, and then be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) OSW (control), or 2) OSW +
      six weekly sessions of competency-based physical training (intervention). They will be
      assessed at three measurement time points (T1 = one-month; T2 = three-month; and T3 =
      five-month from T0 at post-intervention). The intervention group is hypothesized to display a
      greater reduction in the primary outcomes of self-harm and suicidal ideation than the OSW
      group. Chi-square tests giving p <=0.05 will indicate a goodness of fit of the linear mixed
      model, which address random effects in the data and handles intention-to-treat (ITT).
