      be enough to successfully perform a axillary plexus block.

      Three hundred and twenty patients undergoing elective hand surgery under axillary brachial
      plexus block will be enrolled into this prospective, randomized, observer-blinded non
      inferiority trial. Using a computer-generated sequence of random numbers and sealed envelope
      technique, the patients included will randomly be allocated to receive either single or
      double injection ultrasound-guided axillary block. The block will be performed with the
      in-plane technique using a 22 gauge, 50 mm needle and a high frequency linear probe.

      In the 2 injection group, the needle will initially be advanced toward musculocutaneous nerve
      and 7 ml of LA (lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5µg/ml) will be deposited around the nerve.
      The needle will be then advanced until the tip will be positioned just dorsal to the artery
      and 28 ml of (lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5µg/ml) will be deposited in this location. In
      the single injection group using the same LA, and 35 ml will be deposited dorsal the artery.
