      diet (GFD). Follow-up monitoring of the improvement of patients on GFD is essential to assess
      symptomatic recovery and to monitor complications, as well as to assist patients with dietary
      compliance. However, practical methods to monitor diet compliance and to detect the origin of
      an outbreak of celiac clinical symptoms are not available.

      In this study, we have overcome these challenges and shown the feasibility of measuring
      gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in urine samples in healthy and celiac individuals by solid
      phase extraction and estimating the peptide concentrations with a reader of anti-GIP moAb
      immunochromatographic strips (IC-strips).
