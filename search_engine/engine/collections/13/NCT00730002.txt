      We plan with this study to obtain pilot data to support a larger grant application which will
      evaluate whether any of three types of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (known as MR
      Spectroscopy [MRS], MR Perfusion Imaging, and MR Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]) can detect
      alterations in brain function distinctive for Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
      (NPSLE), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and compare our findings to those found in an
      existing cohort of 20 normal healthy controls. Because this study is being done on a
      3T(tesla)scanner (3T(tesla) Achieva(Model name), Philips Medical Systems) and our previous
      group of healthy controls was assessed using a 1.5 T(tesla) scanner (LX EchoSpeed, General
      Electric(GE) Medical Systems), we propose to re-consent 10 of the previous 20 healthy
      controls and re-collect imaging data on the 3T(tesla) scanner in order to confirm that our
      previously-collected data from the group of 20 healthy controls is still valid. This will
      confirm that the change of field strength and manufacturer does not affect data validity.

      Recruiting Update as of March/2009: Enrollment is completed for Study Arms 1 and 2.

      This study is only being conducted in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Travel reimbursement does not
      include hotel accommodations or air fare to and from Ann arbor, Michigan.
