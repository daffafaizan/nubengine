      (MOs) are healthcare visits during which a patient is eligible, but does not receive a
      vaccine. MOs for vaccination contribute strongly to low HPV vaccination rates. This cluster
      randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of a bundled
      intervention training providers first in HPV vaccine communication skills (done through
      online educational modules and live office practice sessions), with the addition of
      performance feedback reports (that pull from electronic health record (EHR) data, and compare
      participants' performance to their own previous performance and performance of others)
      followed by the addition of provider prompts (via EHR and also office staff prompts, e.g.,
      placing Vaccine Information Statements (VISs) on desk) to reduce MOs and increase HPV
      vaccination rates. Throughout the intervention participants will also receive weekly text
      message mini-lessons that will remind participants of the project.
