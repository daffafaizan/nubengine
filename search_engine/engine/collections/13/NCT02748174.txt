      smartphone. They consist of breathing techniques, imaging, progressive relaxation, and more.
      Patients will be asked to perform 20 minutes of relaxation therapy at least 3 times a week.
      Patients will record their headache frequency and intensity, in addition to other symptoms,
      and the frequency of practicing the behavioral therapy using Curelator Headache. ™ Curelator
      Inc. (Cambridge USA) has developed a proprietary, non-pharmaceutical, digital platform,
      called Curelator Headache,™ to collect daily data, identify trigger-attack associations and
      propose 'tests' of trigger modification.

      The Curelator approach requires high quality data from the individual, entered on a daily
      basis. Compliance is expected to be enhanced because the study if being offered by the
      individual's healthcare provider.

      This a pilot study of an initial 90 days use of a digital platform to identify potential
      migraine protective factors (Curelator Headache™) in subjects with physician-diagnosed
      episodic or chronic migraine or post-concussive headache. Subjects are recruited to Curelator
      Headache use by a physician and enter data each day. The baseline period (90 days) is
      followed by a test period (90 days) during which, under Curelator guidance, subjects make one
      or more modifications to their behaviors based on the data from the 90 day period.

      The study will include up to 100 patients with chronic or episodic migraine and 75 patients
      with postconcussive headache. At clinics, investigators will offer participation to
      consecutive migraine patients with 6-20 headache days a month and to consecutive concussion
      patients complaining of headache more than 1 month post concussive event.
