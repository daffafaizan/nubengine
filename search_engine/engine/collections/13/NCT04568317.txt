      period. Participants who have indicated consent will be randomised in two arms: iCBT
      intervention - treatment as usual (n=35) and iCBT intervention with smartwatch (n=35).
      Participants in the smartwatch group will be lent a smartwatch for the duration of treatment,
      with an app allowing them to monitor their mood in the moment, and keep track of their daily
      sleep and activity level. All participants will be asked to complete an acceptance
      questionnaire regarding the technology at three time points: before first use, at 3 weeks,
      and 8 weeks. This study will contribute to the growing literature on acceptance of technology
      supporting mental health interventions worldwide. The results may help to establish criteria
      for patient acceptance of the smartwatch technology as a treatment enhancer in the context of
      mental health interventions.
