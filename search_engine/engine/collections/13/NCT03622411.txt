      an add-on to conventional aphasia therapy (= high intensive) compared to conventional aphasia
      therapy (either alone, or in combination with recreational tablet use (= low intensive) in
      patients with aphasia following stroke, as measured by specific linguistic tests, within task
      improvements, functional communication and quality of life.

      Furthermore, the investigators want to learn more about the recovery of specific underlying
      language processes via event-related potentials (ERPs). At last, the investigators aim to
      explore whether patients with aphasia are satisfied with a tablet-based aphasia therapy,
      whether the app is user-friendly and which barriers the participants might have encountered.
