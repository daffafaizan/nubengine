      required by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) as a condition of product approval
      according to Regulation on Medical Device Re-examination. The designated re-examination
      period is seven years after the approval date (06 Dec 2013 ~ 05 Dec 2020). All patients who
      require treatment of a commercially available HVAD System for approved indications between
      the designated re-examination period at a participating PSR site are eligible for enrollment.
      All enrolled patients will be followed until patient death, transplant, explant (where
      applicable), or the end of the study, on 05 Dec 2020.
