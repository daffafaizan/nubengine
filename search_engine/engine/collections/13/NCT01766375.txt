    
      This study was a multi-center, open, randomized-control study. It evaluates the effects and
      safety of idarubicin 60mg/M2 combined with BUCY pretreatment program or BUCY pretreatment
      program on acute myeloid leukemia patient in high-risk group. 200 patients were studied with
      100 patients in each group.

      Patients enrolled were randomly divided into group A (idarubicin 60mg/M2 combined with BUCY
      group) and group B (BUCY group). SAS randomization software was used to obtain randomization
      numbers. Patients were recommend to start pretreatment within 7 days after randomization.

      Main objective: 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates.

      Secondary objective: safety evaluation (early complications of transplantation, liver, kidney
      and heart toxicity, treatment-related mortality, blood recovery time), the median period of
      disease-free survival.

      Test drugs Idarubicin (Zavedos Â®, Pfizer), busulfan, cyclophosphamide.

      Pretreatment plan Drug Group A (IDA 60mg/M2 + BUCY) Group B (BUCY) IDA: 20mg/m2 a day, d-12
      ~d-10, intravenous infusion for 1 hour. BU: 4mg/Kg a day, oral administration, d-7 ~d-4, or
      3.2mg/Kg a day, intravenous infusion, d-7~d-4.

      CY: 60mg/Kg a day, intravenous infusion, d-3~d-2. GVHD prevention plan GVHD is prevented by
      CSA+MMF+MTX in sibling allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (starting from day
      -1, 3mg/kg of CSA was infused by continuous intravenous drip until gastrointestinal function
      returned normal when method of administration was changed to oral administration. 5mg/kg was
      divided into twice oral intakes, maintaining cyclosporine concentration at 200-300ug / L; MTX
      15mg/m2 at day +1, 10mg/m2 at day +3, +6 and day +11 (based on actual situations day 11 can
      be omitted); MMF 0.25g BID starting from day 0 and continued for a month ). Unrelated
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation used CSA MMF MTX ATG for the prevention of
      GVHD. 3mg/kg CSA was infused through continuous intravenous drip since day -1 until
      gastrointestinal function returned to normal when the administration method was changed to
      oral. 5mg/kg was divided to twice oral intakes maintaining cyclosporine concentrations at
      200-300ug/L; MTX 15mg/m2, at day +1, 10mg/m2 at day +3, day +6 and day +11 (based on actual
      situations day 11 can be omitted); MMF 0.5g BID starting from day 0 and continued for 3
      months (a month later, dose can be reduced according to the hemogram); the total ATG was
      6mg/kg and was taken in three days, from day -4 to day -2.

      Relapse intervention Routine preventive DLI is not recommended, however, if tendency of
      recurrence found during monitor, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, secondary
      transplantation, etc. can be used, and intervention treatment start time should be recorded
      as the end time.

      The efficacy evaluation time point

        1. 1-3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months after transplantation.

        2. Follow-up evaluation: indicators such as blood routines and bone marrow detection, and
           minimal residual disease detection after the end of treatment should be done regularly.
