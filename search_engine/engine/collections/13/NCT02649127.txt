      disorder (PTSD). The most effective treatment for PTSD is exposure therapy where, under the
      supervision of a trained therapist, individuals are exposed to prolonged and repeated
      imagined images of the trauma until the images no longer cause severe anxiety. Various forms
      of exercise have been used to treat a broad range of depression and anxiety disorders and
      exercise has been used with some success to treat individuals with PTSD. Considering the
      population of otherwise healthy and physically active Service Members suffering from symptoms
      of PTSD, it seems possible that exercise might serve as an outlet for the emotional reactions
      experienced during therapy, decreasing emotional distress, and increasing the individual's
      tolerance to imaginal exposure serving as a powerful adjunct to exposure therapy. The purpose
      of this study to explore the role of exercise in the treatment of symptoms of posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), specifically determining if the efficacy of imaginal exercises, part
      of exposure therapy for PTSD, can be improved by augmenting the therapy with aerobic
      exercise. Towards this end, this 8-week experimental, repeated-measures clinical trial will
      randomize 120 Service Members with symptoms of PTSD into one of four groups: 1) imaginal
      exercises of exposure therapy only, 2) aerobic exercise only, 3) imaginal exercises augmented
      with aerobic exercise, or 4) self-care.
