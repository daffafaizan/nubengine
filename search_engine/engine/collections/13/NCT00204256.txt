    
      This is a randomized, open label, phase IV study in anemic predialysis patients (Hb between 8
      and 11.5 g/dl) who require iron supplementation. The duration of the study for each patient
      will be approximately 6 months. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms and
      admitted to the anemia correction phase (days 1-43). Treatment will be intravenous iron
      sucrose alone versus iron sucrose plus rhEPO. The main treatment evaluation will at the end
      of the correction phase: The primary end-point will be the change of hemoglobin during
      correction phase. Secondary end-points will be the change of ferritin and transferrin
      saturation from baseline to day 43. Safety assessments will include recording of adverse
      events, vital signs, physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests. Incidence and
      severity of adverse events will be compared between the two different treatment arms.
