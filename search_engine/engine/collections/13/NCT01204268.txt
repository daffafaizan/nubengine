      preconditioning on the patients underwent intracranial aneurysm surgery. The patients with
      cerebral aneurysm will be recruited in current study. The sevoflurane preconditioning will be
      performed before the surgical procedure. The neurological injury biomarkers, such as S-100b
      and NSE will be detected. The neurological function and recovery will be assessed after the
      surgery.
