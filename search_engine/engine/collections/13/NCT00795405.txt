      and trigger acute myocardial infarction. The mechanisms for this association are unknown. To
      date, there have been no controlled exposures in patients with coronary heart disease: an
      important population who may be particularly susceptible to the adverse cardiovascular
      effects of sporting events.

      In a randomized crossover controlled study, 38 patients with prior myocardial infarction will
      be exposed to sporting events or not. Myocardial ischemia will be quantified by ST-segment
      analysis using continuous 12-lead electrocardiography, and blood pressure change will be
      analyzed using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Autonomic function will be assessed by
      heart rate variability. Ischemic, inflammatory and prothrombotic markers will also be
      measured.
