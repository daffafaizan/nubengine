      receive treatment once daily for 20 days. Safety will be assessed by monitoring AEs, lesion
      site reactions, vital signs, hematology, and blood chemistry parameters.

      Complete cure of ulcerated lesions is defined as 100% re-epithelialization or a measurement
      of ulceration of 0 x 0 mm. non-ulcerated treated lesions will also be measured to monitor
      total area of exposure of lesions to study drug and will be evaluated for cure (the absence
      of raised area on the skin).

      Follow-up evaluations will be at 28 +2 days, 60 +7 days and 100 +14 days.
