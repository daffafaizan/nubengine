    
      To add to the existing NAFLD Database an additional 1,500 adult participants with a diagnosis
      of NAFLD, supported by a recent liver biopsy, with a broad range of severity. Core data
      collection will include clinical, demographic, laboratory, imaging, and histological features

        -  To increase the population diversity of the NAFLD Database to provide greater
           representation of Hispanic, Native American, African American, and Asian patients among
           the new adult participants recruited into the NAFLD Database 2

        -  To expand the current specimen bank comprised of liver tissue, serum, plasma, and DNA
           obtained from new participants and continuing participants undergoing repeat liver
           biopsy with the specific goal of optimizing the collection of plasma or serum suitable
           for biomarker development studies by obtaining specimens in close temporal proximity to
           the performance of liver biopsy
