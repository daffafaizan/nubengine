    
      Single-institution retrospective analysis of consecutive prostate cancer patients after
      definitive primary treatment, without local recurrence, presenting with isolated or limited
      lymph node (LN) recurrence (1-3 lesions) on F-Ccholine PET-CT (CholPET) treated with SBRT
      between January 2010 and July 2015.

      Endpoints of interest are biochemical response rate (defined as a reduction by at least 10%
      of the initial PSA value), time to biochemical recurrence (TBR) (defined as the time interval
      from SBRT until second PSA rise), and time interval between SBRT and ADT start. Univariate
      analysis is used to identify prognostic factors.
