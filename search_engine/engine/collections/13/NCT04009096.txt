    
      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the CCVTM, Oxford.

      There will be two groups vaccinated in the trial, with an optional third group included if
      fewer than 6 volunteers complete group 2. Up to 19 volunteers will be included in total.
      These will be compared to a matched number of infectivity controls, receiving no vaccination,
      who will be recruited as part of a separate study (VAC069 - NCT03797989).
