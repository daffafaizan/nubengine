    
      The objective of this study is to investigate the following research questions in a
      cross-sectional survey of Swedish AF patients being treated either with a VKA or with a NOAC:

        -  Which attributes of a medication to prevent stroke do AF patients view as important?

        -  Do AF patients have a preference regarding the attributes of the medication options VKA
           or NOAC and, in case of NOACs, with regards to rivaroxaban attributes?

        -  Are there subgroups of AF patients whose preference for one of the medication options
           appears above or below average?

        -  What is the quality of life of Swedish AF patients? Are there subgroups with differences
           in their quality of life (for example: subgroups of patients with different CHA2DS2-VASc
           scores)?

        -  Which burden do Swedish AF patients experience in association with their anticoagulation
           therapy? Are there differences in the burden of treatment (ACTS) between patients
           treated with VKA or with NOACs?
