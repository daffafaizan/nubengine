      need to identify new agents that can be incorporated with current therapies to improve
      prognosis. The vinca alkaloids are effective broad-spectrum anti-leukemic drugs. Microtubules
      are a major structural component of cells. They play a role in cell shape, cellular polarity,
      cellular movement, intracellular transport and the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.
      The cellular microtubule dynamics are highly regulated. As cells enter mitosis, the
      interphase microtubules disappear and are replaced with a new network of microtubules that
      interact with the mitotic spindle. Disruption of these new microtubules leads to cell cycle
      arrest. These important and highly labile microtubule arrays comprising the mitotic spindle
      are the principal target of oncologic antimitotic compounds. Known antimitotic agents fall
      into three classes, the vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, and vinorelbine), taxanes
      (paclitaxel and docetaxel), and colchicine-site binders. There are no colchicine-site agents
      currently approved for cancer chemotherapy. These three classes of compounds have distinct
      binding sites on the tubulin subunits. ABT-751 is a novel orally administered antimitotic
      agent that binds to the colchicine site on beta-tubulin and inhibits polymerization of
      microtubules.
