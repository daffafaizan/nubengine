      level of function. the process of gaining this history is often done by several different
      people with no standard questions asked.

      There is also a need to be able to measure what happens to patients after they leave ICU, and
      compare their abilities to preadmission status.

      This feasibility study will aim to investigate:

        -  the time taken to train the physiotherapy team in the use of the outcome measure

        -  the ability to obtain pre admission functional status from patients/friend/relative on
           admission to ICU

        -  the ability to follow patients up at 6 months post discharge with re-assessment of the
           outcome measure
