    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. TAK-788 administered with or without
      antidiarrheal prophylaxis is being tested to evaluate the impact of management strategies on
      gastrointestinal-related adverse events in participants with non-small cell lung cancer
      harboring EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations receiving TAK-788.

      The study will enroll approximately 90 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned in
      1:1 ratio (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-

        -  Cohort 1

        -  Cohort 2

      All participants will be asked to take TAK-788 capsules with or without a low-fat meal in
      Cohort 1 and TAK-788 capsule with antidiarrheal prophylaxis and with or without a low-fat
      meal in Cohort 2.

      This is a multi-center trial and will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 2 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      after receiving their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
