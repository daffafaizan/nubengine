      regimen to boost the immune system in order to treat AML, ALL, blast phase CML, and MDS
      relapse after allogeneic transplantation. The regimen is a step-wise use of withdrawal of
      immunosuppression, cytoreduction if needed, administration of granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and pegylated interferon (IFN) Î±-2b to patients who
      relapsed after an allogeneic transplant and will assess efficacy.

      Relapse is the major problem following allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplants.
      There is currently no standard way to treat leukemia that relapsed after transplant, and
      patients have a poor prognosis.

      A retrospective analysis of patients treated at Emory showed that administration of GM-CSF
      and interferon-alpha-2b was well-tolerated and affected long-term remissions in a small
      number of relapsed patients (after allogeneic transplant). Pre-clinical and clinical data
      from ours and other centers showed that relapsed leukemic blasts have down-regulation of
      co-stimulatory molecules and a tendency to evade the immune system. Cytokines can up-regulate
      co-stimulatory molecules on leukemic blasts and have been shown to increase the cytotoxicity
      of T-cells. This effect may be beneficial as a graft vs. leukemia effect for patients with
      relapse after allogeneic transplant.
