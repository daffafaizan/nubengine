    
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil.

      CHEMORADIATION: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD)
      over 5 days for a total of 5 fractions and concurrently receive fluorouracil intravenously
      (IV) continuously over 96 hours.

      PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 2 weeks of completing chemoradiation, patients receive
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV as a
      push followed by IV continuously over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Within 4-8 weeks of completing preoperative chemotherapy, patients undergo total
      mesorectal excision.

      POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin,
      leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every
      14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year or until removal from the study or death, whichever occurs
      first.
