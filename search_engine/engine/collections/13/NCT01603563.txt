      illnesses, injury and the death of a person close to them are at risk for developing PTSD.
      While effective treatments for childhood PTSD exist, novel interventions that are more
      accessible, efficient, and cost-effective are needed to improve access to evidence-based
      treatment. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of an
      intervention called Stepped Care Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which has the
      potential to greatly improve service delivery approaches to make treatment more accessible
      and less costly, thereby reducing childhood PTSD and related societal impacts and costs.
