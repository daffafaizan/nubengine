    
      Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain (HSP) is a common entity following stroke. It's prevalence varies
      between studies, probably because it includes many etiologies and there is no one way of
      diagnosis.

      HSP delays rehabilitation, elongates hospitalization time and reduces quality of life.

      Currently there is no one reccomended treatment for HSP. Weak transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) induces persisting excitability changes in the human motor cortex. this
      effect depends on the stimulation polarity and is specific to the site of stimulation.
      Interacting with cortical activity, by means of cortical stimulation, can improve the
      rehabilitation potential of neurologic patients. In this respect, preliminary evidence
      suggests that cortical stimulation may play a role in treating aphasia, unilateral neglect,
      and chronic pain disorders.

      In this tDCS study the investigator uses one anode and one cathode electrode placed over the
      scalp to modulate a particular area of the central nervous system (CNS). The stimulation is
      administered via the neuroConn DC.Stimulator. The DC-STIMULATOR is a
      micro-processor-controlled constant current source. The DCSTIMULATOR is a CE-certified
      medical device for conducting non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on
      people.Electrode positioning is determined according to the International EEG 10-20 System.
