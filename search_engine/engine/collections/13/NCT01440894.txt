      Investigator Team at Zhongshan City People's Hospital, No.2 Sunwen Dong Road, Zhongshan,
      Guangdong 528403, P. R. China.

      Investigator: Dr. Stephen Feng, Leader; Fan Futao, Nurse A; Wu Yanting, Nurse B.

      Contact Dr. James Zhu Tel: +86 760 88823818 Used Equipments DUT (Device Under Test): Transtek
      Glass Body Fat Analyzer, Model: GBF-733-W1, GBF-1012, BF-1039, BF-1041-A, and GBF-950-D.

      Reference Device: Transtek Glass Body Analyzer, GBF-950 (Predicate Device). Test Protocol

        1. Test Purpose:

           The aim of clinical test is to collect weight, body fat, total body water, bone mass,
           and muscle mass reading value which measured by DUT and reference device.

           Note: GBF-733-W1 and BF-1039 have not bone mass functions. So it just collects weight,
           body fat, total body water, and muscle mass data.

        2. Target Subject:

           The subject database shall contain at least 25 male and 25 female subjects and all above
           18 years old. Patient's population analysis is bellow.

        3. Test procedures 1) Record the name, age, and gender values of each subject. 2) Let
           subject seated calmly for two minutes before test, dry the feet. 3) Use device to
           measure weight, body fat, total body water, bone mass, and muscle mass; record reading
           value.

      4) For each subject, repeat 3) to get 3 pairs measurements. 5) Repeat step 1) to 4) for every
      device (DUT: GBF-733-W1, GBF-1012, BF-1039, BF-1041-A, and GBF-950-D; and reference device:
      GBF-950).

      6) Repeat step 1) to 5) for each subject. 5. Note:

        1. No motion and speaking are allowed during the measurement.

        2. All DUT use the same algorithms, have the same number of electrodes and contact the
           patient at the same body locations (feet), and operate on the same frequency.

        3. Test environment: Temperature: 22±1℃; Relative humidity: 40~50%.
