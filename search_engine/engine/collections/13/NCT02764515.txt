      clinical trial.The goal is to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of Kunxian Capsule, a
      compound of 4 ingredients of Chinese herb-derived medication, and the active comparator,
      Methotrexate for the treatment of mild to moderate active rheumatoid arthritis.This study is
      basically non-inferiority in design, so 428 subjects will be enrolled. All subjects need to
      fulfill the inclusion criteria and without exclusion criteria. Subjects are randomized into
      the Kunxian Capsule treatment group and Methotrexate treatment group.The dosage of Kunxian
      Capsule used in this study is 0.6g twice daily and the methotrexate dosage is 10mg per week.
      All subjects will take the medication for 24 weeks. Diclofenic is used as the salvage therapy
      in case patients experience joint pain. The primary end-point is the proportion of patients
      who could achieve disease remission or low disease activity treated with Kunxian Capsule and
      Methotrexate. All patients will be followed at week 2,4,12 and 24 after screening. Baseline
      information for disease activity measures such as DAS28 score,CDAI score, SDAI score, ACR20,
      ACR50, ACR70 improvement, HAQ score, patient's VAS score for pain, and lab tests such as CRP,
      ESR, RF, CCP, blood and urine routine tests, liver as well as renal function tests were
      collected and recorded. All these measures are performed at each follow-up visit except RF
      and CCP. In addition, any adverse events or withdrawal happened during each visit will be
      recorded for data analysis.
