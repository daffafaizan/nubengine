        -  Determine the distribution, degree, and intrapatient and interpatient heterogeneity of
           hypoxia, as measured by EF5 binding in tumor tissue, in patients with head and neck
           cancer.

        -  Determine the distribution and intrapatient and interpatient heterogeneity of CA9
           expression, as measured immunohistochemically, in these patients.

        -  Determine the distribution, concentration, and intrapatient and interpatient
           heterogeneity of glucose and lactate, as measured by bioluminescence imaging, in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether there is spatial coordination between concentrations of lactate and
           glucose and the location of tissue hypoxia in these patients.

        -  Determine whether there is spatial coordination between the location of CA9 with hypoxia
           and/or lactate concentrations in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive EF5 IV over 1-2.5 hours on day 1. Within 24-55 hours after EF5
      infusion, patients undergo surgery.

      Tumor tissue samples are examined for EF5 binding by immunohistochemistry, bioluminescence
      imaging, and flow cytometry.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
