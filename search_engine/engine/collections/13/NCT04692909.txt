      and functional imbalance in the mesolimbic dopaminergic brain system. This may cause symptoms
      of altered reward processing, excessive cravings for hyperpalatable food and repeated
      self-regulation failures to control food intake in this population. Specifically, the medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and deeper reward-related brain
      regions function differentially from healthy controls and similarly to individuals with
      substance or behavioral addiction. Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation of the mPFC has
      been shown efficacious in reducing cravings and other addictive symptoms in individuals with
      SUD, as well as symptoms of compulsivity in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In this
      study the investigators use deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) with an H-coil to
      safely stimulate the mPFC and deeper brain regions, in individuals with obesity and food
      addiction. The investigators aim to produce neuroplasticity favoring the restoration of mPFC
      functioning, alleviating food addiction symptoms and promoting weight loss.
