      adolescent (ages 11-15 years old) girls. Mothers will complete a three-item measure that
      assesses their baseline intentions for having their adolescent daughter vaccinated against
      HPV. Mothers will then fill out a short, computer-based survey that assesses demographic
      factors, prior experience with HPV-associated illnesses and views about a variety of
      potential barriers to HPV vaccination. Following the survey, the intervention group (40
      mothers) will receive a two-page print brochure that uses their survey data to generate the
      brochure such that it addresses each mother's top three concerns about the HPV vaccine. The
      control group (40 mothers) will receive a generic, two-page brochure that is similar in
      appearance to the intervention, but contains only untailored, generic information about the
      vaccine. HPV vaccination intention will be assessed a second time after reading the brochure,
      using the same three-item measure as before the survey. The vaccine administration records of
      the adolescent daughters of these mothers will be accessed three months after mothers'
      participation in the study to assess whether any HPV vaccine doses were provided.
