    
      A recent RCT from our group has demonstrated safety and immune response (both humoral and
      cell-mediated) of the live-attenuated Zostavax in stable SLE patients with a previous history
      of HZ or varicella infection. An important research question is whether the immunogenicity of
      the HZ vaccine in SLE patients is long-lasting. There is no information in the literature
      regarding the long-term immunogenicity and safety of the HZ vaccine, Zostavax, in SLE
      patients.

      Patients who had completed the original RCT and had been followed for 4 years since HZ
      vaccination or placebo injection were invited to participate in this extension study. Blood
      samples will be taken for a repeat assessment of the humoral and cell-mediated response to
      VZV at 4 years.

      Outcomes of interest Primary outcome Difference between the two groups in the proportion of
      patients who have a persistent and 50% increase in IgG to VZV (humoral response to Zostavax)
      at 4 years compared to baseline Secondary outcomes

        1. Difference between the two groups in the cell-mediated response to Zostavax at 4 years
           as compared to baseline

        2. Vaccine efficacy - difference in the rate of clinical HZ reactivation between two groups
           of patients at 4 years

        3. Vaccine safety - difference between the two groups in terms of SLE flares and new
           autoimmune phenomena at 4 years
