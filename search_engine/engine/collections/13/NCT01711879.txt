    
      The two arms of this study will compare current common practice (initial intravitreal
      anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) to study treatment (VEGF) injection only) for
      52 weeks.

      This single center study will consist of 20 patients with NVG. Patients will be randomized
      to:

        -  Group A: A single injection of 2mg (0.05ml) intravitreal aflibercept injection at
           baseline followed by standard of care laser with observation for a total of 52 weeks.

      or

        -  Group B: 2mg (0.05ml) intravitreal aflibercept injection at baseline followed by two
           additional injections at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, then every 8 weeks for a total of 52
           weeks.

      Clinical assessment will include pain assessment (Universal Pain Scale), best corrected
      visual acuity (ETDRS), ophthalmic examination, anterior segment assessment including number
      of clock-hours of NVI/NVA, gonioscopy, anterior segment photography, visual field test
      (Humphrey SITA- Standard 24-2), optic nerve OCT (Zeiss Cirrus Optic Disc Cube 200x200),
      macular OCT (Cube scan 512 x 128 and 5 Line Raster), fluorescein angiography (initial iris
      phase followed by standard retinal angiography), and concurrent medical/ocular medications.
      Qualitative assessment of neovascularization will be made by the investigator based on
      comparison to baseline angiography.
