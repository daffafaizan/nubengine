      procedure involves inhaling methacholine through a nebulizer attached to a dosimeter that
      delivers a precise volume of methacholine. The endpoint of the test is the provocational
      concentration that produces a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20). To standardize the procedure, the
      American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommends that the nebulizer output be calibrated to deliver
      an output of 0.9 Â± 0.09 mL/min.

      The Rosenthal Dosimeter and the KoKo Digidoser are two commonly used dosimeters. In an
      attempt to follow the ATS guideline we discovered that the nebulizer output was lower with
      the KoKo Digidoser and could not be calibrated. However, it is unclear whether the apparent
      lower output is a result of the Digidoser delivering less solution or that the ATS method of
      determining output is not applicable to this dosimeter. To answer this question, we propose
      to determine the methacholine PC20 in subjects with asthma using the two dosimeters. It is
      our hypothesis that the Digidoser delivers less methacholine and thus will produce a higher
      PC20 than the Rosenthal Dosimeter.

      Twelve nonsmoking subjects with mild asthma will be selected on the basis of > 18 years of
      age, a baseline FEV1 of > 60% predicted and a screening PC20 of < 8mg/ml. Subjects will be
      randomized to perform a methacholine challenge with the Digidoser and the Rosenthal Dosimeter
      on two different days in an unblinded, crossover manner. The geometric mean PC20 with each
      dosimeter will be compared with a paired t test. The results of this study will indicate
      whether the Digidoser has the potential of causing false negative test results or whether the
      ATS method of determining output should not be used with this dosimeter.
