      manifestation of atherosclerosis and can be considered a major cardiovascular disease with
      important morbidity and mortality, affecting also quality of life (QoL), thus representing an
      important public health concern. From a clinical point of view, PAD may be initially
      symptomatic with intermittent claudication (IC), and in critical limb ischemia (CLI), an
      advanced stage of PAD, with rest pain, and also with leg skin ulceration, a complication that
      may even lead to limb loss for amputation. From a pathophysiological point of view, in the
      presence of atherosclerosis, endothelial activation and dysfunction lead to hemodynamic
      alterations such as turbulent flow, abnormal shear stress, loss of potential energy,
      anomalies of vascular tone with functional impairment during leg exercise in early stages,
      with IC onset, and in advanced stages, during CLI stage, also with rest pain as a result of
      an important demand/perfusion mismatch. Endothelial dysfunction, and vascular tone are also
      regulated by sex hormones, and incidence and prevalence of PAD have usually been found to be
      higher in men than in women, and, more in general, males have a higher risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease during the reproductive period in comparison with females of the same
      age. This sex related difference in developing the disease was hypothesized to be related to
      the protective role of estrogens in female subjects, and harmful effects of androgens in male
      individuals. Furthermore, the androgen receptor (AR) seems to have a role in neointima
      formation, in influencing the size and the composition of atherosclerotic plaques, and also
      vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) activity. Moreover, sex-specific effects on the
      metabolic system are well-known and associated with different risk profiles for
      cardiovascular disease and they have been also related to differences in sex hormones
      activities. In fact, the insulin and IGF-I signaling is mediated by hormone interaction with
      the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) which are members of subclass II of
      the tyrosine kinase receptor super-family and they, on one hand, participate to the metabolic
      homeostasis, and on the other hand, they have a direct role on VMMCs, and also in some stages
      of the atherosclerotic process..

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of AR, IGF-IR, and IR on the arterial wall of
      male patients with PAD undergoing open revascularization surgery.
