    
      This is a study of two investigational agents called oxaliplatin and capecitabine.

      Investigational agents have not received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the
      way they are being used in this study. This means an investigation drug is still under study
      to determine what a safe dose is, what the side effects are and whether or not it is
      effective in the disease or condition being studied.

      Oxaliplatin and capecitabine are chemotherapy agents that have been approved by the FDA for
      use in other cancers.
