      computed tomography scan and color doppler imaging:

      Patients with Graves´ orbitopathy are evaluated by a complete ophthalmic examination.A
      prospective study with Multidetector CT scan and Color Doppler of these patients are made to
      develop parameters capable to predict Dysthyroid Optic Neuropathy (DON).
