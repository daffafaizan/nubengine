      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in combination with
      vorinostat patients with recurrent metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RMHNSCC)
      and recurrent metastatic salivary gland cancer (RMSGC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rates and disease control rates of the combination of
      MK-3475 and vorinostat in patients with RMHNSCC and RMSGC.

      II. Examine programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and T cell phenotype in
      archived tumor, on-treatment tumor biopsies, pre- and post-treatment blood samples and
      correlate these with clinical response to the drug combination.

      III. Determine median overall survival and progression free survival in and RMHNSCC and RMSGC
      patients enrolled in the study.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore peripheral T cell phenotype at baseline and after 3 cycles vorinostat and MK-3475.

      II. Measure expression of the proteins in the PD-1 family on baseline tumor samples and on
      treatment biopsies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) or via percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomy (PEG) on days 1-5 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 8-12 weeks
      thereafter.
