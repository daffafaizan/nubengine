      objective is to determine the efficacy of ModraDoc006 in combination with ritonavir (denoted
      ModraDoc006/r) in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer, as
      measured by RECIST v1.1 criteria of objective response rate (ORR). To this aim, a Simon
      two-stage minimax design will be used, in which 14 evaluable patients will be treated in the
      first stage (Stage A). If 0 or â‰¥ 2 objective responses at week 8 (with confirmation at week
      12) are observed in Stage A, no further patients will be enrolled. If 1 objective response is
      observed, an additional 10 patients with recurrent or metastatic HER-2 negative breast cancer
      will be included in the second stage (Stage B).

      All patients will be treated with ModraDoc006/r, given as oral tablets twice daily once
      weekly (BIDW).

      Patients will be radiologically assessed at week 8 and 12 by CT scan (or MRI if CT is
      contraindicated), and may continue to receive study medication with ongoing radiological
      scans every 6 weeks until disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1), unacceptable
      toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason.

      Furthermore, the safety and tolerability of ModraDoc006/r in the target population will be
      assessed. Additionally, as metastatic breast cancer may occur at older age, often coinciding
      with other non-malignant diseases and co-medications, this protocol investigates whether
      ModraDoc006/r can be applied safely in these (frail) patients.
