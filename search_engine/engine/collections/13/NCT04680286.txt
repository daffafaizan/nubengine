      surgery. After discharge parents must assess pain intensity and administer analgesics,
      including opioids, as per needed. It has been shown that parents often hesitate to administer
      analgesics. The result is unrelieved pain that negatively affects the whole family and
      increases the risk of unscheduled contacts with healthcare professionals.

      In children, methadone has shown a half-life of 19,2 +/-13,6 hours. Regarding outpatient
      surgery, methadone is an opioid with unique pharmalogical properties that may be
      advantageous. A single-dose of this long acting opioid administered perioperatively could
      provide a stable analgesia and potentially reduce the need for shorter-acting opioids in the
      PACU and at home.
