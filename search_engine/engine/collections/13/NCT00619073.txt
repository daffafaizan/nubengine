      platelet hyperreactivity? We will perform a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study
      in normal subjects, in whom platelet reactivity will be measured before clopidogrel or
      placebo, during clopidogrel or placebo, and at various time points after discontinuation of
      clopidogrel or placebo. The dose of clopidogrel will be the standard, FDA-approved dose: 75
      mg daily. All subjects will be treated with aspirin 81 mg daily throughout the 57 days of
      study assessment in both the clopidogrel arm and the placebo arm, because the clinically
      relevant question is: in patients who remain on aspirin, does discontinuation of clopidogrel
      result in platelet hyperreactivity?
