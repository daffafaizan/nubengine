      the operation, low level laser therapy is applied intra- and extraorally. Two different
      lasers are used, one for each side. The two lasers look identical. Only one of the lasers has
      therapeutic light, the other one shows just non-therapeutic red light. The effect of the low
      level laser is measured by several parameters and they are compared with the other side.
      These parameters are pain, swelling and mouth opening. The selection of the lasers to the
      sides is double-blind and randomized.
