      has been associated with diet-related disorders such as cardiovascular disease. This makes
      prevention of ED an important health target. From previous studies we know that a high-fat
      (HF) meal (challenge) impairs postprandial endothelial function (EF). Current studies only
      evaluated the effect of a HF meal on Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD), a measure of macro
      vascular EF. This methodology (FMD) however, is time consuming and large variations in
      reproducibility are reported in literature. The question remains whether other types of
      macro- and micro vascular EF measurements can be used to observe ED after a HF meal that are
      more accurate, faster and easier to perform. In addition, it is know that the postprandial
      phase results in activation of leukocytes. This activation of leukocytes is likely to
      contribute to ED, but the exact underling mechanism remains unclear.
