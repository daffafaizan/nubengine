    
      This is an open-label Phase 1 study to determine the feasibility, safety, and the recommended
      maximum tolerated Dose (MTD) of a single infusion of RPM CD19 mbIL15 CAR-T cells for adult
      patients. Approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled and it is anticipated approximately 16
      subjects will be infused at the varied doses of T cells.

      This study will very rapidly administer T cells that are genetically modified by
      electroporation using DNA plasmids from the SB system to co-express CD19RCD8CD28 (the CAR),
      mbIL15, and HER1t. The presence of mbIL15 may allow for reduced doses of CAR-T cells to be
      infused to reduce the risk for adverse events, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

      The key features of study design are listed below.

        1. Uncontrolled

        2. Blinding: open-label

        3. Randomized: no

        4. Duration of treatment: single infusion within day

        5. Titration: none

        6. Single center, Taiwan
