      the administration of some of the drugs. Treatment for the first 2 courses of therapy will
      last about 2 months.

      Treatment on this study will consist of a combination of 8 anti-cancer medications. The 8
      anticancer medicines are ABT-751, dexamethasone, PEG-asparaginase, doxorubicin, cytarabine
      (Ara-C), methotrexate (MTX), cyclophosphamide, and 6-thioguanine. All the drugs except
      ABT-751 are well known anti-cancer drugs and have been used extensively in the treatment of
      cancer.

      During the Phase I portion of this study, when you enroll, you will be given an assigned dose
      of ABT-751. The dose of ABT-751 will be based on doses given in previous studies done with
      adults and children. At each dose level of ABT-751, between 3 and 6 children will receive
      ABT-751 in combination with chemotherapy. If the side effects are not too severe, the next
      group of children will receive a higher dose. The dose will continue to be increased until we
      find the dose that causes serious side effects. Your dose of ABT-751 will not be increased.
      If you have bad side effects, your dose may be decreased.

      The dose used during the Phase 2 part of this study will be determined by the outcome of the
      Phase I study. The highest dose used in Phase I that was tolerated without serious side
      effects will be the one used in Phase 2.
