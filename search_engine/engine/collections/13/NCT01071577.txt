      are being used to treat a number of disorders including: graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),
      ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of
      this protocol is to collect bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy volunteers to
      produce clinical grade BMSCs to treat Clinical Center patients and to develop new methods for
      producing and assessing the quality of BMSCs. In some cases, the donors will be the
      recipients of the ex vivo expanded cells (autologous transplantation). In other cases, no
      matching of HLA or other antigens is required between the marrow donor and the BMSC
      recipient, so the donors will be required to meet the same healthy history and infectious
      disease marker screening criteria as volunteer blood donors. The BMSCs will be produced in
      the GMP Clinical Cell Processing Laboratory, located in the Cell Processing Section (CPS),
      Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM), Clinical Center. After the BMSCs are produced by
      the Cell Processing Laboratory, they will be infused directly into Clinical Center patients
      on protocol, or cryopreserved and stored, and used as they are needed to treat Clinical
      Center patients. Up to 250 subjects will be enrolled in this study. This protocol will
      provide a mechanism for banking fresh and frozen BMSC products that can be used for patient
      care and research. This is not a treatment protocol. Subjects receiving these BMSC products
      will be enrolled in specific BMSC treatment protocols.
