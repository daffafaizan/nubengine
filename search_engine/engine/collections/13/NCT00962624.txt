      occupational exposure to meningococci. No licensed vaccine is available against serogroup B
      meningococci and the available plain polysaccharide serogroup ACYW vaccine is poorly
      immunogenic. Novartis Vaccines have developed an investigational serogroup B vaccine and a
      conjugated ACYW vaccine. This study will investigate these vaccines ability to induce a
      protective response in laboratory staff from the Manchester Medical Microbiology Partnership.
      Three doses of the meningococcal B vaccine will be administered at 0, 2 and 6 months and a
      single dose will be administered at 0 months. Blood samples will be taken before and after
      each vaccination and functional antibodies determined.
