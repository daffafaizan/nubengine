      alternative to inpatient care for people with acute mental illness. Therefore, psychiatric
      patients in need of hospitalization who meet the study's inclusion criteria are randomly
      assigned to either the condition home treatment or inpatient care (treatment-as-usual) during
      one year. Home treatment patients are visited by a mobile and multiprofessional care team at
      their homes. Additionally, patients without a health insurance for home treatment and
      patients who are directly assigned to home treatment are included in separate study groups.
      Following two years, it will be checked whether home treatment leads to a reduction of
      inpatient days as a primary outcome. Further outcomes such as cost effectiveness,
      rehospitalization rate, severity of symptoms and sociodemographics will be also analyzed.
