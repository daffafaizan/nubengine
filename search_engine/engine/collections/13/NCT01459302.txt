      and to complete a couple of questionnaires regarding their overall medical health and some
      environmental risk factors. Medical records will be requested for all those diagnosed with
      one of the study diseases to allow the researchers to review details of their clinical
      disease symptoms, neurological exams and test results.

      Participants do not need to travel to Massachusetts for this study. Samples can be obtained
      locally at no costs to the participant. Family members may be included in the study depending
      on family history and their relationship to the affected individual.
