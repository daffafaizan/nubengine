    
      Unintentional medication discrepancies during transitions in care (such as hospitalization
      and subsequent discharge) are very common and represent a major threat to patient safety. One
      solution to this problem is medication reconciliation. In response to Joint Commission
      requirements, most hospitals have developed medication reconciliation processes, but some
      have been more successful than others, and there are reports of pro-forma compliance without
      substantial improvements in patient safety. There is now collective experience about
      effective approaches to medication reconciliation, but these have yet to be consolidated,
      evaluated rigorously, and disseminated effectively.

      This project's findings should provide valuable lessons to all hospitals regarding the best
      ways to design and implement medication reconciliation interventions to improve medication
      safety during transitions in care.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

      Aim 1: Develop a toolkit consolidating the best practice recommendations for medication
      reconciliation

      Aim 2: Conduct a multi-center mentored quality improvement project in which each site adapts
      the tools for its own environment and implements them

      Aim 3: Assess the effects of a mentored medication reconciliation quality improvement
      intervention on unintentional medication discrepancies with potential for patient harm

      Aim 4: Conduct rigorous program evaluation to determine the most important components of a
      medication reconciliation program and how best to implement it
