      intragastric meal distribution, postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in healthy subjects.
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) inhibits gastric emptying, thereby slowing the delivery of
      nutrients, and their absorption, across the small intestine. The rate of entry of
      carbohydrate into the small intestine is especially important in patients with diabetes
      mellitus. Sitagliptin is an orally administered inhibitor of dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV
      (DPP-IV), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of GLP-1. It is hypothesized that
      sitagliptin will increase the GLP-1 response to, and thereby slow gastric emptying and
      diminish the glycemic response to, a carbohydrate-containing meal.

      Fifteen healthy subjects (male and female) will be studied. Each subject will be studied on
      two occasions following treatment for 2 days with sitagliptin (100mg once daily) or matching
      placebo in a randomized, double blind, crossover design. Measurements of gastric emptying,
      intragastric meal distribution, blood glucose concentrations, gut hormones and appetite will
      be measured for 4 hours following ingestion of a mashed potato meal.
