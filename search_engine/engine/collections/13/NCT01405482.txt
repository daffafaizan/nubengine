    
      To assess the effect of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTX-A) injections into the scalene muscles on
      pain, paresthesias and function in subjects with TOS.

      Hypothesis:

      BTX-A injected into the anterior and middle scalene muscles will reduce the irritation on the
      neurovascular structures at the interscalene triangle in subjects with TOS. This will lead to
      reductions in pain and paresthesias, and improvements in function when compared with
      injection of placebo.

      Study design:

      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel groups effectiveness trial evaluating
      changes in pain, paresthesias and function before, at six weeks and four months following
      injection.

      Study population:

      Sixty subjects at least eighteen years of age with a clinical diagnosis of TOS of at least
      three months duration but less than one year, referred to our practice for management of TOS.

      Intervention:

      Each subject will receive an injection under EMG guidance into the anterior and middle
      scalene muscles of either 100 units of BTX-A (experimental group), or normal saline (control
      group). Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measure will be pain as measured on a ten point Numeric Rating Scale with
      a two point reduction considered significant. Secondary outcomes will be paresthesias as
      measured on a Numeric Rating Scale, function measured on the Disabilities of the arm,
      shoulder and hand (DASH) questionnaire.
