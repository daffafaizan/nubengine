      and maintain patency of peripheral arterial catheters during surgery in pediatric patients.
      Peripheral arterial catheters measure blood pressure with every heartbeat and provide
      valuable information regarding the status of the heart and the overall well being. It is of
      utmost importance to maintain the utility and patency of these catheters throughout the
      procedure. As standard procedure, Heparin, a blood thinner, is used routinely during the
      surgical procedure to keep these catheters from clotting. Papaverine, an arterial relaxation
      agent, is used after surgery to maintain patency of these catheters. In this study, small
      volumes of papaverine with heparin will be introduced during the procedure (1 mL of a 0.12
      mg/mL papaverine, Heparin 2 units/mL premixed syringe made by the pharmacy) (treatment group)
      or after the procedure (control group).
