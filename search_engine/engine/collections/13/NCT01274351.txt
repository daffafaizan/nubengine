      treatment for patients with Ph+ CMLCP. All patients received oral nilotinib 300 mg twice
      daily for a planned treatment duration of 24 months or until early discontinuation.

      The primary efficacy end point was the cumulative rate of Major Molecular Response (MMR) in
      all participants by 12 months. Secondary efficacy end points included the rate of Complete
      Cytogenic Response (CCyR) at 6 and 12 months; cumulative rates of MMR up to 24 months; time
      to and durability of MMR; and cumulative rate of Complete Haematologic Response (CHR) by 12
      months.

      Patient evaluations, including hematologic assessments, were conducted every 15 days during
      the first 3 months, monthly until month 12, and then every 3 months until the end of the
      study (24 months). All efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to treat population.
