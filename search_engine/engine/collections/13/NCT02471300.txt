      atherosclerosis, gout and diabetes (sterile inflammation). As mitochondrial signaling can
      trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome, we initially proposed that fasting, via a nutrient-sensing
      mitochondrial program, would dampen this innate immune program. Our preliminary data shows
      that a 24-hour fasting does blunt NLRP3 inflammasome activation in healthy young individuals.
      Interestingly, this inflammasome program has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
      bronchoreactivity linked to asthma and intermittent fasting has been found to reduce disease
      exacerbations in asthmatic patients. The objective of this protocol will extend our
      investigations, from what we are finding in young control normal volunteers, to enable us to
      investigate stable mild-moderate asthmatic subjects to determine whether fasting can blunt
      inflammasome activation and assess whether this transient nutrient-deprivation maneuver can
      improve airflow. Blood samples and pulmonary function testing to assay the immune response
      and bronchoreactivity will be performed in subjects in response to a 24-hour fast (water
      intake will not be restricted) followed by re-testing 3 hours after a fixed caloric meal. The
      objective of this pilot study is to identify if these immune adaptive pathways can be subdued
      in human subjects with a known inflammasome linked disease. Additionally, this study may
      enable us to identify a potential therapeutic pathway to blunt/negate inflammation associated
      with nutrient-excess associated bronchoreactivity of asthma.
