      therapy departments in the UK. Patients with early RA (<5 years) were recruited. The study
      followed patients over a 12 month treatment period. Patients were randomised to receive
      standardised occupational therapy or standardised occupational therapy plus static resting
      splints over 12 months. The primary outcome measure was dominant hand grip strength and
      secondary out measures included; dominant hand MCPJ ulnar deviation, the button board from
      the Arthritis Hand Function Test and the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire.

      Data were analysed using ANCOVA. Baseline outcome values, Ritchie Scores at baseline and the
      number of intra articular wrist and hand steroid injections were controlled for as
      covariates.
