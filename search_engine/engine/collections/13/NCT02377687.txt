    
      We will identify all patients aged â‰¥ 75 having an emergency GI laparotomy or laparoscopy
      between the 1st of November 2014 and the 30st of April 2015.

      The first part of the study will take place in the first postoperative week, while the
      patient is in hospital. After consent we will ask both patient and relatives/caregivers
      questions concerning the preoperative course and the informed consent. We will ask for
      permission to call the patients for a followup (the second part of the study) 5-7 months
      after discharge and permission to contact their closest relative. The closest relative is
      chosen by the patient and will after consent be asked the same questions in the first
      postoperative week and after 6 months.

      The second part of the study will be initiated with a letter with SF-36 and an additional
      questionnaire . The SF-36 will be returned by letter. We will contact the patients by
      telephone 2 weeks after sending the letter ask them the questions from the additional
      questinaire.

      We will compare the results from the SF-36 with age-matched controls (Data from the Danish
      SF-36 Manual).

      If the patient is not capable of answering the questionnaires, the primary reason is noted
      (e.g. suffering from dementia or didn't speak Danish, dead).

      We will aim at a 6 month follow-up period after discharge allowing a range from 5-7 months.
      Data acquisition will be done in the fall 2014 until late 2015.
