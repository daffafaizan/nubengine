      Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, or Group 5) with 10 subjects per group in Groups 1-4 and 20
      subjects in Group 5. Within each study group, subjects will be randomized to a treatment
      assignment of either AERAS-404 or placebo control at a ratio of 4:1 (Groups 1-4) or two
      different dose amounts of AERAS-404 or placebo control at a ratio of 9:9:2 (Group 5)
      administered by intramuscular injection on Study Day 0 and Study Day 56. The principal
      investigator will determine an appropriate interval between the vaccinations such that the
      entire group is not dosed at the same time. All subjects will receive the same treatment on
      Study Day 0 as they receive on Study Day 56. All subjects will be followed for safety and
      immunogenicity evaluations for 182 days. A total of eleven clinic visits are planned
      (excluding screening) for all subjects
