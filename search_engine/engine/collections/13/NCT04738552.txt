      characterization. This study is intended to compare the Nelli Software's ability to identify
      seizure events to vEEG review in adults with suspected nighttime seizures. Simultaneously,
      Nelli will continuously record audio and video while video-electroencephalography (vEEG) is
      recorded per typical standard of care. Events with positive motor manifestations will be
      independently identified, following standard clinical practice, by three epileptologists
      using clinical vEEG data. Nelli Software will review the audio and video data and
      independently identify events with positive motor manifestations. The outcomes of event
      identification will be compared between Epileptologists and the Nelli Software. For each
      category of event captured the positive percent agreement will be calculated using the exact
      binomial method. The primary endpoint of this study is to demonstrate that Nelli is able to
      identify seizures that have a positive motor component with a sensitivity of > 70%.
