      freezing of gait (FOG).

      This study will involve 2 study groups:

      Group A - training group; Group B - no training group/controls.

      Both groups will complete a gait evaluation and neuropsychological testing. Group A will also
      practice an in-home visuospatial task for 30 minutes, 4-6 days per week for six weeks. Group
      B will not complete the in-home tasks.

      Participation in this study is expected to last 6-8 weeks.
