    
      This is a multi-center, dose-finding, Phase 1 study of pralatrexate plus bexarotene in
      patients who have relapsed or refractory CTCL.

      Primary Objective(s):

      â€¢ Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose of pralatrexate plus
      bexarotene with concurrent vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation when administered to
      patients who have failed prior systemic treatment.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  Determine the safety profile of pralatrexate plus bexarotene when administered to
           patients with relapsed/refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

        -  Collect preliminary efficacy data.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of pralatrexate plus bexarotene in patients
           who underwent plasma PK sampling
