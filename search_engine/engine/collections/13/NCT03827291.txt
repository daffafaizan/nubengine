      immediately prior to their operation. Participants will be in this study for 96 hours
      following surgery, which is typically 3 days. During participation, the study staff will
      review participant's electronic health records for pain scores and pain medication needs.

      Participants that receive the quadratus lumborum block, may experience improved pain control
      and/or reduced side effects compared to the epidural pain relief option, but it is not known
      yet whether this will be the case.

      The most common risk is being sore in the flank where the block was placed. Other risks of
      the block rarely occur (less than .5-1%), these can include infection, allergy to the local
      anesthetic, bleeding, damage to the nerve, seizures, abnormal heart rhythms, and cardiac
      arrest.
