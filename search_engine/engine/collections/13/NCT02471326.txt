      highly potent, HIV-specific, broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from B cells of
      HIV-infected individuals. It has been shown that certain broadly neutralizing HIV-specific
      antibodies can prevent acquisition of the virus, suppress viral replication, delay and/or
      prevent plasma viral rebound following treatment interruption in Simian Immunodeficiency
      virus (SIV)-infected animals and block cell-to-cell transmission of laboratory-adapted HIV in
      vitro. However, it is unclear what in vivo effects these antibodies might have on plasma
      viral rebound in HIV-infected individuals following discontinuation of combination
      antiretroviral therapy (cART).

      In this regard, it has been shown that virtually all infected individuals who initiated cART
      during the chronic phase of infection experience plasma viral rebound upon cessation of
      therapy. Current research on the treatment of HIV-infected individuals has been heavily
      focused on developing strategies aimed at achieving sustained virologic remission in the
      absence of cART. Thus, it is of great interest to investigate whether a potent HIV-specific
      monoclonal antibody, such as VRC01, can prevent plasma viral rebound in infected individuals
      upon discontinuation of cART. We propose to examine the effect of VRC01 on plasma viral
      rebound in HIV-infected individuals following analytical treatment interruption (ATI).
