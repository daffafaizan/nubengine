      mortality of patients with invasive infections due to CRE are high. The best treatment is
      unknown, however, combination therapy with at least 2 active drugs is often recommended for
      high-risk patients, and monotherapy is probably not inferior to this in low-risk patients.

      Ceftazidime-avibactam is active against many CRE, and in some countries it has been
      prescribed under compassionate use programs for these infections; It has recently been
      approved by the FDA and the EMA for specific indications. Recent data suggest that
      ceftazidime-avibactam may be superior for the treatment of infections caused by sensitive
      CRE, rather than traditional regimens that often include colistin, usually combined with
      other drugs. However, these studies include a low number of patients and are subject to
      important biases.

      Additionally, the development of resistance to this drug during / after treatment has been
      described and is worrying.
