      The stress experienced by the parents can negatively influence their functionality, daily
      activities, psychological state and also their physical condition. The studies in the
      literature have mainly focused on the child rather than the parent, and studies specifically
      for guided imagery are scarce. Since the parents are often neglected by the healthcare
      professionals during the stress evoking period of hospitalization, this study will test the
      effectiveness of complementary methods in improving the psychological state of the parents.
