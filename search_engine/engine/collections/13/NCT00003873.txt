      I. Compare the response rate, response duration, and survival of patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer treated with oral fluorouracil (5-FU) and eniluracil or with protracted
      infusion 5-FU.

      II. Compare the toxicity of these treatment regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to performance status
      (0 vs 1-2) and measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV as a continuous infusion for 28 days.

      ARM II: Patients receive eniluracil/fluorouracil orally twice a day for 28 days.

      Treatment continues every 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed at least every 10 weeks for 1 year.
