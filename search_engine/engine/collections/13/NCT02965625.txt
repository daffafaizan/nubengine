      the pericardium. Adipose located on the outside of the visceral pericardium to the external
      site of the pericardium is called the pericardial adipose tissue (PAT), and is of a separate
      origin than EAT. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the global expression profile of
      the EAT and PAT compartments, in addition to characterizing the function, structure,
      metabolic and inflammatory profile. Furthermore, this study will determine whether CABG and
      valve replacement patients display different EAT and PAT characteristics
