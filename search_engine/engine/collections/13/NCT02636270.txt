    
      The 24-hour pharmacokinetic response of free and total IGF-1 and IGF binding protein-3
      (IGFBP-3) to a single dose of rhIGF-1 (120 mcg/kg) in three patients with PAPP-A2 mutation
      compared to up to four unaffected heterozygous relatives and 2 healthy adult controls.

      One-year trial of rhIGF-1 at standard dose given to the two youngest males with PAPP-A2
      mutation. The primary end point of this trial will be first year height velocity. Secondary
      outcomes will include change in height SDS, change in height velocity SDS, and change in
      whole body and lumbar spine bone mineral density. The study was amended to extend the
      treatment period to continue until the subject has stopped growing. All study procedures
      remain the same. Important note: the treatment phase continues to follow the youngest
      affected male. The older affected male developed an adverse event that resulted in
      discontinuation of treatment.

      Description of additional phenotypic characteristics of patients with PAPP-A2 mutation will
      be studied by collecting information on glucose and insulin metabolism, body composition,
      bone geometry and bone density before and after treatment with rhIGF-1. These measures will
      be collected at the 12 month time period, and every year thereafter until the completion of
      the study. All three affected siblings will take part in the phenotyping activities.
