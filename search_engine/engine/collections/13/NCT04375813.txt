    
      The study is a multi-site phase II double-blind randomized trial. Subjects will be randomized
      into placebo arm or intervention arm with low dose (0.5 mg) eRapa (encapsulated rapamycin)
      Monday-Friday for one year or until disease recurrence. Patients will undergo endoscopic
      evaluation of the bladder every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 2 years, then
      annually following registration. Some patients may also concurrently receive BCG immune
      therapy maintenance (weekly for 6 weeks for induction period, weekly for 3 weeks at 3 months,
      6 months, and then every 6 months for a total of 7 maintenance cycles following tumor
      removal) per standard of care. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessments, cognitive
      assessments, and physical assessments will be completed according to the study calendar.
      Research blood to assess safety, immune response and rapamycin level will be collected
      regularly throughout the study period. Participants will be followed for up to 5 years
      following enrollment.
