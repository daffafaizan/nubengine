      The objective of this study is to determine the effects of asoprisnil in uterine fibroid
      growth suppression. Full thickness biopsies obtained from surgical procedures will allow the
      assessment of asoprisnil's effects on the basalis, the myometrium, and on endometrial
      angiogenesis. Various other exploratory immunohistological and biochemical specimens will be
      collected to evaluate the mechanisms of action of asoprisnil in the endometrium, the
      myometrium, and in uterine fibroids.
