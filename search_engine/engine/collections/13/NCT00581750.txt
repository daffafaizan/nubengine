      genetic level, and that these molecular genetic alterations may be used to predict the
      subsequent development of invasive breast cancer. Prophylactic mastectomy specimens from
      women with multifocal LCIS, and invasive breast cancer specimens which display coexisting
      LCIS, will be examined for X-chromosome inactivation patterns and loss of heterozygosity to
      assess for monoclonality. If clonality is present, we will assess for microsatellite
      instability, and a microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) technique will be
      used to identify genetic alterations present in LCIS. Lastly, LCIS biopsy specimens from
      untreated patients who, after follow-up did or did not develop invasive breast cancer, will
      be evaluated to determine whether the nature or extent of any identified genetic alterations
      can be correlated with the subsequent development of invasive breast cancer. We hypothesize
      that a fraction of LCIS lesions will reflect a monoclonal origin, that those lesions of
      monoclonal origin will display evidence of specific molecular genetic alterations, and that
      these specific alterations will correlate with the likelihood of the subsequent development
      of invasive breast carcinoma.
