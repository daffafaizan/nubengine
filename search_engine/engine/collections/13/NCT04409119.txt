      HFrEF, LVEF < 35%, NYHA II-IV despite optimal medical treatment and an ECG with left bundle
      branch block (LBBB). However, it is not always ideal because of several drawbacks such as
      phrenic nerve capture, inability to reach late activated areas and many more. Direct HIS
      pacing can in many cases capture the left bundle and provide normal electrical activation of
      the left ventricle but sometimes with high pacing thresholds. Recently direct left bundle
      branch pacing has shown promise with synchronous activation of the left ventricle at low
      pacing thresholds.

      In the present study we randomize 50 patients in one center to either conventional CRT or
      HIS/LBB pacing in a 1:1 single-blind design. In the HIS/LBB arm, direct HIS-pacing is
      attempted first but if its not possible or the pacing threshold for capturing the left bundle
      branch is > 2.5 V at 1 ms we switch to placing a LBB-lead.
