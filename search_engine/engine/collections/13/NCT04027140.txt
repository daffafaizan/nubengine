      performance and clinical benefits of the M/L Taper with Kinectiv Technology Stems and Necks
      when used for primary or revision total hip arthroplasty (implants) at 1,2,5 and 10-year
      follow-up*. ML Taper with Kinectiv Technology has been on the market since 2008, but has
      insufficient long term clinical data. Therefore, a prospective aspect to the study will be
      necessary to reach the 10-year time point.

      The primary objective is to confirm safety of the study products. This will be assessed by
      recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and adverse events.
      Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be specified.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by analyzing
      recorded patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).

      *Follow-up with the patient at the 10 year time point will be collected by the site
      prospectively and the 1, 2 and 5 year time point data will be collected by the sponsor
      retrospectively from an existing database including ML Taper with Kinectiv Technology
      patients from a Zimmer Biomet hip registry.
