      receiving short- and long-term oral anticoagulation, especially elderly
      patient.However,Increased INR was previously observed in patients treated with warfarin and
      paracetamol given at the maximum recommended dose (4g/day).

      To date, the mechanism of this interaction has not been determined.A recent in vitro study
      suggested that the toxic metabolite N-acetyl-para-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) appeared to
      interfere with vitamin K-dependent Î³-carboxylase (VKD-carb) and vitamin K epoxide reductase
      (VKOR) activites12. The question remaining to be dealt with is whether this in vitro
      observation can explain the in vivo paracetamol-warfarin interaction. We aim to evaluate the
      effect of paracetamol at the most widely used doses 2 and 3g/day on INR in stable patients
      treated with warfarin in a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial and to identify
      the mechanism involved in this interaction in vivo.
