    
      Extracapsular tonsillectomy (TE) with monopolar electrosurgery is the most commonly used
      approach in adult tonsil surgery in Turku University Central Hospital, Finland.

      In our study setting we are comparing intracapsular tonsillectomy
      (subtotal/intracapsular/partial tonsillectomy (SIPT) ) as the intervention group with
      extracapsular tonsillectomy as the control group.

      SIPT is done with either coblation or microdebrider and TE with monopolar electrosurgery.

      Indications for surgery are recurrent tonsillitis or chronic tonsillitis. The patient group
      is adults (16-65 years)

      Safety, efficiency and cost-effectiveness are monitored in a prospective, patient-blinded and
      randomised study setting.
