      effect on stress level using a pretest-posttest randomized controlled single-blind study
      design of quantitative trial and semi-structured in-depth interview method of qualitative
      trial.The study was conducted in the medical oncology unit of a university hospital in
      Turkey. The data collection process continued from August 2018 to April 2019 and was reported
      in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. To be
      included in the study, a total of 86 caregivers were directed to the investigator by the
      charge nurse of the chemotherapy unit. The investigator evaluated the criteria for inclusion
      into study by conducting a preliminary interview with the directed caregivers. A total of 86
      caregivers were evaluated; 61 were found eligible for the study and 51 caregivers agreed to
      participate into the study. Caregivers were assigned to reiki and sham reiki groups. One
      caregiver in the Reiki group was excluded from the study on the first application day because
      he/she could not provide a saliva sample. 4 of the caregivers in the sham reiki group did not
      continue their application appointments after the first week, and 4 of the caregivers in the
      sham reiki group left the study stating that they did not want to continue due to the
      deterioration in prognosis of the caretakers. The study was completed with a total of 42
      caregivers
