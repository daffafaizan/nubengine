    
      Cancer-related fatigue is a prevalent and distressing symptom which has a significant impact
      on quality of life for children and adolescents with cancer and their families. Evidence
      based guidelines issued by the Oncology Nursing Society and National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network recommend educational interventions for preventing and treating cancer-related
      fatigue.The primary study aim is to examine the relationships among: intensity of
      cancer-related fatigue; frequency of use of an evidence based educational resource for
      self-management of cancer-related fatigue; and perceived helpfulness of resource use. The
      secondary aim is to examine the relationship between the Fatigue Scale-Adolescent (FS-A) and
      the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) 'tired' item as measures of intensity of cancer-related
      fatigue. The tertiary aim is to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining
      adolescents with cancer for longitudinal study of cancer-related fatigue.
