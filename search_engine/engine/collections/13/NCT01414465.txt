      Orlistat is a popular drug approved for long-term use which produces weight loss by
      inhibiting triglycerides, main components of fats in the diet, from binding to the lipase
      enzyme active sites thus halting their subsequent breakdown into monoglycerides and free
      fatty acids necessary for fat digestion, reducing dietary fat absorption by up to 30%. The
      effect of this drug on human blood fatty acid profile has not been described yet.

      The FA profile is typical of each lipid and tissue, however, alterations in diets,
      pathological processes, drugs intervention, cigarettes and alcohol consumption can alter the
      FA profile. The FA composition of RBCs, plasma and platelets can be used to monitor these
      processes. This study presents alteration of FA composition in RBCM and phospholipids,
      triglycerides and cholesteryl esters from plasma of health obese female volunteers treated
      with nutritional orientation and orlistat (120 mg t.i.d) for 3 months.
