      for post dural puncture headache but the investigators do not know if it has significant
      efficacy when compared to epidural blood patch. Method: randomized clinical trial where
      patients with moderate to severe post dural puncture pain will randomly receive either
      sphenopalatine block or epidural blood patch. Pain relief to no pain or low intensity pain
      will be the main outcome. Pain recurrence, survival without pain and side effects (tinitus,
      low back pain, new dural puncture, sore throat) will be secondary outcomes.
