      dermatitis (AD) and a positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonized lesion (at least
      15 cm^2 in size) on the upper extremities.

      Participants who are eligible based on their positive Staph culture results will be
      randomized to one of two treatments: Targeted Microbiome Transplant Lotion (TMT) or Placebo
      (2:1 randomization). One lesional site measuring at least 15 cm^2 and one non-lesional site
      of equal size will be identified on the participant's ventral upper extremities as the target
      swabbing areas. These sites will be photographed and marked for swabbing for reference at the
      participant's future visits. Participants will be instructed to apply investigational product
      with gloved hands to their ventral upper extremities bilaterally from the wrist to the upper
      humerus, which will include the identified lesional and non-lesional swabbing sites twice a
      day for 1 week starting on Day 0. Participants will return to clinic on Day 4 for the
      assessment of adverse events, the collection of skin swabs from the identified target sites,
      and to obtain additional investigational product and gloves. Participants will complete an
      additional clinic visit on Day 7 to correspond with the end of their 1 week treatment. During
      this visit, participants will be assessed for AEs and provide skin swab samples. All unused
      product and empty packets will be returned during the Day 4 and Day 7 visits. Three
      additional clinic visits on Days 8, 9, and 11 will be scheduled for additional skin swabs to
      assess the safety and the stability of the microbiome transplant and time to recurrence of
      Staph colonization. Participants will be followed through Day 38 to assess for safety and
      disease status.
