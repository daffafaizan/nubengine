      simvastatin leads to greater improvement in the symptoms of PAD than simvastatin alone. This
      will be accomplished by evaluating efficacy of orally administered L-citrulline or placebo
      against background therapy with simvastatin for improvement in treadmill absolute
      claudication walking distance (ACWD) in patients, 40-75 years of age, who have PAD with
      intermittent claudication in Fontaine stage II and symptom-limited treadmill walking
      distance.

      Secondary objectives include comparing the combination therapy to simvastatin alone for
      improvement in treadmill pain-free walking distance (PFWD) and ischemic window.

      Other secondary objectives include evaluating the safety and tolerability of L-citrulline
      alone or combined with simvastatin in this patient population and assessing the effects of
      treatment on quality of life (QOL) as measured by two QOL instruments.
