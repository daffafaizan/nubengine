      prognostic value to patients with ischemic heart disease by allowing the clinician to assess
      the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD). The primary objective of the
      clinical development program for AI-700 is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of AI-700
      as an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent in patients with suspected myocardial perfusion
      defects.

      The patient population is comprised of patients who are being evaluated for inducible
      ischemia. The primary study objective was to determine the accuracy, sensitivity, and
      specificity of AI-700-enhanced echocardiographic imaging for detecting CAD using coronary
      angiography/left ventriculography (ANGIO/LVG) or single-photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT) with clinical outcome as the reference standards.
