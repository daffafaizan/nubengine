      specific biotinylated immunoassays is associated with biotin ingestion at doses common in
      over-the-counter supplements (10 mg/d) in healthy adults and subjects with thyroid hormone
      supplementation. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the association of short-term
      biotin ingestion for 10 days with performance of various analytes based on Roche, Abbott and
      Siemens assays.

      Study group 2) Due to a lack of systematic studies, little is known about how performance of
      specific biotinylated immunoassays is associated with biotin ingestion at doses common in
      multivitamin supplements (biotin = 50 Âµg/d) in healthy adults. Therefore, this study was
      designed to assess the association of short-term biotin ingestion for 20 days with
      performance of various analytes based on Roche, Abbott and Siemens assays.
