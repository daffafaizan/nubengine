    
      This study evaluates the effects of an FDA-approved medication called tolcapone in people who
      have both Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The
      study involves seven visits over a three to four week period, including an assessment visit
      and two eight-day medication periods during which participants will be assigned to take, in a
      double-blinded fashion, both tolcapone and a placebo (three visits during each period).
      During two of these visits, participants will undergo a one-hour MRI scan. Participants must
      not be seeking treatment for AUD or ADHD and must not be currently taking any psychotropic
      medications, including stimulant medications for ADHD.
