    
      The main goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effect of two different treatments
      during 12 months:

        1. Lifestyle modification program + metformin 1700mg every 24 hours.

        2. Lifestyle modification program + linagliptin (2.5mg) and metformin (1700mg) every 24
           hours.

      on the following parameters, after 12 months of treatment:

        1. Glucose metabolism, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance

        2. Insulin resistance, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the patients

        3. Insulin secretion, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the patients

        4. Pancreatic beta cell function, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the
           patients

        5. Cardiovascular function, evaluated by ejection fraction measurement, diastolic and
           systolic preloads measured by standard echocardiography.

      All the patients will have a basal evaluation with an oral glucose tolerance test, lipid
      profile, body composition. After the basal evaluation, if the patients result with
      prediabetes (FASTING IMPAIRED GLUCOSE/IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE) and have at least 2 risk
      factors, they will be invited to the intervention phase where they will be randomized to one
      of the two treatment groups.

      Patients will have a follow-up visit every month to review the adherence to the lifestyle
      modification program and to the medication. After 6 months, patients will repeat the same
      evaluation performed as the basal evaluation.
