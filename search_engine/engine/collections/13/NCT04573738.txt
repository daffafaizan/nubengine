      especially for males with obesity and a narrow pelvis.The da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive
      Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is expected to overcome the limitations of the laparoscopic
      transanal approach for rectal surgery. Da Vinci Si Surgical System or da Vinci Xi Surgical
      System would be used to performed Transanal total mesorectal excision. And the surgery would
      performed by two-team approach. This study aimed to investigate the safety and feasibility of
      robotic assisted transanal total mesorectal excision in patients with rectal cancer.
