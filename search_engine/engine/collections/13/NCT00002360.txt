      when antiretroviral therapy is warranted. Didanosine is administered orally with antacids to
      protect it against acid-induced hydrolysis in the stomach. To eliminate the need for using
      buffers in the ddI formulations, an enteric-coated bead formulation of ddI is being
      developed.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups to receive treatment on 2 separate occasions at
      least 72 hours apart. Group 1 receives the reference formulation of ddI. Group 2 receives the
      test formulation of ddI. Clinical evaluations, including clinical laboratory tests, are
      performed periodically during the study and at discharge. Serial blood samples are collected
      at specific time points over the 12 hours following dosing, and are used for the
      pharmacokinetic variables CMAX and AUC(INF). Factors used in analysis are sequence, subject
      within sequence, period, and formulation. Safety is assessed by monitoring adverse effects,
      vital signs, ECG recordings, and clinical laboratory tests throughout the study.
