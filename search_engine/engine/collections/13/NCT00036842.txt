        -  Determine the response rate (confirmed complete and partial responses) in men with
           refractory testicular or extragonadal germ cell malignancies treated with arsenic
           trioxide.

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the biomarker response rate in patients with elevated biomarkers treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days
      for up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      who achieve a confirmed complete or partial response receive up to 3 additional courses past
      response.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 3 years or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-40
      months.
