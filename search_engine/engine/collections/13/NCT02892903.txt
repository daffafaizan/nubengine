      or for the assessment of a recent, but stabilised, non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome
      event. Eligible patients who provide written informed consent will be randomised to
      conventional angiography or additional, routine pressure wire assessment - measuring
      fractional flow reserve (FFR) - in all main vessels judged as being of sufficient vessel
      calibre to allow percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (experimental arm). The study
      pragmatic design allows investigators to conduct all diagnostic and therapeutic management in
      accordance with prevailing best practice patterns. Study outcome measures will examine
      resource utilisation, patient reported quality of life and clinical events at 1 year.
