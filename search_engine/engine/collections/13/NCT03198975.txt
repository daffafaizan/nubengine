      will be imported into the imaging management software (GE healthcare Analysis-Kit
      software),and the tumor lesions will manually delineated by two independent radiologists and
      then reconstruct into three-dimensional images for feature extraction. The radiomic textural
      features including grayscale histogram, transform matrix, wavelet transform and filter
      transformation are automatically extracted by the Analysis-Kit software.The high-throughput
      extracted features will be then selected by the univariate analysis, and a prediction model
      will be developed based on machine learning algorithm in a training set in which patients
      were collected from a retrospective study. And in the present study, an independent
      validation set will be collected and used to validate the prediction accuracy of the model.
