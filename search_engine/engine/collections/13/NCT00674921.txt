    
      Randomized double-blind placebo controlled equivalence trial to be conducted among consenting
      clinically healthy patients on HAART with 2 or more CD4 counts of 200 cells/ul or more for at
      least 3 months. The study will enable comparison of effects of randomized cessation of
      cotrimoxazole prophylaxis at 2 CD4-guided thresholds (200 Vs 350 cells/ul).

      Rationale for inclusion of the placebo-controlled design

        -  The double-blind placebo controlled approach is feasible and ethically justified in this
           equipoise situation to allow for concealment of allocated intervention among
           investigators and patients and avoids accidental unblinding of investigators to the
           allocated interventions by trial patients.

        -  Maintenance of continued cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among patients randomized to this
           intervention will be easier if there is no awareness that those patients randomized to
           cessation of prophylaxis have a relative advantage of reduced pill burden.

        -  It would be very difficult to maintain cessation of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among
           patients randomized to do so in our setting where cotrimoxazole is readily and cheaply
           available in drug shops, drug stores and pharmacies.

      First randomisation

      Patients who have been on HAART for at least 3 months and who have a confirmed CD4 count
      between 200 and 349 cells/ul will be randomized to continue prophylaxis with active
      cotrimoxazole or to cease prophylaxis with active cotrimoxazole but continue with ingestion
      of the placebo cotrimoxazole daily.

      Second randomization

      Patients who achieve a confirmed CD4 count of 350 cells/ul or more while on HAART will be
      randomized to continue prophylaxis with active cotrimoxazole or to cease prophylaxis with
      active cotrimoxazole but continue with ingestion of placebo cotrimoxazole daily. Some
      patients will have participated already in 1st randomization but others will be entering the
      trial at this stage for the first time.

      Rationale for 4 trial arms

      In order to assess the separate effects of cessation of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in trial
      patients at the 2 randomization stages above, those continuing with prophylaxis will be
      compared with those ceasing prophylaxis, necessitating 2 arms at each stage.
