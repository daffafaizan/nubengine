      responses and relapses can occur in a certain percent of diabetic patients showing as
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy. At present vitrectomy is the main intervention for those
      eyes with vitreous hemorrhage, proliferative membrane, and tractional retinal detachment. And
      the surgical procedure might be complicated because of intraoperative bleeding. And
      post-operative complications might be also involved. Perioperative use of intraocular
      anti-VEGF might be associated with less hemorrhage related complications and better visula
      acuity. This study will compare intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (ranibizumab) versus sham injection one week before surgery. The investigators tried
      to make sure whether pre-operative injection of ranibizuman can reduce reduce intra-operative
      bleeding, reduce the frequency of using endodiathermy, decrease surgical time, improve
      microcurculation of retina, and elevte best-corrected visual acuity.
