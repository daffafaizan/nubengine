      language, is surveyed preoperatively, as well as on postoperative day 1 and 3 after
      non-cardiac surgery. We showed in a pilot study that this score reveals a high sensitivity to
      detect patients with a disturbed health status through a detailed and time-consuming physical
      examination.We want to evaluate if short screening tools can be used to categorize patients
      with increased risk for developing postoperative complicationsTherefore, patients undergoing
      non-cardiac surgery are informed preoperatively about the study and written informed consent
      is obtained. Afterwards, the QoR-9, as well as validated preoperative risk scores are
      obtained. Relevant intra- and immediate postoperative factors are recorded. On postoperative
      day 1 and 3 patients perform the QoR-9. Postoperative complications during hospital stay are
      determined using the Clavien Dindo score by searching the patients 'record. After 6 months
      the patients are contacted via telephone and the QoR-9 is obtained. 6-months mortality is
      determined.
