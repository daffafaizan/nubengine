      self-expandable transcatheter valve for type-0 BAS than that for TAS, combined with "balloon
      sizing" strategy. But no prospective and randomized studies show the rationality and clinical
      outcomes of different sizing strategies of type-0 BAS with self-expandable transcatheter
      valve.

      AIM: To observe the clinical outcomes of the different valve sizing strategies treating
      type-0 BAS with self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) valve,
      compared with those of a standard sizing strategy of normal TAS.

      POPULATION: All patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis referred for aortic
      valve intervention will be screened for study eligibility. To be included subjects must be 65
      years or older, anatomical and technical eligible for both interventions, expected to survive
      more than 1 year after the intervention, and able to provide written informed consent. Study
      exclusion criteria include isolated aortic valve regurgitation or other significant valve
      disease, unstable preoperative condition.

      DESIGN: The project is a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Patients of type-0 BAS
      fulfilling all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized into either Down sizing
      group or Standard sizing group. Randomization will be 1:1 with 53 subjects in each group.
      Meanwhile patients of TAS fulfilling all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be included
      as a Standard group in this study. Screening and inclusion will commence in September 2015.
      Inclusion is expected to last 3 years, and subjects will be followed for 5 years.
