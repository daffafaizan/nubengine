      patients with ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) lymph node involvement. The relative roles of
      different treatment modalities are not clear. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may result in dramatic responses in patients with pulmonary
      adenocarcinoma carrying EGFR activating mutations. In case reports, the efficacy of
      perioperative EGFR-TKI therapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR gene
      mutations was satisfactory. Although no prospective data support the use of EGFR-TKIs as
      induction therapy in stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC, their low toxicity profile and the possibility of a
      rapid tumor response suggests that prospective trials are required. Therefore, this study
      evaluated the value of induction erlotinib therapy in IIIA-N2 NSCLC selected by EGFR gene
      analysis and explored a new treatment strategy for this subset. Erlotinib specifically
      targets the EGFR TK domain, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various
      forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding
      site of the receptor.
