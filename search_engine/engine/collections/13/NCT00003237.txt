      adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or cardia receiving
      post-operative adjuvant paclitaxel plus cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo esophagogastrectomies within 4-12 weeks prior to the study.
      Patients receive intravenous paclitaxel over 3 hours on day 1, followed by intravenous
      cisplatin. Treatment is repeated every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients exhibiting disease
      recurrence or unacceptable toxic effects are removed from the study. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and then every 12 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued within 16 months.
