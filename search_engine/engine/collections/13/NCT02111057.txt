      have undergone arthroplasty. RA patients were recruited prior to elective THA and TKA and
      prospectively followed. Clinicians evaluated RA clinical characteristics 0-2 weeks before and
      6 weeks post surgery. Patients answered questions regarding disease activity including
      self-reported joint counts and flare status weekly for 6 weeks.
