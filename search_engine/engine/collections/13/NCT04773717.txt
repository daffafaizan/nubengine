      Central Department of Intensive Care in Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Hospital
      Kaunas Clinics.

      Participants were randomly assigned to a placebo or ascorbic acid group in a 1:1 ratio. They
      were resuscitated according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines. Additionally, they
      received an intravenous infusion of ascorbic acid either placebo. The dose of ascorbic acid
      was 200mg/kg/24h divided into four equal parts for 96 hours. Sublingual microcirculatory
      measurements were obtained, using an incident dark field (IDF) device.
