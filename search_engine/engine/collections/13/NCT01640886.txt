    
      This is a multi-center clinical study to investigate the effectiveness of the performance of
      the KeyPath MRSA/MSSA Blood Culture Test - BTA. The KeyPath test is performed directly on
      positive blood culture specimens from bioMerieux BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles. The
      MicroPhage test will be compared to standards and market available tests with similar
      indications (comparators). It is estimated that the study will last 3-4 months depending on
      the accural rate at the institutions.
