    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, dose-finding, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and popPK of three different
      doses of OMT-28 given once daily versus placebo in patients with persistent AF. At
      randomization, the duration of the current episode of persistent AF must be shown to be
      greater than 7 days and not greater than 3 months, as confirmed by two ECGs (one ECG must be
      a 12-lead ECG) and further patient enquiry (including doctor visits, hospital admissions,
      symptom onset, etc.).

      A sample size re-evaluation will be performed to avoid an underpowered study because of
      imprecise estimates for the study population or overoptimistic parameter estimates.
      Therefore, an interim analysis will re-evaluate sample size assumptions after approximately
      15 patients per study arm (~50 % of planned sample) have completed the treatment phase (Visit
      8) of the study. Predefined rules will govern the decision for adjustment of sample size.

      Patients will be monitored for cardiac events throughout the study using an Implantable
      Cardiac Monitor (ICM). Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Blood samples will be
      collected in pre-specified windows for popPK analysis and at pre-specified timepoints for
      PK/PD analysis. Patients will be provided with a diary to record timing of drug
      administration and clinical symptoms while not on site. Diaries will be reviewed and checked
      for compliance at each non-resident visit to the clinical site.
