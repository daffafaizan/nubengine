      inclusion criteria who provide written informed consent will be randomized at the time of
      enrollment to one of two cohorts engaged in a standardized exercise regimen based on delivery
      method, either in-person or via telehealth. Patient function will be assessed using the Timed
      Up and Go (TUG) test; Stairs Test; which evaluates aerobic ability, resistance, agility,
      balance, and posture; and given a score on the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. Patient
      quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General
      (FACT-G) survey. Outcomes for the cohorts will be compared over time.
