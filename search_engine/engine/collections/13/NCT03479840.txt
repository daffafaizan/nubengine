      Interventional or operative treatment of patients is associated with improvement in SYTAX
      score after PCI so called residual SYNTAX score. The higher the SYNTAX score value the higher
      is the mortality. Whereas this is true for both young and old patients is debatable.
      Therefore we aim to investigate in this registry age-dependent impact of baseline and
      residual SYNTAX score on 1- and 2-year mortality after PCI
