      Chemoprophylaxis significantly improves quality of life in these children. In Uganda
      Chloroquine is the drug of choice for prophylaxis and yet it's effectiveness is limited due
      to high levels of resistance throughout the country. Intermittent presumptive treatment with
      sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine a new approach to malaria prevention, has shown great potential
      in reducing incidence of malaria and anemia among high risk groups such as pregnant women and
      infants. However no studies have been done in Uganda to determine if presumptive treatment
      with sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine reduces incidence of malaria among high risk group such as
      children with sickle cell anaemia.

      We calculated a sample size of 110 patients in each group for a power of 95% assuming that
      the incidence of malaria in children receiving weekly chloroquine will be 0.36 and those
      receiving presumptive treatment with sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine the incidence would be 0.16
      according to (schellenberg et al )
