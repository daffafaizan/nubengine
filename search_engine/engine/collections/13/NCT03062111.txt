      laser technology. While TURP has historically been the gold standard, LEP has become more
      widespread and is arguably a safer and more effective therapy for the patient. TURP is still
      widely performed because it is a traditional therapy with decades of data to support its
      efficacy, despite higher volume of blood loss and risk for TUR syndrome. In comparison, there
      is some data demonstrating that Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate can have similar
      efficacy but may have longer operative times. The ProTouch laser is comparable to the Holmium
      laser but additionally provides improved hemostasis and tissue vaporization. There is little
      to no data comparing LEP with the ProTouch laser to TURP. This study will directly compare
      the efficacy of these two treatment methods by enrolling eligible subjects and comparing
      outcomes.
