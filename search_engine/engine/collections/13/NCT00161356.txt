      transplant patients. Liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome ®) has been shown in animals to be
      concentrated in the liver, lungs and leukocytes. It also has a long half-like making it a
      potentially attractive drug for prophylaxis in liver transplantation (OLT).

      We propose to administer a single (5mg/kg) dose of AmBisome ® following reperfusion of the
      new liver. Liver, subcutaneous fat, blood and bile samples will be analyzed for AMB levels
      1-2 hours after drug administration. Blood and bile, and body fluid samples will be
      sequentially analyzed for 3 weeks post transplant. This will be done in 50 consecutive
      patients. The incidence of fungal infections and adverse effects will be monitored for three
      months.

      Persistent AMB levels in blood bile and ascites, if found, will provide a good rationale for
      AmBisome ® prophylaxis for fungal infections in outpatients.
