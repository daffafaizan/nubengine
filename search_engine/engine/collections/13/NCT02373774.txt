      randomized clinical trial in an urban pediatric emergency department to determine if
      performing an ultrasound prior to lumbar puncture procedure improves success of the
      procedure.

      Patients will be block-randomized into two groups to receive procedural interspace selection
      via 1) standard anatomic palpation technique or 2) visualization with pre-procedural
      ultrasound (experimental group).

        1. Standard Anatomic Palpation Technique:

           Participants randomized to this group will receive standard of care treatment with
           providers using the palpation technique to select an interspace. As variations on the
           palpation technique exist, the investigators will provide a standardized educational
           cognitive aid that clinicians can use for this approach.

        2. Pre-Procedural Ultrasound:

      Clinicians will first use the standard palpation technique to select an interspace for
      ultrasound evaluation. A select group of pediatric emergency medicine attendings and fellows
      who have already trained to a mastery standard with the ultrasound protocol will then conduct
      the pre-procedural ultrasound. The clinicians performing the lumbar puncture will be provided
      the following information to conduct the lumbar puncture:

      i. Assessment for fluid at the level selected (and the number of interspaces above that have
      fluid without conus present)

      ii. Measurements of appropriate angle and depth

      iii. Evaluation of any overlying vasculature

      Post-Lumbar Puncture:

      After the lumbar puncture, infants randomized to both groups will receive a post-procedural
      ultrasound scan performed by one of the mastery trained ultrasound physicians.
