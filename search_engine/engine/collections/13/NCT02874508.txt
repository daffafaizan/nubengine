      al., 2008). The POISE study revealed 5% of patients undergoing a non-cardiac surgery suffer
      perioperative myocardial infarcts going along with a perioperative mortality rate of about
      11,6% (Devereaux et al., 2011). Possibilities to preoperatively identify patients at risk are
      limited (Devereaux und Sessler, 2015; Gillmann et al., 2014) and prophylactic interventions
      are not yet established or controversial (Devereaux und Sessler, 2015).

      Selected leukocyte subpopulations have been demonstrated to be associated with higher risk
      for cardiovascular events (Berg et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2008; Engelbertsen et al., 2012;
      Kotfis et al., 2015; Rogacev et al., 2011; Rogacev et al., 2012).The aim of this study is to
      analyze whether surgical stress (non-cardiac surgery) induces a quantitative change in one or
      several of these leukocyte subpopulations and whether quantitative changes are associated
      with perioperative cardiovascular events. Therefore, high-risk cardio-vascular patients
      scheduled for non-cardiac surgery will be recruited. Blood will be drawn at predefined time
      points before surgery and up to three days postoperatively. Leukocytes will be analyzed by
      flow cytometry. During 30 day follow up adverse cardiovascular events will be recorded. ECGs
      will be recorded preoperatively and on post-OP day 3. High-sensitive cardiac Troponin T will
      be measured prior to the operation and on post-OP day one to three. The patient chart will be
      screened for cardio vascular events up to day 30. A telephone interview will be performed to
      detect cardiovascular events after discharge until post-OP day 30.
