      series to measure structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal
      nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is
      conducted in normal volunteers of various non-Caucasian ethnic group, and data will be
      combined with Caucasian subjects to be representative of the US population: (1) Hispanic
      Descent, (2) Black or African American Descent, (3) Asian Descent, (4) American Indian or
      Alaskan Native Descent. This study will complement the previous study S-2012-1 NORM-cc, in
      which normal data from Caucasian individuals were collected.

      The main goal of the study is to provide the range of these structural parameters in normal
      eyes. The study will include at least 87 (enrollment target: 135) normal volunteers; each
      study site will recruit at least 29 (target: 45) subjects with an age range of 18 to 90 years
      and an approximately equal number of females and males. All subjects will undergo Spectralis
      OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination, disc photography and visual field
      testing in one single visit. All examinations performed on the subjects are non-significant
      risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for marketing in Europe and in the
      U.S. Total study duration including IRB approval is anticipated to not exceed 4 months.
