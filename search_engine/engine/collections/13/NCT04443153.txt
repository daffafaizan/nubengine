    
      Four cohorts of about 25 participants each (expected retention 20 per cohort). Each cohort
      will continue for ~7 months. Following recruitment, screening, and a run-in period of SAP,
      participants will be randomized into one of two groups: escalation vs. de-escalation of
      devices and function. Each treatment modality (SAP - Sensor-Augmented Pump therapy, PF -
      Personalized Feedback, DSS - Decision Support Systems) will continue for about 8 weeks, with
      the last 4 weeks used to assess glucose variability (GV) from CGM data.
