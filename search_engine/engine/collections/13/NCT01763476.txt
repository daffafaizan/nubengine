    
      This is a single-centre, prospective, randomized study to be conducted in Bad Krozingen
      (Germany). A total of 80 subjects will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a
      1:1 basis to either drug-coated balloon angioplasty or atherectomy and drug-coated balloon
      angioplasty for infrapopliteal use in subjects with long de-novo stenosis (â‰¥6cm) and
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease (Rutherford 3, 4, or 5). IVUS of the target lesion
      prior and after intervention will be performed in 15 patients of each group during index
      procedure. All subjects will undergo a repeat angiography at 3 months to assess the primary
      endpoint of In-Segment Binary Restenosis. Follow-up visits are scheduled at 3, 6, 12 months.
