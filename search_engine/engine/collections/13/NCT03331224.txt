      (non-variceal) are identified (Rockall Score > 6) and randomized into either endoscopic
      treatment with the OTSC [Over The Scope Clip] or endoscopic standard therapy. 100 Patients
      are planned. Hypothesis: Endoscopic therapy with OTSC is superior to standard therapy
      regarding technical success and rebleeding.
