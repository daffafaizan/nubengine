    
      DP001 is a vitamin D analog that has been shown to stimulate bone formation in pre-clinical
      studies. In a Phase 1B study of postmenopausal women, an increase in the bone formation
      marker, osteocalcin, was evident without an increase in serum calcium. The aim of this study
      is to determine if 1-year administration of DP001 to postmenopausal women with osteopenia
      results in a significant increase in BMD at doses that are safe and well tolerated.
