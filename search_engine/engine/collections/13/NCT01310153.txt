      better dorsal lung expansion, less vagal response from suctioning and less agitation
      secondary to the righting reflex.

      This study will compare 1033 term babies divided by randomization into two groups prone and
      supine. During the study, care givers will monitor and record incidence and severity of
      Respiratory Distress, Use of FiO2 or respiratory support, admissions to NICU.
