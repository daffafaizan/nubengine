      acuity training to their lower back in the absence of movement, experienced immediate
      positive changes in pain ratings and spinal movements. These changes, however, where only
      measured immediate post-intervention. This study aims to use a similar design of sensory
      discrimination for LBP, but will include a sensory discrimination home exercise program and
      compare groups at a follow-up visit for any difference between groups (48-96 hours) of the
      immediate changes. Changes will be assessed for pain and back and leg movement.
