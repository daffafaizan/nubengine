        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated
           with reduced-intensity allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, including photopheresis,
           total body irradiation, and pentostatin.

        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the engraftment rate of donor cells in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the extent and duration of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-arm, two-stage, multicenter phase II study.

        -  Preparative Regimen: Patients undergo photopheresis using methoxsalen on days -7 and -6
           and receive pentostatin intravenously (IV )continuously on days -5 and -4. Total body
           irradiation is administered on days -3 and -2 for a total of 3 doses.

        -  Transplantation: Allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells are infused on
           day 0.

        -  Acute graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV on days
           -1 to 30 and then orally every 12 hours. Cyclosporine dose is then tapered beginning
           after day 50 and continuing for 6 months in the absence of GVHD. Once cyclosporine dose
           is significantly decreased, oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is then administered twice
           a day. MMF dose is then tapered for 12 months in the absence of GVHD. Patients also
           receive methotrexate IV on days 1 and 3.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients would be accrued for this study within 2.1 years.
