        1. To examine several potential mechanisms by which varenicline functions as an effective
           medication for tobacco addiction: a) nicotine reinforcement (forced-choice procedure),
           b) nicotine-seeking behavior (operant response task), c) cue-elicited craving, and d)
           performance impairment and craving after overnight tobacco deprivation.

        2. To validate our laboratory measures by using a medication with known efficacy in the
           treatment of tobacco addiction.

      Study population

      The study will enroll 50 healthy adult smokers to attain 25 completers.

      Design

      The study is a placebo-controlled, crossover design comparing the effects of varenicline and
      placebo.

      Outcome Measures

      During cue-reactivity sessions, primary measures include tobacco craving, mood, and autonomic
      responsivity (heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance, and skin temperature). During
      forced-choice sessions, the primary measure is the percentage of nicotine cigarette puffs
      chosen during choice trials. During operant response sessions, primary measures include
      breakpoint (final ratio completed), total number of responses, and number of cigarette puffs
      earned and taken. During the tobacco deprivation session, primary measures include
      self-reported withdrawal, tobacco craving, mood, and cognitive task performance (accuracy and
      response time).

      Secondary study measures include baseline demographic and smoking history, level of nicotine
      dependence, tobacco craving, and mood.
