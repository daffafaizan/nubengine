      enrolled and randomized into treated and control groups. In the 10 ACP treated patients the
      stem cells were injected into the ischemic gastrocnemius muscle. The 10 control patients were
      treated with the conventional therapy. Physical examination, a treadmill walking test were
      performed, ankle brachial index (ABI), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcO2) were measured at
      baseline, 1 and 3 months later. Digital substraction angiography and SF-36 quality-of-life
      (QoL) questionnaire were also performed at baseline and 3 months later.
