      pain (including mixed pain) will receive loxapine during four 14-days treatment episodes. The
      dosage for episode 1 (Days 1-14) will be 10 mg b.i.d., dosages for episodes 2, 3, and 4 will
      be defined by taking into account tolerability and analgesic efficacy of the former episode.
      In case of an acceptable tolerability and if a clinically relevant analgesic efficacy is not
      reached, loxapine dosage will be increased (2nd Episode 10 mg t.i.d, 3rd Episode 20 mg
      b.i.d., 4th episode 20 mg t.i.d.). In case of an acceptable tolerability and if a clinically
      relevant analgesic efficacy is reached, loxapine dosage will not be changed. If clinically
      relevant (serious) adverse events ((S)AEs) occur, loxapine dosage will be reduced or the
      treatment will be interrupted or stopped irrespective of the analgesic efficacy. A clinically
      relevant pain reduction / analgesic efficacy is defined by an at least 30% decrease or an
      absolute decrease of two scale units compared to baseline using 11-point numeric pain rating
      scale. Patients will receive loxapine as add-on treatment to their usual (analgesic) care.
