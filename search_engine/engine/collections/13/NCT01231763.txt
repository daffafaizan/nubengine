      AIDS epidemic in 1981 (1). Each year, AIDS continues to claim the lives of millions of
      people, with an estimated two million deaths worldwide in 2008 (2). Heterosexual transmission
      of HIV accounts for the majority of new infections and disproportionately affects women both
      in the United States and globally (2, 3). There is an urgent need for agents to prevent the
      sexual transmission of HIV, particularly agents that may be controlled by women.

      Quick dissolve films such as ListereneÂ® Breath Strips have been developed for inexpensive
      delivery of drugs and vitamins. As products for HIV prevention, quick dissolve films offer a
      host of potential advantages including low cost, control by the receptive partner, discreet
      and applicator-free use, low mess, portability, easy storage, stability, targeting to site of
      exposure, reduction of systemic toxicity by bypassing first-pass metabolism, and the
      incorporation of multiple active microbicidal compounds (4, 5).

      In the course of developing agents for HIV prevention, determination of valued
      characteristics is important for product refinement and for enhancement of future use
      likelihood. Knowledge regarding acceptability can also inform product promotion and
      educational campaigns (6).
