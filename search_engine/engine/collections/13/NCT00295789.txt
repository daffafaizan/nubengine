      curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy, still remains poor. Recently,
      cisplatin plus paclitaxel for palliative chemotherapy were reported to improve the response
      rate and progression-free interval compared to cisplatin alone and has been shown as a new
      appropriate regimen. However, more effective and/or less toxic combinations are needed.
      Carboplatin as a single agent has less response rate but less overall toxicity than
      cisplatin. Particularly, because less nephrotoxicity does not require hydration and less
      neurotoxicity enables 3hrs administration of paclitaxel in the combination, out patient
      therapy becomes possible and patients' quality of life must improve. Therefore, we planned to
      evaluate the benefits of less toxicity of the chemotherapy containing paclitaxel and
      carboplatin, which could reduce the hospitalised days, in comparison with the standard
      chemotherapy containing paclitaxel and cisplatin. This clinical trial is targeted on the
      patients in Japan with incurable cervical cancer diagnosed by means of image.
