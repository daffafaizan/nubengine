      characterized by chronic, irreversible airflow obstruction. Poor sleep quality and insomnia
      are well described phenomena in patients with COPD. Several studies suggest sleep disturbance
      adversely affects quality of life and may worsen daytime pulmonary function in COPD patients.
      Improving sleep quality in patients with COPD, therefore, may not only improve health
      quality, but also attenuate the decline in daytime pulmonary function.

      Previous studies investigating the effects of inhaled bronchodilators on sleep quality in
      COPD have shown conflicting results. These conflicting data prompted us to perform a
      retrospective study on patients with COPD and co-existing sleep apnea (OSA) investigating the
      effects of mechanical lung function impairment and lung hyperinflation on sleep. Our study
      found a significant correlation between increased lung hyperinflation and reduced sleep
      efficiency (a measure of sleep quality), and this relationship was preserved in a
      multivariable regression model.

      We hypothesize that Advair Diskus improves sleep quality by reducing lung hyperinflation in
      COPD. To test this hypothesis, we propose a double-blinded, placebo controlled cross-over
      study of Advair Diskus in patients with COPD and lung hyperinflation.

      It was mutually decided by the sponsor and principal investigator to terminate the study
      early due to study subject enrollment difficulties.
