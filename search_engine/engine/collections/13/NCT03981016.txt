    
      Brain metastases (BM) represent the first cause of tumors of the central nervous system.
      Mortality, morbidity (cognitive disorders, neurological deficits, etc.) and their
      consequences on the quantity and the quality of life are very high. BM represent a real
      public health problem. The incidence is increasing related to the ageing of the population
      and the increase of cancer patient's survival rate. The medico-surgical care has highly
      evolved (neurosurgical progress, radiosurgery, stereotaxic radiotherapy and new chemo and
      targeted therapy).

      Every histological or biological profile requires a specific evaluation, and management.
      Clinical trials are the reference to establish the efficacy and the toxicity of the new
      processes, but usually answer only at a single question and for very selected patients.

      For this reason, the SIRIC Montpellier Cancer proposes to develop a prospective and regional
      Clinical Database Project and regional biological collection (blood and tumor samples), which
      is an expanding data collection designed to contribute to a better understand the patient's
      management with brain metastases including quality of life and neuropsychological/cognitive
      aspects.
