      to traditional therapy, particularly in patients with advanced immunosuppression. An
      intervention aimed at prevention of recurrent sinus disease in HIV-infected patients appears
      to be warranted.

      Patients receive 21-42 days of antibiotic therapy for the defining episode of sinusitis.
      Following discontinuation of antibiotics, screening evaluations are performed. Within 7 days
      following completion of antibiotics, patients with clinical resolution begin 14 +/- 3 days of
      decongestant therapy with oral Deconsal II, a drug combining pseudoephedrine, a decongestant,
      and guaifenesin, an expectorant. Following decongestant therapy, patients undergo entry
      evaluations, including nasal endoscopy and sinus radiograph. Patients with continued clinical
      resolution and no purulence on endoscopy are then randomized to receive decongestant alone or
      in combination with nasal steroid (beclomethasone dipropionate) or antibiotic (cefuroxime
      axetil) or both. Treatment continues for a minimum of 52 weeks and a maximum of 104 weeks.
      Patients are followed at weeks 4, 8, and 12 and every 8 weeks thereafter.
