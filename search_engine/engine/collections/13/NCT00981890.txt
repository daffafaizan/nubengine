      higher than that of primary malignant brain tumours. The reported median survival of patients
      with brain metastases is only 1-2 months with corticosteroids and 5-7 months with whole brain
      radiotherapy (WBRT). But with improvements in neuroimaging, brain metastases are being
      diagnosed more frequently and with a lower burden of disease, such that approximately 50-60%
      of patients have 1 to 4 brain metastases at diagnosis. In these patients, stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS), a single high dose of radiation delivered with high precision to the
      target lesion, is being used increasingly as an alternative to surgical resection or as an
      adjunct to WBRT. The addition of SRS to WBRT has provided improvements in local control and
      functional autonomy for patients with oligometastatic brain disease, supporting the
      hypothesis that SRS increases efficacy against tumours resistant to the significantly lower
      doses used in WBRT.

      SRS can accomplish destruction of a defined intracranial target through precise targeting of
      a high dose of radiation with a sharp dose fall off at the target boundaries and minimal
      damage to surrounding tissue. Brain metastases are well suited for SRS as they are often
      small, radiographically well-circumscribed, pseudo-spherical tumors that are
      non-infiltrative, and they are often located at the gray-white junction, where toxicity to
      critical structures is minimal. SRS toxicity is low (<5%).
