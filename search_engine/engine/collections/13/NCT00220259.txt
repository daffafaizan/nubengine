      increasingly prescribed to patients with CF to combat lung inflammation. Despite five
      published studies, a Cochrane systematic review has concluded that there is not enough
      evidence of either benefit or harm. The number of CF patients already taking ICS in the UK
      means recruitment into conventional studies has proved difficult.

      Aims: to test the feasibility and safety of withdrawal of ICS in CF by performing a study of
      randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal of ICS in children and adults already taking them.
      The results will be used to determine the feasibility of a future prospective study to prove
      whether starting ICS in CF patients not already on them, and those successfully withdrawn,
      leads to benefit (in lung function and chest exacerbations) and/or harm, compared to placebo.

      Methods: We will study 240 children and adults in 12 centres. We have matching placebo and
      Flixotide metered dose inhalers to be used through a Volumatic, so any subjects currently on
      Pulmicort or Becotide will switch to Flixotide 2 months during the run-in phase, and all
      subjects will use their ICS through a spacer device. Patients will be randomised to continue
      on ICS or take placebo for 6 months, in a double-blind fashion. Primary outcome is time to
      1st exacerbation; secondary ones are decline in lung function, new courses of antibiotics and
      rescue bronchodilator usage.
