      questioned and subglottis rather than cricoid is considered the narrowest part with the shape
      of airway defined as elliptical with the subglottis as the narrowest region.

      This is the first study using imaging modality (2D CT images) to determine the airway shape
      and dimensions in neonates and infants. The purpose of this investigation was to determine
      any differences in airway shape between infants and children, and to evaluate the dimensional
      transition between the subglottic area and the cricoid ring.
