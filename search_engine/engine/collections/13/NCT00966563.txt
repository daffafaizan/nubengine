    
      Mangafodipir, manganese (Mn) dipyridoxyl diphosphate (MnDPDP) and its lipophile metabolite Mn
      dipyridoxyl diethylene diamide (MnPLED), are catalytic antioxidants and iron chelators. In
      preclinical studies these agents reduce oxidative stress induced injuries related to
      chemotherapy of cancer and to reperfusion/reoxygenation of ischemic/hypoxic myocardium.
      Accordingly, in an in vivo pig model of AMI metabolite MnPLED applied at end of ischemia and
      during reperfusion reduced myocardial infarct size by 55 %. Mangafodipir most likely
      activates salvage pathways and prevents lethal reperfusion injuries.

      Other advantages are that mangafodipir is already approved as a contrast agent for MRI of
      liver, and that the experience for more than a decade reveals a high safety with minor and
      tolerable side-effects.

      The present study will include 20 patients treated for their first documented AMI. They will
      after admission to hospital undergo primary PCI. Reopening of an occluded coronary artery
      will be preceded by iv. infusion of mangafodipir or placebo in two groups , each consisting
      of 10 patients. The primary endpoint will be release to plasma of commonly accepted
      biomarkers of myocardial injury (Troponin T and CK-MB) measured at admission and 6 hours
      after PCI. The secondary endpoints include the accumulated release of plasma biomarkers over
      48 hours and direct measurement of the final myocardial infarct size at 6-10 weeks after PCI.
