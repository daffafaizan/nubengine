    
      This study is an extension study to the VEG110655 study. The parent study, VEG110655, was
      designed to evaluate whether pazopanib 800 mg daily for 52 weeks will prolong progression
      free survival (PFS) in women diagnosed with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal
      cancer. These women will have obtained stable disease, a complete remission, or a partial
      remission after debulking surgery and at least five cycles of chemotherapy (taxane/platinum).
      This extension study will evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes of pazopanib monotherapy and
      placebo in an Asian population with the same indication as the parent study.
