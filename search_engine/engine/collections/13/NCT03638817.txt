      (eltrombopag) will be effective and safe and will avoid requirement of PC administration in a
      majority of IT patients Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin mimetic available orally, not
      licenced for the treatment of IT. Preliminary data in short series of IT patients indicate
      that eltrombopag, at the doses used in primary immune thrombocytopenia, increases the
      platelet counts after 2-4 weeks of treatment and reduces spontaneous bleeding in a
      significant proportion of subjects. The tolerance of short-term treatment is good. The
      experience of eltrombopag for the management of perioperative thrombocytopenia in IT is
      anecdotic. Avoiding the administration of platelet concentrates in these patients, especially
      children, would represent a direct benefit by preventing adverse reactions to transfusion of
      blood products and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) immunisation.

      Eltrombopag will be prescribed after the inclusion visit at the standard dose of 50 mg/day
      with dose adjustment on the platelet count (+/- 25 mg) after 2 weeks, for a maximum of 4
      weeks before the invasive procedure. If the predefined safety level of platelet count
      required for the procedure is reached, the treatment will be discontinued and the patient
      operated without prophylactic administration of PC. In case of bleeding of undetermined cause
      per-and post-operatively, rescue PC will be given.

      Clinical and biological follow-up will be performed until the end-of-study visit, 4 weeks
      after the intake of the last tablet of eltrombopag.
