      reduced blood loss during surgery, less postoperative pain and complication. During RALRP,
      steep trendelenberg postion and pneumoperitoneum are required essentially, and this is for
      the acquisition of adequite surgical field. However, such position and pneumoperitoneum can
      result in harmful hemodynamic change. Previous study demonstrated that patients of RALRP
      showed 12.5% increase of ONSD.

      The relationship of ONSD and increase of intracranial pressure has been proved previously
      through many studies. Recent meta analysis showed that ONSD measurement for the monitor of
      ICP demonstrated that sensitivity 0.9, specificity 0.85 and ROC cuve 0.983.

      In addition, increase of ONSD during RALRP can be affected by the degree of arterial pressure
      and end tidal CO2 increase.

      This study is designed to see the effect of arterial pressure regulation on the increase of
      ONSD
