      treatment groups (400 and 600 mg daily), 60 to placebo, and 60 to the Actos® group. Patients
      in the Actos® group will receive Actos® 30 mg/daily for the first eight weeks of the
      treatment phase and Actos® 45 mg/daily for the last 16 weeks of the treatment phase. Patients
      in the MBX-102 400 mg group and MBX-102 600 mg group will continue MBX-102 400 mg and 600 mg,
      respectively for the full 24 weeks. All study medication will be over-encapsulated; thus,
      each patient will take two blinded capsules each day containing either placebo, MBX-102 or
      Actos®. This sample size provides the minimum number expected to ensure a power of at least
      90% in detecting a difference of 0.64% in HbA1c between the placebo and experimental
      treatment, using a two-tailed, two-sample t-test with type 1 error of 0.05, when the pooled
      standard deviation is ≤ 1.0%, and the discontinuation rate is ≤ 12.5%.
