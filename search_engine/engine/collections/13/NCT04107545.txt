      each subject will perform 3 experimental sessions of 2 visits each : i) two visits during a
      period of maintenance of body weight (CON); ii) two visits during weight loss (WL); iii) two
      visits during a weight regain (WG). The order of the periods (maintenance, loss or weight
      gain) will depend on the dynamics of the weight variations of each athlete (endurance sport
      and weight class) during the season and will therefore be individualized.

      All experiments will be conducted in the same way for the CON, WL or WG session.

      Upon arrival, each subject will perform a resting metabolism with continuous measurement of
      heart rate variability (≈ 30 min). Then, from 8:30, blood and saliva samples will be taken (≈
      10 min). Then (≈ 8:45), they will perform anthropometric and body composition measurements
      (waist circumference, hip circumference, bioimpedance, DXA) (≈ 30 min). Following these
      measurements (≈ 9:15), the subjects will eat a standardized breakfast and the report to food
      will be evaluated thanks to the Leeds Foods Preference Questionnaire before and after the
      meal. They will then be asked (≈ 10h) to complete the Profile of Mood State Questionnaire to
      measure the athlete's psychological state. Participants will then perform a measurement of
      muscle function (≈ 10:30).

      During the second visit, carried out between 1 and 5 days after the first visit, the maximum
      aerobic capacity of the athletes will be evaluated by mid-morning stress test.
