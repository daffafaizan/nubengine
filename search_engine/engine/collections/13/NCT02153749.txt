      smokers to the following conditions: 1) brief training in cognitive regulation of craving 2)
      mindfulness-based training, and 3) control or no training. Training will be delivered in 6x1
      hour computerized sessions over four weeks. Control subjects simply fill out assessments
      during their visits. Participants who were randomized into the cognitive or mindfulness
      training complete Regulation of Craving (ROC) training sessions of approximately 60-90
      minutes. If randomized into the cognitive regulation training, subjects will be trained to
      use a cognitive strategy that instructs them to think of all the negative outcomes associated
      with continued cigarette smoking. If randomized into the MBT-based regulation training,
      subjects will be trained to use a mindfulness strategy that instructs them to notice and
      accept their feelings of craving without judgment or intent to act upon them. After all
      training sessions are completed, there is a 4 week and 12 week follow-up. The investigators
      will evaluate the effects of training on craving and regulation of craving measured by
      self-report and functional magnetic resonance imaging during the Regulation of Craving(ROC)
      task administered pre- and post- treatment, as well as smoking.
