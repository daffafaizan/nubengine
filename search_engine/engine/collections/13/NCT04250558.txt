      extremity amputation (below the knee, through the knee or above the knee) evaluating bone
      perfusion and viability using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging at several steps
      during surgical procedure. The data collected in this study will inform the development of
      methodology and thresholds around providing surgeons with objective data regarding critically
      injured bone in the setting of musculoskeletal trauma and/or bone infection. This will
      improve our management of and decrease variation associated with management of these
      disabling conditions.
