      [Mps1]) activity. TTK is a protein that is important in regulating cell growth, and cell
      death, and ensuring proper division. Many tumors are shown to make too much TTK. When there
      is too much TTK produced, it is believed to contribute to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and
      division leading to additional mutations in cancer cells. Therefore, it is believed that
      blocking this protein from working will lead to cancer cell death, stopping tumors from
      growing or shrinking them.

      This study has two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

      The dose escalation part tested different dose levels of study drug in groups of patients to
      find the highest dose of study drug that can be given safely to patients (called maximum
      tolerated dose or MTD). This part of the study is now complete.

      The expansion part will further assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of the MTD found in
      the escalation part of the study in additional group of patients.
