      screening for alcohol problems, to compare different approaches to encouraging screening, and
      to estimate the effects of minimal and more extensive feedback in preparation for a future
      alcohol web-based brief intervention study. To do so, 4300 freshman adult college students
      will be randomized to receive an electronic mail request to complete a web alcohol screening
      test using an alcohol-specific or a general wellness approach. The primary outcome is the
      proportion of respondents who complete alcohol screening. Additional outcomes include
      readiness to change drinking, help-seeking, alcohol consumption and consequences. The results
      of this pilot study will provide information useful to 1) colleges deciding how best to
      implement universal screening for hazardous alcohol use, and 2) in the preparation of a
      larger study of web-based screening and brief intervention for hazardous drinking in college
      students.
