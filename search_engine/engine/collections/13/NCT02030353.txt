      United States, and in North Carolina (NC), African American women are more likely to die from
      breast cancer compared to women of other races/ethnicities. Given this disparity and with
      approximately 90,000 African American breast cancer survivors in NC, it is important to
      identify modifiable factors that can help improve survival among this population. Behavioral
      interventions that promote weight management among breast cancer survivors can help reduce
      risks for prevalent comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and
      potentially improve prognosis and survival. While lifestyle interventions have shown promise
      in improving body weight in breast cancer survivors, none have focused on weight gain
      prevention in African American breast cancer survivors, nor evaluated the use of frequent
      self-weighing as a self-regulation strategy.

      Regular self-weighing has been effectively used as an approach for weight maintenance that
      helps individuals monitor daily weight fluctuations and make small changes in energy balance
      behaviors. Given that the frequency of self-weighing among breast cancer survivors is
      unknown, and the importance of self-regulation behaviors for weight maintenance is well
      established, extending previous work to prevent weight gain among breast cancer survivors is
      a critical next step for optimizing cancer outcomes. It is unknown whether self-weighing and
      activity monitoring is a feasible strategy for breast cancer survivors to monitor weight
      changes and regulate their energy balance. Thus, this three-arm, pilot randomized controlled
      trial will evaluate two behavioral self-regulation interventions for weight gain prevention
      (self-regulation or self-regulation plus activity monitoring) compared to a delayed control
      group among 45 female African-American post-treatment breast cancer survivors. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Self-regulation intervention with activity
      monitoring (n=15); Self-regulation intervention (n=15); and Delayed control (n=15).
