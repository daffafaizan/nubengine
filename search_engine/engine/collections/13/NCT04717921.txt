      antidepressant drugs in the world. In previous studies, SSRIs have been found to cause an
      increase in brain gray matter volume in patients with major depression (MD). Optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive medical imaging method that displays biological
      tissue layers by taking high-resolution tomographic sections. Changes in the thickness of the
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), a layer of the ganglion cell complex in the retinal layer
      of the eye and composed of ganglion cell axons, occur due to axonal damage in the retinal
      nerve tissue. Since RNFL is similar to brain gray matter tissue, recently neurological and
      psychiatric studies have been conducted to provide data on the neurodegeneration that occurs
      in the brain by OCT. However, in a recent cross-sectional study, contrary to what was
      expected, thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer was detected in psychiatric patients
      using SSRI drugs compared to the healthy group, and this was attributed to a probable
      maculopathy caused by SSRIs in the eye. In this study, it is aimed to assess the probable
      cortical volume changes of the patients by measuring the changes in retinal nerve layers due
      to SSRI treatment in first-attack MD patients.
