      v12.2 Magnetic Resonance (MR) Perfusion and Diffusion Weighted Imaging ("investigational
      device") performance. Evaluation of MR Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast-Enhanced Perfusion
      Weighted Imaging (DSC-Perfusion), MR Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) and MR Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging (DTI) was compared to the predicate device, the Olea Sphere PACS with Perfusion and
      DWI Modules. MR DSC-Perfusion of the brain is a method for evaluating blood flow in the brain
      and producing optimized parametric maps that help visualize this blood flow. MR DWI is a
      method to evaluate the motion of water molecules within bodily tissues. MR DTI is an
      extension of DWI that allows extraction of the diffusion tensor. The purpose of this study is
      to demonstrate equivalent clinical quality between the investigational and predicate devices
      using a radiologist evaluation of key metrics which are applicable to MR DSC-Perfusion, MR
      DWI, and MR DTI images.
