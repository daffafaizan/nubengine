    
      To test the efficacy of a 12-week supervised, laboratory based program of an exercise
      videogame (EVG) program to increase time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
      (MVPA) and improve cardiovascular health and fitness indices compared to Standard and Control
      programs. Participants will be randomly assigned to (1) a supervised program of Exercise
      Videogames (EVG); (2) a supervised standard exercise program (Standard), using aerobic
      exercise equipment (e.g., treadmill, stationary bike); or (3) a Control condition. We will
      also examine the effect of home-based exercise videogames compared to a home-based standard
      PA program on MVPA maintenance during the 6-month follow up period. We will examine changes
      in cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., estimated VO2max), blood pressure, resting heart rate,
      body composition and blood lipids at baseline, week 12 and at 6-months follow up. We will
      also examine changes in theoretically-based cognitive and affective constructs associated
      with physical activity including: enjoyment, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, motivation,
      and goal-orientation.
