    
      knee osteoarthritis accounts for more than 80% of the total burden of the diseases. patients
      with knee osteoarthritis had worse spatiotemporal gait parameter and dynamic instabitity.
      there are significant hip muscle weakness in knee osteoarthritis. hip muscle weakness leads
      to improper alignment and stress in knee joint. hip muscle strength can affect knee joint
      loading and disease progression in knee osteoarthritis. muscles of the lower extremity play a
      critical role in the preservation of normal knee joint function by providing dynamic knee
      joint stability and shock absorption, while maintaining safe transfer of forces across the
      joint.
