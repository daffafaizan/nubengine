      malaria in inpatient neonates at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Bamako, Mali. The primary
      study endpoint will be the number of infants with malaria infection as detected by the
      positivity of one of the three malaria diagnosis assays. The secondary study endpoints will
      be: (1) the rate of congenital malaria, (2) the rate of acquired malaria, (3) the prevalence
      of antimalarial antibodies in neonates, and (4) the prevalence of specific hemoglobin types
      in the study population. Neonates of both sexes who weigh at least 2000g, are 0 - 28 days
      old, and are referred to the Unit of Reanimation and Neonatology of Hopital Gabriel Toure in
      Bamako, Mali, for inpatient care are eligible for enrollment in this two-year study. After
      informed parental consent is obtained, approximately 2 ml of venous blood will be collected
      for malaria diagnosis by OptiMal test, microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If in
      the clinician's judgment drawing blood is not feasible, a small blood sample will be obtained
      by heel prick from the infants and tested for the presence of malaria parasites. If any of
      the three infant malaria tests is positive, parenteral quinine will be administered as per
      the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) treatment guidelines. If malaria is detected in
      mothers, standard malaria therapy will be administered according to the National Malaria
      Control Program (NMCP) treatment guidelines. Blood will be obtained from mothers for
      molecular diagnosis of malaria infection and characterization of the genetic profile of
      mother's malaria infections.
