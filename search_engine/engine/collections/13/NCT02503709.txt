      I. To establish the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose of the combination
      of onalespib and AT7519M (CDKI AT7519).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of the combination of onalespib and AT7519M.

      II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of the combination of onalespib and AT7519M on HSP70
      expression and modulation of HSP90 client proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs), plasma, and tumor biopsies.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 4 (cycle 0 only).
      Patients then receive onalespib IV over 1 hour and CDKI AT7519 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4,
      8, and 11 (cycle 1 and subsequent cycles thereafter). Cycles repeat every 21 days (7 days for
      course 0 only) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
