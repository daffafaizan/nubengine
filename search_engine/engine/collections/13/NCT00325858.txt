      including: obstetrical, gynecological, orthopedic, abdominal, and oral surgery. The short
      elimination half-life of tramadol IR necessitates every 4-6 hour dosing to maintain optimal
      levels of analgesia in chronic pain. The study medication in this study is a once-daily,
      extended-release tramadol formulation. This is a 12-week multi-center, double-blind,
      randomized, dose-ranging, parallel-group, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled study. Patients with
      OA Functional Class I-III of the knee or hip (index joint) are eligible for participation, if
      appropriate criteria are met. During a 2-7 day washout period, the use of all analgesic
      medications will be discontinued. Eligible patients experiencing moderate to severe pain
      (<=40 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale) in the index joint to be evaluated and who meet all
      other study criteria will enter in a 2-week,double-blind titration period. During this
      period, patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with tramadol HCl ER 100 mg,
      200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg or placebo, once a day. Patients will be titrated to their assigned
      dose between study days 1 - 15 and will continue at that dose for the remainder of the study
      (Week 12). Efficacy and safety evaluations will be collected at study visits occurring at
      Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 or at early termination. Study medication will be discontinued at
      Week 12 and patients will return after 1 week for a post-treatment visit (Week 13). Patients
      with unmanageable pain or with unacceptable side effects will be discontinued from the study
      and alternate analgesic therapy initiated, as appropriate.
