    
      215 women with breast cancer were evaluated for fertility preservation before chemotherapy.
      Of those, 79 elected to undergo controlled ovarian stimulation (COH) with letrozole and
      gonadotropins for embryo or oocyte cryopreservation. The 136 patients who declined served as
      controls.There were no significant differences between the study and control groups regarding
      age at diagnosis, breast cancer prognostic parameters (tumor size, grade, number of positive
      lymph nodes, estrogen receptor status, her2-neu overexpression and vascular space invasion),
      and chemotherapy regimens. There was no difference between the two groups in the projected 10
      year relapse, breast cancer specific mortality or overall mortality. There were 3 recurrences
      or contralateral breast cancers (2 distant, 1 locoregional) in the letrozole group, and 11 in
      the control group (9 distant, 1 locoregional, 1 contralateral breast).

      Comparison; breast cancer patients that underwent ovarian stimulation with
      letrozole+gonadotropins and those who declined ovarian stimulation.
