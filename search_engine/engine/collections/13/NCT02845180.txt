    
      This is a prospective, randomized, two arm, single center study to assess adipose tissue
      development and retention when an implantable allograft adipose matrix ('AAM') is injected in
      the abdominal subcutaneous tissue of healthy volunteers undergoing elective standard-of-care
      panniculectomy. This study will enroll ten (10) subjects. These subjects will be randomized
      to one of two study arms. Arm 1 will consist of five (5) subjects who will receive injections
      of AAM to be followed clinically for three (3) months duration, and arm 2 will consist of
      five (5) subjects who will receive injections of AAM to be followed clinically for six (6)
      months duration. At the point of completion of each arm, 3 or 6 months, the injected tissue
      will be surgically removed as part of the panniculectomy procedure. Samples of the AAM
      injected tissue areas and surrounding tissue will be obtained and processed for histologic
      evaluation.
