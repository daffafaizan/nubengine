      intervention in helping older adults quickly readjust their posture in order to recover from
      unexpected loss of equilibrium. An AMES device will be placed into operation at the
      University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Out-patient Rehabilitation Therapy Clinic
      at Fayetteville, Arkansas(AR), where we will recruit 20 healthy, but near-frail subjects. Ten
      of these participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment group, and the other 10 will
      be assigned into a control group that will not receive the AMES intervention. Before and
      after 12 weeks of training with the bipedal AMES device, ankle strength, range of motion,
      proprioception, and reaction time, as well as gait and whole-body stability following
      unexpected balance perturbations will be assessed. In addition to measuring sensorimotor
      impairment and static balance equilibrium,the incidence of falls in all 20 participants
      beginning with enrollment into the study for a total of 6 months will be tracked. A reduction
      in sensorimotor impairment, an improvement in dynamic balance, and a reduction in fall
      incidence in the treatment group, but not in the control group is expected.
