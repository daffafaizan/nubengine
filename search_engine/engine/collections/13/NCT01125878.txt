      visits each lasting approximately 4 hours. All visits should be done in 2 months. We are
      looking for healthy, non-smoking, premenopausal female volunteers older than 18 with no
      medical history of diabetics, heart, lung, kidney, stomach, or liver disease.

      The initial screening visit will determine subject eligibility through height, weight and
      waist circumference measurements, blood glucose finger prick and eating, health and mood
      surveys.

      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will have four study visits. All study
      visits will be scheduled according to each individual subject's menstrual cycle. At each
      visit subject will be asked to eat the cookie bar and then answer questions about their
      feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat. Subject will continue to answer questions
      about their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat at specific time points up to 3
      hours after eating the yogurt. After 3 hours a lunch meal will be served. The lunch meal
      consists of typical deli items, such as pasta, rolls, salad, etc. Subject will be allowed to
      eat as much or as little of the lunch as they'd like.
