    
      This is a prospective cohort study of 30 older women ages 65 and older with urinary
      incontinence (UI) who will under go a standardized 12-week hip muscle exercises (isometric
      strengthening of hip external rotators with progressive resistance training). Participants
      will take part in a 12-week hip muscle exercise program (weekly supervised hip exercises with
      resistance progression) plus a home program with the same exercises 3 days per week. the
      exercise program will be administered by the licensed physical therapist with special focus
      in hip strength. The change in pelvic floor muscle strength (peak pelvic floor muscle squeeze
      pressures) pre- to post hip muscle exercises. Changes in UI symptom severity, and impact of
      UI symptoms on quality of life will be assessed. Objective measurement of pelvic floor muscle
      strength will be obtained using a perineometer. UI symptom severity and quality of life will
      be measured using validated questionnaires (PFDI and PFIQ, respectively).
