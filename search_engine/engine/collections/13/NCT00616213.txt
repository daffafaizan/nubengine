    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PR-104 in combination with filgrastim (G-CSF) in
           patients with solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PR-104 and its alcohol metabolite.

        -  Evaluate the rate of hypoxia in various solid tumors using F-MISO PET
           (18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography) imaging.

        -  Assess for antitumor toxicity in these patients.

        -  Collect plasma samples for the assessment of potential biomarkers of tumor hypoxia.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of PR-104.

      Patients receive PR-104 IV over 1 hour on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) on day 2. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      also undergo 18F-fluoromisonidazole PET scans at baseline and prior to course 3 to assess
      tumor hypoxia.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically during course 1. Samples are analyzed
      for the pharmacokinetics of PR-104 and for identification of biomarkers for tumor hypoxia.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.
