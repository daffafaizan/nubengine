      used in the western world for this purpose. Probiotics consists of one or more normal
      gut-bacteria. A large study in India showed that giving probiotics to full-born babies
      reduced hospitalizations and morbidity. This study investigates giving a probiotic mixture
      with different combination of bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis
      and Bifidobacterium breve, for a longer duration (4 weeks instead of 7 days).

      Infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a major threat to health-care world-wide,
      and sepsis/severe infection caused by such bacteria is a major cause of neonatal death. The
      study hypothesis is that giving probiotics to newborns prevents them from getting colonized
      with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). By preventing colonization with ESBL-PE, severe infections such
      as sepsis may be prevented, and thereby survival may be improved.
