      symptoms, prokinetics are often used in clinics. However, some prokinetics are dopamine
      receptor antagonist which can aggravate motor symptoms of PD patients or develop tardive
      dyskinesia when it affects dopamine receptors of the brain.

      DA-9701 (Motilitone) is recently developed herbal medication which has both 5-HT4 agonism and
      D2 antagonism. Furthermore, it does not cross the blood brain barrier that can be safely used
      in PD patients. Hypothetically it has a potential to be a good choice for the treatment of GI
      symptoms of PD patients. However, there has been no study that evaluates its efficacy and
      safety by randomized clinical trials in PD patients.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of DA-9701 in the double-blind
      placebo-controlled phase 1 (4 weeks), and the long-term safety of DA-9701 in the open-label
      phase 2 (8 weeks after phase 1).
