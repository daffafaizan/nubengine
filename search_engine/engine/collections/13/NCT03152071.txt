      video assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy in case of lung cancer. At the end of both surgical
      interventions the anaesthesiologist administers the same technique of pain relief:
      paravertebral blockage.

      The data that are going to be investigated are: operative time, conversion to spreading of
      the ribs/thoracotomy, blood loss, lymph node dissection, prolonged air leak, chest tube
      drainage, length of stay, inflammatory reaction (through inflammatory parameters CRP, IL-3,
      IL-6, TNF), lung recuperation (through a lung function test) and postoperative pain (VAS
      score questionnaire).
