      are being treated with BTVA at sites located in the EU and other select geographies. Patients
      will be followed as per standard of care and the registry will collect follow-up data for
      five years following treatment. The follow up data collected will include pulmonary function
      measurements (spirometry, body plethysmography, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide),
      exercise capacity (six minute walk test), imaging findings (chest x-ray and CT), and a
      quality of life questionnaire (SGRQ-C). All serious and non-serious adverse events will also
      be collected for the duration of the study in order to assess safety. Serious adverse events
      will be adjudicated by an independent medical monitor in order to establish relatedness to
      the InterVapor device and procedure.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all safety and effectiveness data. There is
      no predefined hypothesis regarding the magnitude of effectiveness of InterVapor or the
      incidence of specific safety outcomes.

      Monitoring of the registry study will be undertaken as a continuous process to ensure that
      high-quality data are obtained and to ensure compliance with registry procedures.
