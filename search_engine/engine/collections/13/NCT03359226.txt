      living patients with probable Parkinsons disease (PD) would be extremely valuable as a
      diagnostic test, as a marker of molecular therapeutic target engagement and as a progression
      marker. Based on recent data from our group with both early and advanced PD patients, we
      propose to perform a second transcutaneous submandibular gland (SMG) needle core biopsy in 12
      patients who have previously been biopsied and had LTS present in their SMG tissue.
