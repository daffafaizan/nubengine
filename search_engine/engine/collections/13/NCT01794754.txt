    
      Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal diseases in an adult
      population, and approximately 68% of people between the ages of 71 and 80 years have
      radiographic OA in the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint.

      Currently, there is no cure for hand OA. However, several studies have demonstrated that hand
      exercises and CMC-orthoses may reduce pain and improve grip strength, and in a recent study,
      assistive devices improved activity performance and satisfaction with performance in people
      with hand-OA. Still, most people do not receive any such treatment, but those with severe
      CMC-OA are often referred for surgery in this joint. The effect of occupational therapy to
      prevent or delay need for surgery CMC-OA has been investigated in a small study with 33
      participants, but randomised controlled trails (RCT) of good quality are needed.
