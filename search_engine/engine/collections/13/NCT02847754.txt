      compression, and impending pathologic fractures. Palliative radiation therapy serves to
      reduce pain, improve quality of life, and avoid complications. Tailored training of the
      paravertebral musculature may support radiation therapy and improve above named factors.
      DISPO-2 was designed to investigate the impact of tailored physical exercise in patients with
      unstable vertebral metastases as compared to manual therapy (progressive muscle relaxation).
      The trial includes patients with painful bony metastases, patients with spinal cord
      compression or impending pathological fractures are excluded. The investigations are carried
      out in a prospective randomized controlled phase-II parallel group design.

      Patients are randomized to one of the following groups: patients in arm A carry out daily
      physical training consisting of four different isometric exercises under the guidance and
      supervision of a physiotherapist. Training starts day one (first radiotherapy session), 10
      daily units of 30 min each are scheduled during radiotherapy. Patients are expected to
      continue training until 12 weeks post completion of radiotherapy at home. Patients in arm B
      (control group) receive 10 daily sessions of 15 min progressive muscle relaxation starting
      from day one of radiotherapy. Follow-up of the patients is scheduled at 12 weeks post
      completion of radiotherapy incl. CT of the spine and physical examination.
