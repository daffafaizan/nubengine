      Resynchronization Therapy with Defibrillation (CRT-D) vs. Implantable Cardioverter
      Defibrillator (ICD) therapy in the MADIT-CRT study patient population. The registry will
      collect data on patients that previously participated at MADIT-CRT sites within the US
      through five years of participation from their orginal enrollment in the MADIT-CRT IDE study
      (MADIT-CRT IDE: NCT00180271).
