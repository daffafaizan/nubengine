      extraction in both eyes were consented and randomized in a 2:1 ratio at each investigative
      site to receive either the AcrySof速 IQ ReSTOR速 Multifocal Toric IOL or the control AcrySof速
      ReSTOR速 Multifocal IOL in both eyes. Each participant completed a preoperative examination of
      both eyes, implantation of the IOL at the operative visit for each eye, and up to 8
      postoperative visits, with monocular testing at Day 1-2, Day 7-14, and Day 30-60 and
      binocular testing at Day 120-180 and Day 340-420/Visit 5 following the second implantation.
      The eye with the greater amount of astigmatism was implanted first (first operative eye). The
      second eye implant was intended to occur within 30 days after the first eye implant but not
      prior to 7 days after the first eye implant. Both eyes needed to qualify under
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at the preoperative visit. If the first eye was excluded during
      surgery, the second eye was not eligible. If the second eye was excluded during surgery, only
      the first eye was followed.
