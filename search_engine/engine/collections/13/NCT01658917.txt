        -  Recent advances and insights into the molecular pathogenesis of cancer have led to the
           development of novel molecular and biologic targeted therapies for the treatment of
           advanced cancer patients. A critical challenge in extending these studies involves the
           identification and validation of new therapeutic targets for future cancer therapies.

        -  The Surgery Branch, NCI has an interest in identifying novel molecular and biologic
           targets to facilitate the development of future cancer therapies. In addition, we have
           the primary responsibility for providing surgical consultative services to the NIH. As
           such, we are uniquely positioned to acquire and perform important studies on solid tumor
           tissue to help identify therapeutic targets that may have significant clinical
           ramifications.

      OBJECTIVES:

      - Primary Objective: To collect biologic samples from patients undergoing diagnostic or
      therapeutic interventions for premalignant, primary or metastatic solid tumors for the
      purpose of identifying novel molecular and biologic therapeutic targets

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with radiographic evidence of,
           biochemical evidence of, or histologically/cytologically proven solid neoplasms who
           require diagnostic or therapeutic intervention as a part of the diagnosis and /or
           standard of care treatment and/or follow up for their neoplasm

        -  Patients must have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable
           limits by standard of practice guidelines prior to planned intervention

      DESIGN:

        -  A tissue acquisition trial in which tissues will be obtained at the time of intervention

        -  Tissue and blood will be processed at the time of collection, stored and then
           transferred to Dr. Kammula s laboratory for further processing.

        -  No investigational therapy will be given.

        -  It is anticipated that 1000 patients will be enrolled over a period of 10 years
