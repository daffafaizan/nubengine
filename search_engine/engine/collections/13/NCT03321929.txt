      after initial resection in inferred by post-operative margin assessment of the resected
      tissue by a pathologist.

      Phase C enrollment will include approximately 5 patients per surgeon, with 2-3 surgeons per
      site and up to 20 sites. Subjects undergoing a lumpectomy procedure to treat primary breast
      cancer will be injected with a single dose of LUM015 4 Â± 2 hours prior to surgery at a dose
      of 1.0 mg/kg. The sequence of events during the surgical procedure will vary based on the
      standard of care used by the surgeon. Patients will receive at a minimum the standard of care
      practices for each site. Lumicell-guided shaved cavity margins will be removed after the
      surgeon has attempted to remove the main specimen with grossly negative margins.

      Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will continue their
      enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will continue to be
      followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is required.
      Patients with adverse events that are determined to be possibly related to the LUM Imaging
      System will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
