    
      Environmental intervention programs:

      We will both interview by telephone and mail the health education leaflets, in order to
      achieve the following aims:

      -Smokers living with the children will change where smoking takes place for reducing the
      children's ETS exposure.

      Data collection:

      We will contact participants individually to get informed consent before data collection. No
      matter what intervention, non-intervention or reference group, all participants will test as
      follows:

        -  Blood sample collection: We will test the total IgE, specific IgE, cytokines, such as
           IL-4, IL-13, TNF-Î±, ECP and EOS.

        -  Questionnaire collection

        -  Pulmonary function test

      After intervention programs applied, all participants will test pulmonary function, and total
      IgE, specific IgE and cytokines by blood sample after six months by school approaches. Then,
      we can compare the pulmonary function, total IgE, specific IgE and cytokines before and after
      intervention programs.
