      Primary

        -  To characterize the toxicity and determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of erlotinib
           hydrochloride plus romidepsin. (Phase I)

        -  To obtain preliminary data regarding efficacy, including response rate and
           progression-free survival. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of romidepsin in combination with erlotinib
           hydrochloride.

        -  To evaluate the impact of erlotinib hydrochloride on the biologic activity of romidepsin
           by analyzing peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) histone acetylation status and
           histone acetylase activity. (Exploratory)

        -  To evaluate the effect of romidepsin and erlotinib hydrochloride on components of the
           EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)-signaling pathway in skin biopsies, particularly
           downstream mediators such as MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of romidepsin followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive romidepsin IV on days 1, 8, and 15 and erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO)
      once daily beginning on day 3 of course 1 and on days 1-28 of all subsequent courses. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetic studies. Additional samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and skin
      biopsies may be also collected for correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients (15 patients for phase I and 24 patients for phase
      II) will be accrued for this study.
