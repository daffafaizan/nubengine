    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective, phase IV trial with
      parallel design. 126 of new cardiac transplant recipients are planned to be enrolled in two
      sites: 1) Transplant Centre at Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague,
      Czech Republic, and 2) St Anne's University Hospital (FNUSA) - Centre of Cardiovascular and
      Transplant Surgery (CKTCH) in Brno, Czech Republic. Screening data will be reviewed to
      determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. Screening period could last up to four
      weeks. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either alirocumab 150 mg every 2 weeks or
      placebo between month 1 and month 12 after transplantation (study treatment will start after
      the first surveillance cardiac catheterization approximately one month after heart
      transplantation and it will be completed after the second surveillance cardiac
      catheterization approximately 12 months after heart transplantation). Furthermore, all
      subjects will be on a background statin treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg daily. After
      Screening and Baseline visit, 5 visits are planned during the treatment period (4, 8, 20, 34
      and 48 weeks after baseline) and follow-up visit is planned 60 weeks after baseline. Maximal
      expected duration of subject participation will be 15 months.
