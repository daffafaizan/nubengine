      the hospital with a chest tube and valve in place. Subjects will be screened prior to
      discharging from the hospital and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered
      participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained the subject will be randomized to
      receive oral antibiotics and close monitoring, defined as twice weekly telephone calls by a
      member of the care team, of their chest tube and valve or standard of care, defined as no
      calls from the care team but waiting for the subject to contact the care team when the air
      leak has stopped. The subject will be followed until they have their chest tube removed.
