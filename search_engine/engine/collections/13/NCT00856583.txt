      ascertain that the favourable benefit-risk profile and low mortality rates seen in the
      clinical studies with sertindole would not be offset by higher mortality rates when
      sertindole was used under more normal conditions of use. It was recognised that, in a
      clinical trial setting, strict patient selection and monitoring could lead to higher
      compliance in patient management and thereby to a lower mortality rate. Study 99824 was
      therefore designed in collaboration with the CHMP as an open-label, randomised study with
      minimum study management that focused on mortality and general patient safety. The duration
      of the treatment period was not fixed. No efficacy measures were included.
