      an unscheduled hospital admission for heart failure. This study aims to develop and validate
      a prognostic model that will enable management planning and facilitate the identification of
      therapeutic needs or targets. Also, it will assist care providers to predict or quantify
      patients' survival based on their baseline characteristics.

      The National Heart Failure Audit (NHFA) held by National Institute for Cardiovascular
      Outcomes Research (NICOR) is one of the largest available national heart failure registry. It
      includes data from unscheduled heart failure admissions in England and Wales. In the audit,
      heart failure diagnosis is defined as a diagnosis that has been confirmed by imaging or brain
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurement. This study will use NHFA data to develop and validate
      the proposed model.
