      OBJECTIVE-Type 2 diabetes is associated with defects in insulin secretion and insulin
      sensitivity. Hyperglycemia may aggravate these defects, a feature known as glucose toxicity.
      Previous studies have shown that acute correction of hyperglycemia in subjects with
      long-standing type 2 diabetes gives only short-term improvement in glycemic control after
      discontinuation of insulin. The current study attempts to identify whether basal insulin
      glargine or metformin-based OADs for further management would have a long-term benefit in
      newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes after short-term intensive insulin therapy.

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients (fasting blood glucose
      >200 mg/dL or random blood glucose >300 mg/dL) will be hospitalized and treated with
      intensive insulin injection for 10 to 14 days. HbA1c were measured before intensive insulin
      injection. After discharge, patients will be randomized to receive basal insulin injection or
      metformin-based OADs for further management. Patients will be followed in our clinics and
      adjust their medication according to their blood glucose levels. HbA1c were measured 6 months
      later.After the six-month intervention, these patients were continually followed up for
      another six months. Subjects received an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after the
      intensive insulin therapy and at the end of the 6th and 12th month.

      EXPECTED RESULTS-We will expect that basal insulin glargine,compared with metformin-based OAD
      treatment,could more effectively maintain adequate glycemic control in newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetes after short-term intensive insulin therapy.
