      beyond successful treatment completion in approximately 30% of breast cancer survivors,
      causing serious disruption in quality of life. Behavioral interventions incorporating
      physical activity or relaxation/stress management have demonstrated beneficial effects on
      cancer-related fatigue, although research in cancer survivors is limited. Mind-body
      interventions such as yoga are extremely popular among cancer patients and offer a promising
      alternative to traditional treatments. Research is needed to establish the feasibility and
      efficacy of these interventions in cancer populations, particularly those who are
      experiencing problems with fatigue.
