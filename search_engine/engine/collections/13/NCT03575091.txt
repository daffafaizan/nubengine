    
      All children under 2 years of age who are admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress
      and who have previously been essentially healthy are asked to participate. The infants will
      be randomized to 3 groups, 1 control group and 2 intervention groups. The infants in the
      control group will receive the standard care at the clinic. In one intervention group the
      parents will receive instructions how to vary their child body position regularly, and in the
      other intervention group the child will receive physiotherapy regularly and the parents will
      carry out some treatment. Further actions in the form of inhalations or stimulation of deep
      breathing, will be used when needed. The children will be observed following a structured
      observational protocol regularly throughout the hospital stay.
