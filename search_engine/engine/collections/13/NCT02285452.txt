      subjects. Subjects undergo three different interventions (wraps with ginger flour, mustard
      flour or warm water (placebo)) on three different days. Heart rate variability and
      respiratory activity is measured for ten minutes before, during (up to 20 minutes) and for
      ten minutes after each thorax wrap. To investigate the effects on heat development and
      regulation, photos are taken with a thermographic infrared camera at various moments in time.
      Participants are asked to fill in questionnaires referring to their subjective perceptions of
      warmth, bodily warmth distribution and wellbeing. The order of the thorax wrap interventions
      is randomized.
