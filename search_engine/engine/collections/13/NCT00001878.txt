    
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disease with an autosomal dominant pattern of
      inheritance which is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). HCM is often caused
      by missense mutations of genes that encode for sarcomeric proteins. The LVH varies markedly
      in patients with identical sarcomeric gene mutations, and notably, 20 to 40% of subjects with
      disease mutation do not have LVH as assessed by echocardiography. These findings suggest that
      other factors affect LV wall thickness in HCM. We wish (1) to investigate the potential role
      of IGF-I and its binding protein, IGFBP3, in determining increased LV mass in HCM caused by
      sarcomeric mutations; and (2) to assess myocardial ultrasound backscatter, exercise
      tolerance, and propensity to arrhythmias, in subjects who have inherited sarcomeric mutations
      but who do not have LVH.
