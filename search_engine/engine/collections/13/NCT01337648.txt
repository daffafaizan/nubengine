    
      Patients undergoing TBI as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) will have
      feces collected for use in the validation and refinement of new methods for rapid radiation
      biodosimetry. The stool samples will be collected before, and at defined times after TBI.
      Stool sampling will occur in the same manner that it does during routine patient care during
      HSCT.
