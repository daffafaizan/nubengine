      the chemotherapy and/or radiation on hematopoietic tissue administered prior to peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant, are reversible upon neutrophil count recovery. The investigators
      will investigate the use of hyperbaric oxygen as an intervention to shorten neutropenia
      post-high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. The idea of
      using hyperbaric oxygen therapy in autologous stem cell transplantation is based on the
      investigators pre-clinical work that supported the use of hyperbaric oxygen to improve
      umbilical cord blood (cluster of differentiation 34) CD34+ stem cell transplantation.
