    
      A clinical trial multicentric randomized controlled will be organized. A total of 1000 women
      will be recruited between 36 and 38 weeks of amenorrhoea (GW) if the pregnancy is single, in
      cephalic presentation and the fetus is estimated macrosomic for the gestational age (> 90e
      percentile clinically and >95Â° percentile sonographically).All agreeing patients will be
      randomized in one of the two following groups: - 1. Induction of labor between 37+0 and 38+6
      GW and within 3 day after the randomization. - 2. Expectancy until the spontaneous beginning
      of labor or up to 41 GW.The measurement of principal exit is the neonatal traumatism
      (criterion composite associating: dystocia of the shoulders, fractures osseous,
      paralysis/paresis of the plexus brachial or intracerebral haemorrhage).The secondary criteria
      are neonatal asphyxiation (arterial pH < 7.10 or Apgar < 7 to 5 minutes), the maternal
      traumatism (tear of 3rd or 4th degree) and the Caesarean. The long-term after-effects for the
      mother and her child will be also evaluated
