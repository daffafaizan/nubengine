    
      The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of conventional initial periodontal treatment
      (C-IPT), full-mouth disinfection IPT (FMD-IPT) and full-mouth IPT (FM-IPT) and the levels of
      gingival crevicular fluid interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella
      intermedia, Parvimonas micra and Campylobacter rectus in patients with generalized aggressive
      periodontitis (GAgP) over 6-months period. Forty-two GAgP patients were randomly assigned
      into 3 groups. IPT was performed in a quadrant-wise manner at 1-week intervals in C-IPT, in 2
      sessions within 24 hours in FM-IPT, and in 2 sessions with application of chlorhexidine to
      the intra-oral niches within 24 hours in FMD-IPT. FMD-IPT group also used daily 0,2%
      chlorhexidine for 3 weeks. At baseline, 3 and 6 months clinical parameters consisting of
      plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and clinical attachment
      level were recorded, gingival crevicular fluid and microbiological samples were collected.
      Gingival crevicular fluid levels of IL-1β and IL-17 were analyzed using ELISA. The
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used for the quantitative
      detection of periodontal pathogens.
