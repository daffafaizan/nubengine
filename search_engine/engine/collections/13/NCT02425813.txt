      I. To assess the efficacy of intra-arterial steroid administration (IASA) with
      methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MePDSL) in this dose-schedule for treatment of de novo
      acute moderate-to-severe GvHD of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of IASA MePDSL in this dose-schedule for treatment of de novo acute
      moderate-to-severe acute GvHD of the GIT.

      II. To assess the feasibility of IASA MePDSL in this dose-schedule for treatment of de novo
      acute moderate-to-severe acute GvHD of the GIT.

      OUTLINE:

      STUDY AGENT: Patients receive methylprednisolone sodium succinate intra-arterially (IA) once
      daily (QD) on days 1-3.

      CONVENTIONAL THERAPY: Patients also receive conventional therapy comprising
      methylprednisolone sodium succinate intravenously (IV) every 12 hours on for 7-14 days
      beginning on day 1 and budesonide PO on days 1-56. Patients with response by day 7-14 may
      begin taper and receive methylprednisolone orally (PO) on days 28-56. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE THERAPY (IST): Patients receive conventional IST or continue their previous
      prophylactic regimen beginning on day 1 to 56 (or beyond) at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 360 days.
