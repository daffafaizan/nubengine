      NOTE: No individual will be advised to terminate ongoing treatment. If adolescents have been
      in psychotherapy prior to their entry in the study, they will be allowed to continue with the
      treatment. However, psychotherapy cannot be initiated at the time of entry into the study.

      Aim: To provide preliminary clinical data about the efficacy of omega-3FA (derived from fish
      oil) in the treatment of adolescent MDD. A NCCAM/NIH-funded study.

      Summary: Informed consent will be obtained from parent/guardian and assent obtained from
      participant. Interested participants will have a free diagnostic evaluation by study
      psychiatrist to determine eligibility. Routine blood tests and a urine pregnancy test will be
      obtained. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either omega-3FA or matching
      placebo (corn oil) for 10 weeks. Patients will be seen weekly throughout the trial. Dosage
      will be titrated based on clinical response and side effects. At end of double-blind phase,
      participants will be referred to a clinician who will be informed of subjects' treatment.
      Depending on treatment received during double-blind phase, post-study treatment options will
      include treatment with omega-3 fatty acids or an SSRI.
