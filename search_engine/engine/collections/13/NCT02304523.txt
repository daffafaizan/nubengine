    
      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, parallel, 3-treatment, multi-center
      clinical trial. A total of 297 subjects scheduled for colonoscopy will participate to this
      study and be assigned to 3 groups - CDFR0612, CDFR0613, or a comparator (Coolprep Powder). A
      subject will admit to hospital one day before colonoscopy and be administrated with study
      drug. In early morning at the that day of colonoscopy, he/she will be administrated with
      study drug again. Any subject will be carefully monitored for safety during hospitalisation
      (1 night) and additional 4 weeks follow-up period because this study is the first human trial
      of CDFR0612 and CDFR0613.
