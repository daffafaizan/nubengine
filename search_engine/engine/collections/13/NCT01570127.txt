    
      To determine whether individualized acupuncture is more effective than standardized
      acupuncture, 276 Low Back Pain patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to 4 separate
      groups.

      Experimental groups(Individualized Acupuncture Group and Standardized Acupuncture Group) and
      Control groups (Sham acupuncture and waiting list)

      The change of pain and physical functions will be compared among the four groups.

      So the efficacy of acupuncture, and the best acupuncture treatment model will be determined.
      Also in addition, safety and abnormal reactions of acupuncture treatments will be evaluated.
