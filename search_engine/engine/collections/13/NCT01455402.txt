      clinical impact and true incidence rates of RSV-associated hospitalizations and medically
      attended acute respiratory illnesses or events leading to worsening cardiorespiratory status
      in adults with COPD and/or CHF who are at increased risk for serious sequelae associated with
      RSV infections. As part of the evaluation, this study will collect symptom and physiologic
      data, and blood, nasal swab, and sputum in order to investigate the relationship of RSV
      infections with clinical endpoints.
