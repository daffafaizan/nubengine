    
      This is a five arm, prospective, randomized, trial. Patients undergoing abdominoplasty or
      abdominally-based free tissue transfer (TRAM/DIEP flaps) at NYU Medical Center will be
      randomly assigned to receive one of five conventionally used umbilicoplasty techniques during
      the course of their surgery:

        1. Round procedure

        2. "Scarless" round procedure

        3. "Inverted u" procedure

        4. "Inverted v" procedure, and

        5. "Y deepithelialized" procedure

      As there has not yet been a superiority or inferiority comparison of these five methods, no
      patient will be receiving substandard care by randomization to one of the five procedures.
