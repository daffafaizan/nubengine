      antagonist therapy. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the addition of EGFR antagonists to
      chemotherapy has been shown to improve RR and PFS. Improved response rate to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy would be expected to improve surgical outcomes for patients with CRCLM. We
      therefore wish to test the hypothesis that the combination of FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab,
      given perioperatively to patients with wild-type KRAS CRCLM will improve outcome, compared to
      historical control, in optimally resectable patients. As this patient population remains at
      high risk for recurrence post-chemotherapy, we also wish to explore the tolerability and
      efficacy of continued panitumumab monotherapy for an additional 6 months.

      As opposed to most clinical trials for advanced colorectal cancer where the majority are
      treated with palliative intent, patients in this trial will all be treated aggressively with
      curative intent at the outset. There is also the additional benefit of assessment of tumor
      tissue after treatment with a biologic agent.
