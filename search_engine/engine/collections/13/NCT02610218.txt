      both histologically HER2 positive and negative advanced/metastatic gastric cancer. Peripheral
      blood samples of 12.5 mL were collected from the patients for cfDNA and CTCs analysis. The
      blood samples will be respectively drawn before therapy, at the time that the patients
      achieve the optimal response and when they suffer progressive disease. The enumeration of
      CTCs as well as the detection of HER2 expression will be achieved via the integrated
      subtraction enrichment (SET) and immunostaining-fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH)
      platform. Further, for the geneomic analysis, the enriched single CTC will be isolated for
      single-cell targeted sequencing. While for cfDNA analysis, extracted DNA from plasma will be
      directly subjected to targeted sequencing. The correlation of the HER2 status on CTCs and the
      HER2 amplification in cfDNA to the therapeutic response will be evaluated. Moreover, gene
      variations associated with resistance in HER2-targeted therapy will be also studied based on
      the genomic data from sequencing of CTC and cfDNA.
