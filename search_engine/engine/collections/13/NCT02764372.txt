      system (REHAB@HOME), based on Kinect, to augment upper extremity neurorehabilitation
      services. A secondary objective was to provide preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy of
      the approach in increasing arm activity and health related quality of life of persons post
      stroke or with multiple sclerosis (MS).

      A pilot single-blind randomized controlled trial was carried out in an inpatient and
      ambulatory care at a rehabilitation center. Twenty persons with multiple sclerosis (n=16) or
      chronic poststroke (n=4) receiving rehabilitation at the center, able to flex shoulder and
      elbow at least 45 degrees, participated in the study.

      An intervention group received Serious Games-based upper extremity therapy for a total of 12
      sessions (4-5 sessions, lasting 40 minutes, per week) and the control played the same amount
      of time with commercial exergames of the Wii. Both groups received their usual rehabilitation
      services as well as game playing.
