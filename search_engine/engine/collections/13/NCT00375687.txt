      adjuvant hormonotherapy (triptorelin) can prolong survival data for high risk patients.
      Control group (randomised study) will be treated with hormonotherapy, when PSA recidive
      appear (on demand treatment). Secondary purposes will be to compare PSA dinamics and quality
      of life data in the groups.
