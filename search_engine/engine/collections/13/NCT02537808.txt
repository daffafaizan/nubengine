      or low-dose dexamethasone has changed substantially the treatment paradigm for patients with
      multiple myeloma. A variety of treatment options is now available for elderly patients. To
      compare the efficacy and safety of continuous lenalidomide in combination with low-dose
      dexamethasone (Rd) until progression vs. Rd for 18 cycles/72 weeks (Rd18) vs. melphalan,
      prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) for 12 cycles/72 weeks a multicenter, open-label phase III
      study (MM-020/IFM 07-01, FIRST trial) was performed in transplant ineligible patients.

      After market approval of lenalidomide for previously untreated transplant-ineligible patients
      with multiple myeloma, the purpose of the FIRST-NIS is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness
      and quality of life of lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone as first line treatment
      of multiple myeloma in a real life setting.
