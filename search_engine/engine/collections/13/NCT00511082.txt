    
      The study is designed as a single-center,open-label,phase 1 dose-escalation study to assess
      the safety,tolerability,pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor efficacy of OPB-31121 in patients
      with relapsed or refractory NHL or MM.

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of OPB-31121 following repeated oral
           administration of OPB-31121 in patients NHL or MM

        -  To determine the potential dose-limiting toxicities and maximum-tolerated dose in
           patients treated with OPB-31121

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor efficacy of OPB-31121 in patients
