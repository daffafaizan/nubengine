      tuberculosis. The clinical development consortium of this EDCTP program is preparing for
      future years an MTBVAC efficacy trial by setting up a network of three African sites in South
      Africa, Senegal and Madagascar. Each site has established an operational clinical research
      infrastructure. As a first step, Senegal site needs to collect crucial epidemiological data
      on TB in children, to allow a rapid transition to a phase 3 trial in infants.

      The primary objective is to estimate the prevalence of TB infection by the QuantiFERON-TB
      Gold Plus technique in 500 children splined in 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 12-year-old age
      groups living in the study area (Saint Louis, Senegal).

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To study the socio-demographic characteristics, the vaccination history of each subject
           and the possible tuberculous contacts he has.

        -  To map selected populations (from GPS residence data) according to the status (infected
           or uninfected) of each subject.

        -  To ensure the orientation of children found positive by the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus
           test for care and follow-up related to the TB diagnosis and treatment at one of the
           Health Centers (THC) located in the study areas.

        -  To estimate the number of tuberculosis cases detected in children aged up to 12 years
           and resident in the study area from THC registries and data from the National
           Tuberculosis Control Plan (PNB).
