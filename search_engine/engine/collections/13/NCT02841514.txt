    
      Purpose: To assess the efficacy and the safety of tooth bleaching procedure using Y10
      Whitening toothpaste and RF current (Y10 Device), versus placebo (no RF current and off- the
      -shelf non bleaching toothpaste) in healthy patients seeking tooth bleaching.

      No. of Subjects/Sites: A total of 60 patients at Hadassah Medical Center will be randomized,
      30 patients for the test arm, and 30 patients for the placebo arm.

      A 40% to 60% male (or female) ratio will be maintained.

      Target teeth: At least 4 teeth between teeth 13-23 (Upper front teeth) according to the
      international teeth numbering system.

      Upper and lower teeth will be treated with the same treatment arm as described.

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint:

      â€¢ At the end of the treatment (V3), compared to prior of treatment, the mean shade change
      will be at least two shades (Vita Bleachguide 3D Master, Vita P/N: B361) as measured at the
      middle one-third area of the labial surface of the selected target teeth.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Compared to prior of treatment, the mean shade change at 3 and 6 months will be at least
           one shade (Vita Bleachguide 3D Master, Vita P/N: B361) as measured at the middle
           one-third area of the labial surface of the selected target teeth.

        -  Compared to prior of treatment, color change evaluates with a spectrophotometer (VITA
           Easyshade Advance 4; VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany), before and after
           treatment, at 3 and 6 months will be at least one shade. (Device with a high
           reliability, over 96%, Kim-Pusateri Et al. Reliability and accuracy of four dental
           shade-matching devices. Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry United States 2009;101(March
           (3)):193-9.)

        -  Compared to prior of treatment, the mean shade change for the lower teeth numbers 43-33
           after treatment, 3 and 6 months will be at least one shade.

        -  Lesion in the gingiva of the upper and lower teeth (+/- in each of the teeth numbers
           33-43, 13-23 after treatment and 3 months.

        -  Compared to prior of treatment - teeth sensitivity to cold and touch stimulation -
           target teeth - VAS scale after treatment, 3 and 6 months. For the VAS, the participants
           will place a line perpendicular to a 10-mm-long line with zero at one end indicating
           ''no TS'' and the other end indicating ''unbearable TS.''

        -  Patient oral questionnaire - post treatment, 7 days, 3 months, 6 months (See below).

        -  Patient Reported Outcomes: (Scale 0-4). OHIP14-aesthetics questions for patients that
           received dental bleaching - (see below) - before treatment and in 3 months.

        -  Periodontal parameters at baseline, 3 and 6 months: plaque index, sulcular bleeding
           index, pocket depth - all at the target teeth. (See below details).

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Signed and dated Informed Consent Form.
