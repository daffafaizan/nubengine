    
      efficacy assessments:

        -  Histopathological findings based on the biopsies of the primary tumor location and the
           tissue excision at the end of trial (histological cure).

        -  Description of the clinical-therapeutic effect of resiquimod on nBCC (nodular-basal cell
           carcinoma) by visual inspection (clinical evaluation of treatment area and assessment of
           complete clinical clearance)

        -  RNA-analysis (analysis of gene expressions for cytokines, cytotoxic and apoptotic
           signals)

        -  Investigator's global judgment of efficacy by means of a 7-point scale

      Safety assessments:

        -  Evaluation of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

        -  Evaluation of local tolerability (local skin reactions as erythema, edema,
           erosion/ulceration, exsudate, dryness, encrustation) by means of symptom scoring scales
           (0 = absent, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe).

        -  Evaluation of systemic tolerability [hematology (erythrocytes, leucocytes including
           neutrophils, hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocytes), blood chemistry (alkaline
           phosphatase, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (ASAT), alanine transaminase (ALAT),
           serum creatinine), vital signs]. The thresholds concerning laboratory abnormalities that
           determine patient's discontinuation from trial were predefined upfront.

        -  Evaluation of the number of patients withdrawn from the trial

        -  Investigator's global judgment of tolerability by means of a 6-point scale

        -  Photographic documentation of the treatment area

      Exploratory parameter:

        -  C-reactive protein (CRP)

        -  Interferon-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha
           (up-regulation of gene expression)

        -  Immunohistochemistry and characterization of cell types (CD8, T-cells, macrophages,
           dendritic cells)

        -  In addition, blood serum samples will be preserved and frozen for later tests that will
           be specified to the patients. The preserved material will be stored for a maximum of 2
           years.
