      evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture, traditional Chinese acupuncture and sham
      acupuncture in patients with refractory RA. All patients received 20 sessions over a period
      of 10 weeks. Six acupuncture points were chosen. Primary outcome is the changes in the pain
      score. Secondary outcomes included the changes in the ACR core disease measures, DAS 28 score
      and the number of patients who achieved ACR 20 at week 10.
