    
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by producing large
      quantities of antibodies directed against self-antigens, particularly double stranded DNA
      (dsDNA) and small nuclear RNA-binding proteins such as Ro, La, Sm, and nRNP.

      SLE-associated autoantibodies and high serum interferon alpha (IFN-Î±) are two important
      heritable phenotypes in SLE which are thought to play a role in disease pathogenesis . The
      most remarkable feature of the anti DNA response is its association with immunopathologic
      events especially glomerulonephritis . Immune complexes containing DNA can promote the
      expression of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) by a specialized population of dendritic cells
      known as plasmacytoid dendritic cells .

      Activation of the type I interferon (IFN) system is associated with disease pathogenesis in
      SLE, with affected patients typically demonstrating high concentrations of type I IFN
      proteins . Overexpression of type I IFN-induced genes that includes hundreds of gene
      transcripts; which is termed interferon signature (IFNGS), has been observed in 60-80% of
      adults and the majority of children with SLE .

      Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is recognized as a novel, easy to measure biomarker for type1 IFN
      signatures and galectin-9 could aid in clinical decision making in SLE as a marker for
      disease activity and organ damage.

      Galectin-9 is expressed by T cells, macro-phages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, its
      secreted form is barely detected under physiological conditions, it plays an recognizable
      role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses by down-regulating
      pro-inflammatory T cells.
