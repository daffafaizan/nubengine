      ventilated patients. The awareness of respiratory mechanics is essential in the prevention of
      VILI. Currently, plateau pressures are widely used as a guide to assess alveolar pressure and
      minimize alveolar injury. However, patients with reduced chest wall compliance can have
      higher plateau pressures that may not reflect true alveolar pressure. The transpulmonary
      pressure has been cited as the true alveolar driving pressure because it takes into account
      pleural pressure that reflect chest wall mechanics; however, this requires measurement of
      esophageal pressure.

      In our experience, we have seen a disproportionate degree of excursion between the posterior
      and anterior right hemidiaphragm on bedside ultrasound imaging in patients with ARDS, which
      may reflect the dependent atelectasis that occurs during low tidal volume ventilation,
      cardiac weight, weight of injured lung and accumulation of extravascular lung water in
      critically ill patients. The optimal PEEP can be guided by measurement of esophageal pressure
      (and subsequent calculation of transpulmonary distending pressure) with a balloon catheter
      placed into the esophagus much like a nasogastric tube for enteral access. We believe that
      the normalization of the disproportionate degree of excursion between the anterior and
      posterior diaphragm can also be used to identify optimal PEEP, and may be correlated with
      changes in transpulmonary pressure (the current gold standard).
