      microvesicles, microparticles). EVs are released into the interstitial fluid from a wide
      variety of normal or diseased cells.

      Analysis of EVs and their content maybe useful as disease biomarkers as they reflect the
      contents of cells of origin, differ between normal and diseased tissue and can be reliably
      detected.

      EVs may thus act as biomarkers of diverse pathologies like cancer, and detection of these
      biomarkers maybe applied to early diagnosis or assessment of prognosis in patients with
      cancer. EVs indeed contain both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, such as small regulatory microRNAs
      (miRNAs).
