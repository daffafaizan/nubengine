      prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, there is a body of evidence that
      supports the ability of this intervention to reduce hospital readmissions and cardiovascular
      mortality. However, despite the proven benefit, CR programmes are underutilised worldwide.
      Moreover, the molecular mechanisms responsible for orchestrating the beneficial physiological
      adaptations induced by a CR programme are poorly understood.

      Therefore, this study will evaluate the effect of a CR programme on novel molecular
      mechanisms and endothelial function in post-myocardial infarction CAD patients. Additionally,
      semi-structured interviews will be conducted with study participants and their significant
      others (i.e. spouse, family member, or a close friend) to explore the reasons why patients
      may agree or disagree to take part in a CR programme. Altogether, this study will provide
      physiological and detailed qualitative information that may help to provoke an increased
      participation in CR programmes.
