      protocol (Stockholm3+MRI+targeted biopsies) versus the standard protocol (PSA+systematic
      biopsies).

      Men from the STHLM3 study, diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer and currently on AS will
      be invited to the study. Eligible individuals have to be alive without any severe comorbidity
      and without a history of initiating treatment; surgery, radiation, hormone therapy or
      chemotherapy. To avoid the need for additional biopsies, invitation will be synchronized with
      timing for planned follow-up within the AS program for each individual.

      At baseline blood will be drawn for PSA and Stockholm3 analyses. The patient will be asked to
      fill out a study specific questionnaire with questions on anxiety and quality of life.
      Additionally, a bi-parametric MRI evaluated in line with PI-RADS v2 guidelines will be
      performed. For men with PIRADS â‰¥ 3 targeted and systematic biopsies will be performed. For
      men with PIRADS<3 only systematic biopsies will be performed.

      Main outcome measurement will be number of detected significant cancers by each method.
      Further outcome measurements are the number of performed prostate biopsies with each method
      and level of anxiety and quality of life.
