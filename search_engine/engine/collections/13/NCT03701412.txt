      or gradient-echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CMBs were introduced to stroke
      physicians in the late 1990s and early 2000s after development of MRI techniques sensitive to
      paramagnetic effects The clinical significance of CMBs has been actively investigated,
      especially in the stroke field and more recently in studies on cognitive impairment, vascular
      dementia and later developement of cerebral hge ..Histological investigation has shown that
      CMBs are tiny foci containing hemosiderin-laden macrophages and abnormal microvessels .

      Clinical cases with frank symptoms caused by CMBs are uncommon, Because CMBs are
      manifestations of focal extravascular leakage of blood components, however, investigators
      have suggested that accumulation of CMBs reflects a bleeding-prone status in individuals with
      an elevated risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Clinical studies have found strong associations
      between CMBs and chronic hypertension and low cholesterol levels and between the proximity
      and volume of CMBs and those of subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) . studies have
      found that CMBs are linked to subsequent hemorrhagic stroke in stroke survivors,and suggested
      that CMBs are related to antithrombotic-related hemorrhage.

      Clinical implications of cerebral microbleeds The increased of cerebral hemorrhage associated
      with the presence of CMBs may allow prediction of hemorrhagic transformation after ischemic
      stroke. An earlier report suggested that hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis was
      associated with the presence of CMBs.

      Considerable interest also exists in utilizing detection of CMBs to estimate the risks of
      hemorrhagic complications in patients on antithrombotic treatment. , CMBs were found to be
      more frequent and extensive in patients with double antiplatelets-associated ICH.
