      study performed on 18 healthy adult male volunteers. A total of 17 subjects completed the
      clinical phase of the study. In each period, subjects were housed from the evening before
      dosing until after the 24-hour blood draw. Subjects were to return for the 48-, 72-, 96- and
      120-hour blood draws. Both periods were separated by a washout period of 14 days.
