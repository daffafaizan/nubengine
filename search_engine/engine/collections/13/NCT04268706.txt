      efficacy of CD30.CAR-T. The Pivotal part of the study will evaluate antitumor efficacy and
      further evaluate safety and tolerability. All study eligibility requirements, assessments,
      procedures, and follow-up are the same for patients in both Pilot and Pivotal parts of the
      study.

      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will have their blood drawn by leukapheresis for
      manufacture the CD30.CAR-T cells. Subjects are allowed bridging chemotherapy, as per
      Investigator choice, while waiting for production of CD30.CAR-T. Lymphodepletion (LD) with
      fludarabine and bendamustine will be administered for 3 consecutive days starting on Day -5
      to Day -3, prior to CD30.CAR-T infusion, which will be administered on Day 0 as a single IV
      infusion. Depending on disease status, eligible subjects may receive up to a total of two
      CD30.CAR-T infusions at the same dose, each with preceding LD chemotherapy.

      Subjects will be closely monitored for safety and efficacy throughout the Treatment Period
      until the end of study (EOS) visit at Month 24. Subjects will be followed for survival,
      withdrawal of consent or study closure, whichever occurs first. Health Related Quality of
      Life assessments will also be collected throughout the study. After the EOS visit, subjects
      will enter the long-term follow-up phase (LTFU) which will include survival follow-up,
      additional safety, efficacy and biomarker assessments, as clinically indicated.
