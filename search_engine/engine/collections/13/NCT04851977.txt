      (rRSV) vaccine for the protection of children (6 months to 5 years old) and the elderly from
      RSV infection. Human RSV infects nearly all children by the age of two years, and it is a
      leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease in both paediatric and elderly
      populations as well as in individuals was immune system is profoundly compromised. The
      investigational product BARS13 has not previously been administered to human subjects. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of, and how the body reacts to, BARS13
      investigational vaccine when administered in the arm to healthy adult participants aged 18 to
      45 years according to a single (at Day 0) or repeat (at Day 0 and Day 30) vaccination
      schedule, with follow-up occurring for 60 days after the last vaccination.
