      I. Evaluate the effectiveness of daily virtual reality (VR) utilization during
      hospitalization in reducing narcotic use, compared to patients not utilizing VR.

      II. Evaluate the effectiveness of daily ambulation goals using Fitbit devices during
      hospitalization in reducing narcotic use, compared to patients without daily ambulation
      goals.

      III. Evaluate the effectiveness of daily VR use and daily Fitbit ambulation goals during
      hospitalization in reducing narcotic use compared to patients utilizing only VR, only Fitbit
      ambulation goals, and a control group using no digital interventions.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effectiveness of daily VR use and daily Fitbit ambulation goals during
      hospitalization on reducing pain scores, anxiety, depression, and length of stay, and
      improving sleep quality, hospital satisfaction, and disposition on discharge.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP 1: Beginning postoperative day 0, patients use VR daily over 30 minutes every 3 hours,
      and wear Fitbit daily with a goal of 2,000 steps until the day of discharge, or until 14 days
      after surgery.

      GROUP 2: Beginning postoperative day 0, patients use VR daily over 30 minutes every 3 hours
      until the day of discharge or until 14 days after surgery.

      GROUP 3: Beginning postoperative day 0, patients wear Fitbit daily with a goal of 2,000 steps
      until the day of discharge or until 14 days after surgery.

      GROUP 4: Patients do not use VR or wear Fitbit.
