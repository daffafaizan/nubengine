      agent PAC-1 in Component 1, a modified-Fibonacci dose-escalation 3+3 design starts in
      Component 2, at a PAC-1 dose one level lower than the MTD of PAC-1 established in the single
      agent PAC-1 component (i.e., Component 1) and 150 mg/m2 dose of temozolomide given for the 5
      days starting at day 8 of cycle 1 in cohorts of 3-6 patients. The combination cohort that
      reaches MTD will expanded to at least 9 patients, similar to the PAC-1 alone cohort at MTD.
      For all dose cohorts, pharmacokinetics of PAC-1 will be assessed following doses administered
      on days 1 and 11 of the first cycle. Temozolomide pharmacokinetics will be performed on Day
      11 of the first cycle.
