      diagnosed with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing a surgery allowing to collect an
      adipose tissue sample (10g).

      Controls are adults with no pancreatic cancer (excluded by a 6 months old computed tomography
      excluding the probability of a pancreatic neoplasm), paired with cases upon age and body mass
      index, with a scheduled surgical procedure allowing to collect an adipose tissue sample
      without extending procedure length.
