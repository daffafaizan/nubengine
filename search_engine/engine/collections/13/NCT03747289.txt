      physical therapy clinic in Bat-Yam, Israel. Each woman will be tested by one investigator
      after meeting the criteria of eligibility and after obtaining formed consent . The tests will
      include filling out the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, the SF-36 quality of life
      Questionnaire, pain measurement by VAS and lumbar range of motion measurement by a digital
      Inclinometer. By order of appearance, each participant will be assigned to one of two groups
      - weight bearing group or non-weight bearing group. After recruiting at least 3 participants
      in each group, a different investigator will begin a specific exercise protocol for each of
      the groups for four weeks - twice a week, 45 minutes each time, a total of 8 sessions. After
      each participant finishes all 8 sessions, she will be tested for the second time by the first
      investigator, the same tests as the first time. A third identical test will be preformed two
      months after finishing the program.

      After all the participants finish the program statistical analysis will be made in order to
      compare the dependent variables between groups.
