      randomly allocated into three study groups by a Stratified Permuted Block randomization
      method: group A received platelet rich plasma gel, group B (placebo) received platelet poor
      plasma gel, and group C received lubricant gel.

      All of the patients underwent a standard long protocol for knee osteoarthritis. All patients
      with diabetic foot ulcer are selected.On average,in each instance, the amount of platelets in
      the peripheral bloodis4 to6 times the baseline level.

      Group A (interventional): application of 20-30mL of gel from platelet rich plasma (PRP) Group
      B (placebo): application of 20-30mL of gel from platelet poor plasma (PRP) Group C (control):
      application of 20-30 mL of lubricant gel (used typically for sonography)
