        -  To analyse time to tumor progression in patients cystectomized for locally advanced TCC
           of the bladder, who are not suitable for cisplatin-based chemotherapy (i.e.
           postoperative reduced renal function, advanced age). Patients are randomized to receive
           either adjuvant Gemcitabine immediately after radical operation (treatment arm A) or no
           treatment (control arm B). Patients in the control arm are to be treated with
           Gemcitabine as soon as tumor progression becomes evident clinically and/or
           radiologically.

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  Estimation of time-specific survival probabilities irrespective of causes of death.

        -  Assessment of toxicity and tolerability of Gemcitabine

        -  Description of survival experience of patients in the control arm beyond the time of
           initiating chemotherapy.

        -  Assessment of quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30).

      Study Design:

      This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 two-arm study
      using Gemcitabine as a single agent in chemonaive cystectomy patients with locally advanced
      TCC of the bladder in an adjuvant setting. The patients will receive the following treatment:

      Arm A (treatment): Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 2 weeks (days 1 and
      8) followed by 1-week rest period. Repeat cycle on day 22. Maximum of 6 cycles. Begin
      treatment until 3 months after radical operation (within first 6 weeks is recommended).

      Arm B (control): No immediate post-surgery treatment. Watchful waiting; treatment only
      conditionally in case of progression with Gemcitabine (dose and schedule as in arm A).
