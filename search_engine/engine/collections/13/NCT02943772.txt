    
      Epididymitis or orchiepididymitis is an acute disease causing pain and discomfort.

      our hypothesis is that local cooling of the affected testis or epididymis may relieve the
      pain and reduce the analgetics consumption In order to examine this hypothesis we will
      recruit adult patients with epididymitis or orchiepididymitis and will randomize these
      patients to two arms.

      One arm will receive every 8 hours a brick cooled for at least 2 hours in -20(celsius) for
      local use on the affected hemiscrotum, while the second arm will receive a brick in room
      temperature.

      Pain level will be estimated one hour following the application of the brick using visual
      analogue pain score. Patient will receive analgetics according to a predefined escalating
      protocol.

      Pain level and analgetics consumption will be compared between the two arms.
