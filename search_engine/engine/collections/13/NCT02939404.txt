      exercise) or current weight loss drugs only lead to about 5 to 10% weight loss. This may be
      because a person s energy expenditure, aka the number of calories the body uses, leads to
      hunger and may increase the amount of food a person eats. Cold exposure is known to increase
      metabolism but it may not lead to weight loss if appetite and the desire for food are also
      increased. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate whether changing energy expenditure
      by cool temperature exposure results in changes in food intake. This study will involve a
      stay on our clinical research unit where we will determine the energy requirements (at 24
      degree C) of 68 healthy, adult volunteers without evidence of diabetes. Exposure to cool
      temperatures (16 degree C) will be used to increase the number of calories a person s body
      uses in a day. Participants will spend 24 hours in a room that measures energy expenditure
      while the temperature in the room is turned down, once with a fixed diet and once with a
      buffet of food choices. After the fixed diet, volunteers will self-select how much food they
      wish to eat for one day from a vending machine. Volunteers will also spend one day fasting
      followed by a day self-selecting their food from the vending machine. Findings from this
      study will provide knowledge about a possible causal link between energy expenditure and
      eating behavior. This information may shed light on why many weight loss interventions that
      increase energy expenditure do not work as well as expected, and may eventually lead to new
      weight loss approaches and therapies.
