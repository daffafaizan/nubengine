      establish a demographic platform for collection of relevant core patient information. This
      will be accomplished by the construction and implementation of a single data base
      encompassing all rare neurological diseases in pediatric and adult patients (the ERN-RND
      Registry), which will collect information according to the "Set of common data elements for
      Rare Diseases Registration" as it has been defined by the European Commission.

      The ERN-RND network covers the following six disease groups in patients of all age groups:
      (i) Ataxia and Hereditary Spastic Spinal Paralysis (HSP), (ii) Leukodystrophies, (iii)
      Frontotemporal Dementia, (iv) Dystonia, Paroxysmal Disorders and Neurodegeneration with Brain
      Iron Accumulation (NBIA), (v) Atypical Parkinsonism and (vi) Huntington's Disease & Choreas.
