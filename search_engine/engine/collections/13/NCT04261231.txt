    
      a number of 60 day-care as well as 100 in-hospital patients undergoing elective surgery in
      general anesthesia have been enrolled into this observational study. The recruitment of cases
      happened randomly on a daily basis according to the available operations in the surgical unit
      where the main investigator (NN) was performing her/his anesthesiological services. Thus
      there was no selection of specific surgeries or surgical disciplines.

      Inclusion criteria: adult patients (>18 y) undergoing surgery in general anesthesia.

      Exclusion criteria: emergency cases, patients aged < 18 years, pregnant women, inability to
      give informed consent.

      The data acquisition consisted of calculation of the individual pUSIS for the selected cases
      by end of surgery, and by collecting in the follow up period the following set of short term
      parameters:

      In-hospital patients

        -  time duration from end of surgery till discharge from PACU

        -  time duration from end of surgery till discharge from IMCU

        -  time duration from end of surgery till discharge from ICU

        -  time duration from end of surgery till discharge from hospital up to 30 days

        -  Occurrence and severity of complications the during hospital stay or up to 30 days
           according to a predefined list

      Day-care patients

        -  time duration from end of surgery till discharge from PACU

        -  time duration from end of surgery till discharge from hospital

        -  Occurrence and severity of complications the during hospital stay according to a
           predefined list

        -  Occurrence of readmission due to complications within a period of 10 days after surgery

      The predefined list of complications that could be observed during the follow up period
      consists of:

        -  Occurrence of postoperative pain that needed medical intervention, duration of this
           state, average severity level (according an ordinal scale with the levels: mild,
           moderate, severe)

        -  Occurrence of hemodynamic instability, duration of this state, average severity level
           (according an ordinal scale with the levels: mild, moderate, severe)

        -  Occurrence of postoperative hemorrhage, quantification in total ml of estimated blood
           loss

        -  Occurrence of respiratory support, duration of this state

        -  Occurrence of thrombo-embolic complications

        -  Occurrence of hepato-renal complications

        -  Occurrence of cerebral/neurological complications

        -  Occurrence of infectiological/inflamatory complications

        -  Average level of self-assessed subjective wellbeing (according an ordinal scale with the
           levels: excellent, rather good, moderate, bad, extremely bad)

      The obtained follow up results were subjected to correlation analyzis with the pUSIS values
      in order to determine their association and if possible to recognize threshold values that
      may indicate a suitable type/intensity of postoperative surveillance.
