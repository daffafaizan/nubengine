      Elevation of platelet reactivity plasminogen activator inhibitor, fibrinogen, von
      Willebrand's factor, and factor VII have been reported to increase myocardial infarction
      risk. Myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death are more frequent in the morning when
      platelet activity is increased and fibrinolysis is decreased. Reduction of recurrent
      myocardial infarction by aspirin and coumadin suggests causal roles for platelet activity and
      coagulation. Increases in viscosity and decreases in anti-thrombin III and Protein C have
      been linked with increased thrombosis. Despite these findings, a coherent picture of these
      disparate hemostatic indices as cardiac risk factors has yet to emerge.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Platelet reactivty, plasminogen activatator inhibitor, fibrinogen, von Willebrand's factor,
      factor VII, and other hemostatic risk factors were measured in all 4,000 subjects of the
      Framingham Offspring Study. The data were combined with the regularly collected Framingham
      data to: determine the relationships between hemostatic factors and carotid atherosclerosis
      as assessed by ultrasound; determine the relationship between hemostatic factors and the
      traditional cardiac risk factors; and determine if hemostatic risk factors independently
      predict myocardial infarction and cardiac death.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
