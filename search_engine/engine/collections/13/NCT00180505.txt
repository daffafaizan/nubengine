      with stenting is associated with high restenosis rates, especially with the first generation
      stents (stainless steel). Currently, self-expandable nitinol stents are commercialized which
      lead to higher primary patency rates as compared to the first generation stents, even in
      longer lesions. However, until now most data available are retrospective and uni-center. The
      ASSESS study is a prospective multi-center study investigating the performance (restenosis
      rate, patency rates) of the ABSOLUTE™. 035 peripheral self-expandable stent in longer lesions
      (lesion length from 4.00 mm to 200.00 mm).

      Moreover, literature shows stent fracture in nitinol stents, with a possible clinical
      relationship. For this reason, the ASSESS study will analyze the stent fractures of the
      ABSOLUTE™ stent, and a possible relationship between stent fracture and restenosis.
