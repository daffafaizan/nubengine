      increase rate of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, depression and adverse cardiovascular
      events. The evaluation of upper airway obstruction is vital to obtain site-specific
      treatment. Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy is a routinely exam which allows the direct
      observation of the upper airway during sedative induced sleep. Propofol and Dexmedetomidine
      are sedatives approved for all diagnostic examinations that required sedation.

      It's a Randomized Controlled study. 28 participants will be enrolled and randomized in two
      groups: in the first group the sedation state will be performed with Propofol, while in the
      second group will be used Dexmedetomidine for allow sedation state. The study will be
      evaluate the different hemodynamic and respiratory changes during sedation in these two
      different groups and differences in obstructive endoscopic anatomical patterns. This will be
      the first study in whic Dexmedetomidine and Propofol will be compared according to European
      DISE Recommendation published in august 2018 (references)
