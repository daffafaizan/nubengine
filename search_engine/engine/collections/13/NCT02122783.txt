      available ankle foot brace affect how stroke patients walk. The study brace is an ankle foot
      orthosis (AFO) that makes use of a newer type of joint that contains a soft insert, in
      addition to the conventional hard stops, to limit the range of motion of the ankle during
      walking. Participants undergo testing in the gaitlab after using the new brace for a period
      of time. The results of this study will help to clarify 1) whether and how this new joint
      affects the way you walk, 2) whether it makes it easier for the clinician to align your brace
      and 3) your opinions about the new joint.
