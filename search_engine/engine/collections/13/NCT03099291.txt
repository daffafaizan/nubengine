    
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study
      will evaluate whether D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII vaccine is attenuated and immunogenic in
      children 6 to 24 months of age.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV
      D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII vaccine or placebo at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants will be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 31 (outside of RSV
      season) and will remain on study until they complete the post-RSV season visit between April
      1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration
      will be between 6 and 13 months, depending on when they enroll in the study. Participants
      will be evaluated in study visits that may include physical examinations, blood collection,
      and nasal washes. Additionally, participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by study
      staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.
