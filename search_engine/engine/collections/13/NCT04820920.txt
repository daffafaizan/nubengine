      positive for postnatal depression on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) would be
      recruited and randomly assigned into two groups. Groups one will receive the online LTP+CaCBT
      treatment - the intervention will consist of a total of 12 group training sessions (45-60
      minutes). Groups two will receive routine treatment as usual (TAU) currently available in
      their GP NHS trust (e.g. antidepressants, online Tele counselling). Each group will be
      comprised of approximately 15 mother-child pairs.
