    
      To determine the immediate effects of taping on the three-dimensional joint kinematics and
      moments of the lower limb during running in ITBFS patients, and to determine any differences
      between the experimental and control groups.

      To determine the immediate effects of taping on muscle activity of the gluteus maximus,
      gluteus medius, tensor fascia lata, vastus medialis, and vastus lateralis in ITBFS patients,
      and to determine any differences between the experimental and control groups.

      To determine if the short-term perceptions of pain, symptoms, ADL function, sport and
      recreation function, quality of Life, and fear of movement are changed with taping, and to
      determine any differences between the experimental and control groups.

      To determine any perceived changes in the stability of the knee joint, comfort and benefits
      with taping, and to determine any differences between the experimental and control groups.

      To determine if muscle strength, muscle length, and functional movement are changed with
      taping, and to determine any differences between the experimental and control groups.

      To explore the relationship between the clinical and biomechanical outcome measures in ITBFS
      patients.
