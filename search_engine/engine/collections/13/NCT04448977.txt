      cognitive fatigue and on specific brain areas that have been shown to underlie cognitive
      fatigue in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The researchers will investigate the
      effects on the cognitive fatigue that develops during the performance of a demanding task,
      and also on how cognitive fatigue changes as a function of duration of treatment.
