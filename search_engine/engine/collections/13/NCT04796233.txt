      about their perspectives on preoperative ACP and discussion of their values, goals of care,
      and preferences for prolonged care in hospital prior to having surgery. We plan to conduct
      and audio record one-on-one interviews that are structured around standard questions about
      ACP. After recordings are completed, we plan to conduct an analysis of the interviews to find
      common themes and ideas that participants have about preoperative advance care planning.
      These results will help us understand whether patients value and wish to participate in
      advance care planning prior to major surgery, and will help to guide the structure and
      content of preoperative advance care plan programs in the future.
