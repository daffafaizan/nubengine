    
      Patients will be followed for 8 days. After inclusion, (day of the introduction of high-dose
      amoxicillin treatment), the residual amoxicillin plasma concentrations will be determined at
      Day1, Day4 +/- 1 day and Day7 +/- 1 day of the start of treatment. A urine collection will be
      performed the same day to search for crystalluria and measure the pH and urinary density.

      In case of KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) 2 or 3 stage renal failure or
      neurological signs compatible with overdose, residual amoxicillin and crystalluria and
      urinary density and urinary pH will be measured during the day of discovery of renal failure.

      In the case of KDIGO stage 1 kidney failure, a residual level of amoxicillin and a
      crystalluria search and the measurement of urinary density and urinary pH will be carried out
      the following day, when serum creatinine is checked according to usual practices.

      At day 7 the clinical and infectious biological evolution of the patient will be collected.
