      half-dose or a whole dose of a currently approved influenza virus vaccine in their arm. Prior
      to vaccination, subjects will have one tube of blood drawn. Subjects will be given a 3-day
      diary card to record any symptoms they may experience and asked to return for a second and
      final visit approximately 21 days following vaccination. A second blood draw will be done.
