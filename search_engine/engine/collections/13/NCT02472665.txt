    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, and single-arm study. The study population is
      planned to include 8 pediatric subjects (<6 years of age) with severe VWD without inhibitors
      and with no active bleeding at the time of inclusion. Eligible subjects will receive a single
      dose of Fanhdi for a PK evaluation and will be followed for 12 months for which the efficacy
      and safety of Fanhdi will be assessed. In addition, the type 3 VWD subjects, after 6 months
      of follow-up of the first infusion, will receive the second dose as in the 1st PK evaluation
      and undergo a 2nd PK evaluation.

      The study will consist of 2 phases:

        -  PK profile evaluation in which all eligible subjects will receive a single dose of 80
           IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo) of Fanhdi. In
           addition, after 6 months of follow-up of the first infusion, type 3 VWD subjects will
           receive the second dose of Fanhdi and undergo a 2nd PK evaluation with a reduced
           sampling schedule.

        -  A 12-month Follow-up period during which the safety and efficacy of Fanhdi will be
           assessed in the prevention and management of bleeding episodes and/or management of
           perioperative hemostasis during surgery and/or invasive procedures.
