      recent years it has been shown that for many patient populations a restrictive transfusion
      strategy is not inferior compared to a liberal transfusion strategy with regard to overall
      outcome.

      So far it is unclear whether patients with an ARDS should receive blood transfusions
      according to a restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy. Besides pulmonary gar exchange
      and cardiac output, the hemoglobin concentration is an important determinant for oxygen
      delivery.

      The aim of this retrospective observational study is to analyze if low levels of hemoglobin/a
      restrictive transfusion strategy and are associated with a different mortality compared to
      higher levels of hemoglobin/a liberal transfusion strategy in patients with an ARDS.
