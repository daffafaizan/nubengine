      bladder cancer. The three agents being used in this study are:

        -  A new, investigational, personal cancer vaccine called "NEO-PV-01"

        -  Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), an investigational adjuvant that is used to help stimulate the
           immune system

        -  A cancer drug called nivolumab (OPDIVOÂ®)

      These agents are considered immunotherapy and work by stimulating the immune system to fight
      cancer. NEO-PV-01 is a truly personal vaccine therapy in that it is custom designed and
      manufactured to include targets for the immune system that are present uniquely on an
      individual's cancer. Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that helps stimulate the immune system and make
      the vaccine, NEO-PV-01 more effective. Nivolumab helps T-cells, a certain type of immune
      cell, that recognize these targets to reach and attack the tumor. Nivolumab is in clinical
      development for treatment of bladder cancer and is approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration) for the treatment of some lung, skin, kidney, and blood cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant in
      combination with nivolumab is safe and effective for patients with melanoma, lung, or bladder
      cancer. The study also will see if NEO-PV-01 vaccine + adjuvant with nivolumab can improve
      responses compared to available therapies such as nivolumab monotherapy The side effects of
      NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant and nivolumab will be monitored and additional research tests will be
      done to assess the immune response against each individual's cancer.
