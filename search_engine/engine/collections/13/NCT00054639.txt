      I. To determine the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of G3139 (oblimersen sodium) and
      Rituximab in patients with recurrent B-cell NHL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of G3139 and Rituximab on the level of Bcl-2 expression.

      II. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of G3139 and Rituximab on
      Bcl-2 protein gene expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oblimersen sodium intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-7, 15-21, and
      29-35 and rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on days 3, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients achieving
      stable disease or objective response may receive one additional course of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
