      task. In the second session, participants will go through a clinical interview and will have
      an EEG recording while playing another computer task. In the third session, participants will
      undergo an fMRI scan while playing another computer task. All tasks assess reward learning.
      At three and six months after the final session, participants will come back for a follow-up
      interview session during which a clinician will assess symptom severity. There will be no
      intervention in this study.
