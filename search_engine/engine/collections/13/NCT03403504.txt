      to determine the PK profile of oxycodone from OTR tablet 10 mg and OXYCONTIN tablet 10 mg in
      Chinese subjects with chronic pain in a fasted state.

      the China regulations for drug registration require that controlled medicine (opioid is
      categorized to be a controlled medicine) should not be applied in healthy volunteers in
      clinical studies. In this BE study, subjects with histories of chronic pain are chosen as the
      target population.

      Inclusion/exclusion criteria are strictly defined to reduce the potential variation of the PK
      data. The subjects with abnormal liver and kidney functions, which may affect the metabolism
      of oxycodone.

      As a general rule, cross-over design is applied in the study to decrease the inter-individual
      variations between the two cohorts. A washout period lasting for at least 7 half-lives of the
      investigational medicine is needed to eliminate the drug residual from the previous period

      open label design is applied since the plasma concentration of oxycodone is to be objectively
      tested and analysed and randomization will be applied to reduce selection bias.
