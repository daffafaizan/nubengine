    
      A total of 20 most frequently asked questions will be defined on a cohort of 150 breast
      cancer patients. These questions will be asked on the one hand to the chatbot Vik and on the
      other hand to a multidisciplinary medical committee (surgeon oncologist, medical oncologist
      and oncologist radiotherapist). The scientific quality of the responses of the two groups
      will be validated by a second multidisciplinary group of physicians, independent of the
      first.

      A cohort of 150 patients will then be randomized blind and in 1 to 1 to receive the responses
      of the chatbot Vik and the answers of the doctors' committee. Each patient will then have to
      answer the EORTC QLQ-INFO255-7 questionnaire, evaluating the quality of the medical
      information.
