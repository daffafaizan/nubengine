    
      The central framework for the project is a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study in
      which subjects with the non-fluent/agrammatic and semantic variants of primary progressive
      aphasia (naPPA and svPPA, respectively) will undergo language testing and structural and
      functional brain imaging before and after receiving 10 semi-consecutive daily sessions of
      real or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with modified
      constraint-induced language therapy (mCILT). Language testing and brain imaging will be
      repeated immediately after completion of and up-to 24 weeks following completion of
      treatment.

      Subjects with naPPA and svPPA will be randomized to one of two study arms: tDCS+mCILT or sham
      stimulation+mCILT paired with pre- and post-stimulation imaging and behavioral measures.
      Equal numbers of subjects with naPPA and svPPA will be randomized to the tDCS + mCILT and
      sham + mCILT study arms. The study is double-blinded, in that neither the subject nor the
      study personnel administering tDCS or sham stimulation will know which arm of the study the
      subject has been randomized into. Study coordinators will administer tDCS by entering a
      pre-determined code that has been programmed into the device by another member of the study
      team. Data will be digitally audio-recorded and analyzed off-line, such that study team
      members performing data coding and analysis will likewise be blinded to the treatment
      condition of each subject.

      Subject participation in this protocol will occur during 36 planned visits that will span
      approximately 12 months. The events of the study visits are described below:

      VISIT 1:

      Informed consent and screening

      VISIT 2:

      Baseline MRI

      VISIT 3 & 4:

      Baseline language assessment

      VISITS 5-14:

      tDCS+mCILT OR sham stimulation+mCILT, depending on the study arm to which they had been
      randomized.

      VISIT 15 & 16:

      Follow-up language assessment Follow-up MRI
