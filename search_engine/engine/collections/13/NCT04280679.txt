      tissue. The energy is delievered via an extra-corporeal treatment probe, which includes an
      imaging system. The high energy ultrasound waves propagate through the skin and are focused
      on a portion of the target tissue, generating intense heat and causing local cell apoptosis
      and progressive tissue volume reduction over the following months in the tissue within the
      focal area. The process is then repeated in a stepwize fashion to destroy the targeted
      tissues. The Sonovein 2 system is comprised of several components, including the console,
      treatment arm containing the visualization and treatment unit (VTU), a computer with
      touchscreen user interface. In addition, the Sonovein 2 system is intended to be used in
      conjunction with a disposable cooling and coupling system known as ePack.
