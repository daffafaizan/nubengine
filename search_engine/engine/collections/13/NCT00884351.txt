    
      Objective:

      This protocol will test the hypothesis that the 3-Hz spike-wave discharges seen in absence
      epilepsy originate in the thalamus. We will use an emerging modality, magnetoencephalograpy
      (MEG), to test this hypothesis.

      Study Population:

      33 patients with absence seizures.

      Design:

      This is a non-invasive imaging study that involves a 275-channel whole head MEG recording and
      a structural MRI for co-registration of MEG data.

      Outcome Measure:

      The primary outcome measure is the source localization of spike-wave discharges on
      magnetoencephalography.
