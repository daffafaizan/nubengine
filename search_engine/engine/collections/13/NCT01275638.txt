    
      This prospective, randomized, single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was
      conducted between April 2005 and May 2008 in the department of Medical ICU and the Department
      of Infectious Diseases of Erciyes University Medical School. The study was approved by our
      Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from the patients' relatives.
      The study did not alter therapy, and each patient's clinical care was determined by their own
      physician.
