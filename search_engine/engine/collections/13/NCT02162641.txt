      fashion, with initial involvement of a primary node, called the sentinel node, before
      dissemination to the remainder of the lymphatic chain. If the sentinel node is histologically
      negative, then the remainder of the nodes in the same anatomic region will be at a lower
      (assumed to be minimal) risk of containing metastases. SLNB is part of standard care for
      patients with malignant melanoma and with breast cancer but has yet to be prospectively
      evaluated in patients with anal cancer.

      Currently, the standard way to treat patients with anal cancer is to deliver a combination of
      chemotherapy and radiation to the tumour at the anus together with 'preventative'
      (prophylactic) radiotherapy to the lymph glands of the groin and pelvis. There is a growing
      perception for the need to reduce the morbidity of radiotherapy i.e. current regimens
      over-treat the patient and one approach is to reduce radiotherapy volume and/or dose where
      there is an absence or very low risk of nodal metastases.

      This feasibility study is a vital first step in informing the design of a larger study
      examining the role of SLNB in clinical decision-making and outcomes for patients with anal
      cancer. In this trial eligible patients will attend for lymphoscintigraphy, to locate the
      lymph node, before sentinel lymph node removal by surgery. Detection rate of the sentinel
      node(s) will be the key outcome for the study.
