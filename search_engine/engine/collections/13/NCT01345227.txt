      in patients having contraindications for intraportal infusion. A needle for BM aspiration (14
      G) is inserted into the superior-posterior iliac crest and islet suspension (1:2.5;
      tissue:Ringer's Lactate solution) is infused. The entire intraBM-injection procedure lasted
      8-15 min from the beginning of anaesthesia (short propofol sedation).
