    
      This was a single-dose, open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study, evaluating the
      comparative pharmacokinetics of the test product (MMF) versus the reference product (DMF)
      under fasting conditions. Fifty (50) healthy, adult male and non-pregnant female subjects
      were enrolled. Screening of subjects occurred within 21 days prior to the first dose.
      Subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences prior to the first dose.

      In each period, subjects received a single oral dose of MMF 190 mg administered as two 95 mg
      delayed-release capsules (test product) or TecfideraÂ® 240 mg DMF delayed-release capsule
      (reference product), followed by blood sampling (including predose samples) up to 24 hours
      postdose for the determination of plasma concentrations of MMF. There was a washout period of
      2 days between the 2 doses.

      Safety was monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory evaluations.
