    
      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  patients undergoing elective abdominal, thoracic, vascular surgery

        -  minimum age 18 years

        -  informed consent

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  patients with severe cardiomyopathy or severe heart failure

        -  history of coagulation disorders

        -  patients with severe cardiovascular or respiratory disorders

        -  renal insufficiency

      Respiratory mechanic parameters (i.e., inspiratory peak pressure, plateau pressure, total
      airway resistance, and static compliance) are obtained .Blood samples are drawn
      simultaneously from the arterial catheters for gas analysis. Data were collected after
      induction of anesthesia (T0) after 1 h (T1), 2 h (T2), 3 h (T3) and at the end of surgery.

      Primary outcome: evaluate the fluids effects on oxygenation, respiratory mechanics

      Secondary outcome: Incidence of surgery related complications
