    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To analyze the mechanism of development of thalidomide/lenalidomide-induced venous
           thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with multiple myeloma treated on clinical trial
           ECOG-E4A03 or E-E1A00.

        -  To determine the intensity, dynamics, and specificity of cathepsin G (CG) upregulation
           in response to thalidomide and lenalidomide treatment.

        -  To determine the specificity and threshold levels of CG for induction of platelet
           aggregation in response to thalidomide and lenalidomide and the resulting risk for VTE
           development.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples obtained before, during, and after treatment with thalidomide or
      lenalidomide from patients previously enrolled on clinical trial ECOG-E4A03 or E-E1A00 are
      analyzed to determine the total content of cathepsin G (CG) via ELISA; to determine mRNA
      levels of CG via RT-PCR; and for platelet aggregation studies. Blood samples are collected
      from healthy volunteers for platelet preparation.
