    
      Institutional approval and written informed consent from parents or guardians of healthy
      children, with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and/or with increased end-tidal C02 (sleep
      related hypoventilation, obstructive hypoventilation or sustained alveolar hypoventilation),
      confirmed with sleep study, scheduled for elective outpatient or inpatient
      adeno-tonsillectomy at our hospital, will be obtained. The study will be prospective,
      randomized, double blinded and placebo controlled. A computer generated randomization list
      will be used, and the study will be registered with clinical.trials.gov. Written child assent
      will be obtained from children 7 years and older. Copies of a flyer and an explanation of the
      study will be provided at the office of all the pediatric ENT surgeons who practice at the
      Memorial Hermann Hospital OR. The investigators will communicate with the nurses at the
      surgeons' office and ask them to give the flyer with an explanation of the study to the
      parents and children on the day they schedule the surgery. The flyer with an explanation of
      study will be sent to IRB for review and approval. A research assistant will invite parents
      or guardians in the DSU unit, anesthesia clinic or on the floor to allow their children to be
      part of the study. Children with OSA and/or increased end tidal C02 (sleep related
      hypoventilation, obstructive hypoventilation or sustained alveolar hypoventilation), 2-12
      years of age, and both genders will be eligible to be part of the study. OSA and its severity
      will be diagnosed by a preoperative polysomnography. Children with compromised
      cardiovascular, pulmonary or renal function, those with congenital syndromes, sickle cell
      disease, history of seizures and those receiving theophylline will be excluded.
