      investigated in healthy subjects. In addition, it will be assessed if meal calories can
      affect the efficacy of AN-PEP. Subjects receive intragastrically, either AN-PEP or placebo,
      with either a high or a low caloric meal in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
      cross-over fashion. Gastrointestinal fluid will be sampled to measure breakdown of gluten.
