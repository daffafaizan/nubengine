      procedure might impair periodontal healing in deep infrabony pockets due to the mechanical
      disruption of demineralized bone sections at the bottom of periodontal lesions. This
      randomized controlled clinical trial therefore aims at comparing the resulting attachment
      gain 6 months after one-stage antiinfective periodontal therapy comprising the concomitant
      subgingival removal of soft bacterial biofilms and calculus with a two-stage approach
      removing subgingival calculus only 6 weeks after the initial removal of soft subgingival
      bacterial biofilms.
