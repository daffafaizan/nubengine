      ratio. Independent personnel not involved in data collection or intervention will perform and
      conceal the randomization using an online data server. Research assistants who are blinded to
      the group allocation will conduct all the baseline assessments and subsequent event
      surveillance. All data will also be entered and checked by the blinded research assistants.
      All procedures concur with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013).
