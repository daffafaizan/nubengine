      may decide to keep their condition a secret or even to withdraw from other people altogether
      in order to minimise the risk of being labelled. Secrecy can help on the short term to
      protect individuals from public stigma, but often it has negative long-term consequences such
      as social isolation, distress and unemployment. Disclosure, on the other hand, carries the
      risk to be discriminated by others, but can reduce the burden of secrecy, lead to support by
      others and reduce public stigma. In this study investigators aim to evaluate whether a group
      program run both by people with mental illness (peers) and professionals helps to reduce
      self-stigma and makes it easier for adolescents to handle the necessary choices related to
      secrecy versus disclosure.
