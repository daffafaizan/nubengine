        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of cladribine, cytarabine, and imatinib mesylate in
           patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia or blastic phase chronic
           myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate the expression of c-kit and the presence of c-kit mutations with clinical
           response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate the in vitro inhibitory effects of imatinib mesylate and cytarabine on the
           proliferation and survival of leukemic cells with clinical response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-15 and cladribine IV over 2
      hours and cytarabine IV over 4 hours on days 3-7. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously on days 2-7. Treatment repeats every 15 days for 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
