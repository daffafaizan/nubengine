    
      This is a Phase I/II single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind,
      dose-escalation, double-dose administration study comprising two dosing cohorts (Cohort 1:
      250 mcg M-001 per injection and Cohort 2: 500 mcg M-001 per injection) with 20 subjects in
      each cohort receiving either adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted formulations. The adjuvant used was
      Montanide ISA VG51. Cohort 3 with 20 subjects was administered placebo. After priming with
      M-001 or placebo, all participants were administered a boost of a conventional trivalent
      vaccine on day 42.

      There was a minimum of 10 days interval between last dosing of the first injection to the
      last subject of the 250 μg cohort (Cohort 1) and first dosing of the first subject injection
      with 500 µg cohort (Cohort 2).

      For each subject, the second injection was performed 21+2 days after his/her first injection,
      provided they were deemed fit to be dosed by a study physician.

      The DSMB reviewed the safety data obtained from cohorts 1 and 2 before approving their second
      injection and before dose escalation.
