      treatment in patients with unprotected left main disease. However, patients with ULMD and
      high surgical risk score or favourable anatomy are still referred for angioplasty. Recently,
      several studies and registries comparing surgery and percutaneous intervention with drug
      eluting stents report similar results regarding cardiovascular death and myocardial
      infarction in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease including unprotected left
      main disease.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate major cardiovascular events in a "real world" registry.
