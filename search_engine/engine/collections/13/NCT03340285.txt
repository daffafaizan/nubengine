      single-blind, parallel-groups.

      Patients with mild hypercholesterolemia, of both sexes and aged between 18 and 75 years, will
      be recruited, from the beginning of the study and for the next 2 weeks at the outpatients
      Hypertension Clinic.

      The subjects will be enrolled in the 50/50% male/female ratio Â± 10% comparable for age, in
      order to obtain a proper comparison between groups with similar demographic characteristics
      or not statistically different.

      The subjects, selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be divided into
      two groups, to a computer based randomization scheme to receive one of two different
      treatments, two tablet/day before meals of the new nutraceutical AkP06 (Akademy Pharma)
      containing Morus Alba and without Monacolin K, vs. two tablet/day of placebo, always before
      meals. During the first two weeks both groups will follow the prescribed diet and assume
      placebo tablets. At the end, blood tests (traditional metabolic parameters, blood glucose,
      HbA1C, fasting insulin, transaminase levels, CPK) will be performed. During the next 4 weeks
      a group will assume AkP06 (Akademy Pharma) containing Morus Alba and without Monakolin K, the
      other will assume placebo and everyone will continue to follow the prescribed diet. At the
      end of this period blood tests will be repeated. Tablets of AkP06 and placebo will be
      provided by Akademy Pharma free of charge
