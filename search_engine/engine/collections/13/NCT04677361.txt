      without radiation therapy, depending on staging. The problem with current available
      treatments is that SCLC almost always becomes resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. Marrow
      infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs™) are a novel method of adoptive cell therapy that provide an
      activated, polyclonal population of autologous tumor-specific T cells derived from bone
      marrow. Prior to treatment of MILs™ patients will receive non-myeloablative lymphodepletion
      with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to increase the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy.
      Bone marrow aspirate (BMA) will be collected from the patient to manufacture the MILs™. Upon
      progression and after the bone marrow is collected, a subject may receive bridging treatment
      of pembrolizumab until the MILs™ are received, after which treatment of the MILs™ and
      pembrolizumab will begin.
