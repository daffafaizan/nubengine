      hypothesized that the rate of skeletal muscle loss is accelerated in this population, and
      this loss is even more pronounce than the general critically ill patients. We further
      hypothesized that the increased muscle loss will lead to worse functional outcome (lower
      muscle strength) in COVID-19 critically ill patients compared with age- and sex-matched
      non-COVID-19 critically ill patients, as it has been shown that quadriceps thickness is
      strongly correlated with functional status at ICU discharge. Furthermore, a recent systematic
      review and meta-analysis in survivors of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS
      or Middle-east respiratory syndrome, MERS, or COVID-19) also demonstrated reduced exercise
      capacity and quality of life at 6 months after hospitalization or ICU admission
