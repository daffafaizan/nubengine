      that have been associated with relief of symptoms associated with general prostate discomfort
      and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in these symptoms after taking this
      supplement daily for 12 weeks.

      Although it was not until the latter part of the twenties century that investigators began to
      explore the importance of lycopene, the benefits of this natural carotenoid are well studied.
      A number of clinical trials have shown lycopene to be effectual for alleviating prostate
      discomfort, symptoms of BPH and LUTS.

      The American Urological Association estimates that 90% of men between 45 and 80 years of age
      suffer some symptoms of LUTS. Several pathophysiological mechanisms are believed to lead to
      LUTS and BPH, including oxidative damage, inflammation and sympathetic nervous system issues.
      High blood lycopene concentrations have been suggested in epidemiological trials to be
      associated with decreases in oxidative stress and contributions to disease prevention
      overall. Also, clinical trials have shown that higher levels of lycopene in the blood are
      associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, as well as other inflammatory conditions.
