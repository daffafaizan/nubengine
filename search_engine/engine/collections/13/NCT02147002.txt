      disease(I-III) and 30 healthy subjects as a comparison group.

      At the beginning and at the end of the observation period, besides the clinical test, some
      other tests will be carried out: echocardiography, pulse wave velocity (PWV), ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Blood will be collected for laboratory tests such as: lipid
      profile, uric acid, C reactive protein (CRP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine,
      morphology, calcium (Ca),phosphorus (P), Ca x P, ionogram, xanthine oxidase, monocyte
      chemoattractant protein (MPC1),Omega-3 acids, resolvin and protectins - the metabolites of
      Omega-3 acids, creatinine excretion, MPC1 excretion and excretion of uric acid. The patients
      will be treated with Omega-3 acids as a Gold Omega 3 preparation (2x1 capsule where 1 capsule
      = 1000 mg) for 6 months.
