      I. Determine the efficacy of bevacizumab, in terms of progression-free survival and disease
      stability and response, in patients with unresectable nonmetastatic hepatocellular cancer
      (HCC) without main portal vein invasion.

      II. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. III. Assess tumor vascular perfusion
      kinetics, by dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI, in patients before and after treatment with
      this regimen.

      IV. Determine the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-inhibition by this drug
      on circulating levels of VEGF and related cytokines that also contribute to HCC pathogenesis
      (including bFGF, TGF-alpha, and IGF-II) and on potential alterations of these levels on
      prognostic variables in these patients.

      V. Determine the effect of VEGF-inhibition by this drug on hepatic function and hepatitis
      viral activity in cirrhosis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment continues every 2
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
