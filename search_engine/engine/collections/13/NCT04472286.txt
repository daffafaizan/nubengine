      pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma cancer survivors at two time points:
      baseline and 6 months. At the two study timepoints, all study participants will be asked to
      wear an accelerometer, receive a DXA scan of the lumbar spine and hip, and have blood drawn
      for analysis. Study participants will be given a gift card stipend for each study visit
      attended. Study visits will coincide with regular office visits to Children's Hospital
      Oncology Clinic and the Children's Hospital Survivorship Clinics whenever possible. The
      potential mechanism by which physical activity mediates bone changes will be explored by
      concurrently measuring changes in lean/fat mass and metabolic status. This pilot study will
      provide data to inform the design of a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a
      physical activity intervention on bone health in PCS.
