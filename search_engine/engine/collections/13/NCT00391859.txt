      with a high likelihood of knee OA that could be a model for other chronic diseases. The
      intervention will be multidisciplinary such that it will be initiated by community
      pharmacists with referral to a comprehensive OA treatment program at the provincial arthritis
      center involving physiotherapists. In addition, formal communication will be initiated with
      their family doctor. Those in the usual care group will receive an educational OA pamphlet.
      The primary objective of this pilot project is to determine the proportion of patients who
      meet the Arthritis Foundation's Quality Indicator Set for osteoarthritis in the treatment arm
      compared to those in the usual care arm. Specifically, this indicator set focuses on health
      service provision within the first few months of diagnosis which includes physical
      examination, radiographs, education, exercise, weight loss, assistive devices and
      pharmacologic therapy.
