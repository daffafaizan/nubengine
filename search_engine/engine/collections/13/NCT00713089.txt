      and development of allergy in 2 populations with different socioeconomic status and
      prevalence of allergy (high in Singapore and low in Indonesia). A cohort of children will be
      followed prospectively from birth up to 2 years. Stool from different time points,
      environmental exposure data and clinical manifestations of allergy will be analyzed and
      recorded. Singapore and Indonesia will provide the South East Asian context in resolving
      early life influences associated with divergent allergy prevalence. By studying subjects
      below age two, this will provide valuable knowledge regarding the epidemiology of allergy and
      atopy in the first years of life, which is poorly documented in this age group. More
      importantly, the prospective nature and varied parameters included in this study (colony
      counts, species variety and genetic diversity of microbiota) will add to the global data and
      scientific evidence for the role of these factors in allergy development.
