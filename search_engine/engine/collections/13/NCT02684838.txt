    
      This is a prospective, observational registry in patients who have been prescribed Gliadel
      Wafer by the physician as part of usual care. Data will be collected on the safety and
      effectiveness of treatment with Gliadel Wafer perioperatively and ongoing during regular
      office visits up to 3-years. Patients enrolled in this registry will be asked to complete a
      questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain [FACT-Br]) about their
      well-being and clinicians will complete the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) during office
      visits.
