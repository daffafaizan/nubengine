      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The primary objective is to establish the safety,
      tolerability and MTD of SCO-101 when combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Secondary
      objectives are efficacy and to establish PK parameters of SCO-101. The target indication is
      patients with inoperal pancreatic cancer who are to be treated with gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel. The study is designed as a standard 3+3 dose escalation study with increasing
      doses of SCO-101 and a fixed dose (standard regimen) of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. An
      interim report will be prepared once the last patient in the MTD cohort has completed one
      treatment cycle. Patients will continue treatment until disease progression to evaluate
      secondary objectives. One treatment Cycle is 28 days. The starting dose of SCO-101 is 150 mg
      6 daily dosing in a bi-weekly schedule) and may be increased to a maximum of 350 mg (5
      cohorts with 50 mg increments). A total of up to 18 patients are anticipated if dose
      escalation to the 5th cohort. Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is administered according to
      local standard recommendations once weekly for three weeks followed by one weeks treatment
      holiday (dosing on day 6, day 13 and day 20). Patients may continue treatment until treatment
      progression.
