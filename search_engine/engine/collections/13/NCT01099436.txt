    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the value of neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride,
           cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel with or without zoledronic acid in patients with
           HER2-negative large resectable or locally advanced breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate clinical response with pathological responses in both treatment arms.

        -  To evaluate the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding zoledronic acid to neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy.

        -  To evaluate heterogeneity of the ER/PR and HER2 measurement in core biopsy and the
           surgical specimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized between 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and docetaxel
           IV on day 1. Patients also receive zoledronic acid IV over 15 minutes on day 1.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and
           docetaxel IV as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
