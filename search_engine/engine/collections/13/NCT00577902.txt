      receiving concurrent radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Patients with any pathologically
      proven head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, except those of the nasopharynx and sinus will
      be eligible, if there is no evidence of metastatic disease. Patients with previous
      chemotherapy or radiation treatment will be excluded. A Karnofsky performance status ≥60% or
      more is required. Patients with significant cardiac, chest or gastrointestinal comorbidities
      will be excluded, as will those who have had previous chemotherapy or radiation treatment.
      Patients may receive standard nutritional care, as needed.

      This study will involve an examination of the patient to evaluate mucositis, collection blood
      samples for analysis of specific indicators of nutritional status and completion of
      questionnaire regarding food intake and functional status. Blood samples will be collected
      and brief questionnaires about diet and weight status will be completed at each of the three
      visits. Visits will occur before treatment begins, at the end of XRT treatment and 4-6 weeks
      after completion of XRT. Assessments for the presence and severity of mucositis and
      functional status (Karnofsky) will be done at each visit. All of the samples and data
      collection will be done at visits to clinic required for the patients' treatment. If it is
      necessary to obtain blood samples from the central venous catheter, this will be done using
      aseptic technique and will be performed by a nurse. In some instances, the information
      obtained as part of this project may be used to reduce side effects of therapy.
