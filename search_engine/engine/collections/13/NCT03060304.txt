    
      Objective: To investigate the effects of tamoxifen on endometrial thickness and pregnancy
      outcome in women with thin endometrium undergoing frozen thawed cycle.

      Study design: This is a single center, randomize control clinical trial. We plan to recruit
      100 patients from Mar 2017 to Dec 2019, who failed to develop an adequate endometrial
      thickness in previous frozen embryo transfer cycle twice or even more times and willing to
      have another attempt, dividing into two group, one prepare the endometrium through ovulation
      induction with tamoxifen and progesterone(Study Group), the other is hormone replacement
      cycle (control group).

      Intervention: Study Group will give endometrial preparation with tamoxifen and progesterone,
      control group will prepared with estrogen and progesterone supplementation.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of the study was endometrium thickness and
      clinical pregnancy rate, the secondary outcomes are cycle duration, cycle cancellation rate,
      implantation rate, miscarriage rate, live birth rate.
