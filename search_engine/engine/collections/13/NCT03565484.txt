      recognized as a main risk factor of multiple gastric pathology, especially non-cardiac
      gastric cancer. Strong evidence supports that H.pylori eradication is an effective approach
      to reduce the incidence of those pathological processes. Antimicrobial susceptibility test
      can pick out sensitive drugs to kill Helicobacter pylori, and reduce secondary drug
      resistance. But, there is a lack of high quality RCT to compare its efficacy with empirical
      regimen in the rescue treatment.

      This study aims to assess the efficacy of 14-day antimicrobial susceptibility test guided
      quadruple therapy for the rescue treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. Comparing this
      regimen with 14-day personal Medication History guided therapy to tell which one is better in
      clinic practice. Alterations in H.pylori assosicated dyspepsia and safety outcomes will also
      be evaluated.
