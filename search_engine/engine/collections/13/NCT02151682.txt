      morphine prolonged-release (PR) tablets. Assignment was done randomly (like tossing a coin).
      The participant and the caregiver knew which medication the child was taking. The primary
      endpoint was based on data collected in Part 1 of this study.

      If eligible and willing, participants from Part 1 could enter a 12 month follow-up period
      (Part 2). In Part 2 of this study, participants were either treated with tapentadol PR
      tablets or entered observations arms where they were not treated at all or with standard of
      care.
