    
      This study is a single-center blinded study that will enroll approximately 150 adult
      subjects. Trained auscultators will perform the standard auscultation BP measurements. They
      will be blinded to each other's measurements and from the ViSi measurements.

      The study population will be randomized into two groups based on the side of the blood
      pressure measurement: the left arm group (LAG) and the right arm group (RAG).

      The randomization ratio of the LAG and RAG will be 1:1. There will be forced stratification
      in order to ensure that the study subjects meet the required arm circumference and blood
      pressure distributions as specified in the SP10:2008 and ISO 81060-2:2009(E) standards.
