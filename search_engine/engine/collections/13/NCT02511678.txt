      and who have been determined to be an appropriate candidate for cryoablation therapy were
      offered enrollment into the study. Participants agreeing to participate will read and sign an
      informed consent form and thus become participants in the study. Treatment will be performed
      using a Galil Medical cryoablation system and Galil Medical cryoablation needles.
      Participants will have one cryoablation procedure and will be followed for up to 6 months for
      palliation of pain, quality of life, and analgesic usage. Baseline and follow-up data will be
      collected for each participant via a web-based electronic data collection tool.
