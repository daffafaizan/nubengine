    
      Fluconazole and flucytosine have different mechanisms of action. Since fluconazole has not
      been associated with hematologic suppression and does not produce renal impairment that can
      result in higher serum flucytosine levels, this combination may be better tolerated than is
      amphotericin B plus flucytosine.

      Patients in each cohort receive a lower dose of fluconazole alone or in combination with
      flucytosine, or a higher dose of fluconazole alone. Doses in subsequent cohorts are escalated
      if safety data in the previous cohort is satisfactory. Patients are evaluated weekly for the
      first 4 weeks and every 2 weeks thereafter. Therapy continues until 8 weeks after the CSF
      becomes culture negative, up to a maximum of 26 weeks.
