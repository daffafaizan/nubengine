      high, therefore, it is recommended to manage it surgically. A frequently used surgical
      technique is static medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction (e.g.
      Sch√∂ttle-technique). A novel dynamic surgical technique according to Becher was developed,
      addressing the most common complications occurring in static reconstruction, which are
      malpositioning and overtensioning of the graft. This study is to assess and compare clinical
      and functional outcomes of dynamic and static medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction.
