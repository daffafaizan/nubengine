      is the realization of mastoidectomy followed by posterior tympanotomy, in order to expose the
      round window, which finally permits to access to the cochlea. This procedure might be
      complicated with facial paresis, loss of residual hearing, because of anatomy relationships
      in this millimetric area.

      CT scan of temporal bone is part of systematic preoperative assessment. Technological
      advances in radiology during the last decades now provide inframillimetric resolution. Thus,
      otologic surgeons wish they could anticipate round window exposure from these CT scan. This
      could decrease the procedure duration, complication occurrence, or improve surgical strategy.

      Several studies proposed radiological criteria in this aim, from more or less complex
      measures in preoperative temporal bone CT scan. However, these diagnostic tests performances
      have not been assessed for most of them, or compared between them.
