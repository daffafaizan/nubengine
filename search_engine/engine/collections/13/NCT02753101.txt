      criteria for sciatica or CRPS. A signed consent will be obtained from willing participants.

      For the PET/MRI scan, the participants will be injected with [18F]FTC-146 intravenously.
      After injection, simultaneous PET and MRI scans will be acquired using a hybrid PET/MRI
      scanner. Throughout scanning, participants will be monitored for blood pressure, temperature,
      heart rate and pulse oximetry. Participants will be asked to void their bladder as frequently
      as they can to reduce radiation exposure. Following the scan, participants will be contacted
      to check for adverse drug events, and any events will be recorded in the case report.

      Evidence in the literature points strongly toward an involvement of S1 receptors in nervous
      system inflammation, which is known to be an important biologic disease/disorder mechanism
      for maintenance and perpetuation of chronic pain.

      The main purpose of this research study is to image and identify activated pain pathways in
      human subjects using [18F]FTC-146 PET/MRI.
