      collected before and immediately after the 7 days of intake and analysed using point of care
      coagulation assessment instruments and flow dependent platelet aggregation using a microfluid
      flow controlled system (Cellix). For point of care coagulation assessment the multiple
      electrode platelet aggregometer Multiplate, the viscoelastic rotational thromboelastometers
      ROTEM and Sonoclot will be used. Flow cytometry may also be utilized.
