      with a substance use problem (i.e. target client) and one peer, to one of two conditions. In
      the Peer-Enhanced Motivational Interviewing (PMI) condition, target clients and peers will
      receive separate one-hour sessions of Motivational Interviewing (MI) , an
      empirically-supported treatment that helps individuals work through ambivalence about making
      changes in substance use. MI is thought to work because it is a non-confrontational
      intervention where a therapist empathetically reviews substance use behaviors, listens
      empathetically, and reinforces any client statements indicating a desire to change. With the
      'peer' of each PMI dyad, the therapist presents peers with data about the extent of the
      target client's substance use, builds the peer's motivation to help their friend, and teaches
      the peer communication skills they can use to influence the target client's substance use. In
      the WC condition, target clients and peers can receive PMI after the study follow-up period.
      Both target clients and their peers are followed for 12 weeks post-intervention.

      The main purpose of this project is to test whether Peer-Enhanced Motivational Interviewing
      (PMI) results in superior alcohol and marijuana use outcomes for emerging adults (EAs, ages
      18-29) and their peers. Ninety peer dyads (total n = 180, ntarget client = 90, npeer = 90)
      are randomized to receive either Peer-Enhanced Motivational Intervie (PMI) or Waitlist
      Control (WC).
