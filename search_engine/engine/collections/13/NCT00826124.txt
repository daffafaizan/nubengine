      and leg pain will be randomized to receive one of two treatments. Sixty-three patients will
      be allocated to group I and up to 68 to group II (see below and statistical analysis). All
      patients will be candidates for ESI based on history and physical exam. All 63 group I
      patients will receive two ESI based solely on history and PE (i.e. the treating physician
      will be blinded to MRI results). Group II will receive treatment based on MRI, history and
      PE. This probably but may not include ESI (i.e. it is conceivable that a normal MRI might
      result in conventional therapy instead of ESI, though chemical irritation of nerve roots
      often occurs without disc protrusion. We estimate this to occur in no more than 10% of cases
      (probably less); hence, we are planning to randomize up to 68 patients to group II. If an ESI
      is done, the patient will receive two injections, similar to patients in group I.
      Randomization will be done by a research assistant via a computerized randomization system in
      groups of 13. In order to ensure no serious pathology is missed in group I subjects, a
      separate doctor with no knowledge of treatment allocation will review the films. If there is
      serious pathology such as evidence of spinal metastases or infection, the patient will be
      excluded from the study. There will be no "control" group in this study. Both evaluating
      physicians and patients will be blinded until they exit the study.
