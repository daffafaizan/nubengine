      study which will take place across approximately 15 study centres in the U.S., Europe and
      Australia. It will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of eftilagimod alpha
      with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma or
      head and neck carcinoma. It will be a Simon's two-stage, non-comparative, open-label,
      single-arm, multicentre clinical study. Patients participating in the trial will be given the
      combination treatment for 12 months using a 30 mg s.c. eftilagimod alpha dosing every 2 or 3
      weeks.
