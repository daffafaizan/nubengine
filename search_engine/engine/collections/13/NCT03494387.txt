      enrolled in the study. The patients will be randomised to receiving antioxidants or placebo
      perioperatively and 30% or 80% inspiratory oxygen concentration during anaesthesia and 2
      hours postoperatively. The primary outcome is MINS (myocardial injury after non-cardiac
      surgery). The antioxidants are ascorbic acid (vitamin C) 3 grams intravenously preoperatively
      and N-acetylcysteine 100 milligrams/kilogram body weight intravenous infusion for 4 hours,
      starting at the same time as anaesthesia.

      We plan a long-term follow-up study of the risk of mortality, MI and readmissions performed
      at 1 year after inclusion of the last patient. We plan two other follow-up study: One in
      which we investigate ischaemic troponin elevations defined as peak troponin levels above the
      internationally defined thresholds without extracardiac causes; another in which we in detail
      analyse the intervention effects in the subgroup of patients undergoing vascular surgery with
      specific emphasis on episodes of intraoperative hypotension within the following thresholds:
      MAP below 70 mmHg, 65 mmHg, 60 mmHg and 55 mmHg.
