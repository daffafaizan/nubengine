      A. To investigate whether it is possible to teach Late Talkers to attend to objects' shapes
      as a useful property for learning and generalizing novel object labels.

      B. To assess the benefits that this intervention programme has on Late Talkers' short-term
      vocabulary development compared to an intervention where infants will be taught specific
      words ('specific word' intervention).

      C. Assess whether the success of teaching Late Talkers a shape bias for noun extension is
      related to their sensitivity to object shape similarities.

      D. Assess whether the success of teaching Late Talkers a shape bias for noun extension is
      related to their ability of sustain their attention to novel objects that are presented to
      them.

      E. To assess the benefits of the intervention programme on language and cognitive development
      one year after the intervention compared to the 'specific word' intervention
