      95% of the more than 25 million diagnosed cases of diabetes in 2010. Racial and ethnic
      minorities are disproportionately affected by the diabetes epidemic, specifically African
      Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. Although the cumulative evidence suggests that
      lifestyle interventions to prevent diabetes can be implemented across a variety of settings
      with diverse personnel, numerous barriers to widespread dissemination in minority populations
      still exist. Latinos Combatiendo la Diabetes (La Comunidad) is a 225-participant randomized
      trial designed to test the hypothesis that a community-based lifestyle weight-loss
      intervention implemented within the accountability and structure of existing Latino
      communities will have a more beneficial and clinically meaningful impact on HbA1c, insulin
      metabolism, and markers of the metabolic syndrome when compared to an enhanced usual care
      condition. An economic evaluation will also be conducted to determine costs and
      cost-effectiveness. One trial arm will consist of a group-based intensive lifestyle
      intervention promoting healthy eating, increased physical activity and modest, yet achievable
      (5-7%) weight loss delivered in an early 6-month intensive phase followed by an 18-month
      maintenance phase. Latino Health Advisors (LHAs) will be utilized in the intensive
      intervention arm. The control arm will consist of an individual educational intervention that
      incorporates existing community resources that are available to assist residents in making
      healthier lifestyle choices.
