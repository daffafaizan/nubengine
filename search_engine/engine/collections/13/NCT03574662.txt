      symptoms within the last 3 months will be identified by either their outpatient heart failure
      clinic notes or inpatient cardiology notes. Patients will be approached for participation if
      cardiac rehab is mentioned in the notes and inclusion/exclusion criteria it met. Once the
      consent is signed, the baseline visit will be scheduled, this will be done before cardiac
      rehab has started. The baseline visit include frailty assessment measured by a walk time/gait
      speed test and handgrip strength test, and quality of life assessment measured using the
      Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
      (MLHF) questionnaire. Patients will then attend cardiac rehabilitation for six week program.
      The cardiac rehab program will be designed by the individual facility due to the variation in
      exercise tolerance of each patient, no universal protocol will be used. After the six weeks
      of cardiac rehab, up to 16 weeks post-completion, the patient will return to Mayo Clinic
      Rochester to complete the frailty and quality of life assessment.
