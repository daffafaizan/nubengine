      I. To determine the effects of low dose apalutamide on circulating levels of prostate
      specific antigen (PSA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of low dose apalutamide on Ia. Reversibility of testosterone
      levels 7-14 days post intervention. Ib. Post-intervention plasma trough apalutamide
      concentration. Ic. Intra-prostatic immune cell infiltration. Id. Health-related quality of
      life. Ie. Gleason score of pre- and post-intervention tumor(s) with matched location.

      OUTLINE:

      The first 40 patients taking part in this trial receive apalutamide orally (PO) three times a
      week (TIW) for 4-8 weeks prior to before prostate surgery in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Based on PSA levels of the first 40 patients, the next
      group of 40 patients receive apalutamide either once a week (QW) or once daily (QD) for 4-8
      weeks prior to before prostate surgery in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may receive apalutamide for up to 12 weeks before prostate surgery (in the
      event surgery is delayed).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7-14 days after prostate
      surgery.
