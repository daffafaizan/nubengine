      radiopharmaceutical, Na18F, has been used for scanning the skeleton for the spread of cancer
      for more that 30 years, but has not been approved by Health Canada because less expensive
      alternate drugs have been available (99mTc diphosphonates). Given the sudden and drastic
      change in the availability of 99mTc, an acceptable alternative for 99mTc-diphosphonates is
      needed as soon as possible.
