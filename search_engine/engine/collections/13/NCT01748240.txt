      times daily for 7 days as outlined in table 1.1. AZA will be administered SC at 75 mg/m2/day
      x 7 consecutive days or at maximum tolerated dose if a dose reduction of AZA was needed
      before entering the trial with a minimum dose of 50mg/m2/d for 7 consecutive days.

      Each cycle will last 28 days with AZA starting on day 1 of each cycle and vorinostat starting
      on day 3.
