      laboratory of the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY. After informed consent, patients
      undergoing clinically indicated elective PCI with a non-obstructive lesion and optimal
      background statin therapy will be eligible screening. Non-obstructive lesions (30-50%
      stenosis) identified by angiography in a non-culprit vessel with lipid-rich plaque will be
      studied. Subjects will receive evolocumab (Repatha) 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks for
      26 weeks. Serial NIRS/IVUS and OCT imaging will be performed in the non-obstructive lesions,
      first during PCI and subsequently after 26 weeks. A total of 25ml of blood will be drawn from
      the sheath during angiography for transcriptomic profiling of PBMC.
