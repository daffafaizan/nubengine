      with myopia and myopic astigmatism. The investigators will be monitoring changes in anterior
      segment optical coherence tomography epithelial thickness maps. The investigators will
      compare preoperative maps to postoperative maps at one, three, six and twelve months. In
      addition, the investigators will measure changes in epithelial maps from postoperative month
      through twelve months to help understand what is happening to the corneal epithelium to try
      to explain why UDVA and CDVA improves over time
