      anesthesia. The investigators hypothesize that airway leak pressures with the LMA Supreme
      will be superior when compared with the LMA Unique at two different standardized intracuff
      pressures (40 and 60 cm H20). Airway leak pressures will be measured by recording the circuit
      pressure at which equilibrium is reached. The ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of
      laryngeal view, feasibility of use, and complications will also be assessed.
