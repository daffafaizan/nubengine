    
      Conventional therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) treatment include nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors,
      corticosteroids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These therapies are
      often partially effective.

      For those patients, where conventional therapies have failed to alleviate their symptoms,
      Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNFis) is often prescribed to treat the pain and inflammation
      associated with RA. The main problem with TNFi and other advanced therapies in RA is
      retention. At least ¼ of patients stop treatment within a year and another ⅕ to ¼ in the
      second year, mostly due to secondary loss of efficacy.

      Another advanced therapy, the Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK) has demonstrated similar efficacy
      to TNFi treatment in RA. This trial will determine if using a different class of treatment
      (small molecule, oral drug, JAK kinase inhibitor) will have a better retention than a TNFi
      (using the most commonly prescribed TNFi for RA in Canada).
