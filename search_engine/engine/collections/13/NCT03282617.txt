      have either (A) locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer; or (B) stage 4 locally
      advanced nasopharyngeal cancer (N2 or N3 disease and/or T4) and is known to be associated
      with a high risk of distant relapse.

      This study is carried out to find out the safety and recommended dose of CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX in
      nasopharyngeal cancer. CD137L-DC-EBV-VAX is a product made from one of our own immune system
      cells (dendritic cell, DC). Dendritic cells are immune cells that help to stimulate our
      body's T lymphocytes to fight cancer by presenting specific proteins from the cancer cells.
      The investigators have developed in the laboratory a highly effective dendritic cell which is
      primed to activate T cells with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins. It is hoped that this
      will stir an immune response to recognize NPC cells and kill them as part of body's immune
      surveillance system.
