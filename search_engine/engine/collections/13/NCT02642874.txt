      effective drug. Abrams et al compared patients with cirrhosis with those with congestive
      heart failure and found a significantly higher prevalence of weekly or daily cramps with
      cirrhosis (22%) vs patients with congestive heart failure (5%). Interestingly, there was no
      difference in diuretic use or dosing between the 2 groups, supporting that factors other than
      diuretic-mediated effects explained the differences. Methocarbamol is a central muscle
      relaxant used to treat skeletal muscle spasms. The mechanism of action of methocarbamol is
      currently unknown, but may involve the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Methocarbamol has a
      high therapeutic index, i.e. a wide range of safe and effective dosages.
