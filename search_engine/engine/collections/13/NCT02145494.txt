    
      Aim To assess if a focal boost can be delivered to the dominant tumour nodule alongside 36.25
      Gy in 5 fractions to the whole prostate gland.

      Primary end-point: Acute toxicity (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), International
      prostate symptom score (IPSS))

      Secondary end-points: Prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir and 2-year biochemical control
      Late toxicity (IPSS, RTOG, International index of erectile function (IIEF-5)) Quality of life
      (EQ5D scale)

      Inclusion criteria

        -  Prostate cancer patients with any of the following:

        -  PSA>20

        -  Gleason grade 4+3 or higher

        -  Stage T3a

        -  Exclusion criteria

        -  Nodal or metastatic disease

        -  PSA>40

        -  Stage T3b or higher

      Study interventions

      This is a phase II study which will recruit 20 patients. A dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions
      will be delivered to the whole prostate with a simultaneous integrated boost up to 47.5 Gy in
      5 fractions or to the highest dose possible within dose constraints. The boost volume will be
      defined on the multiparametric magnetic resonance scan by the specialist radiologist.
