      Important factors for a safe and successful nerve block include volume, dose and
      concentration of local anesthetic (LA). Knowing the duration of peripheral nerve blocks is
      important to prevent pain breakthrough. With the advancements in ultrasound (US)-guided nerve
      block techniques it has been possible to substantially reduce the amount of LA required to
      perform a successful nerve block. This has reduced the risk of systemic toxicity. However,
      lowering LA volume may reduce nerve block duration, but the extent of this is sparsely
      described in a heterogenic study mass.

      Diluted and large volumes of LA seem to correlate with nerve block duration. Furthermore,
      increasing LA concentration seems to increase the level of motor block, but not the block
      duration. A long-lasting nerve block without dense motor block is preferable for optimized
      pain control and better opportunities to rehabilitate/ambulate.

      Aim:

      To investigate the effect of LA concentration on common peroneal nerve block duration in
      healthy volunteers.

      Methods:

      Randomization of 60 healthy volunteers who will receive 1 of 5 different volumes of LA
      (ropivacaine) using a constant dose (10mg).

      Primary outcome: Duration of sensory nerve block defined by insensitivity towards cold.

      Secondary outcome: Duration of motor nerve block defined by either paresis or paralysis.

      Explorative outcomes: Degrees of sensory and motor nerve block; Onset times of sensory and
      motor nerve block; Length of neural exposure to LA.
