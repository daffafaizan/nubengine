      patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) on the waiting list to identify candidates that should
      present for urgent medical care and, if appropriate, will prompt clinicians to update a
      candidate's lung allocation score (LAS), the score used to prioritize lung transplant
      candidates for transplant by medical urgency, and avoid undetected decline. The clinical tool
      consists of home spirometry measures and patient reported outcomes that is completed weekly
      on a mobile application device used clinically to track spirometry.
