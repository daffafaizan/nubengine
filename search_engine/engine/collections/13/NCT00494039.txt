    
      Objective: To test the hypothesis that the shorter half-life of Pd-103 versus I-125, will
      increase the rate of tumor eradication.

      Research design A total of 600 patients with AJC clinical stage T1c-T2a prostatic carcinoma
      (Gleason grade 2 to 6, PSA 4 to 10 ng/ml) will be randomized to implantation with I-125 (160
      Gy) versus Pd-103 (115 Gy).

      Methodology: Patients will be randomized by the method of random permuted blocks.

      Cancer status will be monitored by serial serum PSA at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and yearly
      thereafter. Treatment-related morbidity will be monitored by personal interview, using
      standard American Urologic Association and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria at 1, 3,
      6, 12 and 24 months. Patients with serum PSA above 1.0 ng/ml two years after treatment will
      be considered to have residual or recurrent cancer and to have failed therapy.
