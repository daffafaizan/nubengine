      vital in selecting the appropriate surgical approach. However, the existing methods,
      including methylene blue and nuclides, possess low efficiency and effectiveness in mapping
      SLNs, and to a certain extent exert side effects during application. Indocyanine green (ICG),
      as a fluorescent dye, has been proved reliable usage in SLN detection by several other
      groups. In this paper, the investigators introduce a novel surgical navigation system to
      detect SLN with ICG. This system contains two charge-coupled devices (CCD) to simultaneously
      capture real-time color and fluorescent video images through two different bands. During
      surgery, surgeons only need to follow the fluorescence display. In addition, the system saves
      data automatically during surgery enabling surgeons to find the registration point easily
      according to image recognition algorithms. The investigators aim to show that the usage of
      our surgical navigation system with ICG to detect SLNs in breast cancer patients is
      technically feasible.
