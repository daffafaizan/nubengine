      feasibility assessments are needed. While some researchers have begun to assess the
      feasibility of implementing PGx into pharmacy practice in community-based practice settings,
      none that we are aware have assessed such feasibility for the Program of All-inclusive Care
      for the Elderly (PACE). The primary objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the
      processes that were involved in implementing a pharmacist-led PGx service for PACE and to
      describe process-related challenges and solutions associated with implementation. Secondary
      objectives include: describe pharmacists' roles in the implementation process; report
      aggregate PGx test results, including genetic variants and drug-gene interactions; and
      describe pharmacists' recommendations to personalize drug regimens for PACE participants and
      prescribers' acceptance of these recommendations.
