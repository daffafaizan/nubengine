      Inc., Erlangen, Germany) using 2D multi-echo gradient echo/spin echo sequence and 2D
      single-shot gradient echo-planar imaging sequence plus intravenous magnetic susceptibility
      contrast medium. The quantitative estimates and mapping of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
      utilization were calculated and plotted in all subjects.
