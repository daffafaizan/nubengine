      mg/m2 administered twice daily, and the blood concentration can be maintained at 10-15 ng/ml
      according to the pharmacokinetic formula.Related research reports that maintaining low blood
      concentration of sirolimus is effective in the treatment of certain vascular malformations
      and hemangioma, and complications are less. In the clinical practice, we found that the blood
      concentration was maintained at 7-10 ng/ml, and the patients still achieved good results and
      the chance of infections decreased. Therefore, this clinical trial was designed.In this
      trial, two different dosing regimens with corresponding blood concentration were designed to
      compare the safety and efficacy.In the high concentration group, the sirolimus dosage was
      adjusted monthly to achieve trough levels between 10 and 15 ng/mL(excluding 10 ng/ml), and it
      is still used at 0.8 mg/m2 administered twice daily.The low concentration group is 7-10 ng/ml
      (including 10 ng/ml), and the initial use of sirolimus is 0.7mg/m2 administered twice
      daily.The dose was adjusted according to the formula after two weeks.The follow-up and
      evaluation were performed according to a strictly established follow-up schedule after taking
      the drug.
