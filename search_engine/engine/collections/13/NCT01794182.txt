    
      The study population consists of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of acute severe anterior
      circulation ischemic stroke, a baseline diffusion weighted image (DWI) lesion between 82 and
      300 cm3, age 18-80 years, and time from symptom onset to start of study infusion of ≤10
      hours. The study will enroll both patients that do not receive IV rtPA and those that receive
      IV rtPA within 4.5 hours of stroke.

      Enrollment will be randomized controlling for site, age ≤60 (yes/no), and IV rtPA treatment
      at baseline (yes/no). Subjects will be randomized equally between RP-1127 and placebo.
