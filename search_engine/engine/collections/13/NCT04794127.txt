      study exploring the activity of the combination of T and P in myxoid liposarcoma patients who
      achieved a stable disease after a minimum of 4 cycles of T alone. If a minimum required
      activity will be demonstrated from the first stage, the second stage of the study will be
      conducted; otherwise, the study will be stopped.

      The second stage will be an Italian multicenter, open-label, randomized, double arm, phase II
      trial, aimed at evaluating the combination of T and P in myxoid liposarcoma and G1 or G2
      dedifferentiated liposarcomas compared to the standard treatment. Patients will be randomized
      by a centralized computer system with a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two arms:

        -  Control arm (A): T alone

        -  Experimental arm (B): T in combination with P The pilot study will be conducted in Italy
           at Istituto Nazionale Tumori Milano in order to recruit 10 evaluable patients. The
           second stage will be conducted in approximately 10 italian centers in order to recruit
           80 evaluable patients.
