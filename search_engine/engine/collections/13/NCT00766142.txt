      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy and cetuximab, in terms of
           progression-free survival at 3 years, in patients with completely resected peritoneal
           carcinomatosis of colorectal origin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the therapeutic strategy among patients who are or are not fit to receive
           chemotherapy.

        -  Determine progression-free survival at 5 years and overall survival at 3 and 5 years in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the overall tolerability (mortality, morbidity) of this regimen, including
           surgery, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo complete resection of the peritoneal carcinomatosis. Beginning 4-8 weeks
      after surgery, patients receive cetuximab IV over 2.5 hours. Patients also receive FOLFOX
      chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and
      fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12
      courses.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.
