    
      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy:

      The patient will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day administered
      IV over 30 min for three consecutive days and a single IV dose of cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2
      administered over 1 hr on the fourth day.

      Administration of iC9-CAR19 T cells:

      Post lymphodepletion, if the patient meets eligibility criteria for cellular therapy, then
      will receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer iC9-CAR19 post lymphodepletion at one of the
      following doses based on the percentage of circulating lymphoblasts prior to lymphodepletion:
      (1) dose of 5 x 10^5 transduced cells/kg or (2) dose of 1 x 10^5 transduced cells/kg.

      Duration of Therapy:

      Therapy under this compassionate use protocol involves 1 infusion of iC9-CAR19 cells.

      Duration of Follow-up:

      The patient will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first.
