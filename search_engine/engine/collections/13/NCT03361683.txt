      passed a spontaneous breathing trial will be included in the study. Following extubation,
      patients will be randomized assigned to one of two study groups. Heart rate, breathing rate,
      median arterial pressure, FiO2, SpO2, and dyspnea and comfort levels will be measured at
      defined intervals after extubation (basal, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24
      hours, and 48 hours). An arterial blood gas test will be performed 60 minutes and 24 hours
      after extubation. The number of patients fulfilling certain preset criteria regarding
      extubation failure will be determined.

      Extubation failure shall be defined as the need for using invasive mechanical ventilation
      again within two days following extubation based on the criteria below:

        -  Breathing rate over 25 breaths per minute for more than two hours.

        -  Heart rate above 140 beats per minute or with a sustained increase or decrease greater
           than 20%.

        -  Clinical data showing fatigue of the respiratory muscles or an increase in breathing
           work.

        -  SaO2 <90%; PaO2 <80 mmHg with a FiO2 > 50%.

        -  Hypercapnia (PaCO2 >45 mmHg or >20% compared to the value before extubation) with a pH
           below 7.33.

      Patients who do not fulfill the extubation failure criteria after the first 48 hours of
      admission may receive extra supplementary oxygen through any device (e.g., nasal cannula,
      face mask, reservoir mask, etc.). Every day, SpO2 will be measured and the moment when the
      patient reaches SpO2 >94% with no need for oxygen will be determined.
