      central NeP in SCI. Research is now proving that it is possible to prevent the development of
      pain in certain conditions. Pregabalin has been proven effective in this area with post
      surgical pain. Therefore, after traumatic SCI there may be a small window of time where we
      could prevent the development of NeP by administering an agent like Pregabalin.

      Objective: To test the hypothesis that pregabalin is an effective treatment in preventing
      post-spinal cord injury neuropathic pain.

      Design: double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, trial Setting: Spinal cord injury
      program, neurosurgery and tertiary care rehabilitation center Subjects: 30 patients with
      acute traumatic spinal cord injury Method: Pregabalin will be offered to patients with acute
      traumatic spinal cord injury pain in a double blind crossover, placebo control design.

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures will be the development of Neuropathic
      Pain and intensity of pain Secondary outcome measures will be Ashworth's Scale for spasticity
      and ASIA motor and Sensory Scores.

      Results: To be determined. Conclusion: To be determined.
