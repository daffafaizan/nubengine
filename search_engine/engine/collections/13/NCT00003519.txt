      survival and overall survival when compared to doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (DC) in women
      with lymph node positive (1-3 positive nodes) or high risk lymph node negative breast cancer.
      II. Compare the toxicity of DD to DC in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by node status (positive vs
      negative), menopause status (pre- vs post), estrogen receptor (ER) status/progesterone
      receptor (PR) status (ER/PR unknown vs ER+/PR+ vs ER+/PR- vs ER-/PR+ vs ER-/PR-). Patients in
      arm I receive doxorubicin IV plus docetaxel IV over 1 hour every 3 weeks for 4 treatment
      courses. Patients in arm II receive doxorubicin IV plus cyclophosphamide IV every 3 weeks for
      4 treatment courses. All patients who are estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor positive
      receive oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years following chemotherapy. Some patients may also
      receive radiotherapy following chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 3 months if patient
      is less than 2 years from study entry; every 6 months if patient is 2-5 years from study
      entry; and every 12 months if patient is greater than 5 years from study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2778 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5
      years.
