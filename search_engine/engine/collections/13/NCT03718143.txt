    
      A phase II study testing the clinical efficacy of combined AZD1775 with AraC or single agent
      activity of AZD1775 in three patient strata: Elderly(> 60 years) newly diagnosed AML patients
      (Arm A) will only receive the combination; whereas relapsed/refractory AML patients and HMA
      failure MDS patients will be allocated to either the combination (Arm B) or single agent
      AZD1775 (Arm C). The study will have a run in safety cohort of six patients in each of the
      three arms to determine the safe use of combined AraC /AZD1775 or single agent AZD1775 in the
      patient populations. This will be followed by an expansion phase of up to 20 and 21 eligible
      patients in each arm respectively where elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML will
      receive a combination of AZD1775 and AraC (Arm A) while patients with relapsed or refractory
      AML or HMA failure MDS will be allocated to receive either AZD1775 with AraC (Arm B) or
      AZD1775 alone (Arm C). An early toxicity check will be conducted to determine safety and
      tolerability. If indicated, dose levels will be reduced. The study will continue to enroll
      the rest of the patients at the tolerated dose.
