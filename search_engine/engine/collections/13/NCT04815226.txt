      manages urinary tract infection among patients diagnosed with neurogenic bladder. It is a
      prospective exploratory pilot study, and the participants will be asked to perform transanal
      irrigation twice weekly for 12 weeks (three months). At each visit, including baseline, the
      study endpoints will be assessed by basic urinalysis, KUB imaging, Seoul Fecal Scoring, and a
      survey (Korean Neurogenic Bowel Score).
