    
      This is a Phase II, single-blinded, prospectively randomized, parallel-group, placebo
      controlled study that will evaluate the safety and feasibility of HBOC-201 when administered
      therapeutically to patients with a peripheral vascular occlusive disorder and who are
      undergoing lower limb amputation due to critical lower limb ischemia. Subjects will be
      randomized (1:1) to receive either HBOC-201 or a colloid control (HAES-sterilÂ® 6%).
