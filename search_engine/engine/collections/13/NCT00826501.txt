      (CPN) with analgesic therapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer will decrease
      the severity of abdominal pain when compared to analgesic therapy alone. The specific primary
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of EUS-CPN + analgesic therapy (Group 1) in
      pain relief of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer when compared with analgesic
      therapy (Group 2). The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the changes in reported pain
      severity between those who receive EUS-CPN in addition to analgesic therapy as compared to
      analgesic therapy alone.
