      AN who are admitted to the Section for Eating Disorders at the Department for Psychosomatic
      Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway.

      Secondary objectives are to (1) prospectively identify baseline predictors of treatment
      outcome and dropout, (2) determine variables related to the treatment process and patient
      engagement as predictors of the outcome and/or treatment dropout, and (3) in a
      multidisciplinary approach, focus on selected pathophysiological mechanisms including changes
      in the gut microbiota as well as immunological measures in patients with severe AN in
      different stages of the disease, and determine to what extent they are related to treatment
      outcome.
