      school-night sleep duration by shifting the circadian system earlier and providing a time
      management plan for after-school activities in youngsters between 14 and 17 years and
      enrolled in high school. This study tests morning bright light and a school-night time
      management plan to facilitate earlier bedtimes to increase sleep duration. Circadian phase,
      sleep, neurobehavioral functioning and mood are measured before and immediately after the
      2-week intervention and compared to a control group. Long-term effectiveness, adherence, and
      acceptability are also examined in a 3-week extension study. These data will provide
      evidence-based treatment strategies for delayed and sleep-restricted adolescents, and
      acceptability of and adherence to the treatment in this age group.
