      stimulation (DBS) targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) . Traditionally, in this procedure,
      stimulation is set to a constant frequency electrical stimulation with the physician
      programming the parameters of stimulation frequency, pulse width and amplitude, and
      stimulated patients' brain nuclei with single frequency, single pulse width and single
      amplitude of the electric stimulation. Indeed, high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the STN
      provides consistent, long-term improvement of the cardinal signs of PD . However, the
      treatment effects of HFS on the axial symptoms of PD, specifically FOG can be poor often
      causing further impairment. While this can be alleviated by using relatively low frequency
      stimulation (LFS) , major concerns in the clinical application of LFS exist in regards to its
      duration of therapeutic benefit. Previous studies have shown that LFS of the STN improves the
      axial motor signs in some PD patients, but a loss of therapeutic efficacy is seen in the
      short term. Thereafter, patients may present increased tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia,
      which is often intolerable outweighing the initial benefits of LFS therapy for FOG. As such,
      a suitable treatment strategy for FOG remains to be established.

      Based on previous findings on the relationships between stimulation frequency and movement
      rhythm regulation in the human body, The National Engineering Laboratory for Neuromodulation,
      Tsinghua University, proposes a method of variable frequency stimulation (VFS) for aiding
      movement.
