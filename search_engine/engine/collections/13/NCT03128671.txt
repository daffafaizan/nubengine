      to prevent delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU), which affects as many as 80% of
      critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults.. The Family Automated Voice Reorientation
      (FAVoR) intervention uses scripted audio messages, recorded by the patient's family and
      played at hourly intervals during daytime hours, to provide information about the ICU
      environment to the patient; this ongoing orientation to the ICU environment through recorded
      messages in a voice familiar to the patient may enable the patient to more accurately
      interpret the environment and thus reduce risk of delirium. Increasing awareness of daytime
      by cuing patients during waking hours may also improve day/night orientation and nighttime
      sleep, further reducing risk of delirium. The primary specific aim of the project is to test
      the effect of the FAVoR intervention on delirium in critically ill, mechanically ventilated
      adults during hospitalization in the ICU. Secondary aims are to: (1) explore if the effect of
      FAVoR on delirium is mediated by sleep, (2) explore if selected biobehavioral factors may
      potentially moderate the effects of FAVoR on delirium, and (3) examine the effects of FAVoR
      on short term (immediately after ICU discharge) and long term (1 and 6 months after hospital
      discharge) outcomes, including cognitive function and patient-reported health status.
