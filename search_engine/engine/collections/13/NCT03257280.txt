      our center, the postoperative management consisted in 1 week period of non oral intake and
      total parenteral nutrition. At the 7 day, an oral contrast image is performed to prove the
      correct function of the anastomosis, in witch case, a progressive oral diet is begin.

      In the late 90s, the Fast-track concept (or multimodal perioperative patient care) was
      introduced in the surgical patients attempting to improve their postoperative course. This
      new concept includes the preoperative advices related to the surgery, the intensive
      mobilization after surgery, the early oral diet, and to avoid the routinary use of the
      nasogastric tube. Some groups have been trying to apply this Fast-track program sporadically
      in patients submitted to an elective total gastrectomy for gastric cancer, even do, there is
      still no good evidence to sport these practice.

      Based on the reasons exposed before, the investigators design a prospective randomized
      controlled trial in gastric cancer patients underwent on a total gastrectomy comparing two
      groups. 24 hours after gastrectomy the investigators will administer oral methylene blue and
      if no evidence of drainage leakage the participants will be randomized into two groups: one
      of them with our classical postoperative management, and the other one implements an early
      oral nutrition protocol, having in considerations its effectiveness, security, and impact on
      the hospital stay.
