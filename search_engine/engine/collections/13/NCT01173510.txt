      cells. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to either RAL plus co-formulated FTC/TDF or
      EFV/FTC/TDF (Atripla). The study will last a minimum of 24 weeks. Participants will come in
      three days before the weeks 4 and 24 visits to receive a subcutaneous injection of G-CSF, an
      FDA-approved medication that mobilizes certain cells. A minimum of 5 visits will be required
      after baseline for blood draws, safety monitoring, or G-CSF injections.
