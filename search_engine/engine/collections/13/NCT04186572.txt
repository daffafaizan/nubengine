      decompensation of cirrhosis, associated with failure of at least one other organ or extra
      hepatic system. It is characterized by high mortality in the short term and its prevalence
      varies between countries and regions.

      It is an extraordinarily dynamic entity in which more than 50% of patients with less severe
      forms improve, while in those with 3 or more organ failures, the transplant rate is low and
      mortality is 90%. It is important to highlight that those patients with ACLF who manage to be
      transplanted have the same survival as cirrhotic patients without ACLF. There is no specific
      treatment, only life support and early determination of the precipitating factor and its
      eventual resolution.

      Having tools that define the short-term prognosis of these patients, especially the variation
      of the score (CLIF-C ACLF) during the first week, would have an important clinical relevance,
      because it can help define the patients who benefit from the supportive treatment and in whom
      the therapeutic effort is futile.

      The biomarker Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is increased in plasma and
      urine in patients with ACLF and could help improve the prognostic ability of the CLIF-C ACLF
      score.
