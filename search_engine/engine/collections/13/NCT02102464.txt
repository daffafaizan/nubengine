      LipiFlow® treatment of contact lens wearers with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative
      dry eye. All subjects undergo examination to determine study eligibility and to capture the
      Baseline status. Subjects are randomized to receive LipiFlow® treatment (Treatment Group) or
      no LipiFlow® treatment (Untreated Control Group). The Treatment group is evaluated one month
      after receiving LipiFlow® treatment. Study endpoints are evaluated at 3 Months by comparing
      the Treatment Group to the Untreated Group. To facilitate subject recruitment, the Untreated
      Control group receives Crossover LipiFlow® treatment (Crossover Treatment Group) at 3 Months.
      The Crossover Treatment group is evaluated one month after receiving LipiFlow® treatment (4
      Months visit).
