      I. To assess the difference between early and late onset swallowing exercises on swallowing
      quality of life in patients undergoing chemo/radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the difference between early and late onset swallowing exercises on swallowing
      function in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the difference between early and late onset swallowing exercises on: individual
      domains of swallowing quality of life; Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) as assessed via
      FEES; diet level (Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) as assessed via FEES; feeding
      tube duration (days); Eating Assessment Tool (EAT); lingual strength as assessed via lingual
      manometry; and percent weight loss and percent weight recovery.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I (Early exercise group): Patients perform swallowing exercises comprising lingual press,
      head lift, breath hold, Masako swallow, high pitch e, effortful swallow, and neck stretch and
      massage for 2 weeks prior to beginning radiotherapy and again immediately after completion of
      radiotherapy.

      Arm II (Late exercise group): Patients begin performing swallowing exercises as in arm I 1
      month after completion of radiotherapy.

      In both arms, swallowing exercises are performed twice daily, 6 days a week, for 12 months
      following completion of radiotherapy.
