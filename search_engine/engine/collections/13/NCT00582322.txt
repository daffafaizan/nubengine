      from female breast cancer in 1991. One of the most important risk factors is a family history
      of breast cancer. A susceptibility allele which accounts for a large proportion of familial
      breast cancer has been localized to chromosome 17q and attempts to clone the susceptibility
      are proceeding rapidly. The existence of recognized susceptibility loci and the awareness of
      a significan proportion of genetic predisposition and the associated penetrances remain
      unknown and are impossible to estimate without bias from previous studies. This study is
      designed to estimate heterogeniety and prenetrance in a series of unslected families,
      identify additional breast cancer susceptibility locs, as well as provide resources for gene
      isolation and mutation analysis studies.
