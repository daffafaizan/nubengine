      responses to see if Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) (as described below), can be used as a
      predictive method of response to treatment in amyloidosis.

      Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a concept that has gained significant value as a prognostic
      predictor and has become an emerging constituent of complete response (CR) reassessment in
      multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Studies in MM have demonstrated that up to 30% of patients
      achieving a CR after high-dose therapy will still have detectable MRD in the bone marrow as
      measured by standard-sensitivity flow cytometry or by molecular assays. Virtually every study
      examining MRD in MM has reported that among patients achieving a CR, those who were MRD
      negative (MRD-) had a significantly superior progression-free survival, with some studies
      reporting superior overall survival.

      As amyloidosis is a disease that is very similar to multiple myeloma, the investigators wish
      to evaluate the concept in this disease.
