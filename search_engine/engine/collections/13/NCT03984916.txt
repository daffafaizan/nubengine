      intervention study.

      In a first phase, it will be done a pre-selection process with 30 male and female volunteers
      over 18 years of age. It will be determined hesperidin excreted levels in urine after the
      consumption of 500 mL of a homogeneous orange juice among all the participants. Sixteen
      participants will be selected preferably with an intermediate capacity of hesperidin
      absorption. The aim of this first phase is to obtain a lower variability in the results in
      the second phase of the study. Of the sixteen participants, six participants will start the
      study with the consumption of a hesperidin extract, five with the consumption of the second
      hesperidin extract and five with the consumption of the third hesperidin extract for, after
      one week washing period, exchange the hesperidin extracts between the three study groups, and
      finally repeat the exchange of hesperidin extracts after another week of washing period so
      that, in the total of the study, each participant had consumed the three hesperidin extracts.

      Participants will consume two capsules with 250 mg of extract each, being the total orange
      extract consumed 500 mg, with 450 mg of hesperidin (90%) and the rest (10%) substances coming
      from the orange in the process of extracting hesperidin.

      During the study there will be 5 visits, one selection (V0), one pre-inclusion (V-1) and 3
      study visits (V1, V2 and V3).
