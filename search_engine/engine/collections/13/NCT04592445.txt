      blinded feasibility clinical study. Both the subject and the noninvasive cardiologist that is
      caring for the subject will be blinded to the assigned cohort (treatment or sham). The
      interventional cardiologist who performs the index procedure will not be blinded.

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and are enrolled will be randomized 1:1 to either
      ablation of the right GSN using the Axon System (treatment cohort) or sham (control cohort)
      at the time of the procedure.

      This study will enroll up to 100 subjects at an anticipated 20 US sites. Subject follow up is
      at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months
