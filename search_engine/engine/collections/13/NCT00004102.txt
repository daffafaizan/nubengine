      with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the
      colon or rectum.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 10-20 minutes followed within 10 minutes
      by fluorouracil IV bolus on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours prior to leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil on days 1, 15, 29, and 43.
      Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional
      courses upon approval by the sponsor. Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
