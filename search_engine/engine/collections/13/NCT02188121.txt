      the course of follow-up, we expect that some will stay consistently on treatment, some will
      discontinue treatment (become non-adherent), while others will make transitions on and off
      treatment in various patterns. In contrast, by design, subjects in the Usual Treatment
      (control) arm do not start on treatment; however, some will initiate treatment as a result of
      usual clinical care, e.g., primary care physician initiation. At any point we will be
      comparing two binary outcomes (on or off treatment) and will use standard methods for
      comparing two proportions to test statistical significance and get confidence intervals for
      the difference in the percent on treatment in the two arms. Participants who are ineligible
      for randomization will be followed similarly to participants in the Usual Treatment Arm, in a
      third, non-randomized group, which will be excluded from the primary analysis.
