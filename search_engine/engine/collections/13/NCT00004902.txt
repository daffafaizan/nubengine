      (8-chloro-cAMP) in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma. II. Evaluate the
      efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-chloro-cAMP) over 120
      hours every 2 weeks for up to 4 courses. Beginning with course 5, patients with stable or
      responsive disease receive 8-chloro-cAMP over 120 hours every 3 weeks until disease
      progression. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 29 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
