      for acetylator phenotype before receive either 182 or 83 mg of hydralazine, and magnesium
      valproate at 30mg/Kg from day -7 to the end of chemoradiation (external and brachytherapy.
      External beam radiation will be delivered by megavoltage equipment for a dose of 50gy (2Gy
      fraction from monday to friday) concurrently with cisplatin at 40mg/m2 for six weeks. Within
      one to two weeks, intracavitary brachytherapy (low-dose rate, Cesium sources) will be
      delivered to achieve at least 85Gy to point A. A punch biopsy from the primary tumor will be
      taken at entering the study and at day 8 of hydralazine and valproate treatment (before the
      first dose of cisplatin and radiation)to assess global gene expression profiling by
      microarray analysis. Blood samples will be taken to assess global DNA methylation, histone
      deacetylase activity and plasma levels of hydralazine and valproic acid.

      Clinical response and toxicity will be assessed.
