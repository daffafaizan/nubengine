      the WPS diet with a different zinc stable isotope (67Zn) than the control diet (70Zn). All
      meals during the 2-day period were labeled with tracer. The dual isotope ratio technique was
      used with a 3rd Zn stable isotope (68Zn) given intravenously and urine enrichment of all
      isotopes measured on Study Days 6-9 to measure fractional absorption of Zn (FAZ). The amount
      of Zn absorbed for the day was determined by multiplying the Zn intake for the day
      (determined from lab analyses of duplicate test meals) by the FAZ. Children (n=16) were
      randomized as to the order in which they consume the test and control meals on Study Day 1
      and 2.

      Study 2: Iron absorption studies The iron study was a cross sectional study with one group
      receiving control meals and the second group receiving the same control meal plus WPS. Iron
      absorption was measured using the erythrocyte iron incorporation technique with labeling of
      all meals over 2 days (58Fe). This was preceded by a reference dose of Fe57 and ascorbate on
      the previous day. Children (n=32) were randomized to receive the control diet or intervention
      diet (control diet + WPS).
