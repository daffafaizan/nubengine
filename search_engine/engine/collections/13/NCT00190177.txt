    
      It is a case-control multicenter study 185 caucasian pregnant women with preeclampsia and 185
      paired controls without preeclampsia will be included.

      The frequency of the V249I polymorphism in african black population will be determined by
      studying 200 subjects (100 cases and 100 controls).

      The V249I polymorphism will be identified by PCR followed by enzyme digestion. Endothelial
      injury will be identified using three assays : von Willebrand factor, soluble VCAM-1 and
      thrombomodulin plasma levels.

      CX3CR1 involvement in preeclampsia would have potential diagnostic and therapeutic
      consequences.
