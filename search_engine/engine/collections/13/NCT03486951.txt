      multiplied by 6 since 2010, indicating a new trend of theses procedures. Outpatient stays
      presents several advantages for the patient and for the health system: decrease of the
      psychological stress, higher satisfaction, minimization of the personal and domestic activity
      interruption, less exposure to nosocomial infections, decrease of global costs, increase of
      the population rate which can be treated. However, very few data report the experience of
      outpatient orthognathic surgery in France and the factors associated with its success or
      failure.

      The choice of ambulatory versus complete hospitalization is decided during preoperative
      consultation by the surgeon in agreement with the patient. The classic surgical and
      anesthetic protocol of orthognathic surgery is applied whatever the type of hospitalization.
      The data are collected from the patient medical record (electronic patient record,
      orthognathic follow-up form, anesthetic sheet) and from a patient quality of life
      questionnaire. There is no modification of the usual follow-up, patients are seen at D-8
      which is the end-study visit.
