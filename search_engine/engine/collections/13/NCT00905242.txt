      variety of different immunosuppressive regimens. Cellcept and prednisone are often the
      biggest concern for GI distress and GI ulcers. Routine use of GI prophylaxis medications
      post-transplant are potentially one mental obstacle to transplant clinicians being fully
      persuaded of the GI neutral effect of myfortic in the immunosuppressive regimen. Patients
      receiving myfortic (as part of the conversion in the US02 study) are theoretically at a
      reduced risk for GI upset and development of GI ulcers. These patients are ideal candidates
      to discontinue their GI prophylaxis medications while taking myfortic.
