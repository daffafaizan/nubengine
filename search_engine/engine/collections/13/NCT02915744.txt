    
      This is an open-label, randomized, active comparator, multicenter, international Phase 3
      study of NKTR-102 versus TPC in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have stable brain
      metastases and have been previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine
      in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting (prior anthracycline may be omitted if medically
      appropriate or contraindicated for the patient).

      In Group A, NKTR-102 will be administered at a dose level of 145 mg/m2 on a q21d schedule as
      a 90-minute intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. In Group B, TPC will
      be administered per standard of care. Patients randomized to TPC will receive single-agent IV
      chemotherapy, limited to choice of one of the following 7 agents: eribulin, ixabepilone,
      vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or nab-paclitaxel.

      This study will randomize approximately 220 patients using a 1:1 randomization ratio and
      stratification based on geographic region, tumor receptor status, and Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) status. At Screening, the Investigator must determine which TPC will be
      offered to the patient.

      Data will be collected on subsequent anticancer therapies in both treatment groups from the
      time patients come off the study treatment until the time of primary data analysis for OS.

      An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will assess interim safety and efficacy data
      and determine final number of death events needed to provide 80% conditional power based on
      the zone adaptive design.
