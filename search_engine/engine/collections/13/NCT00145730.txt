    
      Methodology:

      The study is a multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. 1000 patients
      undergoing elective total hip replacement surgery from 20 orthopaedic centres in Australia
      and New Zealand will be assigned to receive either ibuprofen (1200mg daily) or matching
      placebo in 3 divided doses for 14 days. Study treatment will be started postoperatively on
      the day of surgery. Patient should not receive any other NSAIDs, apart from low dose aspirin,
      during the 14-day treatment period, unless such treatment becomes definitely indicated, in
      which case the study treatment should be withdrawn and open label treatment provided. There
      will be no other changes to standard care.

      Participants:

      All patient scheduled for elective total hip replacement surgery, or revision thereof, are
      potentially eligible unless there is a definite indication for or contraindication to
      treatment with a NSAID during the 14-day treatment period.

      Randomisation:

      Randomisation will be performed centrally using a computer-based system that can be accessed
      24 hours a day by a toll-free telephone call. A minimisation program will stratify treatment
      allocation by centre.

      Outcomes:

      The primary outcome are self-reported pain and physical function, 6 to 12 months after
      randomisation. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, patients' global
      assessment, radiographic evidence of ectopic bone.
