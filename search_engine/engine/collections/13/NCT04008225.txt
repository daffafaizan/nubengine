      and morbidity. This syndrome is characterized by an alveolitis with polynuclear neutrophil
      (PNN). PNNs play an important role in the persistence and in injuries induced by ARDS.
      Several animal studies have shown that lesional edema can be increased by two important
      mechanisms: the increase in the lifespan of PNNs in the lung and the decrease in the
      phagocytosis capacities of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) by macrophages and PNNs.

      However, confirmation of these data in humans does not exist, and knowledge of the mechanisms
      that may increase lung damage during ARDS will limit it and thus reduce the mechanical
      ventilation time of these patients as well as the mortality associated with ARDS.

      " high-mobility group box 1 " (HMGB1) protein may be involved in reducing efferocytosis
      capacity. Similarly, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) could restore the
      clearance capacity of apoptotic cells in macrophages and PNNs.
