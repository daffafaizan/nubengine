      surgery in this randomised controlled study. The participants will divide into the 4 groups
      with computered random generation. The Different combination of propofol+ketamin mixture will
      apply at the induction of anesthesia. The groups will assign as group I,II, III and IV.
      Propofol 1 mg/kg + ketamin1 mg/kg (1/1 ratio) for group I; propofol 1,5 mg/kg + ketamin 0,75
      mg/kg (2/1 ratio) for group II; propofol 2 mg/kg +ketamin 0,66 mg/kg (3/1 ratio) for group
      III; propofol 3 mg/kg will perform for anesthesia induction. Fentanyl 1 microgram per kg and
      rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg will apply for anesthesia induction to the all participants. General
      anesthesia will maintenance with sevoflurane 1-2% and O2/N2O mixture. Postoperative analgesia
      will provide with tramadol 2mg/kg IV at last 30 min of surgery. Extubation time, length of
      stay in PACU, PAED score, FLACC score, VAS score will record. Than all data will
      statistically analyse.
