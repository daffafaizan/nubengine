    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of AUY922 (Hsp90 inhibitor
      AUY922) when given with pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) 500 mg/m^2 in participants with
      previously-treated stage IV non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective tumor response rate as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in participants with previously treated non-squamous NSCLC
      treated with pemetrexed and AUY922.

      II. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of pemetrexed and AUY922. III. Evaluate toxicity,
      including visual toxicity, in participants treated with AUY922 and pemetrexed.

      IV. Analyze tumor-tissue biomarkers for potential correlation with response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922.

      Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes weekly and
      pemetrexed disodium IV over 15 minutes every 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 21 days for 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
