      patients with randomized, double-blinded and controlled method. Patients are divided into
      experimental and placebo groups to receive remote ischemic post-conditioning for 30 days.
      Remote ischemic post-conditioning is performed by the inflating tourniquets to certain
      extents on bilateral arms with 5 cycles of 5min inflation and 5min relax alternation for the
      total of 30 consecutive days. It is 200mmHg for RIPC group and 60mmHg for control group.
      Evaluation parameters include CRP, TNF-Î±, ICAM-1 and GFAP in blood at 0, 3, 7, 15 and 30 days
      after treatment; and MRI at 0 and 30 days after treatment.
