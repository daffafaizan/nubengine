    
      Cell Procurement Up to 300 mL total of peripheral blood (up to 3 collections) will be
      obtained from patients for cell procurement. In patients with a low CD3 count in the
      peripheral blood (less than 200/Î¼l by flow cytometry), a leukopheresis may be performed to
      isolate sufficient T-cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.

      CAR138 T-cell Administration Autologous CAR138 T-cells will be administered 2-14 days
      following lymphodepletion. The lymphodepletion regimen will consist of Cyclophosphamide 300
      mg/m^2 and Fludarabine 30 mg/m^2 IV each given daily over 3 consecutive days.

      Duration of Therapy Autologous CAR138 T-cells will be administered 2-14 days following
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine by a licensed provider (oncology
      registered nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 5-10 minutes through either a
      peripheral or central line. The expected volume is 1-50cc.

      Treatment with one infusion will be administered unless:

        -  The patient decides to withdraw from the study, OR

        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

      Duration of Follow-up Patients will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent
      retrovirus evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for
      unacceptable adverse events will continue follow up for evaluation of progression free
      survival, overall survival and replication-competent retrovirus monitoring.

      Patients who experience disease progression after receiving a cell infusion will still be
      required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures.
