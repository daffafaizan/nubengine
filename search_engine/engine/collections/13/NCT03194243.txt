      medical records, acquired as part of usual care, in patients admitted for acute dyspnea in
      the emergency department. Clinical, treatment, laboratory and imaging data acquired during
      the hospitalization (in the emergency department and in the department that admitted the
      patients following the emergency department stay) will be collected.

      Vital status will be recorded at 30 days and 1 year post-admission.
