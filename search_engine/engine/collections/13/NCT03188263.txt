      people with prediabetes. Individuals will be asked to complete a baseline session with
      one-week of at-home sleep monitoring followed by a 24-hour stay in the clinical research
      unit. During this stay, we will sample saliva in the evening to measure melatonin to estimate
      the timing of the internal biological clock ("circadian phase") and then we will perform a
      3-hour oral glucose tolerance test in the morning to estimate markers of glucose metabolism,
      including insulin sensitivity. The participants will then be given a light device and
      instructed on its use. They will use the device for four weeks and visit our laboratory every
      week for a check-in. At the end of the four weeks, they will repeat the 24-hour stay in the
      clinical research unit.
