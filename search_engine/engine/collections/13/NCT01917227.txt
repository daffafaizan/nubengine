      lifestyle in order to achieve effective blood glucose control. Upon the general control of
      diabetic patients in Taiwan, however, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is not satisfactory.
      One of the important reasons is the low rate of insulin injection. For the use of insulin,
      the patient has many misconception. The patients in the clinic need to spend a lot of time to
      explain and description, but the results are not necessarily good. So we hope that in this
      part of the health education activities through organized groups Videos to assist doctors and
      patients as a bridge of communication, to enhance diabetes doctor thus contributing to
      glycemic control results.
