      two subgroups (A and B) of 25 patients each. In subgroup A, wounds were irrigated with dilute
      (3%) povidone-iodine solution through a low-pressure pulsatile device. In subgroup B wounds
      were irrigated with normal saline solution thorough a bulb syringe. In both subgroup
      specimens for bacterial culture were harvested by swabs from surgical site before and after
      irrigation of the wounds.
