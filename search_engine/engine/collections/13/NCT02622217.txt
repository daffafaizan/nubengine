      case of acute peritonitis complicated by an anaphylactic shock secondary to the injection of
      succinylcholine. All scenarios were performed with the assistance of an anaesthetist nurse,
      facilitator of the scenario. In a second time, after patient stabilisation (defined as oxygen
      saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) > 95%, mean arterial pressure (PAM) > 65 mmHg and heart
      rate (HR) < 100 bpm for at least 2 minutes) consecutive to an expected injection of 100 Âµg of
      epinephrine decided by the participant, a surgeon entered the operating room to create a
      dilemma regarding patient destination (continue surgery or intensive care unit admission)
