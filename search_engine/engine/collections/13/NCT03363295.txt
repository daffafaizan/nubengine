      Evaluation and Comparison of Macular and Choroidal Thickness after Intracameral Moxifloxacin
      for Prevention of Postcataract Endophthalmitis

      Purpose:

      The objective of this study is to evaluate if the using of intracameral moxifloxacin cause
      changes in macular and choroidal thickness.

      Methods:

      A randomized clinical trial will be conducted in the Hospital of Clinics at State University
      of Campinas (UNICAMP). The patients that will be submitted to phacoemulsification surgery
      will be divided into two groups. The first group will receive 0,03ml intracameral
      moxifloxacin after phacoemulsification surgery, while the second group won't receive any
      antibiotics intracamerally. Both groups will apply eyedrops as usual in the postoperative.

      The investigators will evaluate those patients blindly. Each patient will be examined using
      Spectral Domain - Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and Enhanced Depth Imaging - Optical
      Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT), in the pre-operative, at the 30th postoperative and at the
      60th postoperative. The data will be collected regarding macular central thickness and
      choroidal thickness.

      The exclusion criteria will be:

        -  Patients who had any macular changes prior to the surgery (including epiretinal
           membrane, macular edema, drusen or any other)

        -  diabetic patients

        -  patients who had any complications during the cataract surgery

        -  patients who refuse to participate in the trial, or refuse to sign the consent form

      After collecting data, the two groups will be compared regarding changes in macular thickness
      and choroidal thickness from the pre-operative, the 30th and the 60th postoperative.

      The investigators expect that there will be no statistical difference between groups
