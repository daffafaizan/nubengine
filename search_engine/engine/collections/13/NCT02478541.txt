      therapy that affects lipid, glucose or liver metabolism.

      Purpose and design:

      The investigators are asking the research question: "How does the amount and type of sugars
      consumed, such as those found in soft drinks, influence postprandial fatty acid and liver fat
      metabolism?"

      It is known that consuming fructose by itself or with glucose can increase plasma
      triglyceride concentrations and liver fat amounts but it remains unclear how this happens.

      To address this research question investigators want to undertake detail physiological
      studies, in a randomised cross-over study where individuals will be studied twice after the
      consumption of a single test meal that will contain different amounts of glucose and fructose
      with the same amount of dietary fat.
