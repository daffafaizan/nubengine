      after 20 session of WBV exercises was evaluated this study. In the WBV group, 20 sessions of
      unilateral lower extremity vibration exercises were performed with the Whole Body Vibration
      (WBV) device. WBV was applied when the subjects are in the semi-squat position. WBV was
      implemented with Powerplate® Pro5 (PowerPlate® International Ltd, London, United Kingdom).
      During 20 sessions, the WBV amplitude and vibration time were increased gradually. In the
      first session, the subjects were do a 30-second, 30-35, 40- and 45-Hz low-amplitude WBV while
      the knee and hip joint were in 30 degrees of flexion (in the semi-squat position); 10-second
      rest period between vibration applications were applied. A total duration of WBV was be two
      minutes. In the 20th session, the subjects were given a 60-second, 30-, 35-, 40- and 45-Hz
      high-amplitude WBV while the knee and hip joint were in 45 degrees of flexion; 10-second rest
      period between vibration applications were applied. A total duration of WBV was eight
      minutes. During WBV, the left lower extremity was in the knee-hip flexion position but was
      not exposed the vibration.

      The same experimental protocol was applied to the isometric exercise (control) group. Unlike
      the experimental group, sham vibration was applied to the control group. Before and after 20
      session-exercise, both knee extensor isokinetic muscle strength was measured.
