      increased risk for falls. Though recent studies suggest that treatment of OAB may improve
      physical activity, there is a lack of easily administered instruments for measuring physical
      activity in older adults. Furthermore, physical activity outcomes in older adults with OAB
      are affected by treatment preference and potential neurocognitive dysfunction caused by
      anti-cholinergic medication. The aims of the present proposal are 1) to validate an
      instrument to measure physical activity 2) to validate an instrument to measure preference
      for medication and 3) to determine the effect of preference for anti-cholinergic medication
      on adherence, physical activity, and falls risk. Plan: a prospective cohort study of adults
      aged 65 or older with OAB undergoing treatment with anti-cholinergic medication. The primary
      outcome will be physical activity measured using a self-reported instrument and accelerometer
      at baseline and 8 weeks after treatment. Secondary outcomes will be fall risk defined by
      changes in neurocognitive testing, urinary symptoms, and medication adherence at 8 weeks
      after treatment. The findings of this study could provide a paradigm shift in the management
      of older adults with OAB and at increased risk for falls.
