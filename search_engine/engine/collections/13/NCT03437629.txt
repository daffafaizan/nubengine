      definitive total crowns. The temporary cementation should provide sufficient retention
      between the intervals of the consultations, be biocompatible and not present high solubility.
      The aim of this study is through a randomized clinical trial, double blind, splithmouth,
      evaluate the success rate (retention rate and dental sensibility) of temporary dental crown
      cemented on vital teeth. The composition of the cement (Based on calcium hydroxide; and based
      on mineral trioxide aggregate) will be evaluated. Twenty participants with at least two vital
      teeth with the need to confection of definitive total crowns (each participant) will be
      selected who present. The teeth will be randomly divided into 2 different groups according to
      the temporary cement composition (Based on calcium hydroxide; and based on mineral trioxide
      aggregate). Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis
