    
      Randomized prospective non-inferiority study, in which we evaluate patients with stress
      urinary incontinence (SUI) who undergo surgical treatment consisting of a minimal incision in
      the suburethral area of the vaginal mucosa for a mesh insertion in order to:

      Main Objective:

      To compare the continence rate (objective) between Solyx and Obtryx II meshes in patients
      with SUI. This rate will be determined by an effort test.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the continence rate (subjective) between both meshes.

        -  To compare variations in Pad-Test.

        -  To asses patient satisfaction.

        -  To evaluate both techniques regarding quality and sexual life modifications.

        -  To compare both techniques regarding early complications (up to 30 days post
           implantation).

        -  To compare the appearance and persistence of late complications (from 30 days onwards).
