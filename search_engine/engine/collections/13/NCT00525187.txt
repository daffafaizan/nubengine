      type 2, suffering from (DN). At baseline we assessed age, gender, medical history and
      medications, foot insensitivity defined by a vibration perception threshold (VPT) >25 volts
      and onychomycosis by clinical diagnosis.

      Multiple samples of the most affected nail, often the big toe, were taken. A potassium
      hydroxide (KOH) test was done by 2 independent and blinded investigators and a culture in a
      laboratory (lab) specialized in mycology.

      Pictures of the nails and particularly of the sampled nail were taken. Apart from the
      laboratory results, two independent and blinded dermatologists gave their diagnosis looking
      at the pictures.
