      MANOVA of repeated measures approach. For achieving a medium effect size of 0.25 (Duan et
      al., 2017), with a power (1-Î²) of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05, the total sample size will be
      116. Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 30%, a total of 166 participants will be
      required for the study evaluation.

      All data will be analyzed by using SPSS 23.0 software. Independent samples t-tests and
      Chi2-tests will be adopted to examine the characteristics of drop out and compare the
      differences of baseline data at T1. Statistical significance will be set at 5% level
      (two-tailed). The intervention effects on behavioural, social-cognitive and mental health
      status-related indicators will be tested by conducting the multivariate analysis of variance
      (MANOVA) with repeated measures, with time (T1, T2 and T3) as the with-in subjects factor and
      group (IG and CG) as the between-subjects factor. Missing data will be imputed within each
      measurement point in time using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. Furthermore, the
      intervention effect on healthy lifestyle indicator will be examined by performing a
      multinomial logistic regression model. The multiple-mediator model will be conducted to test
      the mediation effects with the use of SPSS macro (Preacher & Hayes, 2008).
