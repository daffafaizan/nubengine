      discussed topic of many scientific as well as non-scientific discussions throughout the areas
      of healthy living, the sports sciences and often used now for the prevention and treatment of
      chronic diseases. It has been demonstrated that long-term low-carbohydrate diet is more
      effective for weight loss and cardiovascular and metabolic risk factor reduction than a
      low-fat diet. In light of conflicting theories of best practice surrounding a polarized topic
      that impacts human health and daily work performance, the primary aim of this research
      project is to examine how low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets affect health markers, exercise
      performance and wellbeing outcomes in sedentary overweight individuals. Each study subject
      will be randomized into one of the four arms of the study and will undergo a 12-week
      intervention, with the exception of the study subjects in the control group, who will undergo
      no intervention for the period of 12 weeks.

      The project outcomes are of immense importance for the investigator's global human health,
      focus on a unique holistic perspective and have the potential to contribute towards
      much-needed adjustments in public health recommendations.
