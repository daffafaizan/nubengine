      contraceptives containing a progestin and an estrogen on liver proteins and coagulation
      factors that are sensitive to estrogen. In this study, a contraceptive vaginal ring
      containing NestoroneÂ® (a progestin with no androgenic properties) and ethinyl estradiol was
      compared to an oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel (an androgenic progestin) and
      ethinyl estradiol.
