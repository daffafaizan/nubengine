      frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, and pain with bladder filling-relieved by emptying.
      There is no cure for IC and the treatment options are suboptimal. Patients with IC report
      significant negative effects on their physical and mental quality of life. The etiology of IC
      is unknown. Certain aspects of IC suggest that autoimmunity may play a role in initiating or
      sustaining the chronic inflammatory response. Bladder biopsies of patients with IC
      demonstrate an increase number of mast cells. Mast cell activation with the release of tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) may mediate this bladder inflammation. Humira® (adalimumab) is a
      medication that blocks the effect of TNF. Humira® (adalimumab) is FDA approved for the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease.
      These diseases are similar to IC. In this study, the hypothesis being tested is that Humira®
      (adalimumab) will show efficacy at reducing the symptoms of IC.
