    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare whether time to high grade recurrence (TTHGR) for patients with BCG-naïve,
      non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) receiving Tokyo-172 BCG strain (Arm II) is
      non-inferior to patients receiving TICE BCG strain (Arm I).

      II. To test whether TTHGR for patients with BCG-naïve, NMIBC receiving intradermal Tokyo-172
      BCG vaccination followed by intravesical Tokyo-172 BCG instillation (Arm III) is superior to
      patients receiving intravesical Tokyo-172BCG instillation without prior intradermal BCG
      vaccination (Arm II).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare time to recurrence (TTR) with any-grade (AG) bladder cancer between patients
      receiving Tokyo-172 versus TICE BCG strain.

      II. To compare TTR with AG bladder cancer between patients receiving intradermal +
      intravesical versus intravesical only Tokyo-172 BCG.

      III. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) between patients receiving Tokyo-172 versus
      TICE BCG strain.

      IV. To compare PFS between patients receiving intradermal + intravesical versus intravesical
      only Tokyo-172 BCG.

      V. To compare 6-month complete response in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or
      without Ta or T1 cancer present at baseline receiving Tokyo-172 versus TICE BCG strain.

      VI. To compare 6-month complete response in patients with CIS with or without Ta or T1 cancer
      present at baseline receiving intradermal + intravesical versus intravesical only Tokyo-172
      BCG.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that purified protein derivative (PPD) test conversion (positive
      PPD at 3 or 6 months) following BCG immunotherapy will predict time to high grade recurrence
      (TTHGR).

      II. To test the hypothesis that urinary cytokine levels following BCG immunotherapy will
      predict time to high grade recurrence (TTHGR).

      III. To test the hypothesis that tumor neoantigen burden and T lymphocyte infiltration are
      associated with BCG response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive TICE BCG solution intravesically once a week for 6 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive TICE BCG solution once a week for 3 consecutive weeks at months
      3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 for up to 7 doses.

      ARM II:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG solution intravesically once a week for 6
      weeks.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG solution once a week for 3 consecutive
      weeks at months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 for up to 7 doses.

      ARM III:

      PRIME: Patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG vaccine once intradermally (ID).

      INDUCTION: Within 21 days, patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG solution as in Arm II.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive Tokyo-172 strain BCG solution as in Arm II.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
