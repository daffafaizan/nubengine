    
      This is a randomized, longitudinal case-controlled study to help find the root causes of
      AxSpA relapses, flares and progression. The study will enroll 400 participants who are aged
      18 or over, are HLA-B27 positive, have had a diagnosis of AxSpA. An informed consent form is
      signed and medical release (to confirm eligibility criteria). Participants sign up online and
      answer questions about their physical and mental health and how they are doing (through an
      app and/or website). The participants will be in the study 1 week, unless they agree to
      complete the 3 and 6 month timeline assessments.

      If eligible, participants are shipped at-home collection kits for: saliva, finger-prick blood
      and stool. They will also make and go to a local lab to collect an additional blood sample.
      All samples are shipped via pre-paid mailers. Participants are randomized into groups and
      given recommendations for their diet and/or supplements to follow for 1 week, (3 months and 6
      months option available). Clinical samples are collected in order to analyze specific
      molecular features associated with AxSpA in the microbiome found in participants.

      Scientists hope to find the microbiome and molecular information that corresponds to health
      and wellness in combination with nutritional guidelines which may alter the gut microbiome in
      patients with AxSpA.
