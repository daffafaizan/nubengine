    
      Ewing sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), Both entities that
      currently comprise the same spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the Ewing sarcoma family
      of tumors (EFT), were originally described as distinct clinicopathologic entities. Primitive
      neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) first described in 1918 by Stout as a malignant tumor arising
      from major nerve. Later, in 1921, ES was described as an undifferentiated tumor involving the
      diaphysis of long bones. It was also reported to arise in soft tissue (extraosseous ES). EFT
      is aggressive malignant small round cell tumors of bone and soft-tissue that predominantly
      affecting children and young adults.
