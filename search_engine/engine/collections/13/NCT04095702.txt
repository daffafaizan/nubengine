      Suck. They have been instrumental in transitioning premature infants from gavage to breast
      feeding Yiallouerou, S, et al, studied the effects of dummy/pacifier on autonomic activity
      during sleep and found pacifier use to be protective during sleep. Risks and Benefits of
      Pacifiers have cleary been identified Sexton, S and Natsale, R have identified that
      nonnutritive suck is a natural reflex for a fetus and newborn. Traditionally, the pacifier
      has been used as a method for fulfilling an infants innate desire to suckle. Study subjects
      will be introduced to either a standard/traditional pacifier (without stabilizing/weighted
      attachment) or a stabilizing/weighted pacifier. Standard/traditional pacifiers will be issued
      to patients that have been assigned an odd number study identifier and , stabilzing/weighted
      pacifiers will be issued to patients that have been assigned an even number study identifier.
      All eligible infants born at 30 weeks to 37.6 weeks who meet study criteria will be included.
      All staff/caregivers will be trained in proper placement of a stabilizing pacifier prior to
      use. Stabilizing pacifiers will not be placed on the infants chest. Traditional pacifiers
      will be used as standard of care at EH. The Neonatal Infant Pain Score (NIPS) scale and a
      caregiver survey will be used to determine efficacy.
