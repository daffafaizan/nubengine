      dysplastic and neoplastic tissue by the use of local thermal coagulative necrosis. Options
      for administration include percutaneous or a surgical approach. Percutaneous RFA is effective
      and safe, but it is unfeasible in cases of lesions with interposition of organs and/or
      vessels. For lesions such as the pancreas, surgery-assisted RFA has been described but
      requires general anesthesia and is associated with a substantial risk of thermal injuries to
      major vessels or adjacent structures.

      EUS-guided RFA is a minimally invasive approach that offers high-quality real-time imaging
      guidance during selective ablation of benign (1-5) or malignant (6-7) pancreatic lesions.
      Treatment in small case series has shown to produce local necrosis with minimal adverse
      events. Other sites treated include the liver and metastatic adenopathy.

      This database will collect data related to endoscopic ultrasound RFA procedures performed by
      Indiana University EUS physicians for the treatment of tumors or adenopathy. No additional
      clinical procedures will be performed outside current standard of care for endoscopic
      ultrasound. The patient's information collected will be pre-procedure identification of the
      adenopathy, labs, the endoscopic ultrasound(s) and post procedure follow up and care related
      to the adenopathy.

      Patients will be contacted by phone at post-procedure 1 & 2 weeks and asked to report
      symptoms related to the procedure.
