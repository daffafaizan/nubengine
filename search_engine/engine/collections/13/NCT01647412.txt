      (IBD) is that overly aggressive acquired immune responses to a subset of commensal enteric
      bacteria develop in genetically susceptible hosts. In an attempt to avoid disease
      progression, patients are treated with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and monoclonal
      antibody drugs, which frequently produce remissions. However, these drugs usually fail to
      achieve long-term, sustained remission or reversal of growth failure, and are associated with
      serious side effects. Recently, intestinal barrier dysfunction has been implicated in an
      alternative 3-step model of IBD pathogenesis.

      The investigators hypothesize that the exclusion diet and nutraceutical therapy (DNT) will
      decrease the production of toxic antigens in the gut and that reactive human growth hormone
      (rhGH) will reduce the passage of the remaining toxic antigens to the underlying mucosal
      immune system by promoting the maintenance of the intestinal barrier and accelerating the
      restitution of the intestinal epithelial lining.

      The following study will test whether the the 3-step model is accurate, and whether rhGH and
      DNT will induce sustained remission in juvenile CD patients.
