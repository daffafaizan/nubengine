      testing visits and 8 weeks of treatment in between.

      In both the pre-treatment and post-treatment testing visit, you would complete game-like
      tasks on the computer, undergo a non-invasive MRI brain scan, and answer some questions about
      your emotional health. The entire visit takes place during 1-2 days at Stanford and lasts
      about 4-5 hours. We'll also ask you to complete a follow-up 12 weeks later, from home, during
      which we'll again ask you some questions on your emotional health.

      The 8-week treatment phase will consist of your choice of either TMS (transcranial magnetic
      stimulation) or Pramipexole (a medication for depression). You will meet with study
      coordinators and MDs each week (Pramipexole) or each day (TMS) to receive treatment. You will
      also be asked to complete weekly online surveys to monitor your mood during the 2-month
      course of treatment.
