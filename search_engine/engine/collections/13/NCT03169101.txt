      HIV-infected individuals. Unfortunately, HIV-infected individuals are three times more likely
      to use tobacco than those in the general population, but little is known about the mechanisms
      that underlie these high smoking rates. This will be the first study to test whether the
      neurocognitive impairments associated with HIV-1 infection may be exacerbated during nicotine
      withdrawal and increase the probability of smoking relapse among HIV-infected smokers (HIV+),
      compared to HIV-uninfected smokers (HIV-). To this end, adult treatment-seeking smokers
      (N=300; 150 HIV+ and 150 HIV-) will complete this 12-week study, which is divided into two
      phases: a pre-quit laboratory phase (weeks 0-2) and a treatment phase (weeks 3-12). Subjects
      will complete two laboratory sessions during the pre-quit phase: once following 24 hours of
      mandatory smoking abstinence and once while smoking-as-usual (order counterbalanced). A
      comprehensive cognitive task battery assessing memory, attention, and executive function will
      be administered during each laboratory session. During the treatment phase, all subjects will
      receive standard smoking cessation treatment, including counseling (weeks 3-8) and open-label
      transdermal nicotine (TN) patches (weeks 4-12). The primary outcomes are: 1) cognitive
      performance following 24-hours smoking abstinence (vs. smoking-as-usual) during the pre-quit
      phase; and 2) 7-day point-prevalence, biochemically-confirmed abstinence rates at the
      end-of-treatment (EOT) for the treatment phase.
