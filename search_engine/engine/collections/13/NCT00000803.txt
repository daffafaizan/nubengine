    
      U-90152 has demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Since the combination of this drug with either
      AZT or ddI has synergistic inhibitory activity against HIV-1 in vitro, and triple therapy
      appears to have greater inhibitory activity against HIV-1 in vitro than dual therapy, the use
      of U-90152 in combination with AZT and/or ddI may improve the benefits of these drugs in
      persons with HIV disease.

      Patients are randomized to receive U-90152/AZT/ddI, U-90152/AZT, U-90152/ddI, or AZT/ddI for
      48 weeks.
