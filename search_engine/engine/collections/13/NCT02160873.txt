      double-blinded approach. This study will include a maximal oxygen uptake test and three
      trials: one familiarization trial, and two experimental trials. The familiarization will
      serve as a practice test to minimize any training effects between experimental trials. The
      experimental trials will be completed within a 2-week period determined by the luteal phase
      of the menstrual cycle (days 15-28 of the menstrual cycle, with day 1 being the first day of
      menstruation). A minimum of 48-72 hours will be provided between testing days.

      Experimental trials will consist of baseline testing (height, weight, urinalysis, resting
      metabolic rate), followed by a treadmill performance protocol. Participants will complete a
      3-stage incremental exercise test (at 55%, 65%, and 75% of maximal oxygen uptake
      respectively). Metabolic data will be collected during this time. Participants will then
      complete a 10-kilometer running time trial in which markers of intensity are monitored at
      various time points (blood glucose, blood lactate, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion).
      Participants and primary researchers will be blinded to all time and speed data. Distance
      will be the only known measure of progress. Additional blood, urine, and body weight measures
      will be taken immediately post exercise.
