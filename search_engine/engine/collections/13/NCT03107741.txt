      and worldwide. Older adults, the age by specific exercise modalities that are suitable for
      regular participation. This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Tai Chi to
      alleviate MetS in older population.

      DESIGN & METHODS: This study is a three-arm assesscer blinded randomized controlled trial.
      Older adults aged 50 years or above with abdominal obesity will be randomly assigned to
      passive control, active control and Tai Chi groups. Subjects assigned to Tai Chi and active
      control groups will receive a 12-week intervention of Tai Chi and generic fitness,
      respectively. No intervention will be given to the passive control group. Outcome measures
      including waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose, triglyceride and high density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up (6
      months after the end of intervention) assessments in all groups.

      HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that: 1) improvements of waist circumference and other indicators
      of MetS are found in Tai Chi group but not in passive control group and 2) improvements of
      waist circumference and other indicators of MetS are more profound in Tai Chi group than
      active control group.
