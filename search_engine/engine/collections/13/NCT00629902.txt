      aortic valve replacement or mitral valve repair. The suboptimal results of MVR underline the
      importance of identifying and preventing prosthesis- patient mismatch. The effective orifice
      area (EOA) of prosthetic valves used for MVR is often too small in relation to body size,
      thus causing a mismatch between valve EOA and transvalvular flow. As a consequence, normally
      functioning mitral prostheses often have relatively high gradients that are similar to those
      found in patients with mild to moderate mitral stenosis. Residual pressure gradients across
      mitral prostheses delay the regression of left atrial and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
      Pulmonary hypertension may cause rightsided failure and is an important risk factor for
      morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular diseases. However data about the
      frequency of prosthesis-patient mismatch after mitral valve replacement and its effect on
      clinical outcome is inconclusive. Predetermined outcomes will be evaluated in the clinical
      course of this condition.
