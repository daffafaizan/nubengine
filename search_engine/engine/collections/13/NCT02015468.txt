      extraarticular distal radius fracture.

      In a prospective manner the investigators intend to analyze hand function, x-ray and other
      parameters in order to investigate whether early mobilization and a targeted program of
      physiotherapy postoperatively leads to a better functional result and earlier return to a
      normal activity level. The investigators analysis will also focus on the safety of early
      mobilization with regards to possible detrimental effects on the osteosynthesis, bony union,
      associated soft-tissue injuries and functional outcome. The investigators also intend to
      assess the cost of more intensive follow-up and physiotherapy and do a cost-benefit
      evaluation.
