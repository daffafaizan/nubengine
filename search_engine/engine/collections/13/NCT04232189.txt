      Health Projects (GHP) launched a portfolio of research that aims to explore the possibility
      of developing a blood or urine test for this purpose.The goal of the present study is to
      validate initial study findings (protocol 8000) in a larger population of people seeking
      abortion.

      Staff will obtain a serum specimen from each participant before any cervical manipulation is
      performed and before any abortifacient drug is administered. The site will send the specimens
      to a central facility for storage until assay. Serum assays for PAPP-A and possibly other
      proteins will be performed at a selected laboratory by qualified experts.
