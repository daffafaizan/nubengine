    
      This is an open-label, non-controlled, first-in-human Phase I study of HS-130 and HS-110 in
      patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, Standard of Care.

      Seven dose levels will be explored in escalating doses. For each dose level, patients will
      receive combination HS-130 and HS-110 via intradermal injections once every 14 days. The Dose
      Limiting Toxicity (DLT) window of observation will include the first 28 days of treatment. In
      the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, patients will continue to
      receive combination treatment every two weeks until disease progression, death, patient's
      withdrawal of consent, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or intolerable
      toxicity, whichever occurs first.
