      Insoles can be used for intervention and correction, especially customized insoles which are
      made according to different foot types. There have been few studies using 3D printing for
      customized insoles for functional flatfoot. Besides, compared to traditional method and
      subtractive manufacturing, the effect of 3D printing customized insoles is still
      controversial and depends on technology, materials and design.The purpose of present study is
      to compare the effects of 3D printing customized insoles using different thermoplastic
      materials on functional flatfoot patients' foot function and biomechanics. Twelve patients
      with functional flatfoot (foot function index> 6) aged 20-65 years old will be recruited in
      this study. Participants plan to wear three kinds of customized insoles fabricated by 3D
      printing with Nylon and TPU or computer numerical control machine with EVA. F-Scan system and
      questionnaires will be used to record foot biomechanics and pain after wearing insoles
      immediately, and foot condition after three weeks. Statistical analysis will be adopted for
      repeated-measures analysis of variance （ANOVA） for all outcome measures and post-hoc test
      will be used to test the difference between groups.
