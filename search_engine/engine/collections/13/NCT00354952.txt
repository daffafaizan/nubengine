      and resistance have shown an association not a causal effect. Utilizing the newer macrolides,
      azithromycin and clarithromycin that are commonly prescribed for respiratory infections, we
      investigated the direct impact of antibiotic exposure on resistance at the individual level.
      203 healthy cohorts were treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin, or a placebo in a
      randomised, double-blind trial. Pharyngeal swabs were collected pre- (day 0) and
      post-antibiotic administration (days 8, 14, 28, 42, 180) and proportions of
      macrolide-resistant streptococci (MRS) were determined at each time-point.
