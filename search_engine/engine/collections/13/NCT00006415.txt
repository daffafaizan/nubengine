      understand the pathogenesis of HIV infection, as well as to potentially prevent the
      establishment of latent infection. Approved antiretroviral therapy is able to reduce plasma
      viremia to unmeasurable levels in established infection and several groups have observed
      comparable effects in recently infected adults. This study is designed to evaluate and follow
      a cohort of patients with primary or early HIV infection and to evaluate the time course of
      latent infection and whether latent infection in CD4 cells will allow viral persistence
      despite antiretroviral therapy.

      Patients begin antiretroviral therapy within 7 days of enrollment. All patients are evaluated
      for treatment compliance and complete a compliance questionnaire regularly. Clinical
      evaluations, including CD4, CD8, and HIV RNA counts also are done regularly. Antiretroviral
      therapy is discontinued if there is no detectable virus by ultrasensitive assay and culture
      techniques in plasma, PBMCs, and lymphoid tissue. In a subset of patients, genital secretions
      and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) are evaluated. If relapse occurs, antiretroviral therapy is
      re-instituted. In addition, virology and immunology substudies are performed.
