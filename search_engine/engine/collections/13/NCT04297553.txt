      (polycystic ovary syndrome) patients compared with conventional controlled ovarian
      stimulation, with less complications (especially ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome), shorter
      treatment duration, lower cost, and acceptable pregnancy outcomes. CAPA (capacitation) IVM
      without hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) priming, has routinely been used at My Duc
      hospital for nearly 3 years to replace hCG-IVM (with hCG priming) because of absolutely
      synchronized oocyte maturation stage and better embryo results and better pregnancy outcomes.
      However, with CAPA IVM, embryos are freezed-only and will be transferred in the next cycles.
      This process will increase the cost of freezing and thawing embryos, and increase the
      treatment duration, which complicates the IVM procedure and turns IVM into an unfriendly
      protocol to PCOS patients. Therefore, our group conducts this study to find out the
      effectiveness of fresh transfer protocol after CAPA IVM compared with freezing-only CAPA IVM
      protocol. The fresh transfer protocol for CAPA IVM is applied from previous hCG IVM protocol,
      with the use of hCG and exogenous estradiol and progesterone, but at different timings.
