      either a Coban™ bandage or a Tegaderm™ dressing after TRA. Firm manual compression will then
      be applied over the QuikClot® Radial® pad after the sheath is removed for 5 minutes. The
      Coban™ cohort will then have the Coban™ bandage removed after an additional 25 minutes, then
      be covered with a Tegaderm™ dressing. The Tegaderm™ only cohort will be closely observed for
      25 minutes after release of manual pressure. Both cohorts will remove the Tegaderm™ dressing
      the following morning.

      Consented subjects will be randomly assigned in the cardiac cath lab upon completion of their
      procedure into the following three arms:

      Arm 1 - Standard of Care with a TR Band® Arm 2 - QuikClot® Radial® pad combined with a Coban™
      bandage Arm 3 - QuikClot® Radial® pad combined with a Tegaderm™ dressing
