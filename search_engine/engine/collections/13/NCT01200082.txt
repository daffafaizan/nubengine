      Specific Aim #1: Establish a baseline of individual and total urinary BAs and BA-sulfates in
      healthy controls and patients with hepatobiliary diseases. A baseline reference of the
      average and distribution of the percentage of urinary BA-sulfates will be determined in
      healthy subjects and in patients with hepatobiliary diseases including chronic hepatitis C/B,
      alcoholic liver disease, hereditary, drug-induced, and autoimmune hepatobiliary diseases. The
      investigators working hypothesis is that patients' capability to sulfate total or specific
      BAs, as determined by the percentage of total or specific BAs excreted in the sulfate form,
      can predict the severity of hepatobiliary diseases, as determined by mayo model for end-stage
      liver disease (MELD) score and compensation status(compensated and decompensated). Patients
      with higher MELD score are considered to be at higher risk of developing severe hepatobiliary
      complications.

      Specific Aim #2: Determine the relationship between BA sulfation and the progression of
      hepatobiliary diseases. This is an exploratory aim to collect preliminary data on the
      relationship between urinary BAs and the progression of hepatobiliary diseases in
      liver-transplant and non-liver-transplant patients, as monitored over a1-year period. The
      investigators working hypothesis is that patients' capabilities of sulfating BAs determine
      the progression of the disease.
