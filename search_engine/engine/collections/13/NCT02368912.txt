    
      Part 1 comprises 7 dose groups of 8 healthy young male subjects. ASP1707 or matching placebo
      ( 3 to 1 ratio) is given as a single dose under fasted conditions.

      The first group receives the lowest dose while the last group receives the highest dose.

      Part 2 (Food-Effect) The group consists of 12 healthy young male subjects who receive two
      separate doses of ASP1707 under fasted or fed conditions. Half of the subjects are dosed
      first under fasted condition and half of them had first an FDA high-fat breakfast. Subjects
      receive the alternate treatment on the second occasion. Dosing is separated by at least 7
      days or 7 times t1/2 (terminal elimination half-life) as assessed from Part 1.

      Part 3 Comprises 4 dose groups of 12 healthy elderly men each, and two groups of 12 healthy
      premenopausal women. The latter are dosed ASP1707 or placebo in parallel to the 4 male
      groups. Subjects are fasted or fed depending on observations from Part 2.

      Dose levels are defined after evaluating interim safety, tolerability and PK and PD results
      from Part 1. A lower maximum dose is used in women than in men, based on preclinical data.
      Dose escalation in the men is independent from dose escalation in the women. Women and men
      receive once-daily dosing;

      Part 4 includes 4 groups, 1 placebo and 3 for ASP1707, each with 9 pre-menopausal women.
      Subjects in each dose group receive a fixed daily dose. Subjects are domiciled for various
      intervals during each of 3 menstrual cycles. Dosing occurs for 21 Days during the subjects'
      second menstrual cycle of the study (Day 1 of Period 2); fasted or fed depending on
      observations from Part 2.
