    
      This is a parallel group randomized controlled, prospective study that examines the effect of
      an Internet-based pain coping skills program on pain severity and pain interference among
      adult cancer survivors experiencing persistent cancer-related pain. The study also explores
      the effects of an Internet-based pain coping skills program on opioid/analgesic medication
      use, health-related quality of life, pain management self-efficacy and various other factors
      relevant among populations with persistent pain (i.e., fatigue, sleep, emotional distress,
      positive affect, pain impact, perceived cognitive problems, and cognitive performance), as
      well as qualitative assessments of participants experiences with pain and the intervention. A
      total of 456 participants will be enrolled (228 per arm) and randomized into the internet
      program arm (plus enhanced usual care) or Enhanced Usual Care alone.

      Each participant will be enrolled in the study for 9 months (from randomization at week 0 to
      the final follow-up assessment at week 34).
