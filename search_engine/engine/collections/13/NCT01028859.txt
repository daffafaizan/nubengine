        -  I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CKD-516 administered at single doses every 21
           days in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  II. Determine both the toxicity and dose limiting toxicity of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  III. Determine the plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of CKD-516.

        -  IV. Gather preliminary data regarding possible antitumor effects in those patients with
           measurable diseae. Assess the effects of CKD-516 on tumor blood flow using DCE-MRI
           scanning techniques, and establish the dose at which these effects occur.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive CKD-516 IV over 30
      minutes on day 1, 8 every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Cohorts of 3~6 patients receive escalating doses of CKD-516 until the maximum
      tolerated dose(MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
