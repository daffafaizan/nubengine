      arthritis receiving abatacept biologic therapy versus TNF inhibitor therapy in the form of
      adalimumab.

      To establish if there are differences in pain outcomes by patient reported scores, objective
      measures of pain using quantitative sensory testing and inflammatory markers in participants
      receiving biologic therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.

      Population: The population being assessed in this study are participants with active
      rheumatoid arthritis with a disease activity score of greater than 5.1.

      Intervention: Subjects will be randomized to treatment with abatacept or adalimumab for
