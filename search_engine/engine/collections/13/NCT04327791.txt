    
      Up to 282 hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed influenza who provide informed
      consent and meet trial inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Experimental Design and Methods In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase
      2-like, investigator-directed trial, hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed
      influenza meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be provided information on the
      trial, offered enrollment, and enrolled randomly in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups upon
      signing of the study's informed consent form: Group 1, the combination treatment group
      (oseltamivir and baloxavir); Group 2, the standard treatment group (oseltamivir and placebo).

        -  Group 1, the combination treatment group will receive oseltamivir and baloxavir

             -  Oseltamavir: 75 mg po bid for 5 days

             -  Baloxavir: 40 mg po once for wt < 80 kg OR 80 mg po once for wt >/= 80 kg

        -  Group 2, the standard treatment group will receive oseltamivir and placebo

             -  Oseltamavir: 75 mg po bid for 5 days

             -  Placebo: Once

      Oseltamavir dosing may be reduced for patients with decreased renal function as follows, per
      treating physician:

        -  CrCl > 60 mL/minute: No dosage adjustment

        -  CrCl > 30 to 60 mL/minute: 30 mg po bid

        -  CrCl > 10 to 30 mL/minute: 30 mg po qd

        -  HD: 30 mg po once and 30 mg po after each HD session

        -  CAPD: 30 mg po once

        -  CRRT: 30 mg po qd After assignment of a unique study number after signing informed
           consent, baseline data will be collected at time 0 including personal and clinical
           information and protocol directed laboratory specimens - nasopharyngeal swabs for
           influenza PCR for patients who only had a rapid antigen test and blood specimens for
           patients who consent to additional blood drawing (for improved efficacy and safety
           analyses; not required for enrollment). Patients will be given oseltamivir by their
           healthcare providers. Research personnel's only involvement for oseltamivir dosing will
           be to remind providers that earlier treatment improves efficacy. Patients will then be
           given a single dose of baloxavir or placebo by the study's CRC as per a computerized
           random allocation scheme with dose determined by weight (as above); the CRC will notify
           the patient's provider that the patient has been given the single (blinded) dose. At
           time 1, 2, 3, 7, and 30 days, nasopharyngeal swabs will again be obtained, clinical
           information will be obtained from the patient via interview and review of the EMR, and
           blood specimens for patients who consented to additional blood drawing. Follow up will
           continue for 30 days.

      Efficacy and adjudicated safety data points will be assessed by a blinded Data Monitoring
      Committee (DMC) after completion of the trial.
