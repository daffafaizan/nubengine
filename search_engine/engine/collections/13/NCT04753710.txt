      groups (12 subjects per group) for single and multiple instillations (1 drop, 3 drops and 3+3
      drops). In each group, 9 subjects is randomized to receive Chloroprocaine 3% Gel and 3
      subjects receive vehicle as control in the right eye. After part I is completed, an internal
      independent board review safety endpoints of data collected from these first subjects and
      advise to go on with further enrollment.

      If no safety concerns arise, in part II efficacy, safety and tolerability is assessed in 60
      healthy subjects for the 3 drops dose regimen. 40 subjects receive Chloroprocaine 3% Gel and
      20 receive vehicle (2:1 randomization) in the right eye.
