    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. This is a
      5-arm, 21-week study comprised of up to a 2-week Screening period, a 15-week Dose-Escalation
      and Maintenance Phase using 4 doses of E2007 (2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, and 8 mg) or placebo, and a
      4-week, single-blind placebo Follow-Up Phase. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of
      the five treatment groups. Those patients assigned to receive either 4 mg, 6 mg, or 8 mg
      E2007 will be escalated to the appropriate dose according to an escalation schedule. All
      patients will take four identical-looking tablets on a daily basis for the entire study
      duration for blinding purposes.
