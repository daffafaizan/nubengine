        1. To investigate the association of both allelic and genotypic -374T/A and -429T/C
           polymorphisms and inflammatory bowel disease.

        2. To correlate the relation between the studied SNPs , disease activity and the clinical
           features of the disease.

      Subjects and Methods:

      This is a case control study. The study will include 90 patients diagnosed as IBD. Patients
      will be recruited from outpatient department of Elraghey Liver Hospital in Assiut University
      Hospital.The clinical disease activity was calculated using the Montreal classification of
      disease activity and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for UC and CD patients,
      respectively (Silverberg et al., 2005).

      -Also, 90 apparently healthy subjects (age and sex matched with the patient group) will be
      included as control group.
