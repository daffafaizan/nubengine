      lymphoma accounts for the majority. As the classic first-line treatment, the emergence of the
      R-CHOP program has resulted in clinical cures for more than 1/2 of patients with B-cell
      lymphoma. But for patients with highly aggressively B cell lymphoma, most of them still
      suffer from disease recurrences due to R-CHOP treatment alone.

      In recent years, with the emergence of various new drugs, many researchers have tried to add
      new drugs to the classic R-CHOP program as a first-line treatment for non-Hodgkin B-cell
      lymphoma. As a new type of immunomodulator, lenalidomide was first approved for the treatment
      of multiple myeloma. In recent years, its role in refractory and relapsed B-cell lymphoma has
      gradually been recognized.

      In 2015, Nowakowski et al. published a clinical study of 64 patients with diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma who used R2-CHOP in first-line therapy. It was found that R2-CHOP does not
      improve R-CHOP in patients with GCB. The effective rate of treatment and the 2-year survival
      rate of patients, but for patients with non-GCB type DLBCL with poor prognosis, the addition
      of lenalidomide can greatly improve the remission rate of the disease and improve the poor
      prognosis of patients.

      So, the investigators initiate this study to evaluate the efficacy of R2-CHOP/R2-EPOCH etc in
      newly diagnosed highly invasively non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.
