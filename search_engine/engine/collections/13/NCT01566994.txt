      populations of smokers and for the 80% who are not motivated to quit. Nicotine addiction is
      just like other drug addictions in terms of breaking the addiction cycle. Researchers and
      providers differ on whether treatment emphasis should be on clinician-based counseling,
      biologically-based medications, computer-based tailored communications or a combination of
      these. There is a lack of comparative research on population treatments to compare
      effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and enhancement of quality of life. Such comparative
      research would provide health care systems and providers with evidence on how to best serve
      entire populations of smokers, especially unmotivated smokers who are seriously underserved.
      This research will compare the four most highly recommended treatments: 1. Motivation
      Enhancement Therapy (MET) plus NRT; 2.Tailored communications based on the Transtheoretical
      Model (TTM), and 3. The combination of these treatments.
