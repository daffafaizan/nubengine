    
      YH25448 is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective and irreversible EGFR Tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) that targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while
      sparing wild type EGFR.

      This is a Phase III, Randomized, Double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      YH25448 (240 mg orally, once daily) versus Gefitinib (250 mg orally, once daily) in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is known to be EGFR sensitizing mutation
      (EGFRm) positive, treatment-na√Øve and eligible for first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI.
