      long-term romantic relationship. This global evaluation can be a reflection of a how happy
      people are in their marriage in general or a composite of satisfaction with several specific
      facets of the marital relationship. Sexual health can be described as enjoying and fulfilling
      sexual desires without harming, physical or psychological, oneself or others. Sexual
      functioning is an important part of a patient's health and well-being. Patients often seek
      for treatment late due to embarrassment and commonly with an alternative problem. Sexual and
      erectile functions are considered important components of men's overall health. The
      psychosocial impact of ED can lead to depression, loss of self-esteem, and relationship and
      marital difficulties. Personality is defined as the "distinctive and characteristic patterns
      of thought, emotion and behavior that define an individual's personal style and influence his
      or her interaction with the environment".
