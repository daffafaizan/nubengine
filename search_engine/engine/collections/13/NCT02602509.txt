      combined effects of administered drugs, host factors and strain factors on mycobacterial
      sterilisation. If performed in parallel with PK measurements, the method can be used to
      evaluate the effect of drugs throughout the dosing cycle. Celecoxib is a COX-2 inhibitor with
      immuno-modulatory properties important in the host defence against tuberculosis (TB). The aim
      of this trial is to investigate the effect on WBA of manipulation of the host response to TB
      using celecoxib, in combination with established TB drugs.
