      patients after kidney transplantation. Researchers and clinicians are trying to extend the
      survival of the renal graft. Currently, it is believed that the main cause of late transplant
      loss is antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). Anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are a
      proven risk factor for the development of humoral rejection and transplant loss. Antibodies
      in sensitized recipients occur before transplantation (preformed) or may develop de novo (in
      13% -30% of patients).

      DSA damage the graft in various mechanisms (complement activation, direct influence on
      endothelial cells, antibody-dependent cytotoxicity) leading to different
      clinical-morphological phenotypes. The pathogenicity of DSA is determined by number of their
      additional characteristics, such as: class, specificity, strength, C1q complement binding,
      IgG subclass . Monitoring the presence of DSA in the kidney recipient serum with the
      determination of their characteristics may improve the stratification of the risk of
      immunological loss of the renal allograft.

      There is no effective treatment for ABMR, hence DSA monitoring allows for early intervention
      such as biopsy or modification of immunosuppressive therapy at an early stage of rejection.
