      be documented. A pre-visit (V-1) will be scheduled for informed consent, V0 for inclusion
      (V-1 and V0 may occur on the same day), V1 one month post-inclusion and V2 4 to 7 months
      post-inclusion. V0, V1 and V2 will be planned during regular medical visits.

      Eligible patients either get their cART in their usual pharmacy according to standard of
      care, or take part in a routine adherence-enhancing program(adherence subgroup)run by the
      pharmacists of the outpatient medical clinic.

      In the adherence subgroup, adherence is assessed electronically by MEMS (Medication event
      monitoring system) monitors on a regular basis.
