      benzodiazepine tapers with the aim of assisting individuals receiving OAT discontinue
      benzodiazepine use. All participants will receive the same benzodiazepine (BZD)
      discontinuation protocol; the only difference will be whether they receive the DT or RT
      interventions. There is no randomization process and the trial will be open label.
      Participants will be assigned one of the two interventions with the first participant
      receiving the DT-BD intervention, followed by the next participant receiving the RT
      intervention, and so on in that pattern. Specifically, among the eight participants, four
      will receive the DT-BD intervention and four will receive the RT intervention. The RT
      intervention has been utilized in past BZD discontinuation clinical trials and was found to
      be an adequate control intervention. Both interventions consist of 12 weeks with 3 weekly
      therapy sessions prior to an 8-week BZD taper. Some participants may be prescribed
      non-benzodiazepine medications to treat the underlying conditions for which they were using
      BZDs [e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) for anxiety or hypnotics for
      insomnia]. Data collection will occur at baseline, then weekly for 12 weeks.
