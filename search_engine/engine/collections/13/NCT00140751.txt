      history of HIV-1 infection, but toxicities and complexities of therapy limit long-term
      efficacy, and make simpler yet effective HAART regimens highly desirable. Previous attempts
      to 'de-intensify' protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy by discontinuing reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (RTI) after achieving viral suppression met with failure, probably
      because plasma levels of most individually administered PI are too low to inhibit viral
      replication consistently.

      Low-dose ritonavir substantially enhances lopinavir plasma levels, and lopinavir/ritonavir
      (LPV/r) is effective as part of a combination therapy in both naive and PI-experienced
      patients. Furthermore, lopinavir is known to have a high genetic barrier to selection of
      resistance. LPV/r monotherapy could thus have the right combination of potency, favorable
      pharmacokinetics, and high genetic barrier needed to suppress viral replication and prevent
      the selection of lopinavir resistance. Preliminary results with "maintenance"LPV/r
      monotherapy show interesting results but data from randomized studies are needed.
