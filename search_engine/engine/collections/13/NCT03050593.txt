      sampling are currently lacking in HFpEF. The main aims of our study are to:

        1. better phenotype and characterise HFpEF (also comparing with HFrEF and age- and sex-
           matched healthy controls)

        2. provide mechanistic insights into pathophysiology

        3. describe potential biomarkers and their relation to relevant clinical outcomes (exercise
           capacity, heart failure quality of life and prognosis)
