    
      The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases has not yet
      been widely reported, and has been evaluated only in symptomatic patient samples. The
      proportion of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients is unknown, in patients who share
      common symptoms with CoV-2-SARS infection.

      Some treatments for chronic inflammatory rheumatisms such as TNF inibitors appear to have a
      protective effect against severe forms of COVID-19, while corticosteroids or other
      immunosuppressants may be associated with a higher prevalence of severe forms of COVID-19.

      Our objective is to describe the prevalence of seroconversion to CoV-2-SARS by consecutive
      screening in routine care of out and inpatients with chronic inflammatory rheumatism (i.e.
      rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis) by serological testing
      and to compare prevalence according to type of chronic inflammatory rheumatism, DMARD class
      and symptomatic treatment (corticosteroid therapy, NSAIDs).
