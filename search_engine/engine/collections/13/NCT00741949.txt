      deep oxygen desaturation. Performing FOB under NIV has been shown efficient to prevent
      episodes of desaturation. Several modes of ventilation have been tried ; Continuous Positive
      Airways Pressure and Pressure Support Ventilation both showed superiority when compared to
      oxygen supplementation alone. The recent French consensus on NIV recommends performing FOB
      under NIV in hypoxemic conditions.

      Efficacy of NIV can be altered by patient agitation or asynchronism with the ventilator.
      Though, some authors have proposed the use of sedative agents like remifentanyl during NIV.

      To our knowledge, none study has evaluated the beneficial effect of sedation during a FOB
      with BAL under NIV.

      Propofol is an anesthetic agent which can be administered in TCI, to maintain a constant
      concentration in the target cerebral compartment. Propofol is widely used in different types
      of anesthesia. Using the same concept, authors have reported its use in sedation, with
      smaller target concentrations. TCI sedation with propofol preserves patient's spontaneous
      ventilation, and does not alter hemodynamic parameters.

      Our hypothesis is that s√©dation by TCI with propofol will lead to best oxygen saturation than
      without this intervention in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and undergoing
      FOB with BAL under NIV.

      Thus, we designed a randomized controlled study. Eligible patients will be randomized in two
      groups. In the treatment group, patients will receive sedation with propofol during the
      procedure of FOB under NIV. In the other group, patients will receive a placebo during the
      same procedure. Patients and fibroscopist won't be aware of the randomization group
