      several disease states (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes, and acromegaly), the target cells are
      resistant to insulin action. Insulin resistance leads to metabolic complications including
      diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and
      reproductive dysfunction. The intramural research program of the NIDDK has a long history of
      studying patients with rare disorders of extreme insulin resistance. We use what is learned
      from these rare patients both to develop therapeutics for rare diseases, and to apply what is
      learned to understand more common forms of insulin resistance.
