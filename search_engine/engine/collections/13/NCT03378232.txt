      costs in Canada. A cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors including insulin resistance,
      dyslipidemia, hypertension, and abdominal obesity increases the risk of developing the
      aforementioned diseases. While drugs can help to treat or slow the development of
      cardiometabolic problems, they are not always effective and in some instances can have
      adverse effects on a patient's health. In comparison, changing, modifying or improving
      dietary habits is now recognized as a safe and effective way to help reduce the risk of
      developing CVD, as well as treat CVD and T2D. The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) is
      highly recommended due to their known benefits for health and development; however,
      considerable variability exists in the literature regarding the benefits of omega-3 FAs. This
      variability stems from differences in study design; differing in dosage, duration of
      supplementation, population studied, sample size, as well as the amounts of eicosapentaenoic
      acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) used in supplements. The current study will
      investigate the effects of EPA and DHA on markers of cardiometabolic and cardiovascular
      health in young adults.

      To assess the effectiveness of EPA and DHA on markers of cardiometabolic health, including

        1. blood lipids, such as triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
           and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels

        2. markers of inflammation, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and other
           circulating cytokines

        3. whole-body glucose and insulin levels

        4. resting metabolic rate

        5. blood pressure and muscle sympathetic nerve activity
