      in hospitals and same day surgery centers. There has been a rise in the number of opioid
      misuse and overdoses nationally, with Ohio ranked first in the nation for drug overdose
      deaths in 2014 and Cuyahoga County leading the state with 666 overdose deaths in 2016(ref) As
      health care providers, it is our responsibility to respond to this epidemic. One measure to
      address this is to reduce the number of unused prescription opioids that remain in patients'
      possession when they no longer need them. (ref) Doing so will maximize safety by decreasing
      the availability of unused opioids. The purpose of this study is to determine if a product
      that deactivates opioids will be used as designed after oral opioid medication is no longer
      needed. The design of this study is a quality initiative project using a randomized control
      design. The setting is a surgery center in a suburban hospital in Cuyahoga County. The
      population is all adult surgery center patients that are prescribed opioids postoperatively
      who are discharged the same day. In addition to usual care, a medication disposal bag with
      instructions on how to use will be given to the patient prior to discharge. The patient will
      be called 30-45 days post discharge. The data will be collected on a case report form that
      will include information about disposal and information obtained from the patients medical
      record.
