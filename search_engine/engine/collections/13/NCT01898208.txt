      broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy typically administered in patients who have positive
      blood cultures, improving clinical outcome and reducing cost. To test this hypothesis we
      propose a prospective, randomized controlled study comparing outcomes among patients with
      positive blood cultures who receive either: Standard culture and antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing (AST) of positive blood culture bottles as is done today (control), standard culture
      and AST of positive blood culture bottles plus the FilmArray Blood Culture ID Panel
      (intervention group 1), or standard culture and AST of positive blood culture bottles plus
      the FilmArray Blood Culture ID Panel testing along with expert infectious diseases phone
      consultation (intervention group 2). In both intervention groups, results of the FilmArray
      test will be communicated by phone to the primary service, along with templated comments
      about optimal antimicrobial therapy, based on the result. (Templated comments will also be
      used in the control group). In intervention group 2, an infectious diseases pharmacist or
      physician will provide patient-specific recommendations to modify antimicrobial therapy, if
      appropriate, based on microbiology results and clinical information obtained through medical
      record review and discussion with the primary service.
