    
      The primary objectives of this study are to:

      i.) Determine the effects of increased fish consumption on serum and breast fat tissue fatty
      acids in women at high risk for developing breast cancer relative to an omega 3 fatty acid
      supplement;

      ii.) Assess adherence and tolerability of increased dietary intake of fish relative to an
      omega 3 fatty acid supplement.

      Secondary objectives include:

      iii.) Evaluate possible correlations between physical factors such as body mass index (BMI)
      and dietary factors and target tissue effects.

      iv.) Explore additional biomarkers as surrogate endpoints to measure effects of fish
      consumption.
