      the global burden of disease. Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) affects an additional 0.2% to
      1.1% of adults. As many as four out of five people who have schizophrenia or SAD relapse
      within 5 years of recovery from their initial episode. Interventions aimed at early
      intervention to prevent relapse would impact public health.

      The Texting for Relapse Prevention (T4RP) is an innovative service delivery program delivered
      via text messaging designed for people who have schizophrenia/SAD. The intervention will be
      tested in a randomized controlled trial against a treatment-as-usual control group which, for
      most, involved meeting with their therapist every 2 to 4 weeks and meeting with their
      psychiatrist at least once every 90 days or more frequently as clinically indicated. A total
      of 40 people with schizophrenia and 5-15 provider participants (depending on the patient
      distribution across the providers) in the pilot RTC. The study is being conducted by
      researchers at the Center for Innovative Public Health Research and Johns Hopkins Community
      Psychiatry Program (JHCPP).

      The investigators posit that T4RP will reduce psychiatric morbidity and institutionalization
      rates and promote recovery by facilitating improved patient-provider communication, promoting
      medication adherence, helping people self-monitor their early warning signs, and promoting
      self-management of symptoms.

      If T4RP is effective, this cost-effective and easily scalable intervention will make a
      significant public health impact and reduction in relapse-related costs for people with
      schizophrenia/SAD.
