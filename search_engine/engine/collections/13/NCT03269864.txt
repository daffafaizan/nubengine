      a source artery and vein through branches for all tissue layers between the skin and the
      bone, and showed that between neighboring angiosomes there are choked and true anastomotic
      arteries.

      Koshima and Soeda in 1989, described an inferior epigastric artery skin flap without the
      rectus abdominis muscle for reconstruction of floor of mouth, began the era of perforator
      flaps.

      The big popularity gained by the local perforator flaps was due to their main advantages: 1)
      Sparing of the source artery and underlying muscle and fascia, 2) Combining the very good
      blood supply of a musculocutaneous flap with the reduced donor-site morbidity of a skin flap,
      3) Replacing like with like, 4) Limiting the donor-site to the same area, 5) Possibility of
      completely or partially primarily closure, 6) Technically less demanding, because they are
      microsurgical procedures, but without microvascular sutures, 7) Shorter operating time.
