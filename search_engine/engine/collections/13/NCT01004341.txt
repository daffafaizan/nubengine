      behavioral weight control programs are the mainstay of treatment, there is considerable
      variability in their outcomes. Parents play an important role in the success of their
      children, particularly by implementing new behavioral skills. However recent evidence has
      also suggested that parenting style, or the way a parent interacts with their child and
      provides emotional support and discipline, may be another key element in pediatric weight
      control. Our goal is to evaluate the role of specific parenting (behavioral) skills and
      parenting style in the success of children enrolled in a standard family-based behavioral
      weight control intervention. Our goal is to examine whether specific parenting (behavioral)
      skills and parenting style change during the intervention and whether or not this change is
      related to changes in the child's BMI z-score.
