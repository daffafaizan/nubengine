      of skin to skin and is influenced by moist conditions. The prevalence of intertrigo was
      reported to be 2.5% for adults with an average age of 41.5 years. Prevalence of intertrigo in
      the large skin folds varies from 6% in hospital patients to 17% in nursing home clients and
      20% in home care patients. The inframammary fold was most often affected (9.9%), followed by
      the inguinal region (9.4%), axilla (0.5%) and abdominal region (0.5%). Intertrigo may be mild
      and asymptomatic, but also may lead to intense erythema and desquamation. The affected skin
      may have a foul odor and may be macerated and ulcerated with copious or purulent discharge.
      The conventional therapy for simple intertrigo is minimizing moisture and friction. Some
      suggest the use of absorptive powders, such as talc and cornstarch, or barrier creams. These
      topical treatments such as topical steroid, however, have little or no proven benefit and may
      cause irritation or facilitate yeast colonization. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of liquid powder containing tapioca starch stimutex AS, aloe barbadensis, rose hip
      oil and allantoin comparing with topical 1% hydrocortisone cream of mild to moderate
      intertrigo patients.
