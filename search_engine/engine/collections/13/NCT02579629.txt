    
      The main purpose of this study is to examine if pain levels treated with intrathecal (IT)
      preservative-free morphine (PFM) after a cesarean section improve with the additional use of
      continuous subfascial wound infiltration with ropivacaine using the OnQ® elastomeric pump
      system. As a double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled study, women undergoing first,
      second or third cesarean section will be randomly assigned to one of 3 different groups.
      Group 1 will receive saline, group 2 will be given ropivacaine 0.1%, group 3 will be given
      ropivacaine 0.2%, all at a rate of 8ml/hr via the OnQ® pump system. Each group will also
      receive an 8mL bolus of the previously assigned infusate. The investigator will assess pain
      at rest and with movement at different time periods during the recovery process through 3
      months post operatively. The investigator will also assess if the use of this system
      decreases the need for other pain medications and reduces the potential side-effects of pain
      treatment.
