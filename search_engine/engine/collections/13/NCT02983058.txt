      activity of the mTOR kinase pathway. This study is being conducted by the New York State
      Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) and will take place at Columbia University Medical Center
      (CUMC) in New York City and at a research office in Strasburg, PA. Subjects (n=20) with the
      CNTNAP2 mutation with schizophrenia or a related condition will be recruited from the Amish
      and Mennonite communities and brought to CUMC for detailed investigation. Affected
      individuals will be compared to Amish and Mennonite control subjects drawn from the same
      families but not harboring CNTNAP2 mutations (n=20). The primary measure will consist of
      mGluR PET binding in DLPFC. In addition, secondary analyses will assess binding in other
      brain regions such as hippocampus and visual cortex. Exploratory measures, as well as
      relationships between PET mGluR5 binding and clinical symptomatology, will be assessed.
