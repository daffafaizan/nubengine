      Participants will be provided with a dosing card containing a dose for initial treatment and
      a second dose to be used for rescue or recurrence of migraine. Each participant's study
      participation will consist of a screening visit (Visit 1) with a telephone contact within 7
      days to confirm eligibility, a Treatment Period of up to 8 weeks, and an End-of-Study (EoS)
      visit (Visit 2) within one week (7 days) of treating a single migraine attack. The total time
      on study is approximately 11 weeks.
