      patients with advanced lung cancer with activating mutations of EGFR gene with or without
      T790M which were detected from circulating tumor DNA. EGFR-TKI na√Øve patients with activating
      EGFR mutation will be enrolled in cohort 1. Patients with acquired resistance to prior EGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) due to T790M mutation is going to be enrolled in cohort 2.
