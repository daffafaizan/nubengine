      indications for prophylactic mastectomy. The cosmetic appearance and complications will be
      followed through several post operative visits throughout the duration of the study. This
      study is conducted in conjunction with the plastic and reconstructive surgeons who will be
      performing the breast reconstruction procedures. Patient satisfaction will be measured via
      survey format. In addition, local recurrence rates will be compared to patients undergoing
      traditional mastectomy.
