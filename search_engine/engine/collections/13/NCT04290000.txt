      authorized medication: Yescarta and Kymriah. Despite impressive outcomes in 3 phase II
      studies, never met in relapsed or refractory diseases, half of the patients don't respond to
      this treatment.This can be explained by a low expansion, functional alteration or short
      persistance of infused cells. Determination of reasons for treatment failure is the first
      step for optimization of this therapeutics. This project aims to bank blood samples from a
      cohort of patients treated with CAR-T cell for hematological malignancies in Montpellier
      University Hospital. Clinical data related to samples will be collected. This samples will be
      used to determine factors influencing efficacy of CAR-T cells treatments.
