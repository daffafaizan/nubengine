      Gy to the lateral aspect of the primary tumor. Patients will receive pembrolizumab for 2
      cycles prior to surgery or SRT and surgery. Surgical resection of all involved areas of tumor
      will occur within 6 weeks of the last administration of pembrolizumab. It should be noted
      that surgery is expected to occur within a much shorter window and 6 weeks would represent
      the greatest allowable amount of delay.

      If during the run-in, only the pembrolizumab-alone cohort meets pre-specified safety
      parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter a larger expansion cohort, with
      treatment given according to that cohort only. If during the run-in both cohorts meet
      pre-specified safety parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter the expansion
      cohort and be randomized between preoperative pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab with SRT of
      12 Gy.
