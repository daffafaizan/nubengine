      million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis become chronic to require medical treatment. The
      optic light from the illumination wand travelled through the pallet into the sinuses and
      exited the face. The optic device can determine air-filled and fluid/tissue-filled spaces in
      the sinus cavity during clinical exam.
