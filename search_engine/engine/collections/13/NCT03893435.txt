      Sacubitril/Valsartan (SAC/VAL) is now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and also, recently indicated as
      class I indication, level of evidence B in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
      guidelines 2016 on congestive heart failure (CHF).(1) PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that
      morbidity and mortality can be improved with SAC/VAL In comparison to enalapril, it reduced
      the occurrence of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for CHF by 20% with a 16% reduction
      in all-cause mortality.(2) So far, no available data about the effect of usage of SAC/VAL in
      post-AMI except in animal experimental models that proved efficacy of SAC/VAL in preventing
      AMI-induced LV dysfunction compared with SAC/VAL, also significantly attenuated LV scar size
      following AMI compared with placebo .(3)

      Aim of the work:

        -  This study aims to investigate the effects of SAC/VAL in post-AMI through using it
           instead of conventional Angiotensin Converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs inhibitors) or
           Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in treatment of post-AMI patients with reduced
           left ventricular (LV) systolic function.

        -  Design: Randomized open label interventional clinical trial.
