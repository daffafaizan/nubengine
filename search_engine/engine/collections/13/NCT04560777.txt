    
      Twelve participants will be included (aged 8 to 21 years old). Participants will have
      different assessment times, before, during and after the CO-OP intervention (immediate
      post-intervention, 2, 4 and 6-months post-intervention). Parents will be asked to answer
      questionnaires and interview and to participate in certain CO-OP sessions, if they can.

      They will choose four objectives (problematic everyday life activities they want to improve).
      Three will be worked on in CO-OP sessions, the fourth will be the control objective.

      Participants will have 14 sessions of rehabilitation with the CO-OP approach (2 sessions per
      week for 7 weeks).
