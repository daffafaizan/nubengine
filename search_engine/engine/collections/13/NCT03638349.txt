      parts. Part 1 involves each subject completing a number of simple quantitative exercises to
      gauge their level of comprehension of diabetes related information. Subjects will then
      continue during the same visit to complete part 2 which involves gathering qualitative
      feedback from each subject on the new Blood glucose monitoring system.
