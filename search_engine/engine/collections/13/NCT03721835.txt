      offer better intra-operative reduction control with the assurance of eliminating device
      failure modes. This system is dedicated to treating both non-displaced and displaced
      intracapsular fractures of the femoral neck. It is a dynamic locked implant system that
      provides multiple points of fixed angle support with continuous compression across the
      fracture site, ensuring bone-on-bone contact during the fracture union process. The
      continuous fracture site compression and post-operative reduction maintenance is accomplished
      with the incorporation of telescoping compression screw technology. The novel system empowers
      surgeons to address the current surgical challenges and often unfavorable patient outcomes
      and high re-operation rate associated with the current treatment options for intracapsular
      femoral neck fractures.

      This study will evaluate the re-operation rate for any reason of displaced and non-displaced
      femoral neck fractures treated with the CONQUEST FN Femoral Neck Fracture System at one year
      post-operation.
