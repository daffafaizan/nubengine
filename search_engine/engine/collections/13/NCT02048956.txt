      are caused by a progressive loss and deterioration of articular cartilage with reactive new
      bone formation at the joint's surface and margins involving articular cartilage, soft tissues
      and bone damage. Many treatment programs have been developed, including medication with
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical modalities, and therapeutic exercises. It is
      hypothesized that a hydrotherapy treatment during 8 weeks would benefit patients with knee
      osteoarthritis.
