      injections and then subsequently followed in a treat and extend regimen with extensions by
      two weeks if no signs of disease activity were seen. Hemorrhage, intraretinal macular edema
      or subretinal fluid were considered signs of disease activity. Patients reaching 12-week
      intervals without any evidence of disease activity on three consecutive visits, a BCVA
      between 35-88 letters (Snellen 20/200- 20/20) and a near vision of at least 24 points were
      eligible for study inclusion.

      If there were signs of recurrent disease activity during the follow-up, study participation
      was concluded at that point and intravitreal therapy was resumed. Between scheduled visits
      patients were encouraged to monitor their vision at home using monocular visual assessments
      and were advised to return earlier than planned if symptoms of visual deterioration or
      metamorphopsia occurred. At baseline and at every follow-up visit all patients had a full
      dilated ophthalmic examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images were obtained by
      using the Zeiss Cirrus OCT instrument (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc.,Dublin, Ca). A pigment
      epithelial detachment (PED) was identified as an elevation of the RPE band and included both
      serous and fibrovascular PED. Near vision was tested at 40cm with the addition of +3 dioptres
      to the BCVA refraction. For near vision assessment we used the LIX adult A chart (Ortho-KM,
      Lund, Sweden) graded in typographical points, the largest text being 24 points and the
      smallest 4 points.
