      control groups. The study group (n = 26) included Shen Men, the 7th acupuncture point (HT7)
      of the heart meridian located between the ulna and pisiform bones on the radial side of the
      flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, EX-HN3 (Yintang) located in the middle of the beginning of both
      eyebrows and the thumb and the LI4 points located in the space between the index finger
      (between the 1st and 2nd metacarpal bones of the hand, in the middle of the 2nd metacarpal
      bone on the radial side) will be applied for an average of 10 minutes. No intervention will
      be made to the control group (n = 26). In order to avoid ethical problems, both groups will
      be given an informative training on acupressure and anxiety content at the end of the study.
      The primary outcome of the study is the effect of acupressure on the state anxiety level of
      senior nursing students. The secondary outcome of the study is the effect of acupressure on
      trait anxiety level in senior nursing students. The results will be collected before the
      acupressure and in the 4th week of the last intervention.
