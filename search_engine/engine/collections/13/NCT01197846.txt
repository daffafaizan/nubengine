      in occupational and social domains after (McQueen et al, 2001; Tohen et al, 2000) Ongoing
      depressive symptoms are the strongest predictor of functional deficits in persons with
      bipolar disorder (Bauer et al, 2001; Judd et al, 2005). Depressive subsyndromal symptoms are
      associated to functional impairment in bipolar disorder (Vojta et al, 2001; Altshuler et al,
      2002; Yatham et al, 2004) The addition of olanzapine to valproate or lithium provided
      superior efficacy to valproate or lithium plus placebo in non completely remitted manic and
      mixed bipolar episodes, mainly through a control of depressive symptoms (Tohen et al, 2002)
      Quetiapine has demonstrated to be efficacious in the control of depressive symptoms in
      Bipolar Disorder (BOLDER, EMBOLDEN studies) and in the prevention of recurrences, maintaining
      the patient in YMRS and MADRS scores under the cut-off point between asymptomatic and
      subsyndromal states (Studies 126, 127 and 144) Thus it's expectable that adding quetiapine to
      previous mood stabilizers in bipolar patients with subsyndromal symptoms probably would
      improve their symptoms, mainly depressive, to levels not only of syndromic but of symptomatic
      remission, driving to a better functional status Quetiapine extended release would be used
      because its advantages on quetiapine immediate release regarding an easier and comfortable
      posology and potential better adherence
