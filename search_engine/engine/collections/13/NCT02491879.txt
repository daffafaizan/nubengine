      for emergency department physicians to deal with. Parenteral analgesic is the most common
      drugs for the these patients in emergency department. However, pain killers in gel forms have
      not been studied sufficiently for ceasing the pain of these patients. This study aimed to
      analyse the analgesic effect of ketoprofen gel in patients presented with mechanical low-back
      pain to the emergency department.
