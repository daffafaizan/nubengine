      requires long scanning time. CT is also a useful tool to diagnose spinal stenosis, yet
      interpretation can be time-consuming with high inter-reader variability even among the most
      specialized radiologists. In this study, the investigators aim to develop a deep-learning
      algorithm to automatically detect and classify lumbar spinal stenosis. It would be a
      time-saving workflow if the software can assist the radiologists to detect and locate the
      suspected lesion.
