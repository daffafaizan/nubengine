      curative therapy for a majority of malignant hematologic diseases, especially acute leukemia.
      HSCT from MSD offers the best results for these diseases, but lack of this donor resource has
      restricted its wide application. HSCT from MUD provides another option, but MUDs still cannot
      satisfy all patients due to unsuccessful donor searches. Almost all patients have an
      available related donor with whom they share a single HLA haplotype (ie, haploidentical
      related donor), and it owns the advantage of immediate availability, especially for those who
      urgently need transplantation.The results of transplantation from HRD have improved
      significantly over the past few years. However, the results from such haploidentical
      transplantation have not formally been compared with those of transplantation in patients
      contemporaneously using MSDs and MUDs for hematologic malignancy.
