      may have psychological as well as economic impact on the injured person. Time off work is
      also a burden to the economic system, associated with loss of work days, sick leave and
      national insurance payment. Hand injury can cause limitations in function, therefore
      influence the ability to work. Review of the literature reveals that time off work after hand
      injury ranges from a few days to a year and more. Factors associated with time off work
      include medical, socio-economic and psychosocial factors. Only a few studies have been
      conducted in Israel to investigate rate of RTW after hand injury and factors that affect RTW
      . The aim of this study is to explore the extent of RTW after traumatic hand injury and to
      examine the relationship between several factors - medical, demographic and psychosocial and
      RTW. This, in order to identify prognostic factors that can be treated during rehabilitation.
      There is no preliminary hypothesis made about the relationships between the factors and RTW.
      This study is also retrospective and prospective since it examine individuals under-going
      occupational therapy treatment and individuals who have been treated in the past.
