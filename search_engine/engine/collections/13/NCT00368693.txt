    
      This prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center study will test the
      efficacy of Dermal - Living Skin Replacement (Dermal - LSR) plus standard of care treatment
      against solely the standard of care treatment on participants with diabetic foot ulcers.

      The purpose of this study is to test Dermal - LSR combined with standard treatment. We want
      to see how well it works and the number and types of side effects, if any. We hope to learn
      more about how to heal diabetic foot ulcers better.

        -  have blood drawn

        -  have the ulcer photographed

        -  wear a walking boot to reduce pressure on the ulcer
