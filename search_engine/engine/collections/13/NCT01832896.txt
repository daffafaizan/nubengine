    
      This pilot study is an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study to evaluate the
      tolerability and safety of a single SC administration of ecallantide in up to approximately
      10 pediatric subjects with HAE during an initial acute attack. The study is planned to enroll
      subjects 2 through 15 years of age who present with an acute cutaneous, abdominal, or
      laryngeal HAE attack. No more than 3 study sites will be included until a goal of 10 patients
      is achieved.

      After treatment for an initial attack, one additional open label treatment with ecallantide
      will be offered to subjects contingent upon having been treated previously and presenting
      with a subsequent acute cutaneous, abdominal, or laryngeal attack of HAE at least 7 days
      after initial treatment. Open-label treatment for a second HAE attack will continue until 10
      patients have been treated for an initial attack. Safety evaluations will be performed at
      each subsequent ecallantide-treated attack as for the initial treated attack
