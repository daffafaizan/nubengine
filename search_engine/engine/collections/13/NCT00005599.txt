        -  Determine the complete and partial response rates in patients with unresectable or
           metastatic esophageal cancer or carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction treated with
           sequential paclitaxel and bryostatin 1.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the survival of patients after treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Examine pre- and post-treatment tissue biopsies for markers of apoptosis in selected
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours on day
      2 weekly for 2 weeks. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 1 and 2, and then after every 2
      courses thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
