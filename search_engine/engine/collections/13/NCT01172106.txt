      caregivers. This is especially true for Uganda where cultural beliefs for the causation of
      the illness place blame on supposedly the postpartum mother's promiscuity during pregnancy
      (COX, 1979). Cultural perceptions on the causes of postpartum psychosis may affect the nature
      of social support the mothers perceive from their families when they develop the illness.
      Other perceptions regarding postpartum psychosis in Uganda lay blame on supernatural causes
      like witchcraft.

      Family psychoeducation which sets out to inform families of the nature of the illness is
      called for so as to demystify the illness.
