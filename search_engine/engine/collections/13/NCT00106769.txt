    
      Study Design: This is a Phase I open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune
      response of a recombinant DNA vaccine, VRC-WNVDNA017-00-VP. The hypothesis is that this
      regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to the West Nile
      virus. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of the
      investigational vaccine. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the
      immunogenicity of the study vaccine.

      Product Description: VRC-WNVDNA017-00-VP is composed of a single closed circular DNA plasmid
      that encodes the WNV viral proteins precursor transmembrane (PrM) and envelope (E). Vaccine
      vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered
      intramuscularly (in deltoid muscle) using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management
      System.

      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 50 years old) will be enrolled.

      Study Plan: Fifteen volunteers will be enrolled and receive 3 injections on the schedule
      shown in the schema. The protocol requires nine clinic visits and three telephone follow-up
      contacts.

      Study Duration: 32 weeks clinical follow-up for each participant.

      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the regimen; secondary immunogenicity
      endpoints are an ELISPOT and an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for WNV-specific
      T cell responses and a WNV ELISA assay. The principal timepoints for ICS and ELISPOT are Week
      0 (baseline), Week 8 and Week 12. ICS and ELISPOT at other study timepoints, as well as other
      immunogenicity assays through Week 32, will be completed as exploratory evaluations. Stored
      sera will be tested for WNV neutralizing antibody once an assay is developed.
