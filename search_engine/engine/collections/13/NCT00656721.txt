      treatment of bronchiectasis patients (Van der Shans, 1997). For this purpose, a number of
      techniques has been introduced in the last decades. The Flutter Valve was initially proposed
      for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) (Lindemann, 1992), but there is not
      enough evidence about its utilization in patients with bronchiectasis (Van der Shans & cols,
      1999).

      The effects of the Flutter Valve on respiratory mechanics of patients with bronchiectasis
      have been evaluated by forced spirometry (Pryor e cols, 1994; Gondor e cols, 1999; Thompson e
      cols, 2002). This approach however, does not allow the characterization of mucus
      transportation along the airways (Williams, 1994). The forced oscillation technique (FOT), a
      non-invasive alternative to characterize respiratory mechanics, allows the evaluation of
      respiratory mechanics at different frequencies without special maneuvers (Dubois e cols.,
      1956). According to eligibility criteria and in a randomized order, the patients were
      submitted to two protocols (control and Flutter Valve intervention), with one-week interval
      between them (washout). Respiratory mechanics and expectorated sputum volume were assessed
      before and after each intervention, in order to assess the Flutter Valve effect on
      tracheobronchial sputum removal.
