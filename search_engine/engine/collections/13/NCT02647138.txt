      apartment. The investigators will screen patients during the first meeting using The Mini
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0 (MINI 6.0). At baseline, an Insomnia Severity
      Index will be administered.

      The study will consist of a one week baseline period in which noise levels will be monitored
      using spectral analysis and decibel levels and sleep duration will be recorded using a
      subjective sleep log and wrist actigraphy for objective measurement. At the end of the first
      week an Insomnia Severity Index will be administered.

      During the second week, a treatment period with a white noise machine using a fixed decibel
      level will be installed in the bedrooms of the subjects. The room noise will continue to be
      monitored via spectral analysis as well as decibel levels while the patients are wearing
      actigraphs and keeping a sleep log. At the end of the second week an Insomnia Severity Index
      will be administered.

      During the third week, the white noise machine will be removed and the rooms will still be
      monitored for sound via spectral analysis and decibel levels and the subject will wear an
      actigraph and keep a sleep log. At the end of the third week an Insomnia Severity Index will
      be administered.

      The investigators will use Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline vs. white noise to
      analyze differences. The investigators will use an Acute Noise Index, in which noise spikes
      of 2 standard deviations from the mean of the entire nights decibel levels count as a noise
      event.

      Noise levels in subjects bedroom will be collected throughout the study along with subjects
      sleep activity using an actigraph and sleep log.
