      hypoalbuminemia, electrolytic disturbances or organ failure. The lymphatic circulation cannot
      be summarized by the Starling's equation and obstruction cannot explain everything. An
      interstitial hypothesis underlines the role of the lymphatic pump and edema volume can be a
      crucial point. The SDO, via the direct liquid removal, can restore the lymphatic pump
      function. This volumetric effect can explain the long time effect of the SDO and the large
      range of liquid amount reported in effective SDO. The superficial lymphatic system, in the
      superficial layer of derma, drains 80 % of lymph flow. In edema, the increased volume leads
      to the creation of subcutaneous interconnected lacunas. The subcutaneous site for drainage is
      justified.

      After topic anesthesia, three subcutaneous channels are created on the ankle's medial face of
      the edematous limbs and liquids are absorbed by pads. An additional drainage can be done on
      the external face of the thigh with liquid collecting bags in bedridden patients.

      The study includes clinical examination, total and segmental bioelectrical impedance measured
      at J0, J4 and on exit or at J7 at the latest and daily weight, umbilic abdominal perimeters
      and segmental circumferences and QOL evaluation before and after SDO. Bioelectrical impedance
      is collected from hand-foot, thigh root-foot and under patella calf - foot electrodes.
      Segmental circumferences are collected at thigh, calf and ankle points identified from bone
      relief distance.
