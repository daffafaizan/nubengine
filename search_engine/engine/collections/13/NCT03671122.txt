      follow-up by standardized protocols for clinical evaluation, echocardiography, and ECG. In
      one subset undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery (n = 100) and classified according to
      LV function, myocardial biopsies will be collected during surgery, and cardiac magnetic
      resonance (CMR) imaging will be performed at baseline and after 1 year. Blood and tissue
      samples will be stored in a biobank.We will characterize and compare new-onset HFpEF and
      HFrEF patients regarding clinical findings and cardiac imaging, genomics, proteomics, and
      transcriptomics from blood and cardiac biopsies, and by established biomarkers of fibrosis,
      inflammation, haemodynamics, haemostasis, and thrombosis. The data will be explored by
      state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to investigate gene expression patterns, sequence
      variation, DNA methylation, and post-translational modifications, and using systems biology
      approaches including pathway and network analysis.In this epidemiological HF study with
      biopsy studies in a subset of patients, we aim to identify new biomarkers of disease
      progression and to find pathophysiological mechanisms to support explorations of new
      treatment regimens for HFpEF.
