      components of air pollution responsible for these cardiovascular effects are unknown but
      small combustion-derived particles are suspected to be the major cause. Using a unique
      exposure system in Ume√• Sweden, we have demonstrated that healthy volunteers who inhale
      dilute diesel exhaust develop an impairment of two important, highly relevant and
      complementary aspects of vascular function: the regulation of vascular tone and endogenous
      fibrinolysis. We have recently extended these findings and have shown that brief exposure to
      dilute diesel exhaust promotes myocardial ischemia and inhibits endogenous fibrinolytic
      capacity in patients with stable asymptomatic coronary heart disease. We now wish to extend
      these findings to patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. In particular, we wish to
      determine the functional impact of diesel exhaust inhalation as well as describe the time
      course and minimum exposure that can induce these detrimental effects.
