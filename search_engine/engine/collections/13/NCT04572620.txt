      conditions with associated immune dysfunctions. Though severe recurrent/chronic infections
      are the main cause of mortality and morbidity in PID, immune dysregulation manifesting with
      oncological and autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions involving various organs and
      systems have been the focus of research in the recent years.

      The interstitial lymphocytic lung disease (ILLD) is one of the recently characterized
      non-malignant PID complications. Immune dysregulation in ILLD causes reactive
      bronchi-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) hyperplasia that manifests in several
      pathomorphological forms: follicular bronchiolitis (FB), nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH),
      and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). Treatment of ILLD patients with various
      immunosuppressive drugs leads to inconsistent results ranging from partial\transient effect
      to no effect at all and has been often associated with adverse effects and an increase in
      infections' rate. Therefore there is a need for targeted therapy of ILLD. In small cohorts of
      adult PID patients rituximab in combination with azathioprine proved to be effective. Yet,
      the reports are scarce and there is currently no consensus on ILLD treatment, especially in
      children.

      The study will collect and analyze information on the effectiveness and safety of ILLD
      monotherapy with rituximab or abatacept, chosen predominantly based on the pathomorphological
      characteristics of lymphoid infiltration, as well as genetic defects, in a cohort of
      pediatric patients with PID.
