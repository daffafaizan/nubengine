      invasive treatment options for these lesions is seen as they come with several advantages
      compared to partial nephrectomy. Current guidelines state that patients with a small renal
      mass unfit to undergo surgery, should be considered for minimal invasive ablative treatment.
      Although percutaneous cryoablation is shown to be a safe and effective therapy for SRM, there
      is no consensus on post procedural follow up imaging which should be aimed at evaluation of
      therapeutic effect of the intervention and the early detection of residual and recurrent
      disease. Also interpretation of conventional contrast enhanced imaging (CT and MRI) during
      follow up can be very challenging due to contrast enhancement not necessarily indicating
      residual or recurrent disease.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of early evaluation of the
      therapeutic effect by performing early follow up imaging after percutaneous MR-guided
      cryoablation of pT1a renal cell carcinoma 111In-Girentuximab-DOTA SPECT CT imaging.

      Therefore, before cryoablation, a targeting 111In-Girentuximab-DOTA SPECT CT scan is
      performed. Additional functional 111In-Girentuximab-DOTA SPECT CT scan 4-6 weeks after
      percutaneous MR-guided cryoablation of small renal masses is performed. The latter will take
      place in case of proven targeting on the pre procedural 111In-Girentuximab-DOTA SPECT CT
      scan. Standard 1 and 3 months follow up MRI after treatment is performed.
