      I. Feasibility and optimization of thoracic duct identification using indocyanine green (ICG)
      lymphangiography.

      II. To explore specifically how identifying the thoracic duct (TD) will prevent injury
      intra-operatively.

      III. To understand if a TD injury can be recognized by leakage of fluorescent chyle into the
      operating field.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive indocyanine green solution subcutaneously (SC) and undergo near-infrared
      imaging over 1-2 minutes during their standard of care neck surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 1 year.
