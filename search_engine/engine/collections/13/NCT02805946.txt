      offers new treatment possibilities, specifically in patients previously unable to attain
      adequate exposure to posaconazole solution. To the opinion of the researchers, only limited
      data are available on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the new formulations of posaconazole,
      however, these use strictly selected patients or healthy volunteers, but more importantly,
      specific aspects related to the PK remain unsolved. Despite the fact that adequate exposure
      is attained using the new solid oral formulation, it is hypothesized that oral
      bioavailability of posaconazole may be impacted during mucositis. Whether mucosal barrier
      injury impacts the absorption of posaconazole or alters presystemic clearance is still
      unknown. Therefore, it seems prudent to conduct a trial in a group of patients that will
      experience a severe degree of mucositis to identify changes in absorption of posaconazole and
      resolving the impact of various stages of mucositis on the PK of posaconazole by linking PK
      of posaconazole to markers of mucositis (citrulline). This research may also serve as a model
      for other drugs and allows for direct translations in improving patient care. For this
      purpose it is needed to determine the PK using both IV and PO dosing of posaconazole.
