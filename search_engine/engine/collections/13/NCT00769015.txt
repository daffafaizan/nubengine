      the U.S. and affects more than 10 million people. One third of patients with AMD become
      clinically depressed when they lose the ability to pursue valued activities. Because their
      depression is disabling and unlikely to be treated, preventing depression in AMD is a public
      health imperative as the population ages.

      We will recruit 200 subjects who have bilateral AMD and subthreshold depressive symptoms.
      Their bilateral vision loss and subthreshold depressive symptoms increase their risk to
      develop more severe depressive disorders and functional decline. We will randomize eligible
      subjects to collaborative Low Vision Rehabilitation (LVR) (optometrist and home-based OT) or
      enhanced LVR (optometrist and home-based Supportive Therapy). In this study, usual care LVR
      is enhanced with Supportive Therapy (ST), which is a standardized placebo psychological
      treatment that controls for attention.

      Many older persons with AMD understandably become depressed when their vision loss prevents
      them from pursuing valued goals. This necessitates a disease management strategy that
      combines treatment for vision loss and depression. Because depression in AMD is rarely
      treated, preventing depression is more sensible than waiting to treat it after diagnosis or
      failing to treat it at all. As the population ages and more people are affected with AMD,
      finding ways to prevent depression and improve daily functioning has great public health
      importance. For these reasons, the VITAL Trial has high clinical significance to patients
      with AMD, and wider public health significance as our society confronts the challenge of
      caring for the growing population of older adults with chronic disabilities.
