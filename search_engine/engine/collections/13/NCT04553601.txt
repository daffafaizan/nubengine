      biopsy of primary and distant metastatic tumors. The LIFEx package was used to extract PET
      and CT radiomic features from primary and metastatic lesions. The radiomic ROI sites of
      primary and distant metastatic tumors were point-to-point corresponding to the PET/ CT-guided
      targeted biopsy sites. Whole exon sequencing of primary and distant metastatic tumor samples
      obtained by PET/CT-guided targeted biopsy was used to get genomic data of primary and distant
      metastatic tumor. Predictive radiogenomics models were established and validation.
