      responses, resulting therapeutic gain, as a result of a higher dose of radiation delivered to
      the tumor volume without incurring a higher gastrointestinal toxicity to the patient or
      surgical complications later, thanks to the use of intensity modulated radiotherapy
      (concomitant boost technique) that allows us to significantly reduce the administered dose
      organs at risk.
