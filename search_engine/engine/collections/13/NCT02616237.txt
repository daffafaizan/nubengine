      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The regular physical activity, healthy diet and social
      support have been shown to be beneficial for weight loss.

      This is a two-arm parallel design randomized controlled trial for 6 months. Participants who
      completed the baseline assessment will be randomly allocated, after stratified by gender, to
      either a control group or Facebook-based intervention group. The control group will receive
      information on healthy eating, physical activity, obesity and cancer via three government
      printed health pamphlets. In addition to the government health pamphlets, the intervention
      group will receive a programme delivered through Facebook.

      The interventions include participation in a private research group on Facebook for health
      education, self monitoring and social support. Participants will receive 12 weekly lessons
      related to nutrition, physical activity, Chinese food therapy, acupressure, weight loss. A
      registered nutritionist and a registered Chinese medicine practitioner will join the Facebook
      group as health partners. Both of them are also registered nurses.

      Data collection will be carried out at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Each time, both
      groups will complete online questionnaires and attend in-person anthropometric measurements
