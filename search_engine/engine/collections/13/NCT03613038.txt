      tracking of articulatory performance in progressive dysarthrias. The short-term goal of the
      proposed cross-sectional study is to focus on ALS and PD and quantify articulatory kinematic
      performance as a function of phonetic complexity, which is experimentally manipulated based
      on theoretical principles of speech motor development. The research strategy is to use 3D
      electromagnetic articulography to examine phonetic complexity effects of single word stimuli
      at the articulatory kinematic level in 15 talkers each with preclinical, mild, and moderate
      dysarthria, relative to 45 controls. The central hypothesis is that as dysarthria severity
      increases the discrepancy in articulatory performance, indexed by movement speed, distance,
      coordination, and variability, between people with dysarthria and typical controls will
      significantly increase at a lower phonetic complexity level.
