      I. To assess the performance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in detection of ovarian cancer in
      a clinical setting and to help improve the design of the next generation hand held PAI probe.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate vasculature and oxygen saturation in lesions based on PAI-measurements.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo PAI over 15-30 minutes prior to the ovarian excision.
