      busulfan/cyclophosphamide on engraftment, incidence of posttransplant relapse, incidence and
      severity of graft versus host disease (GVHD), and incidence and severity of nonGVHD
      posttransplant complications in patients with acute or chronic leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome who are eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplants from HLA
      identical/compatible donors but who cannot or should not receive total body irradiation as
      part of their cytoreductive regimen.

      OUTLINE: 2-Drug Combination Cytoreductive Chemotherapy followed by Bone Marrow Transplant
      with, as indicated, CNS Prophylaxis. Busulfan, BU, NSC-750; Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271;
      followed by Allogeneic Bone Marrow, AlBM; with, as indicated, Intrathecal Cytarabine, IT
      ARA-C, NSC-63878.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
