      cesarean section, the post spinal hypotension remains the most frequent complication of this
      procedure and is still responsible of considerable maternel and fetal morbidity. It is
      recommanded to prevent this post spinal hypotension with fluid coloading and prophylactic
      vasopressors administration. The prophylactic use of norepinephrin and phenylephrin has been
      validated by several studies, but few data are published concerning the comparaison between
      norepinephrin and ephedrine as preventive vasopressors in cesarean section; these molecules
      act on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and could provide better maternal hemodynamics in
      parturients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficency and the safety of norepinephrin and
      ephedrin prophylactic administration to reduce the incidence of post spinal hypotension in
      cesarean section.
