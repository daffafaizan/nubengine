    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, open label Phase 1 study to assess the
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy trends to applying NVS therapy to de
      novo lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and the proximal popliteal artery (PPA)
      during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with life-style limiting
      claudication due to obstructive SFA and proximal popliteal artery atherosclerosis. Each
      investigator will receive supervised training for each procedure.

      Eligibility to participate in the study is determined during the screening period and prior
      to the index procedure with the NVS therapy. Study Data will be analyzed through the Day 365
      follow-up visit.
