    
      Participants will be contacted by the Patient Outreach Center (POC) on an annual basis to
      complete a questionnaire about the occurrence of AESI, as defined in the Outcome Measure
      section.

      The questionnaire will be completed directly by the participant (via a secure web based
      platform) or will be administered via telephone by a POC staff member. In the event of the
      occurrence of a AESI, study participant will be encouraged to contact the POC as soon as
      possible, rather than wait for the annual questionnaire completion. Follow up data is
      inclusive of the 1 year in the core trial, 4 years in the long term follow up trial and 10
      years in this long term safety follow up. Participation for United Kingdom participants will
      be life-long.
