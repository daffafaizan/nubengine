      series of nutrition education (individual and group) specifically tailored to fit their needs
      (based on our preliminary findings), they increase the consumption of foods that have
      antiinflammatory properties, which will result in lower levels of inflammatory cytokines in
      the body (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP ), interleukin (IL) -2, IL-4 and IL-6),
      and consequently reduce the intensity of pain. Also, weight loss in obese patients is
      expected, and it will have an contributing effect of the intervention. Patient's quality of
      life and indicators of their psychophysical condition (eg, depression level) are also
      expected to improve.

      Chronic pain patients who either attend Daily clinic (Control Arm) or the 4-week
      multidisciplinary programme at the Department of Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive
      Care (Intervention Arm) will be recruited. They will be followed for total of 8 weeks (4 week
      intervention + 4 week follow-up).
