      complications, advantages of PA in Diabetes control, how to include more PA in routine life
      style 2. pamphlets.All these were standardised. Physical activity was measured using
      international physical activity questionnaire validated(responsiveness& reliability) for our
      cultural activity.IPAQ covers four domains of physical activity: work-related,transportation,
      housework/gardening and leisure-time activity. PA data from the questionnaire were
      transformed into energy expenditure estimates as MET using published values. To calculate the
      weekly physical activity (MET-h /week), the number of hours dedicated to each activity class
      was multiplied by the specific MET score for that activity.

      follow up once in a month (4 times) measure incremental physical activity and reinforcement
      in each visit. Students t test was used to compare the experimental and control groups with
      respect to the incremental physical activity measured in calorie expenditure. It was found
      that the incremental physical activity(final-basal) measured in METS is significantly higher
      in intervention group.
