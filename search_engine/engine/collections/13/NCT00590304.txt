      and low-income children. Current pediatric asthma research in this high-risk group focuses on
      children living in inner-city environments. Low-income, minority children with asthma from
      non-urban locales have not been studied extensively. The specific aims of the study will
      examine the impact of home environmental exposure to endotoxin on asthma severity and atopy
      status in the rural setting among predominately African American, low-income asthmatics. This
      study will answer several research questions. The first question involves the relationship
      between asthma severity and exposure to endotoxin among rural children at high risk for
      increased morbidity and mortality. Second, the relationship between atopy and endotoxin
      exposure has been the subject of recent debates among asthma researchers. The hygiene
      hypothesis suggest that the recent rise in atopic disease in Westernized societies is due to
      decreased microbial burden. Last data on atopy and aeroallergen exposure among high-risk
      rural asthmatics will be critical in the design and implementation of future intervention
      programs.
