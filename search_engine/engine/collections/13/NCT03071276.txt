    
      After the recommended Phase II dose was determined, additional patients began enrolling to
      receive selinexor at the recommended dose level for further evaluation of tolerability and
      response.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the overall response rate, as defined by complete response or complete
           response with incomplete count recovery, of selinexor in combination with fludarabine
           and cytarabine for patients with relapsed or refractory AML in the phase II portion of
           the study.
