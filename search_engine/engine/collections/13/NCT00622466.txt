      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib tosylate and paclitaxel by measuring tumor
           response, as defined by RECIST criteria, in patients with metastatic, HER2-negative
           breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate six-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate clinical benefit rate (tumor response and stable disease) at 24 weeks in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To examine the relationship of gene expression and tissue/serum protein markers, where
           available, related to response to therapy focusing on growth factor receptor pathways.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28 and paclitaxel IV over 1
      hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
