    
      This is a prospective, observational cohort study to assess the frequency with which
      neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
      recipients are colonized with fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacterales (FQRE) and the
      clinical impact of FQRE colonization.

      The investigator will collect perianal swabs from patients receiving induction chemotherapy
      for acute leukemia or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), and who are
      receiving fluoroquinolone (FQ) prophylaxis. FQRE colonization will be assessed by culture,
      and the investigator will correlate FQRE colonization with the risk of Gram-negative
      bacteremia during neutropenia.

      Population: 410 adults with acute leukemia who are receiving induction chemotherapy and HCT
      recipients who are receiving FQ prophylaxis during neutropenia.

      Results of this study will be combined with a portion of subject data from an
      identically-designed R01-funded study of FQRE colonization.
