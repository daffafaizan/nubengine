      blood thinners. Suitable and consenting patients are randomized to one of the two regimens.
      They will either stop warfarin for 5 days and replace it with injections of LMWH for 3 days
      before pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) surgery. The other group
      will have the dose of warfarin reduced to half for 3-6 days before surgery, depending on how
      thin their blood is. For all patients the degree of blood thinning is checked the day before
      surgery. If the blood is still to thin, the patient is instructed to take by mouth a dose of
      vitamin K, provided by us, to reduce the effect of warfarin. After surgery the patients
      restart warfarin at a double dose for 1 or 2 days to quickly reach the therapeutic effect
      again. Staff from the Pacemaker or Defibrillator Clinic, unaware of the treatment allocation,
      examines the patient for bleeding in the implantation pocket before they leave the hospital,
      and at routine follow-up after 2-3 weeks and 90 days.
