      aggregation and are used commonly to prevent recurrent CHD events. Two of the most common
      anti-platelet agents are aspirin and clopidogrel. However, up to 25% to 30% of people do not
      respond to these medications. Evidence indicates that treatment response may be related to
      genetics. The purpose of this study is to determine specific gene variants that predict
      response to aspirin and clopidogrel therapy.

      This study is part of a larger group of studies called the Pharmacogenomics Research Network
      (PGRN). Participants will include the Old Order Amish of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. They are
      well suited for genetic studies because they are a homogenous, closed, founder population.
      Participants will receive 300 mg of clopidogrel on the first day, then 75 mg of clopidogrel
      per day for the next 6 days. On the last day of clopidogrel treatment, participants will take
      a single dose of 324 mg aspirin. Participants will undergo platelet function tests before and
      after clopidogrel alone, and then again after taking clopidogrel plus aspirin. Using the gene
      variation profiles across the genome, researchers will analyze which genes correspond to
      treatment response.
