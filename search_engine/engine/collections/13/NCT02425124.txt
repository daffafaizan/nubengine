      world and the second leading cause of death in Africa. Estimates by the WHO using disability
      adjusted life years (DALYs) suggest that NCDs were responsible for 28% of the total burden of
      disease in South Africa in 2004, with heart disease, diabetes and stroke together being
      responsible for the second most important cause of death in adult South Africans. In the
      investigators 2014 survey of 3 primary health care facilities in the North West Province
      where the Department of Health is piloting Integrated Chronic Disease Management the
      investigators found that of the 1 250 chronic care patients surveyed, 51% reported having
      hypertension. Spurring the rising burden of NCDs are mental disorders. One in 6 adults
      experience a common mental disorder (depression, anxiety disorders and substance use
      disorders) within a 12 month period (Herman et al., 2009), one in four receive treatment of
      any kind (Seedat et al., 2009). Depression co-exists with NCDs having a mutually reinforcing
      relationship compromising both prevention and treatment through exacerbating modifiable risk
      factors and compromising adherence and self-care respectively. Objectives: The investigators
      propose to strengthen the Primary Care 101 guidelines. This is a set of clinical guidelines
      and decision support for nurses developed for the identification and management of multiple
      chronic diseases.
