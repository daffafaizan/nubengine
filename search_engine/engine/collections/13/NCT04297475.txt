      allowed real-time imaging of grey-scale US imaging, Color-Doppler US (CDUS) imaging and
      dual-wavelength PA imaging. The PA/US images were acquired using a hand-held probe integrated
      optical devices and US transducers. 3D volume data of the selected joint of each participant
      was collected using an automatic scanning device after the dual-modal imaging. The
      investigators plan to recruit RA patients from the outpatient department of Rheumatology of
      our hospital, who have been diagnosed as RA by experienced rheumatologists. The patients and
      healthy volunteers will receive multi-modal imaging examinations using the novel imaging
      system. The MCP 2 and 3, PIP 2 and 3, and wrist of bilateral hand were chosen for the
      multi-modal imaging. Conventional US scanning of the joints, including grey-scale US, CDUS,
      and PDUS, will be carried out by an experienced US operator. Afterwards, 2D and 3D PA/US
      imaging will be implemented for each joint by the same operator. All of the imaging data will
      be analysed by the Matlab software.
