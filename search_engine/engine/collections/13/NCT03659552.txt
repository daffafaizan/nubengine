    
      The Lungpacer Jugular Access Feasibility System is a prototype for the Lungpacer Diaphragm
      Pacing Therapy System (DPTS) and consists of the LIVE Catheter, a stimulation system with a
      Multipole Panel Accessory, an airflow sensor and a Heart Rate Data Capture Device. The
      catheter is intended for inclusion in the commercial product. The stimulation system with a
      Multipole Panel Accessory and a Heart Rate Data Capture Device is an interim component
      created to enable initial safety and feasibility testing of the Lungpacer DPTS concept.
