    
      This is a three-arm study of ME-401 alone, of ME-401 in combination with rituximab, and of
      ME-401 in combination with zanubrutinib in subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL or B
      cell NHL. The 3 arms of the study will be conducted in parallel, with subject allocation to
      ME-401 alone, ME-401 plus rituximab, or ME-401 plus zanubrutinib based on disease type and
      availability of an open enrollment slot.
