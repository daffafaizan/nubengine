      of KT (K-Taping®) on the gastrocnemius muscle and the muscles of the midfoot. The placebo
      tape group (PTG) was composed of 31 participants that received the application of a placebo
      tape (3M Micropore®) on the same muscles of both limbs. The order of application of KT tape
      and placebo was conducted randomly among the elderly. Before the tape applying the site was
      cleaned with 70% ethanol for better fixation of the tape and for both groups were determined
      the application technique in "I" shaped. This technique consist in placing two tapes that
      format. The first tape was placed along the length of the plantar aponeurosis fixed point in
      the middle third of the medial gastrocnemius muscle to the metatarsal phalangeal joint. The
      second tape was also applied in "I" shaped without fixed point was placed around the midfoot
      arch in the direction of tension lines to assist with the metatarsal arch support.
