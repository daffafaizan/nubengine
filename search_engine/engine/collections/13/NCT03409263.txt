      main cause for most complications and deaths of patients with liver cirrhosis. Implantation
      of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) leads to instantaneous alleviation
      of portal hypertension, but may cause hepatic encephalopathy. Stent grafts, as well as
      patient stratification and medical surveillance, have drastically improved over the past
      decades. However, there are few data on long-term outcome after TIPS implantation.This
      prospective registry study will assess the clinical course of patients after undergoing TIPS
      intervention and biomarkers for complications after TIPS implantation.
