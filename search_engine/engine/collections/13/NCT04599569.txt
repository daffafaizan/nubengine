      recommend that measurement of energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry should be
      favoured in critically ill patients. The technique is based on measurement of oxygen
      consumption and carbon dioxide elimination. Experimental studies have reported on carbon
      dioxide elimination via renal replacement therapy. Since acute kidney injury with requirement
      for renal replacement therapy (RRT) is common in the intensive care unit, the significance of
      carbon dioxide elimination via the dialyser should be clarified. However, available evidence
      from clinical studies is contradictory, one reason being the heterogenous study design.

      In this prospective observational study on critically ill mechanically ventilated medical
      patients requiring RRT, indirect calorimetry (IC) will be conducted twice on the same day
      with and without RRT: either immediately before commencement of RRT followed by a second IC
      with RRT after an RRT run time of an hour, or immediately before the end of an RRT session
      followed by a second IC an hour after the termination of RRT.
