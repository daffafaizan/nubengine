      threshold inspiratory muscle strength training device, 5 days per week. The inspiratory
      muscle training is conducted at the highest pressure setting tolerated by the patients. The
      Sham groups uses an inspiratory muscle trainer that does not increase inspiratory muscle
      strength. Both the treated and Sham groups participate in progressively lengthening periods
      of breathing without ventilator as tolerated. Patients are considered weaned when they can
      breathe for 72 consecutive hours without any ventilator support.
