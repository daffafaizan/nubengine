      Theoretically, dietary supplementation of creatine nitrate during resistance training can
      improve the quality of training leading to greater changes in strength, power and fat free
      mass. Endothelial function measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a non-invasive vascular
      health parameter that can be measured via ultrasonography, is a predictor of cardiovascular
      disease risk which precedes traditional risk markers. Diet, physical activity and
      pharmaceutical interventions can all impact vascular function and health. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the acute vascular response of creatine nitrate supplementation on FMD
      by analyzing the pharmacokinetics of creatine nitrate supplementation.
