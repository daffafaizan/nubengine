      all clinically recognized pregnancies result in spontaneous loss, there are many more
      pregnancies that fail prior to being clinically recognized. Only 30% of all conceptions
      result in a live birth.

      Although no reliable published data have estimated the probability of finding an etiology for
      recurrent pregnancy loss in a population with 2 versus 3 or more miscarriages, the best
      available data suggest that the risk of miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies is 30% after 2
      losses, compared with 33% after 3 losses among patients without a history of a live birth.
      This strongly suggests a role for evaluation after just 2 losses in patients with no prior
      live births. An earlier evaluation may be further indicated if fetal cardiac activity was
      identified prior to a loss .
