      problematic as atrial fibrillation that presents itself with symptoms. The objective of the
      study is to establish the feasibility of tracking the total incidence of atrial fibrillation
      in the peri-operative period, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic events, using an
      ambulatory heart monitor. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the overall incidence of
      peri- and post-operative atrial fibrillation. These will be accomplished through usage of
      iRhythm ZIO XT, a small pebble shaped device that will be adhered to the patient's chest for
      14 days before and after surgery, to measure how often atrial fibrillation occurs.
