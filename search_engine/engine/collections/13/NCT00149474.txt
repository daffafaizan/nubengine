      We propose a five-year Demonstration and Education project to assess the incremental value of
      peak flow monitoring (PFM) over symptom monitoring (SM) as a management tool for asthma
      control in adults greater than or equal to 50 years with moderate-severe asthma. We will
      develop three parallel asthma education programs for older adults using as our base an
      existing asthma education program (AIR/Kaiser Adult Education Program) of demonstrated
      efficacy for adults ,50 years of age.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Primary outcome Frequency and cost of health care utilization for asthma, and asthma-specific
      quality of life

      Key secondary outcomes Prebronchodilator FEV1; diurnal variability in PEF

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
