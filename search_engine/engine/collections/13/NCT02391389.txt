      for consent. When the infant is delivered, members of the neonatology team will be at the
      mother's side and will provide initial steps of resuscitation (position, suction, stimulate)
      per guidelines of the Neonatology Resuscitation Program (NRP). At 30 seconds after birth, the
      infant will receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if breathing well, or positive
      pressure ventilation (PPV) if not breathing well. At 90 seconds, the umbilical cord will be
      cut and the remainder of the resuscitation and stabilization will be carried out in the usual
      location.
