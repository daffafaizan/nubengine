      techniques : repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct
      electrical current (tDCS) of the motor cortex in patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy
      on average pain intensity. This will be a sham controlled crossover design : patients will be
      randomized to receive either active rTMS or tDCS during 3 consecutive days followed by the
      alternative treatment within 3 weeks apart, or sham rTMS or tDCS during 3 consecutive dats
      followed by the alternative treatment within 3 weeks apart. The investigator will be blind to
      the treatment. Assessments will be performed before each treatment, then 1 hour after the end
      of the third day session, then 2 days and 1 week after the stimulation. Assessments will
      include pain questionnaires, quality of life, anxiety and depression, catastrophizing and
      evaluation of treatment effect on experimental pain using Quantitative sensory testing.
