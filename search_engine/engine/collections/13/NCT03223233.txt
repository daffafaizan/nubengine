      showed that serum procalcitonin levels are more sensitive than serum CRP levels.The
      investigators aimed to assess its predictive value in terms of post-cesarean wound infection.
      The serum procalcitonin levels are aimed to measure in participants who had cesarean section
      and developed surgical site infection. The investigators aimed to compare the serum
      procalcitonin levels between the patients who need secondary suture and the patients who did
      not need secondary suture.
