    
      The study will be conducted as a pre-post single-arm feasibility study comprising 50
      participants.

      The main objective of the study will be to evaluate the feasibility of the web-based,
      peer-supported exercise intervention in patients with hip and/or knee OA.

      Specific research objectives are:

        -  to assess feasibility of intervention delivery, data collection, eligibility and
           inclusion/exclusion criteria and intervention fidelity

        -  to assess the responsiveness of relevant primary and secondary outcome measures

      In the feasibility study, all participants will be allocated to an intervention group,
      receiving a 12-week web-based, peer-supported aerobic exercise program including weekly
      motivational messages. Patients between 40 and 80 years of age that are not candidates for
      surgery will be recruited from Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

      To assess and evaluate feasibility, we will report on descriptive statistics. Responsiveness
      will be assessed using Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analyses.
