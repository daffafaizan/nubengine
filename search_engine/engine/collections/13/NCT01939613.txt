      multiple-system organ failure with life-threatening complications.Over time, several
      resuscitation formulae have been proposed to guide burn resuscitation and the best known ones
      are Parkland and Evans formulae. The main controversy between the two formulae also focuses
      on whether to infuse the colloid in the first 24 h.Controversy continues and the conflicting
      results left many clinicians unsure about the effect of colloids on fluid resuscitation in
      extensive burn patients who suffer higher risk of hypovolaemia, abdominal compartment
      syndrome (ACS), multiple organs dysfunction and mortality. To address this uncertainty, we
      conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare fluid resuscitation
      in extensive burns guided by Parkland formulae with TMMU formulae as a modified Evans formula
      routinely used in China.
