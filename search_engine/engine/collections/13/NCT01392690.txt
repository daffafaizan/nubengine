      "Dominique's Handy Tricks" for anxiety disorders in children aged 9 to 12 years of age. This
      cognitive-behavioural program is delivered using a combination of story-based books and
      workshop sessions. The originality of the program comes from the use of story books that were
      not developed for anxiety management specifically. Every session is based on a story
      describing characters facing common stressors in childhood and how they managed to cope with
      their daily problems. In our randomized control trial with 46 children, participation in the
      program lead to a significant improvement in coping skills, self-efficacy, anxiety
      sensitivity, signs of anxiety and phobic avoidance. The theoretical and practical elements
      underlying the delivery of this primary prevention programs are described. It is suggested
      that such an approach, without any labelling specific to anxiety disorders, can be useful in
      universal primary prevention programs.
