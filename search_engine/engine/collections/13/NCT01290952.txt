      directed to highly selected and relatively low risk surgical patients. Since then there has
      been a growing body of evidence suggesting many potential advantages of the OPCAB technique
      over the conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) technique in different groups of high-risk
      patients.

      On-off study is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, parallel, trial.Patients indicated
      for elective or urgent isolated coronary artery bypass graft with additive European System
      for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation â‰¥ 6 were enrolled. Patients in cardiogenic shock were
      excluded. Patients were randomly assigned either to coronary artery bypass surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass (ON arm) or to off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OFF arm). The
      composite primary end point included operative mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke,
      renal failure, re-operation for bleeding and adult respiratory distress syndrome, within 30
      days after surgery. The total planned sample size was 693 patients; the actual number of
      enrolled patients was 411,according to the results of the interim analysis scheduled at 400
      enrollments (alfa-spending=0.029, Pocock method).
