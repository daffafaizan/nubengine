      Primary

        -  Compare response rates in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer
           treated with two different treatment schedules of pemetrexed disodium and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Compare time-to-event efficacy variables in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the overall toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease stage (IIIB vs IV) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
           to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 9
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
