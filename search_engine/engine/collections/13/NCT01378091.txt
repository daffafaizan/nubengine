      medication available to help treat this disease, which typically lengthens life by 10 to 12
      months. More recent studies have shown average survivals of 20 to 23 months.

      The investigators hope that the experimental (research) drug called lenalidomide (RevlimidÂ®),
      which is being used in this study, will lengthen the lives of these patients by even more
      time. A different drug in the same drug family has demonstrated activity against a variety of
      solid tumors as well as hematological malignances. It works against cancer in different ways
      than chemotherapy by affecting the immune system (the body's ability to naturally fight
      disease).

      The investigators believe that the study drug helps build up patients' immune systems than
      some of the other popular drugs on the market, and may potentially increase survival rates
      for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.
