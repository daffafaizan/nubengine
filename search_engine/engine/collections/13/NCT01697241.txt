      patients. Recent studies indicate non-surgical interventions being effective in reducing pain
      and disability also at later stages of disease when hip replacement is considered. Possible,
      non-surgical treatments can be used to postpone hip replacement. The effect of education and
      supervised exercise on time to hip replacement is largely unknown
