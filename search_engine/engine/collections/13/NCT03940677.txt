    
      The investigators will use 4 different approaches in parallel:

        1. detailed clinical evaluation using the current available validated clinical scales and
           the Dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging;

        2. anatomical and perfusional brain evaluation using functional MRI;

        3. cortical brain mapping and transcranial magnetic stimulation assessment using a
           robotized approach;

        4. emotional responses study using a novel paradigm. These 4 modalities will be assessed at
           baseline, 1 year and 2 years follow-up.

      The investigators will integrate these 4 analysis using a mathematical paradigm in order to
      define specific phenotype of disease and disease progression.
