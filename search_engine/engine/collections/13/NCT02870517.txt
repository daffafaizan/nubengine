      Reduction of stress associated with surgery is even more important in children, for whom a
      traumatic experience can have even more damaging and long-lasting effects (2). One
      stress-reduction technique of current interest is music. In global studies outside of the
      surgical realm, music has been shown to reduce heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate,
      and stress hormone levels as well as alleviate anxiety (3).

      Evidence has also been found that listening to music pre-operatively in both adult and
      pediatric cases can reduce patients' stress and anxiety levels before surgery (3,7) Of the
      studies that have addressed the benefits of pre-operative music, however, none have assessed
      the impact of pre-operative music on stress levels during induction. In addition, almost all
      prior studies of the benefits of perioperative music have assessed the effect of only one
      style of music on each patient group. This set-up is beneficial in eliminating variables
      within the study design, but it fails to consider the individuality of each patient and what
      he/she might find to be relaxing. This study aims to assess the effect of music (selected by
      the pediatric patient from one of several pre-compiled playlists) played pre-operatively and
      during induction on patient stress levels.
