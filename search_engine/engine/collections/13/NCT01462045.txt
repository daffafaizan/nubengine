      exercise-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom reduction and exercise-induced
      changes in cortisol level. The participants consist of nurses and the intervention will be
      conducted at the Clinical and Translational Science Center of the University of New Mexico.
      The study was approved by the Human Research Protections Office of the university. Nurses who
      are screened positively for PTSD will be randomly assigned to either control or exercise
      group. At baseline and in weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16, immediately after the phlebotomy for serum
      cortisol, the investigators will ask the participants to rate the severity of their PTSD
      symptoms using the PTSD Checklist (PCL).
