      significant concern that peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients can become progressively
      fluid-loaded with time on treatment, especially as residual kidney function declines. Body
      Composition Monitor (BCM) has the potential to enable better management of fluid balance. The
      investigators undertake a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled trial to determine
      whether availability of longitudinal BCM measures help clinicians maintain stable fluid
      status over 24 months in 300 peritoneal dialysis patients.
