    
      Patients with a Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy-induced corneal edema and an ODM 5 therapy
      recommendation prior to their inclusion will be observed in normal practice setting in this
      post-market clinical follow-up study. In this indication, the use of ODM 5 should extract the
      fluid excess in the cornea away by an osmotic effect, enabling the cornea to temporarily
      regain a normal state of hydration. As a consequence, the patient's visual acuity, contrast
      perception, corneal thickness and ocular complaints/symptoms should improve. The hyaluronan
      in ODM 5 helps to protect and heal the cornea in case of irritation and thus, enables the
      cornea to regain a normal state of hydration and participates in improving the quality of
      vision.
