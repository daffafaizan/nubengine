    
      Post-authorization observational, prospective, follow-up study of a cohort of patients with
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation treated with direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran,
      rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) to assess the clinical course (occurrence of stroke,
      other ischemic or bleeding events and mortality) and its correlation with clinical,
      pharmacokinetic (plasma concentrations), pharmacodynamic (haemostatic) and pharmacogenetic
      factors.

      Patient selection and follow-up will be performed in 6 public Spanish hospitals: Hospital
      Universitario de la Princesa, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Hospital Universitario Ramón y
      Cajal, Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Hospital Gómez Ulla (Madrid) and Hospital Universitario de
      Burgos (Burgos). To reduce variability, the determination of anticoagulant activity will be
      performed in the Hematology Service of the Hospital Universitario de Burgos and the
      measurement of plasma concentrations and genotyping of all patients in the Clinical
      Pharmacology Service of the Hospital Universitario de la Princesa.

      Patients who are to receive or are receiving one of the four DOACs currently available in
      Spain will be informed about the characteristics of this study and will be asked to sign the
      consent form for their participation. The treatment or clinical management of these patients
      at each centre will not be modified. They will be asked three blood samples, coinciding with
      other tests that will be carried out to monitor their pathology (one blood sample for the
      study of the effect on coagulation, another for drug quantification in plasma and another for
      genetic studies) with the only requirement that they must have been treated with the drug for
      at least one week so that they have spent more than 5 half-lives and are in steady state. The
      samples will be extracted in the morning, before medication intake (trough concentrations).
