      non-absorbable sutures. Recently, topical skin adhesives such as n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and
      2-octyl cyanoacrylate have been used more frequently as these have been shown to be a faster
      and less painful way to close superficial facial lacerations. However, lacerations that are
      deeper, gaping or occurring along lines of excessive tension, such as the chin, still need
      sutures for repair. Non-absorbable sutures have to be taken out at 4-7 days. This involves
      another physician visit, parental absence from work, and children who need to be taken out of
      school or daycare for a simple suture removal.

      In Part Iof the study, we were able to demonstrate non-inferiority of absorbable sutures to
      nylon sutures. However, we purposely removed all remaining absorbable sutures on the 5-7 day
      follow-up visit. In Part II, we will allow the absorbable sutures to dissolve on their own.
      We will again assess long term cosmetic outcomes, as well parental satisfaction, and short
      and long-term complication rates at 3 months.
