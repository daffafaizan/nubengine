      "How to set the best positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level for each patient? ".
      Different titration techniques have been studied on oxygenation and respiratory mechanics
      parameters without reaching a consensus. Currently we have a module that is connected to the
      ventilator to collect the patient's lung volume. It will therefore allow us to optimize the
      settings of the ventilator and to set the best level of positive end-expiratory pressure
      "best peep" in order to individualize our treatment for each patient.
