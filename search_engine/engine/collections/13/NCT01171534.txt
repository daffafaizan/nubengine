      arms, legs, or pelvis will be consented for participation in the research study. Patients
      will either have their fasciotomy wounds closed through application of the Dermaclose device,
      as per the manufacturer's instructions, or through application of vessel loops with staples
      in a "shoestring technique" as described in the literature (1). Choice of wound closure
      technique will be at surgeon discretion. All patients will undergo application of a
      vacuum-assisted wound closure device (Wound VAC, Active Healing Solutions Inc, San Antonio,
      TX), which is standard of care for temporary coverage of open wounds (2, 3). Patients will be
      returned to the operating room every 2-3 days until wound closure or skin grafting has been
      accomplished. If skin closure is not accomplished in the operating room, but occurs prior to
      return trip to the operating room, then definitive suture closure of the wound will be
      performed under local anaesthetic, followed by removal of the Dermaclose device or of the
      vessel loop with staple shoestring. Decisions regarding wound closure or skin grafting in the
      operating room will be left to the judgment of the attending surgeon.
