      children with Brain damage.

      This well-designed and follow-up RCT study compared home-based CIT with a control
      intervention (traditional rehabilitation, TR) by combining kinematic analysis and clinical
      evaluation, which is possible to examine whether functional improvement is accompanied by a
      change in motor control. We hypothesized that home-based CIT would induce better motor
      control strategies (shorter RT, MT, lesser MUs, MGA, and PMGA, and larger peak velocity (PV))
      for greater functional gains than TR. Furthermore, the beneficial effects would be maintained
      at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Findings of this study allow clinicians to understand the
      underlying motor control changes for functional improvement after home-based CIT.
