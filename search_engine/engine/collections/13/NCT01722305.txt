      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide in combination with
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma
      (PCNSL) or primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) and safety of pomalidomide in combination
      with dexamethasone in patients with PCNSL and PVRL lymphoma in an MTD expanded cohort.

      II. To evaluate overall survival and progression free survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide in the central nervous system. II. To
      identify the predictive biomarkers for responsiveness to pomalidomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pomalidomide.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22 of courses 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
