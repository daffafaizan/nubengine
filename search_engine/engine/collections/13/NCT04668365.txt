    
      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL). Currently, R-CHOP is world-widely used in the first-line treatment for DLBCL. There
      are about one second of patients suffering relapse and drug resistance. ABC-DLBCL mainly
      relies on the chronical activity of BCR signal, which can activate the downstream NF-kB
      pathway through BTK and MYD88, thereby promoting the occurrence of tumors. A study by Wyndham
      H Wilson et al. showed that 23% of ABC-DLBCL patients were accompanied by acquired functional
      mutations of the BCR component CD79A/CD79B. Zanubrutinib is a new BTK inhibitor. The goal of
      our trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib combined with standard
      chemotherapy in the treatment for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and CD79A/CD79B
      genetic abnormality.
