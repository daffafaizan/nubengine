      caused by solvent or solvent free use of rotary instruments. It was reported that the use of
      ProTaper retreatment instruments in combination with gutta-percha solvent reduced the amount
      of apically extruded debris compared to their solvent free use. Nevertheless,no clinical
      evidence has been yet published regarding the comparison of postoperative pain after removal
      of the root canal fillings with or without solvent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effect of combined usage of ProTaper retreatment instruments and gutta-percha solvent, on the
      postoperative pain intensity after retreatment. The adult patients (18-59 ages) who referred
      to Department of Endodontics with a diagnose of failed root canal treatment were examined
      radiographically and clinically. Endodontically treated, clinically asymptomatic,
      single-rooted teeth with one canal exhibiting chronic periapical infection were included. A
      hundred cases who matched the determined criteria were selected and randomly allocated to two
      groups:

      Non-solvent Group (n=50):

      ProTaper retreatment instruments were used in combination with with X-Smart electric motor
      for the removal of root canal fillings.

      Solvent Group (n=50):

      ProTaper retreatment instruments were used with the abovementioned technique but in
      combination with a gutta-percha solvent
