      VLCD on outcomes for patients undergoing elective general surgery. Included are patients who
      are obese, BMI >30, and scheduled by a Christiana Care-employed general surgeon for elective
      general surgery. Eligible patients are those scheduled for elective cholecystectomy, ventral
      or incisional hernia, umbilical hernia, and inguinal hernia surgery.

      The investigators will also be determining the feasibility of introducing a preoperative VLCD
      for patients undergoing elective general surgery in a Community Hospital setting.
