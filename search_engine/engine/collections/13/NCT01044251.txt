      transitional therapy in patients diagnosed with medication overuse headache. Currently, there
      are no proven transitional therapies to help patients get through the detoxification process.
      Frovatriptan has not been tested as a transitional therapy in the past. This study will
      compare Frovatriptan, taken over a 10 day transitional period, to placebo. The primary
      outcome of the study will be the mean headache intensity in the 10 day transitional period in
      the Frovatriptan group as compared to the placebo group. A number of secondary and
      exploratory outcomes will also be determined and further data collection will occur at 1, 2,
      and 3 month periods. The duration of the study for the participants will be 3 months, and
      they will be asked to keep detailed headache diaries during this time. Ten days of baseline
      headache diaries will also be performed before patients can enter the study.
