      I. To determine the activity of Gleevec^trademark (TM) (imatinib mesylate) as measured by
      progression-free survival at six months.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse effects of Gleevec^TM in this cohort
      of patients as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 3.0
      (CTCAE v3.0).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the distribution of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      II. To estimate the objective response rate (partial and complete response as defined under
      the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria).

      III. To determine the effects of prognostic factors such as initial performance status and
      histological grade.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the levels of expression of v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral
      oncogene homolog (c-KIT), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), v-akt murine
      thymoma viral oncogene homolog 2 (AKT2), and phosphorylated (p)-AKT2 in archived,
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumors collected prior to the initiation of
      first-line chemotherapy

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive imatinib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
