    
      Purpose: To evaluate the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection
      in serosa-positive gastric cancer patients, a multicenter phase III clinical trial was
      conducted by 13 participating centers in Japan. Methods: From January 1993 to March 1998, 268
      patients were randomized to either adjuvant chemotherapy (135 pts) or surgery alone (133
      pts). The chemotherapy comprised intraperitoneal cisplatin 70 mg/m2 before closing the
      abdomen, and after surgery intravenous cisplatin 70 mg/m2 (day 14) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
      700 mg/m2 daily (day 14-16), and oral FU (UFT) 267 mg/m2 daily from 4 weeks after surgery for
      the next 12 months. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Relapse-free survival and the
      site of recurrence were secondary endpoints.

      Comparison: gastrectomy with D2 or greater lymph node dissection versus gastrectomy with
      adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection in serosa-positive gastric cancer patients.
