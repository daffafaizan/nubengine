      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate when given in combination
           with pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin in patients with advanced non-squamous cell solid
           tumor malignancy including, but not limited to, breast, lung, colon, pancreatic,
           prostate, or head and neck cancer or sarcoma.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  To obtain preliminary information about the antitumor activity of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate once daily on days 1-21 and cisplatin IV over 1-2
      hours and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days, every 8 weeks until
      disease progression, and then every 3 months for up to 6 months.
