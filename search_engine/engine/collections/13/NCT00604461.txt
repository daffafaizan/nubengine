      Eligible patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma received frontline treatment
      consisting of carboplatin AUC 5, bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, and pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 every 21
      days (Tier-1). Dose escalation continued to achieve a target dosage using carboplatin AUC 6
      (Tier-2). After a maximum of 6 treatment cycles, non-progressing patients received
      maintenance therapy with bevacizumab and pemetrexed every 21 days to complete 1-year total
      treatment duration.
