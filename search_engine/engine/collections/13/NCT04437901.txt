    
      The COVIDAR Registry is an international longitudinal multicentre observational study
      worldwide which aims to assess the incidence, type and risk factors of arrhythmias in the
      context of SARS-CoV2 infection, also providing relevant information on events/management and
      major cardiovascular outcomes. During the course of the registry patients will be followed up
      according to the usual practice of the centres. Drug prescriptions and indications to perform
      diagnostic/therapeutic procedures will be completely left to the treating physicians.

      The registry population will consist of patients presenting with a suspicion of SARS-CoV2
      infection, who are hospitalised in a medical or surgical department of the participating
      hospitals. Patients will officially be enrolled in the COVIDAR Registry if the COVID-19
      disease has formally been noted or confirmed in the patient's medical record.

      The registry will include all patients and collect data at the following timepoints:

        -  Admission: evaluation before SARS-CoV2 infection treatment initiation

        -  On-treatment: evaluation 24-28h after treatment initiation

        -  At any adverse event: evaluation if any adverse event occurs

        -  At discharge: evaluation of clinical status at the end of the admission period.
