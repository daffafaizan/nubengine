      Pulmonary Disease (COPD), is the airflow obstruction resulting from the destruction of the
      alveolar walls distal to the terminal bronchiole, without significant pulmonary fibrosis. The
      existing clinical approaches has contributed to the enlargement and amelioration of the
      emphysema patients life quality, although no effective or curative treatment has been
      achieved. The surgical treatment, on the other hand, involves complex procedures and, in the
      specific case of lung transplantation, a lack of donors.

      Considering these aspects, several experimental models have been proposed aiming to increase
      knowledge about the pathophysiological processes and enable new clinical approaches to the
      pulmonary emphysema. The cell therapy, briefly described as the use of cells in disease
      treatment, presents itself as a promising therapeutic approach with great potential
      applicability in degenerative pulmonary diseases. In this way, it is intended in this
      project, the proposition of a protocol to evaluate the safety of cell therapy with pool of
      mononuclear cells from bone marrow in patients with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of
      pulmonary emphysema in advanced stage (stage IV dyspnea).
