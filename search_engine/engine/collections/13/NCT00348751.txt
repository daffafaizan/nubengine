      to change behaviour more than requiring users to actively initiate the system. However,
      randomized trials comparing these methods in a clinical setting are lacking. In this study we
      compare the effect of Alerting physicians with a CDSS or actively requiring initiation of
      CDSS on the adherence of Dutch general practitioners to the Cholesterol guideline of the
      Dutch college of General Practitioners, using a clinical decsion support system called
      CholGate. This system has the functionality to provide both Alerting and On-Demand decision
      support. Users are free to negate the advise provided by the decision support system. The
      trial will have a cluster randomized structure.
