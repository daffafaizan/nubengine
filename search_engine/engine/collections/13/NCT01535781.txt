      perioperative blood loss. Patients who are osteosynthesised with an intramedullary nail have
      been shown to have the largest hidden blood loss.

      Postoperative anaemia is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality. We wish to
      investigate the possibility of reducing this hidden blood loss, with the use of a well known
      drug (tranexamic acid) that is widely used to reduce blood loss in other forms of surgery and
      in multitraumatized patients.
