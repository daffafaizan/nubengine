      include at least 14 Sub Saharian countries some of whom have never participated in a LMB
      study. The evaluation of improvement in early diagnosis should be possible in this study. The
      study hopes to be able to evaluate children earlier, with stage I and II disease and to
      evaluate treatment response earlier so that the units can decide if a change in treatment is
      necessary, it is also hoped to provide an intensification of treatment for children with a
      stage IV disease.
