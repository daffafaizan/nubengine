      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and numerous trials have shown large
      improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and exercise capacity in persons with
      COPD. However, the great majority of patients who would benefit from PR never follow such a
      program. Moreover, many COPD patients are either not instructed to exercise at all or fail to
      adhere to exercise training at home after completing PR.

      This study evaluates a newly developed exercise training program that requires minimal
      equipment (i.e., only a chair and elastic bands) and can be easily implemented long-term in
      the patient's home-setting.
