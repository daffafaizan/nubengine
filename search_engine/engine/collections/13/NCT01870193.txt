      Review Board of Baylor College of Medicine at the time of approval of the full protocol.
      Subjects taking an nonvitamin supplements or lipid lowering medications will stop this 4
      weeks before the screening labs and for the entire duration of the study. Fasted subjects
      will have screening labs (blood count, HbA1c, lipid profile, liver profile, blood urea
      nitrogen, Creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone, free t4, cortisol) followed by an oral
      glucose tolerance test, measures of muscle strength by dynamometry, tests of function
      (including a 6-min walk test) and body composition scans to measure total body fat. On
      another occasion, fasted subjects will be undergo stable isotope infusions and other studies
      in the metabolic research unit to measure concentrations of amino-acids and glutathione in
      red blood cells and muscle tissue, glutathione synthesis rates in muscle and red cells,
      plasma and whole-body mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation, Kreb's cycle function, urine urea
      nitrogen, plasma reactive oxygen species and F2-isoprostanes, genes of glutathione synthesis
      and fuel oxidation. Elderly subjects will also have magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan for
      liver and muscle fat content.

      Young subjects will be given dietary cysteine and glycine for 2-weeks and be restudied
      2-weeks later. They are then released from the study.

      Elderly subjects will be studied for 16 weeks. They will be assigned to receive either
      cysteine plus glycine, or alanine in a randomized, double-blinded study design. The studies
      described above will be repeated after 2 weeks and 16 weeks. Subjects will have monthly
      measures of liver profile, lipid profiles, BUN and creatinine and glutathione.
