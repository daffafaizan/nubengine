      pigmentosa in people. This is a Phase 1/2a, single-center, open label, safety study of two
      escalating doses of human neural progenitor cells (CNS10-NPC) delivered unilaterally to the
      subretinal space of subjects with RP.

      Subjects meeting all Eligibility Criteria and providing Informed Consent will be enrolled in
      one of two sequential dosing groups. Subjects will be treated sequentially with a minimum of
      one month interval between surgeries for the first three subjects in each dosing cohort. The
      remaining subjects in the cohort will be treated with a minimum interval of at least one week
      between surgeries.

      Primary objective. To assess the safety and tolerability of two escalating doses of clinical
      grade human fetal cortical-derived neural progenitor cells (CNS10-NPC) administered in the
      subretinal space of one eye (unilaterally) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

      Secondary objectives. Within constraints of a small first in-human study focused on safety:

        1. Determine if CNS10-NPC can engraft and survive long-term in the retina of transiently
           immunosuppressed subjects,

        2. Obtain evidence that subretinal injection of CNS10-NPC can favorably impact the
           progression of vision loss in subjects with moderate RP.
