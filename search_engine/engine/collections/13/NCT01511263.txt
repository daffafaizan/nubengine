      involvement who have achieved at least partial hematologic response after chemotherapy will
      be randomized to receive standard supportive therapy (SST) or SST plus Epigallocatechin
      gallate (EGCG). After giving written informed consent, the patients will be evaluated for
      eligibility. Briefly, the subjects with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of AL amyloidosis who
      achieved at least partial response after chemotherapy, who are not planned to receive further
      chemotherapy and who have significant cardiac dysfunction will be considered eligible. The
      patients will be stratified according to the quality of hematologic response and to the
      severity of cardiac involvement. Following stratification, the patients will be randomized to
      receive SST or SST plus EGCG. The study comprises 3 periods: screening (including
      stratification and randomization), treatment (with evaluations of response every 2 months)
      followed by the end-of-treatment evaluation and follow-up. Therapy will continue for up to 1
      year. After treatment patients will be followed for 3 years.
