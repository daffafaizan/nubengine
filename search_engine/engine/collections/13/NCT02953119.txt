      changes, leads to tissue trauma, immobility, psychological distress and reduced quality of
      life. Physical capacity appears to be an important predictor for postoperative recovery after
      major abdominal surgery. Prehabilitation is a concept that challenges the traditional models
      of recovery by initiating the recovery process preoperatively. Improvement of physical
      capacity by means of prehabilitation may facilitate better recovery after surgery. More
      specifically prior to major abdominal surgery, preoperative exercise therapy is associated
      with improved physical fitness of patients, but whether or not this results in fewer
      complications or faster convalescence remains unclear.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of preoperative physical exercise
      training (prehabilitation) on postoperative recovery and clinical outcomes after major
      abdominal surgery.
