      pneumoperitoneum for a prolonged time, but this can cause significant increase in
      intracranial pressure. Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha2 receptor agonist might attenuate
      the sympathetic activation and contribute to stable hemodynamics. The investigator
      hypothesized that continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine during laparoscopic lower abdominal
      surgery, might help to attenuate the increment of intracranial pressure and the investigator
      would observe the optic nerve sheath diameter using ultrasonography.
