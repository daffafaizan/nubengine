      the number of patients who require repeat surgical procedures to completely remove breast
      malignancy.

      In standard procedures, pathologists evaluate tissue samples on a microscope after the
      surgery is over. The new investigative imaging instrument is an advanced type of microscope
      that enables evaluation during surgery.

      The microscope will not be used directly on the participant or in the operating room, but
      instead will be used to image tissue immediately after excision but prior to the conclusion
      of surgery. If pathologic examination using NLM concludes that there is invasive cancer or
      ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at or close to the margin of the specimen, the surgeon will
      be notified and may decide to do additional surgical shavings before the patient leaves the
      operating room, in order to improve the likelihood of achieving clean margins and reduce the
      probability that the patient will be advised to have another operation to achieve clean
      margins. For both patients on the experimental arm (NLM) and the control arm (without NLM),
      standard pathologic evaluation of the specimen will be done some days after the lumpectomy is
      completed. That pathologic evaluation will decide whether or not to recommend that the
      patient has additional surgery in order to achieve clean margins. The primary outcome measure
      is the percentage of patients in each group who are advised to have additional surgery for
      this reason.
