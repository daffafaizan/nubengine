    
      The Specific Aims of this study are:

      Aim 1a. To delineate the effects of TCF7L2 rs7903146 on functional Beta-Cell Capacity in
      obese adolescents with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and pre-IGT.

      Aim 1b. To determine if the risk genotype in TCF7L2 is associated with worsening in beta cell
      function longitudinally, thereby affecting changes in glucose tolerance.

      Aim 2. To examine the functional effect of the rs7903146 variant in the TCF7L2 gene on a)
      incretin effect in obese adolescents with IGT and pre-IGT.

      Aim 3. To determine the functional effects of TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP on hepatic glucose fluxes
      in obese adolescents with IGT and pre-IGT.
