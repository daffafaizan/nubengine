      of vital bodily functions. Unbalance of autonomic nerve system results in considerably
      disordered vital function. Clinically, this is of great significance, because if an
      anesthetic agent produces cause the sympathetic system to block, the effects can be serious
      in individual cases, particularly on the cardiovascular system. If complications are to be
      avoided, it is essential to assess the degree of block correctly. Clinical monitoring has a
      variety of applications, a particularly useful one being measurement of the sympathetic
      system during regional anesthesia, for which quantification of the blocking effect is a
      clinical necessity and the degree of block needs to be ascertained without delay. The
      autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the regulation of hemodynamics
      during anesthesia. Analysis of beat-to-beat fluctuations of heart rate and blood pressure is
      a promising new approach to the clinical diagnosis and management of alterations in
      cardiovascular regulation. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), which could overcome the
      limitation of the steady-state assumption in the classical spectral analysis, is believed as
      a reliable and robust method to access cardiorespiratory dynamics of the ANS and the
      investigators will applied during spinal anesthesia to evaluate the detail changes.
