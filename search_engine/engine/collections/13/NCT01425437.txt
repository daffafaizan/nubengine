        1. To prospectively collect keloid and normal skin tissue samples from patients with keloid
           by performing keloid tissue biopsy and biopsy of uninvolved skin.

        2. To collect blood and/or saliva for genomics, proteomics, tissue culture, flow cytometery
           and other keloid investigational studies.

        3. To collect any keloid tissue that has been previously removed from the patient
           (unrelated to enrollment on this study).

        4. To prospectively collect keloid tissue from patients who are undergoing a planned
           surgical removal of their keloids.

        5. To evaluate keloid histology, genomics, proteomics, molecular markers, cytokines, growth
           factors receptors, ligands and signal transduction pathways within keloid tissue in
           order to find druggable targets.

        6. To prospectively follow the patients and correlate patient demographics and natural
           history of the disease, response to the past and future treatments with the genomic and
           molecular maker profiles.

        7. To culture nucleated blood cells from keloid patients in order to determine the genomics
           of this disease as well as learning about potential presence of keloid stem cell in
           peripheral blood. To use flow cytometry as well as other technology to search for
           circulating keloid stem cells in peripheral blood.

        8. To test in vitro:

      A- The effect of small molecule kinase inhibitors on the activation of wild-type and mutant
      kinases.

      B- The effects of various drugs that inhibit ligands, receptors or pathways.
