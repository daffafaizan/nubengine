        -  Compare the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis in patients with locally
           advanced undifferentiated nasopharyngeal cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin
           followed by cisplatin and radiotherapy with or without amifostine.

        -  Compare the feasibility and activity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of paclitaxel and carboplatin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to WHO
      performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), response to induction chemotherapy (complete vs partial vs
      stable disease vs not evaluable), and participating center.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with a complete or partial response after 2 courses of induction chemotherapy
      receive 2 additional courses before randomization. Patients with stable disease after 2
      courses of induction chemotherapy or who cannot be evaluated after 1 course proceed directly
      to randomization. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1, 22, and 43. Patients also undergo
           radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks.

        -  Arm II:Patients receive amifostine subcutaneously daily. Patients receive chemotherapy
           and radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41-93 patients will be accrued for this study.
