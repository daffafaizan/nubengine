    
      150 adult subjects (> 21 years of age, any cause of CKD) of either gender of any ethnicity
      with CKD Stage V on hemodialysis will be recruited from Davita-UTSW dialysis centers and
      randomized into two equal groups in a parallel design, stratified according to gender and age
      (> or â‰¤ 50 years). After baseline evaluation, one group (EffCaMgCit Group) will take
      EffCaMgCit, and the other group (CaAcS Group) will take calcium acetate suspension/solution
      for two years. Both drugs will be taken 1 sachet each just before or along with breakfast and
      dinner for the first three months. If tolerated, the dose will be increased to 1 sachet tid
      just before or along with breakfast, lunch and dinner.

      After screening and a baseline evaluation, research personnel will visit patients at the
      dialysis center every three months for two years. Patients will be evaluated with a medical
      history, side effect questionnaires, blood pressure measurements, blood tests,
      echocardiograms, coronary artery calcification analyses, muscle magnesium analyses, and bone
      mineral density analyses.

      It is expected that markers of cardiovascular risk would be improved in patients taking
      CaMgCit, and would remain stable in those taking CaAcS.

      Endpoint Expectations:

        -  During treatment with EffCaMgCit, T50 would increase (indicative of reduced propensity
           for CPP formation)

        -  Serum Mg (inhibitor of CPP formation) would be increased by EffCaMgCit

        -  An increase in intracellular muscle Mg would show that EffCaMgCit provides a Mg load,
           and also indicates repletion of Mg stores that might be cardioprotective independently
           of effects on CPP formation

        -  The Investigators anticipate that serum FGF23 would be lower and serum Klotho would be
           higher on EffCaMgCit
