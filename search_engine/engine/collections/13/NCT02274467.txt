      epidural anesthesia will be performed in the standard fashion employed in the investigators
      institution by a resident, fellow, or staff. Spinal ultrasound will be used prior to
      performing the epidural catheter insertion. Patients will be randomly allocated into two
      different groups to receive either a 19 gauge uniport catheter or a 19 gauge multiorifice
      catheter (Arrow Flextip plus, Arrow International Inc., Reading, PA). After securement of the
      catheter, the TCEST will be performed. The test will be repeated at 5 minutes, following a
      test dose, to determine the change in intensity of current required to elicit the motor
      response. Following the second testing, a loading dose of the standard anesthetic solution
      will be administered. The sensory level to ice will be tested at 20 minutes following
      injection of the loading dose of bupivacaine and fentanyl. The sensory level will be assessed
      from the sacral to the thoracic levels, bilaterally Failure of the epidural analgesia will be
      assessed, defined as no evidence of a sensory block to ice and absent pain relief. The need
      for catheter replacement will be determined within 2 hours of the completion of the loading
      dose.
