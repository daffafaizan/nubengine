           termination of pregnancy. Both groups were assessed by the obstetrician in the
           outpatient clinic who must be admitted to the hospital to terminate the pregnancy. After
           receiving consent, a pre-test is performed in the clinic. The pre-test included
           questionnaires (basic attribute, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) - the State
           Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety), Perinatal Grief Scale (PGS), Beck Depression Inventory).
           After complete pre-teat, study nurse will provide the experimental group a QR Code to
           enter the cloud system (Hama Star e-book network platform), enable the couples to read
           the content at home; the control group receives traditional oral instructions. When the
           experimental group entered the delivery room, the researcher used the Hama Star e-book
           network platform to play the content of the termination of pregnancy e-book education
           model, and discussed the content with them; the control group receives regular
           traditional education model, with booklet and oral instructions, the intervention is
           about 20-25 minutes. The experimental group is able to use e-books as needed during
           induction, hospitalization, and after discharge. Two post-tests are conducted for
           follow-up. Both groups write the first post-test questionnaire (State-Trait Anxiety
           Inventory (STAI) - the State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety), Perinatal Grief Scale (PGS),
           Beck Depression Inventory) 60 minutes after education. Then, complete the second
           post-test questionnaire at the next appointment a month after.

        2. Randomization Process: This study used a two-group pre- and post-test mode in
           experimental design, and random allocation to assign subjects into experimental and
           control groups. Participants were randomly allocated to the experimental or control
           group in a 1:1 ratio using the network randomization tool (www.randomizer.org/).

        3. Sample size calculation:G-power version 3.1 was used to calculate the required sample
           size for the study. Set power 0.8, Î± = 0.05, based on the effectiveness (effect 0.30),
           the number of samples required for each group in this study is 32, because the tracking
           period is up to half a year, with a loss rate 50%, the two groups need a total of 96
           participants.
