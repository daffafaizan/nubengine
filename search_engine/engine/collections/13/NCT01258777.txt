      tolerability, immune response, pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug), of

      or 400 mg golimumab or placebo. Subjects will be in the study for up to 16 weeks. Safety
      assessments will be performed throughout the study and include obtaining and evaluating
      laboratory tests, vital signs (eg, blood pressure), and the occurrence and severity of
      adverse events. A single dose of 200 mg or 400 mg golimumab, or placebo.
