    
      Fifteen prevalent and stable hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism
      eligible for treatment with calcium receptor sensitizers according to current KDIGO will be
      included.

      Study phases will begin and end on the day of the first hemodialysis session of the week.

      The run-in phase will last 4 weeks. No calcimimetics will be prescribed during the run-in
      phase.

      The treatment phase starts with a dose of etelcalcetide is 2.5mg thrice weekly. Etelcalcetide
      dose will be escalated every 4 weeks in 2.5mg/dialysis session increments to a maximum dose
      of 15mg thrice weekly.

      The wash-out Phase starts after completion of the 15mg thrice-weekly phase or in case a
      pre-specified safety endpoint is reached, etelcalcetide will be discontinued and patients
      will be followed for additional 8 weeks to study any potential reversibility of PTH lowering
      on T50 results.

      For the individual patient, the study duration will be 9 months
