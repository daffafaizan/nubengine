      study in de novo heart transplant recipients. Patients eligibility for randomization was
      assessed 5 days after heart transplant.. Patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria were randomized to one of two treatment groups: either conventional treatment with
      Cyclosporine A (CsA), Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and corticosteroids (Group A), or low-dose
      CsA and everolimus, reduced dose MMF, and corticosteroids (Group B). After 7 to 11 weeks, CsA
      was discontinued in Group B, while the standard triple-drug immunosuppressive regimen was
      maintained in Group A.
