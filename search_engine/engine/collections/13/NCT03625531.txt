      for acupuncture selection of appropriate points and skillful needling techniques. Many
      clinical trials on acupuncture used fixed acupuncture protocols without accounting for
      individual differences. We here design a multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate
      whether personalized or fixed acupuncture increases the likelihood of live births for
      infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with letrozole or placebo
      letrozole. We hypothesis that letrozole is more effective than personalized acupuncture and
      that personalized acupuncture is more effective than standardized acupuncture, which is more
      effective than placebo letrozole.
