      heart attack, and stroke in patients with T2DM, whose diabetes is not well controlled at the
      beginning of the study and who have a history of CV events or have a high risk for CV events.
      The study includes 3 substudies which will compare the effectiveness of lowering blood
      glucose and assess the safety of canagliflozin relative to placebo in patients receiving
      specific commonly-used diabetes agents. 4,330 participants will be randomly assigned to
      treatment with 1 of 2 doses of canagliflozin (100 or 300 mg) or placebo, in a 1:1:1 ratio.
      This study was originally designed to last for up to 9 years. As per FDA post-marketing
      requirements for canagliflozin, the study's last subject last visit will now occur when
      enough MACE events (ie, CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke) are
      accumulated between the CANVAS (this study) and CANVAS-R studies. The completion target was
      reached in February 2017.
