      reduction in morbidity and mortality after surgery. Moreover, appropriate pain management
      results in better outcomes. Opioids therapy is recommended as the first choice medication for
      the management of postoperative pain but is associated with a number of undesirable adverse
      effects. A multimodal therapy for providing postoperative analgesia has advantages over the
      use of opioids alone. The use of NSAIDs and opioids together often improves analgesia and
      reduces the need for opioids in the postoperative period. Often, the combination of COX-2
      inhibitors with epidural analgesia is preferred. With epidural analgesia, addition of COX-2
      inhibitors may improve the analgesia and decrease the undesirable side effects.
