      targeting amyloid, on cognition, global clinical status, and underlying pathology in
      participants at risk for the onset of clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Cognitively unimpaired individuals with two APOE4 genes and age 60 to 75 years, inclusive,
      are selected as they represent a population at particularly high risk of progression to Mild
      Cognitive Impairment and/or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.

      The study follows a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-cohort, parallel group
      design in which participants receive one of the investigational treatments or their matching
      placebo for at least 60 months up to a maximum of 96 months and no longer than when the
      target number of events for the TTE endpoint has been observed and confirmed in either
      cohort.

      An unbalanced randomization (active: placebo) of 5:3 ratio in Cohort I (430 CAD106 :260
      Placebo) and 3:2 ratio in Cohort II (390 CNP520 : 260 Placebo) will be applied. Randomization
      will be stratified by age group (60-64 years, 65-75 years) and region (North America/Other ,
      Europe).

      Participants who meet study entry requirements will be required to undergo at least one PET
      scan during the course of the study. Additional PET scans, blood and CSF collection will be
      voluntary. The study (also known as the Generation Study 1) is conducted as part of the
      Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) program.
