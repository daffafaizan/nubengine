      tapping tasks, (Motor Interference Therapy <TIM>)in a pilot study with amazing results and a
      solid size effect. The investigators decided to challenge the intervention using a control
      task (JacobsonÂ´s progressive relaxation exercises) The hypothesis consists in achieving a 30%
      reduction of the distress, (measured with Visual Analogue Scale) by using TIM compared with
      the control task. Patients with traumatic memories will be enrolled in to one of two
      treatment modalities. The first group will receIve motor interference therapy and the second
      group will receive a control task (relaxation exercises). Both groups will be assessed using
      the Spanish version of the PTSD Symptom Severity Scale-Revised (EGS-R), the visual analogue
      scale (EQ-VAS) from EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), and a simple visual-analogue scale (VAS) immediately
      after, a week after, a month after and six months after the treatment for follow up.
