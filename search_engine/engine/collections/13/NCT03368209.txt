      Home 2 protocol" The investigation was initiated to collect spectral raman data paired with
      validated blood references. In the OUH protocol, capillary blood was analysed by ABL 800 Flex
      blood gas analyzer by Radiometer. In the Home 1 protocol, references were obtained by the
      finger pricking procedure from HemoCue (Radiometer). In the Home 2 protocol, HemoCue
      measurements were conducted along with continuous monitoring using Dexcom G4/G5 device
      (Dexcom) or FreeStyle Libre (Abbott) The data was collected from diabetic patients and
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) readings were obtained from all subjects.
