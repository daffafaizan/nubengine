      reducing Staphylococcus aureus colonization and surgical site infections (SSIs).

      Aim 1a. Evaluate patients after surgery to determine S. aureus colonization and to survey
      patients on tolerability of intranasal povidone-iodine decolonization. The intranasal
      povidone-iodine swab will be administered to the patient's nares around one hour prior to the
      first surgical incision. It will then be re-applied around 12 hours later, for a total of two
      applications within a 24 hour period.

      During the same visit at 24 hours after surgery, patients will also be administered a
      questionnaire to determine the tolerability of intranasal povidone-iodine decolonization.
      Questions will be asked about adverse events (e.g., itching, irritation) and how intranasal
      povidone-iodine felt (very pleasant, pleasant, neutral, unpleasant, very unpleasant).

      Based on the data obtained from this aim, we will summarize the patient acceptance of
      intranasal povidone-iodine.

      Aim 1b. Compare the rates of SSI among orthopaedic trauma surgery patients who received
      intranasal povidone-iodine to similar patients who received orthopedic trauma surgery before
      intranasal povidone-iodine implementation.
