      osteoporosis. Currently, only a small minority of these individuals who are at high risk for
      recurrent fractures undergo evaluation for possible treatment. We propose to test and
      optimize a novel approach to address this question, relying upon fracture events reported to
      provincial health service (Manitoba Health) as a mechanism for osteoporosis case
      identification and enhancing post fracture care.

      Phase 1 (one year duration): individuals meeting the fracture case definition will be
      randomized to usual care (no intervention), physician notification and physician/patient
      notification. The notification will provide a general recommendation for osteoporosis
      assessment. The use of appropriate post-fracture investigations and treatment will be
      prospectively evaluated.

      Phase 2 (up to two years duration): the intervention will be refined and iteratively trialed
      for all individuals meeting the fracture case definition.

      Phase 3: a recommendation for long term maintenance of the post-fracture intervention will be
      developed.
