      knowledge directly in humans. Knowledge will be acquired using diverse state-of-the-art
      genomic and proteomic technologies, a highly complex clinical, proteomic, and genomic
      database, as well as newly-developed, novel analytical tools to probe this complex dataset.
      Our analytical capabilities at the genomic and proteomic level are now rapidly evolving and
      our ability to link these genomic and proteomic data to pathways and functional modules will
      help us more closely link this cellular data to immunological processes and ultimately, to
      the phenotypic response (i.e., trajectory) in the injured host. As a result, potential
      interventions, whether through our Program or other funding mechanisms, can be more
      effectively designed.
