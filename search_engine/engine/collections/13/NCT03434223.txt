    
      To collect and organize data into a repository from the Principal Investigator's and other
      Site Investigators' elderly patients (aged â‰¥ 60 years) who are undergoing single, two-level,
      or three-level lumbar instrumented arthrodesis procedures supplemented by the Implanet Jazz
      SystemTM at participating centers. This device is designed to provide a stable interface
      between spinal constructs and the rods; it can be secured around vertebral structures (such
      as the lamina, transverse or spinous processes) from T1 to L5 and is intended to provide
      temporary stabilization as a bone anchor during the development of a solid body fusion. Of
      note, these patients will receive the supplemental support of the Implanet Jazz Sublaminar
      Band as their clinical standard of care deems necessary and separately from study
      participation.

      Clinical data will be collected as indicated at 6 weeks, as well as 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and
      60 months post-operatively in the database.
