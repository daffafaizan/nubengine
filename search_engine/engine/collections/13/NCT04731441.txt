      patients with advanced GI or Gyn cancer, as prehabilitation prior to surgery. The objective
      of the prehabilitation program is to reduce complication rates and improve the length and
      quality of survival for patients with abdominal cancer. The prehabilitation program will be
      offered to patients who are eligible for and consent to cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and
      heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).
