    
      This study is designed to investigate in a prospective, randomised fashion whether a single
      intravenous dose of rituximab (375 mg/m2) given two weeks prior to transplant, in addition to
      standard therapy, will allow sensitised renal transplant subjects to achieve a negative CDC
      crossmatch and thereby proceed to live donor transplantation. We will also evaluate whether
      rituximab will reduce the number of AAMR episodes in the post-transplant period, compared to
      controls. All eligible subjects must have a positive T- and/or B-cell CDC or flow cytometry
      crossmatch and have donor-specific antibodies identified by solid-phase assay at screening.
      All subjects will receive a standard desensitisation regimen that includes plasma
      exchange/IVIG + MMF before and immediately after transplantation followed by a standard care
      immunosuppressive regimen (IL-2R antagonist, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] and
      corticosteroids) after transplantation.
