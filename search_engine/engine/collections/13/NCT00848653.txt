      patients. This therapy is delivered using a device (pacemaker (PM) +/- defibrillator (ICD) )
      and leads placed in the right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV).
      Rates of LV lead implantation failure and post operative lead related have decreased
      dramatically over the years, however, the incidence of lead dislodgement and phrenic nerve
      stimulation is still high. This study is a prospective evaluation of the benefits of having
      various pace/sense electrode configurations available in a CRT system.
