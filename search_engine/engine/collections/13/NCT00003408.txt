        -  Determine the feasibility of therapy with sargramostim (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 and
           interferon alfa following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in
           patients with high risk cancer.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on long-term leukocyte and platelet recovery
           following high dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue in these patients.

        -  Determine the cellular response to this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess progression free and overall survival rates in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of interleukin-2 and interferon alfa.

      Beginning 14 days after the autologous stem cell transplant, patients receive daily
      subcutaneous injections of sargramostim (GM-CSF) on days 1-7 and daily intravenous
      interleukin-2 on days 3-7, followed by 1 week of rest. Patients then receive a subcutaneous
      injection of interferon alfa three times a week for 3 weeks followed by one more week of
      rest. Treatment is repeated for four courses.

      Cohorts of 10 patients each receive escalating doses of interleukin-2 and interferon alfa
      until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which
      no more than 3 of 10 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Intrapatient dose escalation
      occurs in courses 2-4, in the absence of dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
