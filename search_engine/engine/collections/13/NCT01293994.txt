      opioid medication in patients who suffer from chronic pain (e.g. OIH vs. analgesic tolerance,
      baseline pain sensitivity, etc.). This has never been done before, and if it proves
      successful, it could provide physicians a greater understanding of why some chronic opioid
      users continue needing increased doses of opioids. This data may also help predict which
      patients will do well with chronic opioid therapy and which ones may not. Initial data with
      OPRM1 gene analysis in humans already implicates certain SNPs with opioid responsiveness and
      there have been suggestions for screening patients for OPRM1 prior to initiating opioid
      therapy in order to optimize their treatment response (Reynolds et al., 2008).
