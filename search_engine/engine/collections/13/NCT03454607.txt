      foot-controlled robotic endoscope holder prototype that allows the surgeon to directly
      manipulate surgical instruments with both hands at all times. The conducted ex-vivo cadaver
      test, corroborated the feasibility of the robotic prototype. However the next step requires
      further clinical trials to evaluate its use in endoscopic sinus surgery in patients that is
      the purpose of this study
