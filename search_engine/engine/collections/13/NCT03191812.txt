      like talking, reading or decision making, is critical to the preservation of functional
      independence into old age. Such "dual tasking" often impairs balance, even in healthy older
      adults and those with greater dual task "costs" are more likely to suffer future falls.
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, noninvasive and inexpensive means
      of modulating activity across cortical networks. A single, 20-minute session of tDCS
      facilitates brain activity for up to 24 hours. Through Dr. Manor's previous research in
      healthy older adults, he has discovered that just 20 minutes of tDCS targeting the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)-a region involved in both cognitive and motor
      function-immediately reduces the dual task costs to balance when standing and walking, and
      improves performance in the timed up-and-go (TUG) test of mobility. However, there are
      several brain networks with known involvement in balance control and dual tasking, and the
      optimal brain region to target to improve dual task capacity has not been established. The
      proposed study will be a double-blinded, sham-controlled study in which older adults both
      with and without a history of falling undergo dual task assessments immediately before and
      after single, 20-minute sessions of tDCS designed to target several different brain regions
      with known involvement in dual tasking and the maintenance of balance.
