      decreasing the incontinence episode frequency per week. Other objectives include the
      determination of the cure rate (objective and subjective) with the ring, the effects to
      bladder function as noted on urodynamic testing, the impact on quality of life and the
      acceptability to this device in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.

      In this cross-over study, 40 women will undergo a two-period treatment. In one of the
      periods, she will spend 4 weeks wearing continuously the ring and in the other (also 4 weeks
      duration), she will not be using any treatment for her incontinence. Between periods, she
      will spend 2 weeks in "wash out" to eliminate the risk of continuous effect from the
      treatment in the preceding period. Each woman will be randomly assigned to the treatment
      sequence.

      Stress urinary incontinence is a common problem affecting at almost 20% of women. Treatments
      currently advocated include pelvic floor exercises and surgery. Pelvic floor exercises
      require great motivation and usually 3 months of training to show an impact. Surgery is very
      effective, but costly and carries a number of complications. The use of the incontinence ring
      may allow women to control their symptoms with immediate result at minimal risk. This device
      has never been properly evaluated before its introduction into the market.
