      to swallow the OCT capsule while being awake and unsedated. The capsule is attached to a
      tether which allows the operator to control as well as navigate the capsule as it progresses
      down the esophagus using natural propulsive force called peristalsis.

      As the capsule progresses through the esophagus, multiple images of the esophagus are
      acquired and later analyzed.
