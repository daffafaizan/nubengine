      recurrence.

      At present, there are no biomarkers predictive for post-operating recurrence and
      administration of a post-operating medical treatment to prevent recurrence is based on
      biological, endoscopic and imagery data.

      Predictive biomarkers could allow the identification of patients with high risk of
      post-operating recurrence and administration of a systematic prophylactic post-operating
      treatment and at the same time avoiding the prescription of this treatment to patients with
      low risk of post-operating recurrence.
