      to be a large gap in our understanding of disease pathogenesis and mechanisms accounting for
      large variability in disease phenotype. Cigarette smoking is the principal cause of COPD, but
      only approximately 15% of adults with substantial tobacco exposure develop clinical COPD.
      Besides, bacterial colonization or infection is also considered as an important factor in
      COPD. There are very limited data from microbiome studies that suggest that respiratory and
      gastrointestinal microbiota may be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. However, the
      cross-talk between between lung and gut microbiome, and their relationship with various
      clinical phenotypes of COPD. Here, we conducted 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing to evaluate the
      link between the lung-gut axis and the clinical phenotypes of COPD, such as lung function,
      emphysema, symptoms, exacerbations, inflammation levels and metabolic features.
