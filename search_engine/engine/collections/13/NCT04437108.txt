      in aging men including both voiding and storage symptoms. After prostatectomy, 20-30% of the
      patients still have persistent storage symptoms. The pathophysiology of persistent storage
      symptoms after surgical relief of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) remains unclear. It may
      be due to bladder changes produced by long standing bladder outlet obstruction (BOO)
      including bladder ischemia and denervation or it may be related to other factors rather than
      preoperative BOO such as aging, chronic inflammation or a subtle neurological disorder.

      After exclusion of urinary tract infection (UTI) and BOO, antimuscarinics are the commonly
      used medications for post-prostatectomy persistent storage symptoms. However, these
      medications are associated with side effects which may interfere with the patient compliance.

      Low-intensity shock wave therapy (Li-SWT) is a non invasive procedure that has a beneficial
      effect in promoting revascularization and enhancing tissue regeneration. It has been applied
      to the penis for erectile dysfunction and to the perineum for chronic pelvic pain syndrome
      (CPPS) with encouraging results. In a rat model, it has been reported that defocused Li-SWT
      leads to improvement of bladder innervation and vascularization.

      Based on the previously mentioned studies, the investigators hypothesized that Li-SWT can
      offer benefit in improvement of persistent storage symptoms after surgical relief of BPO. In
      the present study, the investigators will evaluate the effect of Li-SWT on persistent storage
      symptoms after transurethral surgery for BPO compared to antimuscarinics in a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT).
