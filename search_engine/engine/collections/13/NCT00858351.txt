      Sessions can be scheduled once or twice per week. Sessions involve a walking task, filling
      out questionnaires, and having temperature of hands and feet monitored. This study involves
      no drugs, blood draws, or any other invasive procedures. Participants are urged to continue
      the treatment of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy as directed by their physician for the
      duration of their involvement with the study. After 3 months, a packet of questionnaires will
      be mailed with a stamped addressed envelope to be returned.
