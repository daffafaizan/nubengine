      of the fourth lumbar vertebra, remaining fixed at the same site for at least six weeks.
      Moreover, it is associated with hydronephrosis and/or prevents contrast medium from passing
      below the calculus on intravenous urography (IVU).Moreover, there is inability to pass a
      guidewire or catheter beyond the stone at initial attempts. The treatment for patients with
      large impacted proximal ureteral stone remains controversial; the surgical options for the
      treatment of proximal ureteral stones include extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL),
      Ureteroscopy, PCNL and rarely Laparoscopic or Open surgery. Every technique has its own
      limitations. The aim of this study is to compare and to evaluate the outcome and
      complications of two main treatments procedures for impacted proximal ureteral calculi,
      Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) and Ureteroscopy.

      Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) and Ureteroscopy are two common modalities in
      the management of Proximal Ureteral Calculi.European Association of Urology (EAU) and
      American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines have recommended URS or ESWL as first-line
      treatment Options.ESWL is an effective and non-invasive treatment method in urolithiasis,
      particularly in stones located in the upper third of the ureters.However, URS is a more
      invasive technique when compared to ESWL, URS became the most efficient treatment method in
      proximal ureteral calculi after the development of small-caliber, semi-rigid and flexible
      endoscopes and the holmium:YAG laser. Today, the greatest dilemma faced by Urologists is to
      choose between ESWL and URS. A number of factors influence the final results of ESWLand if no
      fragmentation occurs after several unsuccessful sessions, the stone is considered
      ESWL-resistant; the case is deemed an ESWL-failure and the patient therefore undergoes
      URS.URS has been described as a salvage or second line treatment option in cases of
      ESWL-resistant calculi
