    
      Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation is an effective treatment after exacerbations of COPD to
      prevent future exacerbations and to improve breathlessness and quality of life. Its
      effectiveness after exacerbations of bronchiectasis has never been demonstrated.

      Aims: To determine if a 6 week course of pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise capacity
      at 8 weeks after exacerbation.

      Study Design: Randomised controlled trial. Methods: The study will take place in NHS Tayside.
      40 patients with a history of bronchiectasis confirmed by HRCT will be included. Patients
      will be monitored using diary cards for exacerbations. At the onset of an exacerbation
      patients will be treated with a standard 14 day course of antibiotic therapy and randomised
      to one of two arms: Pulmonary rehabilitation or standard care. Patients randomised to
      pulmonary rehabilitation will undergo a 6 week course of supervised pulmonary rehabilitation.
      Patients will undergo study assessments (6-minute walk test, Quality of life questionnaires,
      pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC, FEF 25-75), symptoms recorded by symptom diaries and
      sputum microbiology).Assessments will be performed at the start and end of exacerbations, at
      6-8 weeks post exacerbation (after completion of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients
      randomised to rehabilitation) and at 12 weeks.

      Outcome: The primary outcome is 6 minute walk distance at 8 week post exacerbation Expected
      Conclusion: We will determine the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation after
      exacerbations of bronchiectasis.
