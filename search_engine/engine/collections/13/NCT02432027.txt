      gel compared with vehicle by measurement of the thickness of the Echo Lucent Band (ELB) of
      the psoriatic infiltrate using 20 MHz sonography. To gain additional information about
      possible efficacy the change of the test fields compared to untreated plaque will be
      clinically assessed by visual scoring.
