    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of trastuzumab
      deruxtecan (DS-8201a) in combination with ceralasertib (AZD6738) in advanced solid tumors
      with HER2 expression. (Escalation Phase) II. Assess differential pharmacodynamic (PD) profile
      of tumor tissue (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] damage & repair) between Top1 inhibition and
      dual inhibition of Top1 and ATR in patients with colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal
      cancer with HER2 expression. (Expansion Phase)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      DS-8201a and AZD6738 and immunogenicity of DS8201a.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate association between HER2 heterogeneity and response to DS-8201a plus (+) AZD6738
      therapy using central protein expression assessment.

      II. Determine predictive biomarkers (including but not restricted to: HER2 protein levels,
      HER2 gene copy number, alterations of TP53, ATM and RAS) of DS-8201a + AZD6738 efficacy in
      advanced solid tumors (specifically colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal cancer) with HER2
      expression III. To characterize PD biomarkers for efficacy of DS-8201a + AZD6738 efficacy in
      advanced solid tumors (specifically colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal cancer) with HER2
      expression (such as pRAD50 and SLFN11).

      IV. To establish a biorepository of tissue, blood and pre-clinical models (PDXs) for HER2
      expressing advanced solid tumors (specifically colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal
      cancer).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of AZD6738 with fixed dose DS-8201a followed by a
      dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and
      ceralasertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: During the dose-expansion
      phase, the first 6 patients in each disease cohort (gastroesophageal cancer [cohort A] and
      colorectal cancer [cohort B]) receive only DS-8201a for the first cycle, followed by DS-8201
      and AZD6738 together in subsequent cycles.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
