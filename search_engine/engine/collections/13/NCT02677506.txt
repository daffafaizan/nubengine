      been recommended for elbow surgery. Supraclavicular approach is considered to have a more
      rapid onset. However, investigators have noticed that the supraclavicular approach needs more
      supplementation if it is used for elbow surgery. Therefore more and more anesthesiologists
      now choose the infraclavicular approach for elbow surgery (though both approaches are
      recommended in the text books).

      None of the published studies have addressed if one approach is indeed superior to the other
      specifically for elbow surgery. Therefore the investigators propose to undertake a study that
      will evaluate the two approaches to the brachial plexus specifically for elbow surgery.
