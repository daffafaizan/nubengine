      Primary

        -  Determine the confirmed tumor response rate in patients with unresectable, metastatic
           adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia treated
           with bortezomib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression, overall survival, and duration of response in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the adverse events in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, and 8 and paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 17 months.
