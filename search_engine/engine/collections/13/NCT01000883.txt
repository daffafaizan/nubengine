        -  Collect , catalogue, and store biological specimens from patients with locally advanced
           or metastatic breast cancer

        -  To collect clinical data from these patients containing identifiers, demographics,
           epidemiologic review, clinical evaluation, treatment, and long-term follow-up.

        -  To provide an efficient bi-directional flow of clinical information and specimens
           between laboratory and clinical scientists in order to foster innovative translational
           research.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo core biopsy and blood sampling at diagnosis, between chemotherapy regimens,
      and prior to definitive surgery. Tumor markers are assessed using immunohistochemistry and
      flow cytometry.
