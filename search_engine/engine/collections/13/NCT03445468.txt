    
      The study is an open-label(Part 1), Single-arm(Part 1), Randomized(Part 2), Double-blind(Part
      2), Active comparator(Part 2) Phase III study.

      Before initiation of any protocol-specific activities, written informed consent is obtained
      from each patient and their legally acceptable representatives. Subjects who meet all of the
      eligibility criteria after screening assessments as specified in the protocol, are randomized
      into the test group or the comparator group in a ratio of 4 :1 and receive a single dose or
      two doses of the study vaccine. The investigator perform the efficacy (immunogenicity) and
      safety assessments throughout the study. Efficacy data are collected at Visit 1 (prior to
      vaccination) and at the end-of-study visit for efficacy (immunogenicity) assessments, and for
      safety assessment, subjects and their legally acceptable representatives are instructed to
      record any treatment-emergent adverse event in Patient Diary cards.

      For all randomized subjects, blood sample is obtained prior to vaccination, and the study
      vaccine 0.5mL is administered. For children aged from 3 years to <9 years of age who have not
      previously received influenza vaccine, another dose of the study vaccine is administered 4 to
      5 weeks after the first dose. Blood samples are collected 4 to 5 weeks after the last dose of
      the study drug for the assessment of antibody titer. All subjects are followed for 6 months
      after the last dose of the study drug for the safety assessments, and Month 6 follow-up visit
      is the end-of-study visit.
