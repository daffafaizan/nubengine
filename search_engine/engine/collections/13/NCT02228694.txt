      medication administration processes. HackensackUMC is specifically interested in measuring
      the time to first dose administration from scheduled dosing times of the IV antibiotic
      piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, USP. and we are interested in assessing a
      reduction in time from scheduled dosage times of first dose to documented administration
      after the implementation of the regulated ADC system compared to before.

      Timely administration of antibiotics improves morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital
      stay.Early and effective antibiotic therapy is essential in the management of infection in
      critical illness. The loading dose is probably the most important dose and is a function of
      the volume of distribution of the drug and the desired plasma concentration but independent
      of renal function.
