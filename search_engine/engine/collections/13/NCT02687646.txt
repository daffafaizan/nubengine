      safety and efficacy of sequential infusion of allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue, expanded
      "in vitro" platelet lysate in the treatment of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell
      trasplantation, who have developed a refractory graft versus host disease to first line of
      treatment.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, open to patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation in
      Spanish hospitals, with one cohort of patients who receive four sequential doses of MSC.
