      cognitive functioning, patients will undertake a number of training sessions using the tool.

      This study will be composed of 2 groups of schizophrenic patients.

        -  the active group will benefit from 14 one hour sessions on the driving simulator. The
           training will be progressive and organized enabling the remediation of the different
           cognitive functions necessary to driving.

        -  the TAU (treatment as usual) group will carry on their usual care during the length of
           the study. This group will help confirm the pertinence of using such a tool on a daily
           basis. After the end of the study, the 14 session training will be suggested to the
           patients who are willing.

      Social autonomy, neuropsychological functioning and clinical symptomatology will be measured
      before, after and at a 6 month follow-up.
