    
      The HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (VAS) is intended for use in patients with chronic
      Stage D/NYHA Class IIIB/IV left ventricular failure who have received and failed optimal
      medical therapy and who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation. The ENDURANCE clinical
      study is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, multi-center, non-inferiority evaluation of
      the HeartWare® VAS versus a control group consisting of any FDA-approved Left Ventricular
      Assist Device (LVAD) approved for destination therapy. Patients are randomized to HeartWare®
      VAS or control LVAD in a 2:1 ratio. Each patient receiving the HeartWare® VAS or control LVAD
      is followed to the primary endpoint at 2 years, with a subsequent follow-up period extending
      to 5 years post implant.
