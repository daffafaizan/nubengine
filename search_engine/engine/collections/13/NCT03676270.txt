      to an expected paucity of benefits, since approximately 5% of patients in phase 1 trials are
      reported to have tumor shrinkage.

      Objective was to conduct a search of the literature using PubMed to identify articles about
      phase 1 trials that were published from January 1, 2014, through June 30, 2015. The primary
      end point was the response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria.

      Clinically relevant trials' characteristics were investigated as candidate factors associated
      with the RR: Funding source (Academic / Industrial), First-in man trial (Yes / No), Expansion
      cohort (Yes / No), Number of targeted organs (Single / Multiple), Therapy (Single /
      Combination), Treatment (MAB-Immuno / ITK / Chimioth-HT-other), Biological eligibility
      criterion (Yes / No), as well as the number of assessable patients, which for ease of
      clinical interpretation was transformed into a qualitative variable (0-25 / 26 - 50 / 51+).

      The RR was described according to the individual trials' characteristics. Associations with
      trials's characteristics were investigated using statistical modeling.
