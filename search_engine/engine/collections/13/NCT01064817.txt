    
      Glaucoma is a disease of the eye which affects the optic nerve (the nerve that sends signals
      from the eye to the brain) and is associated with visual field defects and potential
      blindness. The treatment of glaucoma involves lowering the pressure in the eye, which is
      often (but not always) elevated due to accumulation of fluid inside the eye that cannot drain
      away. In the operation called trabeculectomy (a type of filtration surgery), a small channel
      is created through the sclera (the white of the eye) to allow accumulated fluid to drain
      away. Scarring may occur after surgery when, during healing, too much collagen (a type of
      protein) is deposited in the channel. This causes the channel to seal up and the pressure
      inside the eye to build up again.

      The study will be conducted in patients suffering from glaucoma who are due to undergo
      trabeculectomy. Patients will be randomized to have either PRM-151 or placebo.
