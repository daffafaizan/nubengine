    
      Male and female patients at least 18 years of age with untreated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
      who have non-incisional biopsy definitive evidence of disease (or from cytology results from
      a bronchoscope procedure) and who have been previously certified (per centers for Medicare
      and Medicaid Services requirements) by their physicians will be consented for the study. The
      study consists of a screening visit, gold-standard 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging followed by the
      investigational agent 99m Tc-Ec-DG SPECT/CT. The study procedures can be performed within 5-7
      days of signing the informed consent. [To better meet the standard of care at each clinical
      location, the PET/CT can be performed as part of pre-study procedures on a PET/CT camera
      previously qualified by the site to meet the standards required for the study. If this
      occurs, the SPECT/CT must be performed within 45 days of the PET/CT imaging procedures.]
      Patients will be seen 24 hours after the 99m Tc-Ec-DG injection for safety. A 21-day
      follow-up period (after the SPECT/CT image) will allow the investigator to acquire additional
      imaging, surgical, pathology and treatment documentation. [An actual patient visit is NOT
      required at the 21-day follow-up time point.]
