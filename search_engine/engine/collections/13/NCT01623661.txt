      disease (CKD) Changes in the sodium intake results in a slower expansion and/or reduction in
      extracellular fluid in CKD patients.

      Urinary biomarkers reflects the kidneys transport of sodium and water in the nephron.

      Changes in the sodium-and water channel activity is induced by intervention with hypertonic
      Saline (3.0%) The change in sodium-and water channel activity is followed by change in
      extracellular and intracellular fluid compartments and the plasma concentration of vasoactive
      hormones.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in urinary biomarkers (u-NKCC2,
      u-ENaC-gamma and u-AQP2), the activity of the sodium-and water channels, the extra- and
      intracellular fluid compartments and the plasma concentration of Vasoactive hormones in
      patients with CKD and in healthy subjects.

      Subjects and patients are examined during one examination day. Four days prior to the
      examination day the subjects consume a standardized diet based on the amount of sodium and
      calories. On the examination day the subjects receive an infusion with hypertonic saline.

      Renal function is measured by renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA. Urinary biomarkers (u-NKCC2,
      u-ENaC-gamma and u-AQP2) are measured to evaluate the activity of sodium channels in the
      nephron and changes in fluid compartments are measured by body composition monitor.
