      Primary objective:

      Investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4635 monotherapy in Japanese patients

      Secondary objective:

      Characterize the single-dose and multiple-dose plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of
      AZD4635 monotherapy Determine the preliminary anti-tumor activity of AZD4645 monotherapy

      Overall design:

      This is a phase I, open-label study of AZD4635 in Japanese patients with advanced solid
      malignancies.

      The study consists of 2 cohorts, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. At least 3 or up to 6 evaluable
      Japanese subjects with advanced solid malignancies will be enrolled in Cohort 1 and 6
      evaluable patients will be required for Cohort 2 to confirm the tolerability. The total
      number of evaluable subjects in each cohort will depend upon available data in each cohort
      and decision of Safety Review Committee(SRC).

      Study Period:

      The study is expected to start in June 2019 and end in June 2020.

      Number of Subjects:

      9 to 12 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study to confirm the tolerability.

      Treatments and treatment duration:

      Subjects will receive AZD4635 once daily (QD). A single dose of AZD4635 will be taken on
      Cycle 0 Day1 and the subsequent dose of AZD4635 will be taken from Cycle 1 Day 1 until
      discontinuation criterion is met. A cycle of study treatment will be defined as 21 days of
      continuous dosing.
