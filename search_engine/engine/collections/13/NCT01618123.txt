      troponin, will undergo the following tests upon arrival following clinical evaluation and
      their consenting to the study: resting ECG, EndoPAT testing and then after stress nuclear
      imaging or stress echocardiography. Except for EndoPAT testing, all other tests will be
      conducted according to the routine CPU protocol.

      The results of the EndoPAT will be blinded to the treating physician until the end of the
      study and all patients will be managed according to the current CPU protocol, including 24-h
      Holter monitoring, repeat resting ECG and exercise tests (nuclear SPECT imaging or stress
      echocardiography, whichever is available) in addition to repeat clinical and troponin tests
      evaluations.

      All clinical data of the recruited subjects the will be recorded and evaluated after
      completion of the study.

      Long-term clinical follow-up All patients will be followed by telephone contact after 6 and
      12 months for combined major adverse cardiovascular end-points (MACE) which include all-cause
      mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or angina
      pectoris, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary interventions, by
      physicians who will be blinded to the patients' baseline clinical status and endothelial
      function (assessed by EndoPAT) results. All MACE will be validated by review of medical
      records by senior cardiologists blinded to the endothelial function results. In addition,
      on-line access to this information will facilitate verification and safe documentation of all
      events. In addition, written medical records will be reviewed by cardiologists in the event
      of any death, hospitalization and/or angina pectoris.

      At the end of the study the cost effectiveness on prediction of short (in-hospital) and long
      (6 months, and 1 year) of EndoPAT will be assessed and will be compared to the stress tests
      (nuclear imaging and/or echocardiography).
