      difficulties encountered with data collection (related to incomplete e-Diary entries) in
      concert with business considerations. The decision was not related to any new or unexpected
      safety or efficacy findings with NOMAC-E2. As a result of this early termination, none of the
      pre-specified efficacy endpoints were analyzed.
