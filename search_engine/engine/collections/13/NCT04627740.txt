      To evaluate the number of ALPP-positive participants with treatment-related adverse events as
      assessed by CTCAE v4.0 after infusion with anti-ALPP CAR-T cells.

      Secondary Objectives:

      The number of patients experience objective response from anti-ALPP CAR-T cells treatment

      To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of anti-ALPP CAR-T cells in patients with
      ALPP-positive patients.

      The number and percent of ALPP-CART cells in peripheral blood from ALPP-positive patients at
      6 months after infusion
