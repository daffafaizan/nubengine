      complementary intervention to enhance biopsychosocial functioning in special populations. The
      objective is to conduct a methodologically rigorous trial to quantify the therapeutic
      efficacy of service dogs on clinically-important outcomes for veterans with PTSD. Based on
      preliminary findings and qualitative reports, the central hypothesis is that military
      veterans with PTSD who are provided service dogs will experience reduced PTSD symptoms
      related to socio-emotional functioning and arousal modulation. The rationale for this
      research is that its successful completion will provide an evidence-based demonstration of
      the efficacy and role of an increasingly used yet poorly tested complementary intervention.
      The completion of this project is expected to established an initial demonstration of the
      therapeutic efficacy of service dogs in this population, as well as possible mechanisms of
      action via specific biological pathways and human-canine interaction profiles.
