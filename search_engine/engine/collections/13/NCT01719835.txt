    
      Background:

      T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive rare subset of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) comprising several
      different subtypes of disease within this group. No standard first-line treatment exists for
      T-cell lymphoma as published series are small, with heterogeneous populations and often
      retrospective.

      Protocol Synopsis, Study Period: 5 years

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      • To compare the complete response rate of GEM-P with CHOP chemotherapy in the first line
      treatment of patients with T-Cell Lymphoma.

      Secondary:

      To investigate, between both arms:

        -  Rate of metabolic complete response

        -  Toxicity of treatment

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS)

      Exploratory:

      • Investigate impact of International Prognostic Index (IPI) on the outcomes response rate,
      PFS and OS

      Study Design:

      A randomised multi-centre open-label phase II study

      Indication: Previously untreated T-Cell lymphoma No of Participants: 186 (93 patients in each
      arm)

      Main Eligibility Criteria:

        -  Histologically proven T-cell lymphoma of the following subtypes:

        -  Peripheral T-cell lymphoma NOS

        -  Systemic Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative
           cases only

        -  Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma

        -  Hepatosplenic gamma/ delta T-cell lymphoma

        -  Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma

        -  Bulky Stage I, Stage II, III or IV

        -  No prior chemotherapy regimen

        -  Patients aged 18 years or over.

        -  WHO performance status 0,1 or 2

        -  Adequate organ function:

        -  No Central Nervous System(CNS) or leptomeningeal involvement with lymphoma

        -  No treatment for lymphoma within 4 weeks of commencing trial therapy

        -  No known HIV, active Hepatitis B or C infection

      Treatment:

      CHOP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone every 21 days. GEM-P:
      gemcitabine, methylprednisolone, cisplatin every 28 days.

      Assessment Schedule:

        -  Patients will be reviewed at baseline and prior to each scheduled dose of treatment for
           toxicity

        -  Radiological tumour assessment will be done with CT scan after every 2 cycles in Arm A
           and after cycle 1, 3 and 4 in Arm B

        -  PET/CT scan will be performed at baseline and upon completion of treatment..

        -  Follow up after completion of treatment will be 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months then annually
           for 5 years in total. CT scan will be performed at 3 & 12 months.

        -  Following disease progression patients will be followed for survival every 3 months
           until death
