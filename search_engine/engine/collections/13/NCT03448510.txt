      (LUTS) in aged male. Oral medications, such as,α1-adrenoceptor antagonist and 5α-reductase
      inhibitors are the mainstay treatment options. However, some patients can not tolerate
      long-term use, due to either side effects or limited efficacy. Though transurethral resection
      or enucleation of prostate usually achieve significant symptom improvement, it's an end stage
      procedure and it is only reserved for carefully selected patients.

      The development of focal ablative therapy yields minimally invasive treatment option for
      primary tumors such as the liver, lung, pancreas, kidney, and prostate. Among the novel
      techniques are cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, and
      high-intensity focused ultrasonography. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a one of the
      ablation modalities using electric pulses to create nanoscale defects in the cell membrane.
      IRE is not dependent on thermal energy and is therefore causing minimum damage to the blood
      vessels, nerves and tissue architecture. The present is a randomized, controlled trial, with
      a main purpose of looking into the safety and feasibility of irreversible electroporation for
      patients with benign prostatic obstruction.
