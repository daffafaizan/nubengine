      Primary Care on anxiety, depression, stress, and chronic illness self-management in primary
      care patients receiving care in an urban, community, multi-cultural safety net healthcare
      system. The current comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial takes place in a
      larger sample, and investigates the impact of a refined MTPC curriculum on specific aspects
      of self-regulation such as action plan initiation, while examining potential mechanisms of
      change, including self-efficacy, perceived control, mindfulness, self-compassion, emotion
      regulation, and body awareness. Participants randomized to MTPC are compared with
      participants who are randomized to a low-dose comparator condition and receive a 1-hour
      introduction to mindfulness with a referral to community mindfulness resources. Outcome
      assessments are conducted at baseline and study weeks 8-10.
