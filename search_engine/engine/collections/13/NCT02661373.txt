      study of (+)-SJ000557733 (SJ733) in healthy adult volunteers. SJ733, is an investigational
      oral anti-malarial agent is a novel inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum plasma membrane
      protein (PfATP4). Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled using a leap frog,
      fixed dose escalation design with an adaptive component where 6 subjects are enrolled per
      dose cohort.

      Following successful completion of the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment resulting
      from the single-dose escalation portion of the study, a three-dose cohort study will be
      undertaken. It includes once per day oral dosing for 3 consecutive days. Both single and
      multi-dose cohorts of SJ733 in combination with cobicistat (boosted cohorts) will also be
      completed.

      After the study results from the single-dose cohorts of SJ733 in combination with cobicistat
      (boosted cohorts) were reviewed, multi-dose cohorts of SJ733 in combination with cobicistat
      (boosted cohorts) were not conducted and Phase 2 study planning initiated.
