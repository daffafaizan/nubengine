      soothe itching and ease the swelling from mosquito and horsefly bites as well as jellyfish
      and nettle stings. It accomplishes this by discharging 13KV at 0.7mA for 10 microseconds over
      the area of the bite or sting each time it is activated. In this clinical study, only the
      indication of reducing itching from mosquito bites will be evaluated. The theory behind the
      device's effectiveness is that multiple high voltage, low current electrical discharges over
      a bug bite or sting generates warmth over the immediate area of the bite or sting which
      inhibits the histamine release, thus relieving the symptoms of itching and swelling arising
      from the bite or sting. The device is a quick, simple and painless means of reducing the
      annoying symptoms of mosquito bites.
