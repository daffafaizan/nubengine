      cirrhosis. Mainstay of treatment for SBP is use of proper antibiotics. Although, several
      antibiotics including cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin are being used, it is unclear
      which drug is most effective. Our aim of study is to compare the efficacy of the three
      current antibiotics for the treatment of SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis.

      The primary hypothesis is that the efficacy of all the antibiotics will not significantly
      different. The expected success rates (infection resolution rates) are 83%, 87%, and 78% for
      cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin. This is non-inferiority trial. The level of
      significance is 5%. The power of this stuy is 80%. Non-inferiority margin is 15%. Therefore
      87 patients for each group are needed.
