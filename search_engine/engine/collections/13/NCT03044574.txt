    
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most common complication after major surgery, especially
      in high-risk patients. But the high-risk group is inhomogeneous. Some patients included in
      this group have an extremely high prevalence of postoperative venous thrombosis and pulmonary
      embolism, in whom the standard complex prophylaxis with elastic compression and standard
      anticoagulation is less effective. This is particularly so, in patients having a Caprini
      score of 11 and more, so that at the background of standard prophylaxis postoperative DVT is
      10 times higher. This group of patients needs a more effective protocol for VTE prevention.

      Sequential compression devices (SCD) combined with graduated elastic compression stockings
      (GCS) or without them were found to be effective in the prevention of VTE in high-risk
      patients, especially after neurosurgical interventions, even without the administration of
      anticoagulants. However, their efficacy in patients at "extremely high risk", having 11+
      Caprini scores has not been assessed yet. The aim of the current study is to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of VTE prophylaxis by the combination of graduated compression stockings
      (GCS), standard doses of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) and sequential compression
      device (SCD) in the mixed group of surgical patients at high and extremely high risk for
      venous thromboembolism

      The expected outcome of the study is a reduction of asymptomatic postoperative venous
      thrombosis rate in the hospital and reduction in all VTE during 6 months after discharge.
