      intestine is deficient. This leads to an increase of the concentration of fructose in the
      large intestine after the intake of fructose-rich meals. The exzess fructose is then degraded
      by intestinal microbes into CO2, CH4, H2 and short chain fatty acids causing symptoms like
      bloating, diarrhea, flatulence or stomach pain.

      The clinical diagnosis requires a hydrogen breath test after challenge with fructose. After
      an oral challenge with fructose the emerging hydrogen is measured in the expiratory air. A
      fructose malabsorption is diagnosed if the hydrogen in the expiratory air reaches 20ppm or
      more.

      In the course of this study the participants will take 2 hydrogen breath tests. Before each
      of these tests the participants will take either the active treatment (Fructosin(R)) or a
      placebo. The active treatment should reduce the exhaled hydrogen indicating a reduced
      concentration of fructose in the large intestine after fructose metabolization by the verum.
