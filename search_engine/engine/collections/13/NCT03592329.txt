      proven to be completely successful for alleviating pain, such as migraine headache. It is
      well documented, and recommended in the recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, that a
      multimodal approach is optimal for pain management. This study will evaluate a combination
      transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation and stress reduction training for migraine.

      Investigators will recruit participants who have migraines and randomize to one of four
      potential treatment arms (real or sham stimulation + real or sham stress reduction training).
      Brain imaging (MRI and PET) and clinical data will be collected before and after 8 weeks of
      the combination therapy.

      Healthy controls will also be recruited for collection of the same baseline brain imaging and
      clinical data, but with no treatment or second data collection phase.

      Findings from this research will help elucidate brain activity and inflammation associated
      with migraines and evaluate the efficacy of the combination therapy in reducing migraine.
