      one in two European adults. To meet the needs in terms of public health, contemporary
      medicine is gradually reintegrating the use of complementary therapeutic methods. Music
      therapy is a non-medical intervention that is particularly suited to pain problems. The
      therapeutic use of music is an economical, practical and safe method. Many clinical studies
      show that this activity promotes a significant decrease in pain. The ability of passive
      listening to music to reduce the perception of pain has been called "music-induced
      analgesia". The neuro-psycho-physiological mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain
      poorly understood. One hypothesis, still discussed, proposes that listening to music would
      stimulate, directly or indirectly, endogenous mechanisms of modulation of pain, stemming from
      the brainstem. In individuals undergoing nociceptive tonic stimulation, the specific neuronal
      activation induced by listening to music demonstrates the involvement of inhibitory
      descending pathways. A measurement of pain control mechanisms would account for the impact of
      music on central awareness.

      The purpose of this research is therefore to study the neuromodulatory effect of music on the
      sensory component of pain. The activation of pain control systems, through music, would pave
      the way for rehabilitation prospects for patients with a deficit of these controls.
