    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the titer of antibody for serogroups A, C, Y and
      W-135 and the safety of a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine 134612 given
      to toddlers who were primed with GSK Biological's Hib-meningococcal vaccine 792014. In
      addition, this study will provide immunogenicity and safety data on the co-administration of
      Infanrix with meningococcal vaccine 134612 as compared to Infanrix administered alone.

      Depending on the group the subject is assigned to, one or two blood samples will be taken out
      of the subject's arm during the study.

      The protocol posting has been updated following a protocol amendment.
