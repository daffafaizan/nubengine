    
      The study is an open-label randomized, multi-institutional, phase II clinical trial of
      Abraxane in combination with tigatuzumab or Abraxane as a single agent in patients with TNBC.
      Randomization (2:1) will be made from these two categories: TBNC patients with no prior
      chemotherapy for metastatic disease or TBNC patients with prior taxane (except Abraxane)
      therapy for metastatic disease. Patients randomized to Abraxane alone may be allowed to cross
      over to the combination of Abraxane + tigatuzumab if there is disease progression.
