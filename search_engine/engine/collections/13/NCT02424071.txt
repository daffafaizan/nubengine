      that make it a good premedication agent before anesthesia and surgery. Patients undergoing
      surgery in our establishment usually receive benzodiazepines as premedicants to reduce
      anxiety before the surgery. For bariatric patients benzodiazepines are usually avoided due to
      side effects which could be deleterious in obese patients.

      In this study the investigators intend to randomise 60 patients undergoing bariatric surgery
      into two groups. The participants will receive either melatonin or placebo on the evening
      prior to the surgery, and the same agent two hours before the surgery.

      The patients recovery from the surgery and anesthesia will be assessed using the Q0R15
      questionnaire. The patients will be asked to take the questionnaire once in the pre-operative
      clinic, again after the second melatonin or placebo pill before entering the operating room,
      and once more on the first post-operative day.
