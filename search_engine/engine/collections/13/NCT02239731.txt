    
      This is a phase II multicenter, randomized, double blind, vehicle controlled clinical study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Doxycycline Foam 4% for the prevention
      of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition Skin Toxicity, to Subjects with Cancer
      Receiving Cetuximab or Panitumumab on a weekly or every 2 weeks basis.

      The study consists of a screening visit, a treatment period where patients will be treated
      topically on the face twice daily for 5 weeks. A post-treatment follow up visit (4 weeks
      after end of treatment), will be performed only for subjects who have experienced unresolved
      possibly-related or related adverse events at the end of the treatment. Seven days after
      randomization and study drug initiation, subjects will start their EGFRI treatment.
