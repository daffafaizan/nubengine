    
      The first aim of the study is to compare the resistance index to erythropoietin (hemoglobin
      level / rHuerythropoietin dose) with L-carnitine versus placebo Double blind randomized study
      evaluating the supplementation with L-carnitine versus placebo in patients beginning chronic
      hemodialysis for less than 1 month.

      Primary outcome to compare rHuerythropoietin resistance index defined as hemoglobin level /
      rHuEPO dose ratio with L-carnitine and with placebo.

      Secondary endpoints to compare acylcarnitine / carnitine ratio, number of red blood cells
      transfusion, physical status, quality of life, hypotensive episodes, lipid profile, diabetes
      profile, albuminemia, c reactive protein.

      Several variables that influenced primary and secondary endpoints will be included in a
      multivariate analysis; albuminemia, c reactive protein, iron status, dialysis efficiency,
      protein intake, lipid intake, treatment with additional vitamins (C, B9, B6), treatment with
      statins, treatment of predialysis hypotension by midodrine, antihypertensive treatments.

      Statistical analysis:

        -  description of the cohort

        -  comparisons of each evaluated variables between the 2 treatments

        -  ANOVA study for repeated measurements from inclusion to month-12 for Hb / rHuEPO dose to
           compare the course of the ratio between each group in intention to treat analysis

        -  analysis of the ratio Hb / rHuEPO month by month and taking into account tempera
           withdrawal

      Following analysis in both intention to treat and per protocol analysis:

        -  acylcarnitine / carnitine ratio by ANOVA for repeated data

        -  number of predialysis hypotension by Chi2 test

        -  number of red blood cells transfusion by Chi2 test

        -  SF-36 physical status by comparison of mean

        -  SF-36 total score by comparison of mean

        -  lipid profile by ANOVA for repeated data

        -  HbA1c by ANOVA for repeated data

        -  variables that influenced primary and secondary variables will be analyzed by
           multivariate analysis

        -  statistical study of clinical events per month
