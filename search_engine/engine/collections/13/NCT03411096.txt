      complication, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, ileus, etc are related to opioid usage.
      Recently, local or regional pain nerve block, such as transversus abdominis plane block,
      wound infiltration, have been reported in several studies. Quadratus lumborum (QL) block was
      first introduced in the abstract of 2007 European Society of Regional Anesthesia. The effect
      is longer and more than that of transversus abdominis plane block because it works close to
      the spinal cord nerves. The QL block can be an effective pain control method for patients who
      underwent ileostomy closure. The aim of this study is to compare pain intensity after
      ileostomy closure between QL block (ropivacaine) group and placebo group (normal saline).
