        1. Interventional (parasternal group)

        2. Case control group The "parasternal group" of patients will receive the pre-operative
           parasternal block (20 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine per side) in association with infiltration
           with local anesthetic of access to thoracic drainage (drainage infiltration with 20 ml
           of 0.25% Ropivacaine) at the end of the intervention combined to General Anesthesia.

      The "case control group" will only receive drainage infiltration with local anesthetic and
      standard intraoperative management with opioids.
