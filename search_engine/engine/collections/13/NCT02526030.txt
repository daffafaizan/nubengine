      ongoing epidemiological and three-year longitudinal intervention program of first-episode
      psychosis (PAFIP) conducted at the outpatient clinic and the inpatient unit at the University
      Hospital Marqu√©s de Valdecilla, Spain. Conforming to international standards for research
      ethics, this program was approved by the local institutional review board. Patients meeting
      inclusion criteria and their families provided written informed consent to be included in the
      PAFIP. The Mental Health Services of Cantabria provided funding for implementing the program.
      None pharmaceutical company supplied any financial support to it.

      Study design: the severity scale of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive symptoms (SAPS) and
      the Scale for the Assessment of Negative symptoms (SANS) were used to evaluate
      symptomatology. To assess general adverse event experiences the Scale of the Udvalg for
      Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU), the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SARS) and the Barnes Akathisia
      Scale (BAS) were used to assess side effects. The adverse events were evaluated using the UKU
      Side effect rating scale. Those treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred at a rate of
      at least 10% in either treatment group are considered. Treatment-emergent akathisia (BAS) and
      extrapyramidal symptoms (SARS) were assessed by both baseline-to-end changes and newly
      emergent categorical changes. The same trained psychiatrist (BC-F) completed all clinical
      assessments.
