      recurrences are 33 percent overall, half of them had at least one recurrent seizure (the 3rd
      febrile seizures). After that the recurrent rate is 50-100 percent depend on their risk
      factors. A few studies found that multiple recurrent febrile seizures might associated with
      language developmental delayed, poor speed performance quotient, Attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorders. Moreover, seizures are upsetting both parents and children. During
      the febrile illness, the intermittent diazepam, continuous phenobarbital and valproate are
      effective for prevention of the recurrences. Because of the benign nature of a simple febrile
      seizures, the risks of side effects generally outweigh the benefits. However, there is no
      clinical guidelines for prevention of recurrent febrile seizures in the children who
      experienced multiple occurrences. The better prophylactic drug; safe, effective and easy to
      use, for prevention of recurrent febrile seizures in children with multiple recurrences might
      be needed. Clonazepam, the long half-life benzodiazepine, is commonly used for treatment of
      epilepsy may be effective in preventing recurrent febrile seizures. This study, a
      single-blind, randomized clinical trial, single dose clonazepam at the time of fever present
      compared with oral diazepam during the fever to prevent the recurrent febrile seizures.
