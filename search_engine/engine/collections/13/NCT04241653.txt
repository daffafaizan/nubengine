      movements can lead to an unsatisfactory surgical field and increase the risk of
      ophthalmological complications. Achieving adequate ventilation of children is considered
      another challenge due to huge variability in size and lung maturity. Spontaneous breathing is
      a popular mode of ventilation with several beneficial effects. Controlled ventilation without
      muscle relaxation using laryngeal mask airway is attractive option because the side effects
      of muscle relaxants are avoided. Therefore, this study will be conducted to evaluate effects
      of different modes of ventilation on pediatric cataract surgery aiming to a peri-operative
      stable anesthesia, better surgical satisfaction and post-operative recovery. This
      prospective, randomized, comparative clinical study will include 150 children who will be
      scheduled for elective cataract surgery under general anesthesia in Mansoura ophthalmology
      center over one year. Informed written consent will be obtained from parents of all subjects
      in the study after ensuring confidentiality.The study protocol will be explained to parents
      of all patients in the study who will be kept fasting prior to surgery. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to three equal groups according to computer-generated table of random
      numbers using the permuted block randomization method. In the first group, spontaneous
      ventilation will be maintained with pressure support; while in the two other groups,
      mechanical ventilation will be applied with pressure controlled modes. The collected data
      will be coded, processed, and analyzed using SPSS program. All data will be considered
      statistically significant if P value is â‰¤ 0.05.
