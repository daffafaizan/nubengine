      stimulation of this nerve can help with bladder, bowel, and sexual problems, and pelvic pain.
      Researchers do not fully understand how the nerve helps with these functions or how the
      anatomy is different between people. Successful stimulation of the pudendal nerve may help
      improve medical care for future patients with bladder problems, pelvic pain, bowel problems,
      and/or sexual problems.
