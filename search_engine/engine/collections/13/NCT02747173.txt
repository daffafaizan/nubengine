    
      Prospective observational study to assess:

        -  Bone predictive biomarkers for tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) response in renal cell
           carcinoma (RCC) patients with bone metastasis - Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)
           with TKI

        -  Comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of whole body magnetic resonance versus
           bone scintigraphy and versus Computerized tomography (CT) in the assessment of
           metastatic lesions at bone level and at other sites.
