      fetus. Various studies have clearly shown that antenatal thyroid disorders at both the mother
      and the fetus could cause in extreme situations of neurological consequences.

      At a broader scale, subtle alterations of thyroid hormone balance has been implicated in
      developmental delays and deviations of the IQ bell curve in newborn infants of mothers with
      elevated TSH.

      The clinical implications of these basic data and public health are yet to confirm.

      It has been clearly established that there is a moderate iodine deficiency in France with a
      decreasing gradient from west to east. In the Ile de France, there is a moderate iodine
      deficiency, this has led some teams to propose a systematic supplementation of all women in
      iodine.

      One way to target women who really need supplements systematic determination of urinary
      iodine tongue; this assay is reliable but is difficult to implement in an ad hoc practice at
      the individual level.

      Our team has expertise in the field of fetal thyroid, particularly in its sonographic and
      reference curves of the perimeter and diameter of the thyroid are now clearly established
      reliably.

      Knowing that iodine deficiency is causing a decline in maternal urine iodine with a
      phenomenon goitrigénèse and biological hypothyroidism and that some studies have shown that
      neonatal thyroid volumes were higher in iodine deficient mothers . We postulate that the
      measurement of fetal thyroid by our criteria can be correlated with maternal urinary iodine.

      If this were the case, we will have a simple test to identify iodine supplementation in
      pregnant women.
