    
      This study will prospectively collect and analyze whole blood T2 clinical research specimens
      and concomitant blood culture specimens from patients who have been referred for a blood
      culture per routine standard of care. Additional analysis of blinded, contrived (i.e. Candida
      spiked and un-spiked whole blood) specimens will be completed by study sites to augment the
      analysis of Candida positive blood specimens prospectively obtained from the study
      population.

      The clinical performance of the T2 Candida test on the T2 Dx Instrument will be evaluated by
      calculating the:

        -  Estimated clinical specificity of the T2Candida test results compared to Candida
           negative blood culture results in prospectively collected specimens, and the

        -  Estimated sensitivity of the T2 Candida test results compared to the known Candida
           positive status or Candida positive blood culture status of contrived specimens that
           have been spiked at clinically relevant concentrations of the target organisms and,
           where detected, to Candida positive blood culture results in prospectively collected
           clinical specimens.
