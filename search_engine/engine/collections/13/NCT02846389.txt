      breast cancer patients. Physical activity interventions can attenuate CRF. The proposed study
      is a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of exercise of structured moderate-intensity exercise
      intervention, delivered concurrently with radiotherapy, to reduce CRF and improve
      health-related quality of life among breast cancer patients. Eighty women with breast cancer
      scheduled to receive radiation therapy at Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC) will be
      randomized to one of the two trial arms:1) a facility-based aerobic exercise utilizing a
      portable stationary pedal exerciser; or 2) a control group. Intervention arm participants
      will exercise at the hospital either before or after their radiation treatment. Assessments
      will be conducted at baseline, 4 weeks into radiation course, and at 4-week follow-up visit.
      The outcome variables are CRF, biomarkers of inflammation, and health-related quality of life
      (QOL). The study will provide preliminary evidence on whether a short-term moderate-intensity
      exercise intervention might be effective in reducing CRF in women undergoing radiotherapy for
      breast cancer, and whether this effect is mediated by inflammation.
