      = RTRT, and each study period was separated by a 7 days washout period. After an overnight
      fast for at least 10 h, the subjects received a single oral dose of the R or T formulation of
      rivaroxaban tablets (20 mg) with 240 mL of water in a seated position. A total of 19 blood
      samples were collected at 0 (within 60 min prior to dosing) and 0.25,0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0,
      2.5,3.0,3.5, 4.0, 4.5,5.0, 5.5,6.0, 8.0, 12.0, 24.0, 36.0 ,and 48.0 hours after dosing.Blood
      samples were collected in a vacuum blood tube containing sodium heparin, gently mixed, and
      stored on ice-water mixture until sample processing and then centrifuged at 2000g at 2-8Â°C
      for 10 min.
