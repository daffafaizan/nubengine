      squamous cell cancers located in the middle and upper thoracic segments, whereas
      adenocarcinoma accounted for less than 20 percent.Unlike other malignancies, more than half
      of esophageal cancer were diagnosed as locally advanced at the time of diagnosis. Definitive
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an important treatment for locally advanced esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a new class of antitumor drugs. They are different from
      traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs and can target the regulatory molecules that play an
      inhibitory role in the tumor immune system.

      Recent clinical studies had shown that for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer,
      maintenance therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitor could significantly improve the
      overall survival for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after definitive concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy. Moreover, the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 has also been shown to be a
      promising anticancer agent in esophageal cancers. Therefore, the present study intended to
      give a standard dose (50.4Gy/28F) to locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma for
      radical chemoradiotherapy, and than to give the Sintilimab as consolidation therapy for 1
      year after completion of radiotherapy. At the time point of 6 weeks after radiotherapy, all
      participates need a full evaluation of the treatment response. In patients with residual
      disease, we would give them an additional radiotherapy boost to 61.2 Gy/34F under the
      guidance of PET-CT or ultrasound endoscopy.
