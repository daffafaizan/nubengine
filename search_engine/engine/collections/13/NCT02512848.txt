      standards, and then collect their endometrial sampling with Li Brush. Pathologists will help
      to decide the cytology obtained by Li Brush and histology diagnosis of the endometrial
      sampling. Comparing the pathological diagnosis results of cytology and histology,
      investigators want to prove the feasibility of cytology diagnosis of endometrial cancer in
      the postmenopausal period, as the same time, investigators intend to evaluate the possible
      factors that affecting the precision of Li Brush for endometrial cancer in the postmenopausal
      period.
