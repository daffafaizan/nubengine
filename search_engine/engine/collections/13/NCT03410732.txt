      cells (DCs) in treatment of gastric cancer. The autologous DCs are collected and enriched
      from peripheral blood, and then are activated by the proteins from autologous tumor cell
      membrane and cytokines in vitro. The efficacy endpoints include objective response,
      immune-cell response, recurrent rate after a radical surgery, progression-free survival and
      overall survival, and the safety endpoints include adverse events, laboratory tests, ECG,
      ECOG-PT, etc. All patients will be followed up for at least 2 years after treatment.
