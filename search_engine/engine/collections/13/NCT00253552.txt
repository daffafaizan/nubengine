      Primary

        -  Determine whether granulocyte engraftment can be achieved by day 30 in patients with
           hematologic disorders undergoing HLA-matched, related-donor, allogeneic bone marrow
           transplantation using filgrastim (G-CSF)-primed bone marrow.

        -  Determine the incidence of grade II or greater acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in
           patients treated with this regimen and post-transplantation immunosuppression with
           cyclosporine and methotrexate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether platelet and red blood cell engraftment can be achieved in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of limited and extensive chronic GVHD in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the event-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the post-transplant immune reconstitution in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Mobilization: Donors receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily on days -3 to
           -1 followed by bone marrow collection.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive 1 of the following conditioning regimens
           according to their primary disease:

             -  Total-body irradiation and high-dose chemotherapy comprising etoposide and
                cyclophosphamide

             -  High-dose chemotherapy comprising busulfan and cyclophosphamide

        -  Bone marrow transplantation: Patients receive G-CSF-primed allogeneic bone marrow on day
           0. Patients then receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 5.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine beginning on day -1
           and methotrexate on days 1, 3, and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
