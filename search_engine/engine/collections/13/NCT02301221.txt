      general population. Constipation frequency appears to augment with increasing age,
      particularly after 65 years old.

      Recent evidence in the literature and collected in our laboratory confirm that constipation
      can be a consequence of intestinal dysbiosis, with an increase of potentially pathogenic
      microorganisms and a decrease of potentially beneficial microorganisms. These alterations may
      affect the motility and metabolic environment of colon, especially the production of short
      chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

      A new and under-explored method to manipulate the gastrointestinal microbiota involves fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT). There has been growing interest in the use of fecal
      microbiota for the treatment of patients with chronic gastrointestinal infections (e.g. CDI)
      and other extraintestinal conditions (e.g. IBD). Similarly, we suppose that reshaping the gut
      microbiome with FMT would be effective for patients with slow transit constipation.
