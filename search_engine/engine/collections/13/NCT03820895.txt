      relative rareness, it reduces the quality of life. It is three-dimensional deformity where
      there is a lateral curving of the spine. The prevalence rate is 0.47-5.2%. The degree of the
      spinal curvature is evaluated by the Cobb angle. A Cobb angle of more than 10-15Â° is
      considered pathological. AIS occurs mostly in adolescents between 10 and 25 years of age, and
      is more prevalent among females.

      Scoliosis is considered severe and requires surgical intervention when the Cobb angle exceeds
      40o.

      The etiology of AIS is still unknown. Genetic and non-genetic factors have been attributed to
      cause AIS. Among non-genetic factors is bone mineral density (BMD), as bone quality plays an
      important role in the derangement of bony mechanical stability. The prevalence of AIS with
      osteoporosis is approximately 20-38%. Osteoporosis is known to lower the bone strength.

      Vitamin D plays an essential role in maintaining a healthy mineralized skeleton. It helps
      with calcium absorption, and patients with a deficiency of Vitamin D can have difficulties in
      producing new bone and maintaining their bone strength.

      In this study, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency among patients with AIS was
      evaluated. Gender differences in serum vitamin D levels, Cobb angles, BMD, and serum alkaline
      phosphatase levels were measured. Further correlation of Vitamin D with Cobb angles, BMD, and
      serum ALP levels was also evaluated.
