    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ Determine whether interval between palliative radiation therapy referral and palliative
      radiation therapy initiation is shorter for participants treated in a dedicated palliative
      radiation oncology clinic compared to the same interval for participants treated in a general
      radiation oncology clinic (historical control). The investigators' hypothesis is that this
      interval will be significantly shorter among the Palliative Radiation Oncology Chief's Clinic
      participants compared to historical control.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Determine whether each of the three component intervals within the overall interval from
           referral to treatment initiation (i.e., referral to consultation; consultation to
           simulation; simulation to treatment) is shorter for participants treated in a dedicated
           palliative radiation oncology clinic compared to the length of the same intervals for
           participants treated in a general radiation oncology clinic (historical control). The
           investigators' hypothesis is that each of these component intervals will be
           significantly shorter among the Palliative Radiation Oncology Chief's Clinic
           participants compared to historical control.

        -  Describe levels of and changes over time in patient-reported quality of life after
           palliative radiation therapy in the full sample, and in subgroups stratified by various
           radiation regimens. The investigators' hypothesis is that participants who receive a
           shorter course of palliative radiation (one day or five days) will have greater
           improvements in overall quality of life than participants who receive a ten-day course
           of palliative radiation.

        -  Determine median overall survival after palliative radiation therapy.
