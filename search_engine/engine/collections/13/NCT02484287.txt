      quality prospective analysis and compare the usage of standard catheters used by the
      department here at Oklahoma University, 1) the 35cm Codman Bactiseal rifampin and clindamycin
      impregnated catheter, 2) the Ventriclear EVD Antibiotic Catheter, and 3) the 36 cm Integra
      Hermatic large style ventricular catheter, in terms of incidence of infections, cost,
      duration of placement, and differences in placement technique.

      Proposed procedure: Monitor for infections associated with and related to EVD placement in
      patients and assess if infections rates are affected by usage of antibiotic impregnated EVD
      catheters.

      Importance of knowledge reasonably expected to result from the research: While use of sterile
      techniques and periprocedural antibiotics have traditionally been used to combat infection,
      infection rates remain above goal leading to the question of whether the antibiotic
      impregnated catheter should be added to the standard of care. With the knowledge gained, the
      investigators hope to decrease the amount of external ventricular drain related catheter
      infections and reduce use of prolonged antibiotics.
