      incontinence. Up to now, the investigators don't know whether treatment outcome in elderly
      women is as good as in younger premenopausal women. The International Incontinence Society
      states 2009: "There is no good evidence to date to suggest that "healthy" older women with
      urinary incontinence do not benefit from pelvic floor muscle training as much as younger
      women".

      In this retrospective study the investigators analyze patient charts from 2003-2008 regarding
      subjective patients and physiotherapists reported outcome after physiotherapy as well as for
      objective parameters like the need of an incontinence surgery in the follow-up of at least 2
      years.

      Eligibility criteria are age younger than 50 years (premenopausal) and age older than 65
      years and a urodynamically proven urinary incontinence. As incontinence forms the
      investigators include in this study the following three form: stress urinary incontinence,
      mixed urinary incontinence and urgency urinary incontinence.
