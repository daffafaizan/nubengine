      to determine the effect of culture media microdroplet geometry of different culture dishes
      and oil overlay on the pre implantation embryo development in dry incubators

      Method:

      We used sibling oocytes splits between two different dishes : GPS (life global, USA) and SPL
      (life science, Korea) with two different oils : light mineral oil (LM)(Irvine, USA) and
      paraffin oil (PO)(Vitro life, Sweden). All embryos cultured in dry incubators at the same
      conditions.
