      activity of the GA101 - Obinutuzumab in combination with high-dose methylprednisone (HDMP).
      We will evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first month of therapy as part of
      the phase Ib of this study. In the phase II we will determine response rate in an intention
      to treat analysis. In this study we will include CLL patients that have never received
      treatment as well as patients that have failed previous treatments.
