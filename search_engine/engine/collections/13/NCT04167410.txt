      operations are administered to diabetic patients more frequently compared to non-diabetic
      patients. Diabetes or hyperglycaemia in surgical patients increases mortality and morbidity
      rates during the perioperative period by 50% compared to non-diabetic patients. Maintaining
      patient blood glucose (BG) levels of within the target range during the surgical period is
      crucial to prevent postoperative complications. The target BG level has been modified in line
      with recent scientific findings; institutions (such as the American Diabetes Association),
      have prepared new guidelines for the management of glycaemia in critically ill and surgical
      patients. Insulin infusion is the most effective method to control glycaemia in patients with
      critical disease or in patients about to undergo major surgery. Therefore, current guidelines
      recommend the use of reliable and practical glycaemia control protocols during insulin
      infusion. These protocols should be learnt by all members of the team that provide
      healthcare. Existing studies suggest that glycaemic management protocols are effective
      methods to achieve the target BG range and decrease the prevalence of hyperglycaemia and
      hypoglycaemia in critically ill and major surgery patients in a reliable and effective way.
