      expressing cell lines. Regular FISH protocols will be finely tuned to fit immunophenotyping
      and cells in suspension constraints needed in IS-FISH. In a second time, the protocol will be
      applied to MM BM. Cells from BM aspiration will be processed and analysed on the ISX in
      Amiens. Based on last years local activity, this step is expected to last 2 years, so as to
      be able to obtain 5 samples from patients harbouring of each prototypical cytogenetic
      aberration above described. Inclusions will be guided by the results of PCS conducted before
      the first treatment initiation. Finally the results will be compared with PCS.
