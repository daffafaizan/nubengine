      prostate cancer since 2001. RALP offers some advantage such as reduced blood loss, sparing
      nerves, less postoperative pain. However, RALP require steep Trendelenberg position with
      pneumoperitoneum. It can cause increased airway peak pressure and unwanted hemodynamic effect
      under conventional volume controlled ventilation(VCV). Autoflow-VCV use decelerating flow,
      can reduce airway peak pressure and improve dynamic compliance.

      We will compare parameters(arterial blood gas analysis, airway compliance, etc) when each
      group applied VCV and autoflow-VCV during RALP.
