      The study will be conducted in two phases. Each phase will include at least 71 ERCP
      procedures. All consecutive patients undergoing ERCP will be included. For the first phase of
      the study the physicians performing the procedure will not be made aware of the study and
      also will not be briefed at the end of the procedure with the number of accessories used
      during the procedure and the dollar value of the accessories. For the second phase of the
      study, endoscopist will be briefed by the endoscopy manager after completion of each
      procedure about the total number of accessories used and the dollar value of the accessories
      used during the procedure.

      During the study period, all gathered information will be deidentified but the procedure
      indication and whether it was successful or not will be collected. Only deidentified
      information will be collected. Endoscopists will not be aware of the study to avoid a
      Hawthorne effect. The endoscopists resource utilization is what is being studied. They will
      be debriefed at completion of protocol.

      ERCP's requiring cholangioscopy (spyglass), stent removal alone, or just stent exchange will
      be excluded from the cost analysis, because of the atypical nature of the procedures and the
      number of accessories used during these procedures may not reflect the number of accessories
      used during a typical procedure. For both groups, if an endoscopic ultrasound is used for
      gaining biliary access it will be included in the cost analysis of this study. Both
      outpatient and inpatients will be included for both groups. All investigator patients will be
      excluded from the analysis.
