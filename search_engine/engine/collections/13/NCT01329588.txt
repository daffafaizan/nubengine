      infection than FSWs who roam the streets or part-time sex workers. These communities (from 3
      to 114 FSWs per site) will be aggregated into 18 clusters (one cluster was composed of 1-10
      FSW communities) based on geographical proximity. Over a one-year period, FSWs from these
      clusters presenting to dedicated clinics will be invited to participate. In addition, field
      workers will visit FSWs at home or at prostitution sites to provide information about the
      trial and seek participation.

      Clusters will be paired according to their size and demographic characteristics of FSWs and
      clients. Within each pair, one cluster will be randomly allocated to the intervention and the
      other to the placebo group using pre-coded envelopes. With an average of 35 FSWs per cluster,
      the required number of cluster pairs is estimated at 8.7 to detect a 50% reduction in NG
      prevalence, assuming a baseline prevalence of 25%, 80% power and 5% alpha error.
