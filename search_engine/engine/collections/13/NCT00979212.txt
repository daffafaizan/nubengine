      Primary

        -  Determine the mediastinal nodal clearance after completion of induction
           chemoradiotherapy with or without panitumumab in patients with stage IIIA non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess overall survival of these patients.

        -  Evaluate patterns of first failure in these patients.

        -  Determine the acute and late adverse events associated with these regimens.

        -  Assess surgical morbidities in patients with resectable disease at reassessment.

        -  Determine the correlation between pre- and post-treatment biomarkers (including
           epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ras mutation status) and outcomes
           (mediastinal nodal clearance and overall survival).

        -  Evaluate the prognostic value of plasma osteopontin and microRNA for overall survival.

        -  Assess the ability of FDG-PET/CT scan re-staging to predict outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive induction therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and
           carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients also undergo
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT)
           once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Beginning approximately
           6-12 weeks later, patients receive consolidation therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1
           hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive induction therapy comprising panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days
           1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes on days 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients also undergo IMRT or 3D-CRT once daily
           on days 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. Beginning approximately 6-12 weeks
           later, patients receive consolidation therapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and
           carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21.

        -  In both arms, patients with resectable disease and no disease progression may proceed to
           surgery (thoracotomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy) approximately 4-6 weeks after
           completion of induction therapy. After surgery, patients proceed to consolidation
           therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
