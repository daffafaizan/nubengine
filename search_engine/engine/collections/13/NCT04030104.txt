      design. The study will include 15 readers with an additional 5 as back-up readers depending
      on qualifications and availability. Readers that participated in the Seno PIONEER Study
      (NCT01943916) or the Reader-01 Feasibility Study (NCT03708393) are not eligible to
      participate as readers in this Pivotal Study.

      ImagioÂ® [Ultrasound (IUS) + Optoacoustic (OA)] (IUS)(IUS+OA) training will be completed prior
      to any reads taking place. Read 1 will be immediately followed by Read 2 within the same read
      session.
