      associated with better survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Multiple factors might affect body weight during treatment. Cancer-related symptoms can
      impair quality of life and appetite. Cachexia syndrome affects around 50% of colon cancer
      patients and is characterized by cancer-induced catabolism with involuntary weight loss (fat
      and muscle), patients have increased lipolysis and change in skeletal muscle metabolism,
      including increased energy expenditure at rest and protein degradation, and decreased protein
      synthesis. Besides these disease factors, treatment related side effects are common causes of
      weight loss, such as inability to ingest or digest food effectively due to nausea, vomiting,
      and malaise. Based on these factors and the hypotheses between tumour control and weight
      gain, monitoring the serial weight change can have practical value.
