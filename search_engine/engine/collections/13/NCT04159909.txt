      limited medications available for the condition and the majority of the medications are
      controlled substances, which may cause significant adverse effects and can be potentially
      addictive.

      The rationale for using transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) on a specific target area of the
      ear is based on anatomical studies suggesting that this area is the only place on the human
      body surface where there is afferent vagus nerve distribution (Mercante et al., 2018).
      Therefore, direct stimulation of the afferent nerve fibers on the ear can produce an effect
      similar to that by implanted device-generated VNS yet without the need of surgical
      intervention. Although taVNS has not been tested for treatment of AUD, it interestingly
      appears to be very similar to auricular acupuncture that has been widely used for AUD.
      However, acupuncture needs to be administered by medical providers who have undergone long
      trainings and own special licensure, which is usually unavailable in acute detoxification
      units where patients receive treatment for acute alcohol withdrawal.

      The pilot study will enroll 70 evaluable subjects who are in inpatient detoxification unit
      randomized to receive single-blind treatment with vagus nerve stimulation or sham stimulation
      (1:1, VNS: sham). Evaluable subjects are those who complete stimulations (VNS) or sham 5
      minutes twice a day for 4 days.
