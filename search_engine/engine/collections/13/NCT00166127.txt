      following cardiopulmonary bypass or prior to manipulation of the heart in the off pump group.
      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled into this study, 20 off-pump and 10 subjects on pump.
      Levosimendan is approved in Europe for the treatment of decompensated heart failure. It
      improved cardiac function without increasing energy demands. The subject's enrollment ends at
      Day 7 or day of discharge, whichever comes first.
