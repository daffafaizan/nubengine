      tissue sarcoma (STS) of the extremity and trunk. However, controversy remains as to whether
      RT should be delivered preoperatively or postoperatively. While both confer similar rates of
      local control, preoperative RT leads to a decrease in late tissue morbidities such as
      fibrosis, limb edema, joint stiffness and fracture as compared to postoperative RT. The
      reasons for this are likely multifactorial, but are in part related to total dose delivered
      (50 Gray (GY) preoperatively and 60-66 Gy postoperatively) and, based on a previous National
      Cancer Institute (Canada) Phase III randomized controlled trial, the much larger volume
      treated in the postoperative setting compared to that in the preoperative setting. The
      optimal radiation dose used in the postoperative setting is unknown but has been developed
      empirically and doses of 60-66 Gy are generally employed.However, investigators in
      Norway/Sweden and France have found equivalent local control rates for patients with negative
      surgical margins treated with 50 GY postoperativelyThe main concern with preoperative RT has
      centered on the risk of an increased rate of delayed wound healing and major wound
      complications. Although some studies suggest it may be possible to reduce the incidence of
      acute wound healing complications associated with pre-operative radiation than previously
      seen in the 2D RT era, this has yet to be tested in the phase III setting. IG-IMRT allows a
      much higher degree of conformality and accurate delivery of dose to the tumour while sparing
      surrounding normal tissue. This may allow similar rates of acute wound healing complications
      for pre- and postoperative RT in the treatment of STS.
