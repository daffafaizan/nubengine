      populations of type 1 diabetic (D) patients (pts) in order to better understand diabetic
      nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of renal failure. Objectives are: (a) to determine
      whether PTx can more readily arrest or reverse the early vs. the more established lesions of
      DN; (b) to continue studies of renal structural-functional relationships in DN, with emphasis
      on the multifaceted pathologic DN lesions, including glomerular, vascular, interstitial
      lesions and glomerular-tubular connections; (c) to continue studies of DN natural history and
      the role of renal biopsy in predicting outcome; (d) to quantitate and understand the basis of
      atubular glomeruli (AG) in DN; (e) to elucidate glomerular (glom) epithelial cell
      abnormalities in DN; (f) to study the glom extracellular matrix abnormalities of DN; (g) to
      study the recurrence of DN in the KTx; (h) to study the molecular/genetic basis of DN and
      develop cellular markers of DN risk; (i) to determine the long-term (10-15 yr) structural
      consequences of cyclosporine (CSA) on the native kidneys of PTx recipients; and (j) to
      determine the shorter-term (5 yr) consequences of Prograf on the native kidneys of PTx
      recipients and compare these with those seen after 5 years of CSA treatment. Together, these
      studies will help to elucidate the pathogenesis and natural history of DN, unravel some of
      the molecular and genetic aspects of this disease, describe the dynamics of DN reversal in
      PTx pts, and recurrence in KTx pts and expand our knowledge of the nephrotoxic effects of
      calcinosis inhibitors.
