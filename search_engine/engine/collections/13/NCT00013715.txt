      viral infective process in the nasal epithelium, (2) the effect of ozone exposure on
      RV-induced inflammatory gene expression, mediator release and inflammatory cell influx into
      the upper and lower airways, and (3) the interactive effects of ozone and RV on airway
      reactivity. This information will improve our understanding of the risk associated with
      oxidant pollutant exposure in this population of individuals in whom RV infection may
      represent a significant health concern.
