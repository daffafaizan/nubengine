      The causes are multifactorial and include altered pulmonary mechanics, inefficient gas
      exchange, decreased muscle mass, and psychological status, which all lead to a progressive
      detraining effect. Essentially both the pathology and the functional manifestations of
      bronchiectasis increase the demand for inspiratory muscle work and that contribute to dyspnea
      and exercise limitation.

      In recent studies reduced strength of respiratory muscles are investigated in bronchiectasis
      and can be contribute the exercise limitation. Additionally IMT has shown to improve
      respiratory muscle function, exercise tolerance and dyspnea in patients with bronchiectasis.
      Despite this, the number of studies are inadequate and so the optimal training protocol
      remains still to be defined. In this study the researchers want to investigate the effects of
      high-intensity inspiratory muscle training in functional results in patients with
      bronchiectasis.
