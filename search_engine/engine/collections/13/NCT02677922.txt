      of the study to determine a safe and effective dose of AG-120 administered with azacitidine
      for future studies.

      The Phase 1b (AG-120 expansion) stage will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical
      activity of oral AG-120 when administered with Subcutaneous azacitidine.

      The Phase 2 stage of the study will no longer include AG-120 administered with azacitidine
      (IDH1 subjects) and IDH1 patients will not longer be included in the azacitidine alone arm.
