    
      1. The study will compare the effect of glutamine and placebo on resting energy expenditure
           (REE) in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) by comparing the change in REE ratio
           between baseline and 12 months.

        2. The study investigates the effect of oral glutamine and placebo on body composition in
           children with SCA by comparing the difference in body mass indexes (BMIs) and percent of
           body fat (DEXA Scan) between baseline and 12 months of treatment in the two groups.

        3. This Study will investigate the effect of oral glutamine and placebo on growth in
           children with SCA by comparing the Z scores for one year before baseline to 1 year while
           on study.

        4. This study will investigate the effect of oral glutamine and placebo in children with
           SCA by comparing the difference in the levels of plasma and red blood cell glutamine
           between baseline and 12 months of treatment in the two groups.

        5. This study will investigate the clinical effects (strength and exercise endurance) of
           oral glutamine and placebo in children with SCA by comparing the difference between
           baseline and 12 months of treatment in the two groups.

        6. This study will evaluate quality of life in children with SCA who have glutamine or
           placebo for 12 months.

        7. This study will evaluate the changes in REE over time in a small group of patients that
           will have REE measurement at months 3, 6, and 9. This objective will be offered to all
           patients, but will be "additional studies" that are not required to participate in the
           protocol.
