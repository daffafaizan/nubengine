      where the blurred biological lens is replaced with an artificial clear lens (IOL). Most
      people who operate achieve full vision. Nevertheless, serious complications may occasionally
      occur, and one of these is dislocation of the entire complex with IOL and lens capsule. This
      requires surgical treatment.

      In this study the investigators want to compare two different surgical methods used in late
      dislocation of IOL inside the capsule after cataract surgery. Patients will be randomly
      affiliated to either the suturing of existing IOL / capsule complex, or lens exchange to an
      IOL fixed to the iris.

      The focus of the trial will be especially on complications and other eye changes in the early
      stages of surgery. Today, little data is available on these topics, and the investigators
      believe that new knowledge can bring us closer to a response to preferred operating
      techniques and an optimal drug drop regime for the patient group.
