      I. To determine the magnitude of tissue testosterone suppression by abiraterone acetate in
      metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (resistant to luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist or orchiectomy Â± antiandrogen) after one month of
      treatment to establish tissue based mechanism of action.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ability of abiraterone acetate to suppress tumor testosterone after 12
      weeks of treatment.

      II. To determine tissue testosterone from metastasis at time of progression during
      abiraterone acetate treatment.

      III. To determine response to dose escalation of abiraterone acetate at clinical progression.

      IV. To determine potential mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate by analyzing
      pharmacokinetics at clinical progression, tissue androgen levels at baseline and at
      radiographic progression, evaluating wild type and splice variant androgen receptor (AR)
      levels at baseline and at time of progression and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA)
      microarray at progression.

      V. To determine if micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA) acquired from peripheral blood reflect
      molecular changes in tumor metastases and are a potential biomarker for mechanisms of
      sensitivity and resistance.

      VI. To evaluate pharmacokinetics of dose escalated abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) at 1000
      mg twice daily.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and prednisone PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
