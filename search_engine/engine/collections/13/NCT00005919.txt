      comparison of two types of patients and to compare them to normal controls. The two types of
      patients are those with pigment dispersion (PDS) with normal intraocular pressure (IOP) and
      those with PDS and elevated IOP. The hypothesis to be tested is that a developmental
      abnormality of the iris pigment epithelium (IPE) and the dilator muscle is the fundamental
      defect responsible for the pigment dispersion. This defect may involve other structures of
      the eye such as the ciliary and retinal pigment epithelium. The results of pupillography in
      PDS with or without elevated IOP and asymmetric PDS (one eye versus fellow eye) will be the
      outcome parameters.
