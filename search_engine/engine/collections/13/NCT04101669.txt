      System when used with moderate intensity lifestyle and dietary counseling and medical
      management, in patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 8.0% and ≤10%, and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and ≤
      50kg/m2, whose diabetes medications consist of at least dual therapy for 3 months, excluding
      insulin, yet have not achieved adequate HbA1c control (<7%).

      Specific objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine if the EndoBarrier System significantly improves glycemic control

        2. To determine that the EndoBarrier System can be safely used to improve glycemic control
