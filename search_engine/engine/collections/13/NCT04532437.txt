      increases attractiveness]. Raising awareness and educating students and adults regarding
      practices for skin cancer prevention are critical since skin cancer is increasing rapidly
      worldwide. Skin cancer preventive interventions for adolescents are needed to improve their
      motivation for sun safety behavior. This pilot study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes,
      and practices regarding skin cancer prevention in young adults and to determine the impact of
      artificial intelligence-based simulation of facial skin aging on their attitudes regarding
      skin cancer prevention.
