      sequences and 3 periods, employing a Latin square assignment. Using this design, each subject
      will function as his/her own control. This will reduce variability and thus increase the
      chances of observing true effects between treatment periods (effects of treatment compared to
      placebo). In each treatment period, assessments will be performed at baseline prior to dosing
      and post dosing, enabling a change from baseline analysis and enabling the possibility to
      compare baseline conditions for each treatment period. The treatment period in each treatment
      is 28 days (4 weeks), which is supported by the pre-clinical toxicology program. In mouse
      studies, a 4-week period was sufficient to observe clinically relevant effects.
