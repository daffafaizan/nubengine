      women. More than half of patients diagnosed will die within the first year. Given these
      concerning facts, we are in need of novel methodologies to diagnose patients at earlier
      stages of the disease, more accurately predict treatment response / failure and predict
      overall survival.

      The use of CTC has been investigated and shown to predict progression free survival and
      overall survival in metastatic breast cancer, and recommended as a breast cancer tumor marker
      by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. There have also been relationships between
      CTC's and survival, shown in metastatic colorectal and prostate cancer. However, CTC's have
      not been thoroughly investigated in non-small cell lung cancer. This trial will assess if the
      detection of circulating tumor cells could be used as a tool to help further advance
      treatment for NSCLC patients.
