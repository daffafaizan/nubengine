        -  To describe the toxicities of R115777 (tipifarnib) in adult patients with
           myeloproliferative disorders.

        -  To assess hematologic responses, including changes in white blood cell count and
           erythroid responses.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess bone marrow cytogenetic responses to R115777.

        -  To analyze for the presence of neuroblastoma (N)/Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
           homolog (K-Ras) mutations in patient bone marrow samples.

        -  To analyze the effect of R115777 on Ras /DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily A, member
           1(HDJ-2) farnesylation in patient bone marrow/peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

        -  To analyze the effect of R115777 on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation in
           patient bone marrow mononuclear cells.

        -  To perform colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) cytotoxicity assays using
           patients' hematopoietic cells with R115777.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a good hematologic response may continue treatment at the
      discretion of the treating physician.
