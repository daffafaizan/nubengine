      your brain which secretes hormones. At the Royal Hallamshire Hospital the investigators are
      currently conducting a study into the effects of local anaesthetic (a medicine which causes
      numbness) injection on patients undergoing this particular type of operation.

      After patients are anaesthetised (asleep) but before surgery starts the surgeon injecst a
      local anaesthetic solution into the nose. This is routine practice and is done to provide
      pain relief afterwards and also to decrease the amount of bleeding during the operation to
      ensure that the surgeon has a good view.

      The investigators have known for a long time that local anaesthetic affects the heart rate
      and blood pressure, however the investigators would like to describe exactly how, in much
      more detail.
