      investigators aim to test whether a mechanistic link can be established between that synaptic
      inhibitory dysfunction, systems levels changes in oscillatory synchrony and regulation of
      inhibition and treatment with Lovastatin in these two neurodevelopmental disorders. The
      investigators will explore this link through the application of complementary quantitative
      measures (putative biomarkers), such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) applied to the same group of adult
      patients before and after the lovastatin or placebo intake during three days.

      The intervention comprehends three sessions: the first two visits will occur in the same week
      and the third visit will take place 4 to 6 weeks later. In the first visit (baseline
      assessment), participants will perform neuropsychological, EEG, MRS and TMS assessment. In
      the other two visits participants will repeat EEG, MRS and TMS assessments to study possible
      post- intervention effects. Participants will intake 60mg of Lovastatin or Placebo during
      three consecutive days before the second and the third visits.
