      the Step Up Wellness Program among people with depression who also are physically inactive
      and smoke cigarettes.

      Participation in this study will last 6 months. All participants will complete a baseline
      survey and then be assigned randomly to receive the Step Up Wellness Program or usual care
      for 3 months. Participants in the Step Up program will receive weekly phone calls from a
      study health coach. During these calls, the coach will discuss ways to improve and manage
      mood, increase physical activity, and prepare to quit smoking. Participants will also be
      given materials to review and homework assignments between calls. Participants in the usual
      care group will receive standard care which includes referrals for treatment of depression
      and nicotine dependence, as well as self-help information on physical activity. All
      participants will be surveyed at 4 and 6 months post-enrollment. Participants will also
      provide qualitative feedback on the program.
