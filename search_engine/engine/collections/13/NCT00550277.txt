      Histones are components of the core proteins of nucleosomes, and acetylation and
      deacetylation of these proteins play a role in the regulation of gene expression. HDAC
      activity is known to be increased in many types of malignant cells; HDAC inhibitors have been
      shown to induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in cultured tumor cells.
      Since this tumor-associated mechanism is common to many types of cancer, HDAC may have a
      broad role in cancer treatment.
