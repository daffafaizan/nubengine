      among college students, with rates comparable to the general population. As such, brief,
      scalable and transdiagnostic prevention efforts targeting CMDs are needed. In order to
      address this need, this study aims to evaluate the impact of a single session intervention
      (SSI) utilizing growth mindset (GM) on CMD symptom severity and investigate the mediating
      role of changes in modifiable risk factors in the relationship between intervention and CMD
      symptom reduction. The intervention will adapt existing GM interventions for college students
      to engage mechanisms in the prevention and management of common mental disorders including
      engagement in modifiable risk factors. College students will be randomly assigned to complete
      either a GM intervention or a psychoeducation control.
