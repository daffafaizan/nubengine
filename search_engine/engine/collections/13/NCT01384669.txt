      papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) by the World Health Organization (WHO), emphasizing
      on their benign behavior, probably of little clinical significance, which do not affect
      patients' survival. However, some reported that PTMCs may have aggressive behavior, can cause
      locoregional recurrences, cervical lymph node metastases, and even distant metastases. But
      till now, the characteristics of PTMCs with early lateral neck node metastasis were only
      reviewed and described by the clinicopathological parameters, and no analysis of PTMCs by the
      gene level is available. In these study, we investigate the genetic expressional alteration
      which influenced on the early lateral neck node metastasis in thyroid papillary
      microcarcinoma.
