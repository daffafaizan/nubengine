      obesity and ethnicity on he development of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The proposed
      approach will seek to clarify for the first time if BMI is a biological factor that regulates
      aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression and epigenetic activity at breast cancer
      susceptibility and hormone receptor genes based on Hispanic or non-Hispanic white (NHW)
      ethnicity. If successful, the proposed experiments have the potential to highlight the role
      of overweight and obesity for dietary prevention of TNBC and to underscore the consideration
      of breast cancer screening among overweight/obese Hispanic women. Additionally, this study
      will provide the opportunity to begin testing the utility of AhR as a biomarker of TNBC
      development related to BMI and ethnicity.
