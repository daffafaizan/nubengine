      a sequential set of three groups of volunteers with different doses of the drug, the total
      number of volunteers who received the drug will be at least 36 people.

      Given the fact that the drug is investigated for the first time with the participation of the
      people, will initially be admitted to hospital on 5 volunteers who will receive the
      investigational drug in the 1 dose The total number of recombinant pseudo-adenoviral
      particles (2.5 ± 1.25) x 10*10 VP/dose). If the safety of the drug is confirmed by the
      results of observation on the 7th day of the study, the study will continue with the
      participation of 7 more volunteers in this dosing group.

      Further, according to a similar scheme (each time after an interim safety assessment on day
      7), the study will include volunteers receiving the drug at a dose of 0.5 ml (Total amount of
      recombinant pseudo-adenoviral particles (1.0 ± 0.5) x 1011 VP/dose), particles/dose and 0.5
      ml, -The total number of recombinant pseudo-adenoviral particles (2.5 ± 1.25) × 1011 VP/dose
      .
