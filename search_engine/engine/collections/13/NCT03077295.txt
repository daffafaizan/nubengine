      components (in particular fibre and protein) in a healthy diet. The information gained from
      this research will lead to better policy advice, particularly in relation to healthy weight
      management, metabolic control, mental health and intestinal health. It will also lay the
      foundations to produce healthier primary products and aid the food industry in developing new
      and healthier products (e.g. products that aid hunger control and satiety). This will be
      addressed through four interlinked objectives:

      O1: Healthy weight management and improved metabolic and mental health O2: Identification of
      gut bacteria and compounds of relevance to vascular and gut health O3: Linking fibre
      consumption to intestinal microbial communities and health O4: Mathematical modelling of
      interactions between diet and gut microbial communities
