      in the hospital room. If an individual is unable to complete the instrument, the participant
      may have another individual input answers on the electronic device. Hospitalized patients (n
      = 1240: 620 in Phase 1 and 620 in Phase 2) with a variety of chronic diseases will be
      recruited into the study. Study coordinators will recruit participants with the following
      diagnoses: heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute myocardial infarction,
      coronary artery bypass graft, pneumonia, total knee or hip replacement, and stroke. These
      diagnoses were chosen because of the frequency with which patients are readmitted after
      discharge.
