    
      This three-year study will be divided into two phases. Phase I will be devoted to developing
      and refining an instrument, the Pre-PeCKS, into a valid and reliable data gathering
      observational tool. In Phase II the Pre-PeCKS will be used to develop a predictive model that
      can discriminate between those with and without MSD-UE. The model developed will be used to
      select the construction and weighting of the subscales of the final instrument, the PeCKS.
      The specific aim of Phase I is to evaluate the inter- and intra- rater reliability and the
      concurrent criterion-related validity of the Pre-PeCKS; the specific aim of Phase II is to
      use information gathered using the Pre-PeCKS to develop a diagnostic instrument that can
      identify those with and without MSD-UE. In Phase I, 50 subjects will be digitally recorded
      while typing while at the same time the kinematics of their hands will be recorded using a
      VICON™ motion analysis system and a keyboard force plate. The video of the typing performance
      will be rated by independent raters using the Pre-PeCKS and reliability statistics will be
      calculated. Concurrent validity will be obtained by comparing the results of the VICON™ with
      the results of the Pre-PeCKS. In Phase II, 20 typists with MSD-UE and 20 typists without
      MSD-UE will be rated using the Pre-PeCKS. Variables from the Pre-PeCKS along with other
      variables of interest will be used to build models that can discriminate between those with
      and without MSD-UE. The best model will be used to assign weights to Pre-PeCKS parameters and
      to develop how subscores will be combined to best identify those with MSD-UE. This
      information will be integrated into the final tool, the PeCKS. The PeCKS can then be used to
      identify an individual who have keyboarding styles that have been associated with MSD-UE.
