      characterized. The present study will obtain detailed information on vincristine
      pharmacokinetics in patients being treated for standard risk ALL according to or on CCG
      protocols 1952/1962/1991. A limited sampling strategy will be developed, and the interpatient
      and intrapatient variability of vincristine pharmacokinetics in children will be studied. A
      correlation between vincristine neurotoxicity and vincristine pharmacokinetics will be
      sought.
