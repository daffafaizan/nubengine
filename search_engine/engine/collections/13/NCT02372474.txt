      are self sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time. They have the
      remarkable potential to develop in many different cell types in the body. Premature ovarian
      failure (POF) is the loss of ovarian function in women less than 40 years. It is associated
      with sex steroid deficiency, amenorrhea, infertility, and elevated serum gonadotropins. This
      work aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Autologous Mesenchymal sc (MSC)
      transplantation in women suffering from POF. Out of 112 high risk patients for POF, 10 cases
      were diagnosed as POF. The ten POF patients were scheduled for MSC transplantation at Al-
      Azhar University Hospitals. MSC preparation from the bone marrow of the iliac crest was
      laparoscopically injected in the ovaries. Endometrial fractional biopsy is
      histopathologically (HP) and Immunohistochemically (IH) stained and evaluated according to
      Edessy stem cells score (ESS) (1).
