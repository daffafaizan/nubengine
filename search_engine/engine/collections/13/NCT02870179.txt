    
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a SpO2 hypoxia evaluation of the Oxitone Medical
      Oxitone 1000 pulse oximeter. The Oxitone 1000 pulse oximeter will be evaluated during
      non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SpO2 in comparison to a Reference Pulse
      Oximeter. The end goal is to show the SpO2 accuracy performance of the Oxitone 1000 and if
      needed, use the data to make improvements prior to an arterial blood hypoxia study.

      A Clinimark 3900 Reference Pulse Oximeter or Nellcor N-600x will be used for the SpO2
      calibration. There are no risks or adverse device effects to be assessed. There are no
      contraindications for use in the proposed study / study population

      The Control Pulse Oximeter, GE Healthcare (Datex-Ohmeda) 3900, an FDA cleared device, is used
      to monitor the oxygen saturation levels real time throughout the study for subject safety and
      to target stable plateaus. This device is used to assess the stability of the data.
