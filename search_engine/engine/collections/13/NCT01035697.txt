      and RANTES] but not anti-inflammatory cytokines released during the perinatal period have
      been associated with the development of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and cerebral palsy
      (CP) in near term and term infants. However, because blood samples were obtained on any day
      between day 1 and 18, these data cannot distinguish between prenatal and postnatal effects on
      neurological outcome. Furthermore, very low birth weight infants who are at the highest risk
      have not been studies.

      The goal of this study was to measure pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels
      at various times in the perinatal period (at birth up to day of life 21), since they may be
      elevated at different points in the disease process. Blood samples (whole blood spots, dried
      on filter paper) were obtained on day 1 within 4 hours after birth, and on days 3, 7, 14, and
      21. Neurodevelopmental assessments were conducted at 18-22 months corrected age.
