    
      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-CD133 (cluster of differentiation antigen 133 ) vector (referred to as CART-133
      cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-133 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-133 TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-133 cell
      infusions.

      II. To determine if the CD137 transgene is superior to the TCR zeta only transgene as
      measured by the relative engraftment levels of CART-133 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells
      over time.

      III. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-133 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.

      IV. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells determine tumor cell killing by
      CART-133 cells in vitro.

      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD133, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-133 (loss of engraftment).

      VI. Determine the relative subsets of CART-133 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).
