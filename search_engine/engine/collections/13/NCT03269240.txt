      delivering key content and improving the competencies of health workers. In facility-based
      driven simulation-based LDHF trainings, providers are not removed from clinical practice for
      the extended periods of time, and a heavy emphasis is placed on simulation with practice and
      feedback.

      The Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP) in Nigeria is working in selected health
      facilities in Ebonyi and Kogi States to improve the quality of care received by mothers and
      newborns on the day of birth using high-impact evidence-based lifesaving interventions. The
      simulation-based LDHF/m-Mentoring evaluation comparing it to the traditional group-based
      training will contribute to the body of knowledge on this approach.

      The study design is cluster randomized control trial. Sixty (60) health facilities will be
      selected from the list of 120 facilities which are supported by MCSP and randomized to
      intervention and control group. Selection will be based on caseload, level of service
      delivery, and ownership. Thereafter, these will be randomly assigned to simulation-based
      LDHF/m-Mentoring Group (intervention arm) or Group-Based Training Group (control arm).
