      contributions of various eye tissues, in particular those associated with the vision
      photochemical processes. Eye blood flow changes are involved in the physiopathology of
      several frequent eye diseases susceptible to lead to blindness (glaucoma,age-related macular
      degeneration, venous or arterial occlusions). Numerous systematic pathologies can also alter
      eye blood flow (diabetes, sleep apnea, arterial high blood pressure, inflammation).

      The difficulty to measure blood flow in humans is connected with the necessity of using not
      invasive, reliable and reproducible techniques.

      There is several quantitative approaches to study eye blood flow which do not answer all
      these specifications. The laser doppler velocimetry allows movement speed measures but not
      vessel diameter. Optical coherence tomography doppler allows a simultaneous diameter and
      speed of travel (movement) measures, but presents a limited spatial resolution and thereby
      not easily reproducible vessel diameter measures.

      The investigators propose development of a technique allowing a simultaneous diameter and
      velocity measure of these vessels.
