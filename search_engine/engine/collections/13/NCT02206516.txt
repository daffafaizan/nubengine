      domains during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) and
      Ultrasound tagged near infrared spectroscopy (UT-NIRS), to assess functional brain changes as
      a result of a treatment protocol with Transcaranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in
      adults suffering from attention deficit disorder (ADD).
