      provinces. The RDT under evaluation (index test) is the CL Detectâ„¢ Rapid Test (InBios, USA);
      a membrane-based amastigote antigen (peroxidoxin) detection test. The reference standard
      consists of two tests: direct examination of skin smears and PCR. For each patient, the
      health professional takes one dental broach sample and four skin smear samples from a single
      lesion. The dental broach sample is used for the RDT, which is done once. The skin smear
      samples are sent to provincial laboratories for microscopy testing and to reference
      laboratories in Morocco and Belgium for PCR testing by ITS1 PCR, Hsp70 genotyping and
      parasite load determination. Readers of index and reference tests do not have access to
      clinical information or any other test results. The results of the test under evaluation
      (RDT) and the molecular tests (PCR) are not communicated to the patient or her/his physician,
      as case management has to follow current clinical guidelines.
