        -  Determine the toxicity of LMB-9 immunotoxin in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of
           the colon, rectum, pancreas, esophagus, or stomach with overexpression of the Lewis-Y
           antigen.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive LMB-9 immunotoxin IV continuously on days 1-5. Patients with stable or
      responding disease after completion of the first course receive additional courses every 4-5
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LMB-9 immunotoxin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
