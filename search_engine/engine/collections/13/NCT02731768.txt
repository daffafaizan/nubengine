    
      This 4-month randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the short-term efficacy
      and feasibility of a novel, social support-enhanced behavioral weight control intervention.
      Participants will be recruited via email listservs, fliers, and word of mouth. They will be
      randomized to a standard behavioral weight control treatment (SBT) or a social
      support-enhanced behavioral weight control treatment which receives the same intervention as
      SBT plus social support resources (specifically, additional self-monitoring technologies) for
      weight loss.
