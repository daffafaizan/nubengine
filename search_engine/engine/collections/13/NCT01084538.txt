    
      This study is a non-interventional, observational study in which Zemplar® Injection is
      prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local Summary of Product
      Characteristics (SmPC) with regards to dose, population and indication. The study population
      consists of participants receiving hemodialysis in whom the diagnosis of secondary
      hyperparathyroidism has been established, and who are not adequately controlled with the oral
      VDR activator (calcitriol or alfacalcidol). Participants will be included via consecutive
      sampling. To be included, participants should have a clinical indication to initiate
      treatment with Zemplar® Injection due to: (1) a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism
      and (2) because they require a change in treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism (e.g.
      due to a lack of effectiveness of the previous treatment). Each participant will be observed
      during his/her Zemplar® Injection treatment regimen for a maximum period of 12 months.
