      associated with higher maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Neonatal complications
      are primarily due to prematurity and to ascending infection of the amniotic cavity
      (chorioamnionitis), leading to a high rate of cerebral palsy, intracranial hemorrhage,
      sepsis, pneumonia, and death. Every physician is confronted with an extremely difficult and
      at the same time of paramount importance decision, when it comes to establish the timing of
      the delivery of a premature fetus with PPROM. The balance is between delivering a premature
      infant exposed to all the risk of prematurity, and keeping the baby in utero, prolonging the
      exposure to an adverse intrauterine milieu. At present, there are no objective and
      reproducible tools to help in this decision-making process. The technique most frequently
      used for fetal surveillance is cardiotocography (CTG). Assessment of the fetal heart rate is
      classified subjectively as 'reassuring' or 'not reassuring'. Dawes and Redman have suggested
      computerized CTG (cCTG), which eliminates inter- and intra-observer variability, identifying
      several objective parameters to determine fetal well-being. After the multicentre
      TRUFFLE-Study, cCTG became the best tool to manage fetuses with intrauterine growth
      restriction (IUGR). However, the use of cCTG has never been investigated in prospective
      studies to assess its role in the management of fetuses with PPROM. Of note, amniotic fluid
      concentration of glucose, lactate, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-8
      (MMP-8) have been associated with neonatal septicemia, chorioamnionitis, preterm birth,
      and/or fetal inflammatory response syndrome in women with pPROM.
