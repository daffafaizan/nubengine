    
      This study consists of several phases: screening (-28 to -1 days), dose adjustment/treatment
      (Day 1 [treatment baseline] to Day 30), initial steady-state treatment (post-Day 30 through
      Week 52 post-baseline), a treatment interruption period (Week 52 through approximately Week
      54), long-term steady-state treatment (approximately Week 54 through study completion), and
      safety follow-up (30 to 37 days after a participant withdraws from or completes the study).
      The Primary Analysis Period is from baseline through Week 52. The Extension Period is from
      Week 52 through study completion (that is, participant withdrawal, the study is terminated,
      eliglustat tartrate becomes commercially available, or where applicable, specific regulatory
      requirements have been met).
