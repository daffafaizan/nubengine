      Sevoflurane when used over 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration, dilates intracranial
      vasculature and increases intracranial pressure. On the other hand, propofol decreases
      intracranial blood pressure and intracranial pressure is maintained or decreases.

      Optic nerve sheath diameter is a feasible diagnostic tool in evaluating intracranial
      pressure. Female patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy or myomectomy
      are evaluated.
