    
      Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a multifactorial metabolic burden whose metabolic features include
      alterations in GLP-1 secretion and ultimately hunger/satiety circuit derangement.
      Manipulating the composition of the diet in order to promote GLP-1 secretion may represent a
      promising lifestyle strategy for obesity and T2D management.

      The objective of this study was to assess the post-prandial profile of appetite- regulating
      hormones and assessing the post-prandial appetite ratings using a Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS), as well as measuring the fasting and postprandial glucose/insulin responses in
      overweight and/or obese, well controlled patients with T2D.

      Twelve T2D patients (M:F = 7:5) aged 63.1Â±8.5 years were enrolled in a randomized,
      controlled, crossover trial. Subjects consumed on two different days, at one-week interval,
      an experimental High Fiber Vegetarian meal (HFV) rich in dietary carbohydrate and fiber in
      comparison with a standard, Mediterranean-like meal (MED). The two meals were isocaloric.
      Appetite ratings, glucose/insulin and gastrointestinal hormone responses were assessed either
      at fasting and every 30' until 210' for GLP-1 and Oxyntomodulin and 240' for glucose and
      insulin after the ingestion of the meal.
