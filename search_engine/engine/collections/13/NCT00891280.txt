      growth and overexpression of CK2 has been documented in multiple types of cancer. CK2 has
      emerged as a potential anticancer target and inhibition of CK2 represents a potential
      therapeutic strategy to target a specific molecular defect perpetuating many cancers. CX-4945
      has demonstrated potent inhibition of CK2 enzymatic activity. This study will evaluate the
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CX-4945 administered to
      patients with malignancies or lymphoproliferative disorders known to overexpress CK2
      including advanced solid tumors, Multiple Myeloma and Castleman's Disease.
