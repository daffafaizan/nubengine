      disease ) has been legislated in the United States. In China, the two indicators of POX plus
      auscultation of heart murmur for screening major CHD have also been promoted as national
      standards. There are differences in the POX range of newborns at different altitude areas, so
      the threshold of POX screening based on sea-level areas is not applicable to low, medium and
      high altitude areas. While the normal range of POX at different altitude areas has not been
      studied in detail, so the current screening strategy can only be used in sea-level areas, but
      not benefit newborns in low, medium and high altitude areas. In order to apply major CHD
      screening strategy better to cover the newborns all over the country, we need to clarify the
      range of POX at different altitude areas of China and make sure the threshold of POX in major
      CHD screening. We plan to carry out a multicenter study on the normal POX value range of
      healthy and asymptomatic term newborns 6-72 hours after delivery in medical centers with
      altitude of 500-1000; 1000-2000; 2000-3000; 3000-4000 and above 4000 meters. And compare the
      POX value at different altitude areas with that of newborns delivered in the maternity
      hospitals at sea level. And measure the POX value of newborns with major CHD in the same way.
      POX screening thresholds will be obtained at different altitude areas. We will test the
      hypothesis that POX of healthy newborns at different altitude areas is lower than that of
      healthy newborns at sea level, and POX threshold of major CHD screening is lower than that of
      sea level.
