      criteria of ROME III criteria. A trained assistant helps the eligible patients to complete
      the ROME III standard questionaire, brief symptom rating scale (BSRS), and Maudsley
      Personality Inventory (MPI). The enrolled patients are then randomized into either
      lansoprazole or mosapride group for 14-day treatment. Before starting medication, right after
      completing the medication, and 1 month after the medication, the enrolled patients complete
      standardized severity questionnaire (Hong-Kong Index) to evaluate severity of dyspeptic
      symptoms. Symptom improvement is then determined.
