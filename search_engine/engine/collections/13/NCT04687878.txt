      disease referred to Movement Clinic of Shohada-e-Tajrish Hospital will randomly receive
      intranasal placebo or insulin, every day, twice a day for 12 weeks. Motor and non-motor
      symptoms will be evaluated in four time points; baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatments.
      Primary outcome is motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS; part III, IV), and secondary outcomes are motor
      (gait balance) and non-motor (MDS-UPDRS part I, II, cognition, depression, anxiety and
      fatigue) symptoms. Patients, researchers (physicians, outcome assessors) and data analysts
      are blinded.
