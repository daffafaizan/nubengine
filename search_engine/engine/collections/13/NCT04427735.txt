      health and life. The patients' prognosis is poor because the epidemic situation runs on
      medical resources, delays the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases such as
      cardiovascular diseases, and the patients' willingness to see a doctor is reduced. In
      particular, the delay in the treatment of STEMI, which needs PCI treatment, will cause more
      damage to the patients. It is necessary to study the treatment of STEMI patients in the real
      world under the influence of the epidemic. In this study, STEMI patients who experienced
      emergency PCI treatment after the covid-19 outbreak in 2020 were included, and compared with
      the data of the same period in 2019,we will analyze the pre hospital treatment time, vascular
      opening time,and the major cardiovascular adverse events, which provide effective suggestions
      and strategies for emergency and severe treatment.
