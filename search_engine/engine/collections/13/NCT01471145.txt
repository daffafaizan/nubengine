      prevalence. Drug free treatments, including pharmacologically supported interventions using
      oral naltrexone, have not been very successful, mainly due to low compliance. The recent
      introduction of Vivitrol®, consisting of monthly injections, may create new opportunities.
      Vivitrol® is an innovative treatment delivery method that blocks the rewarding effects of
      heroin.
