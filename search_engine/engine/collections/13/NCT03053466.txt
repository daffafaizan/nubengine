    
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, 3-part study with a Dose-Escalation Segment, Cohort Extension
      and Dose and Disease Expansion cohorts of APL-501 injection, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal
      antibody, targeting the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) membrane receptor on T lymphocytes and
      other cells of the immune system. Select advanced solid tumor malignancies will receive
      escalating doses of APL-501.

      Dose escalation will occur in three subject cohorts until a protocol defined dose limited
      toxicity (DLT) occurs, not due to disease progression or inter-current illness, and a
      tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or biologically effective dose (BED) is determined.

      Cohort Extension will evaluate APL-501 at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 15 every 28
      days.

      At the tentative MTD, BED or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), at least two tumor types in the
      Dose and Disease Expansion will be assessed at an equivalent non-weight based dose to further
      evaluate toxicity and preliminary efficacy.
