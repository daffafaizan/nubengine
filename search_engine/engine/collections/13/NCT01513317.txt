      and study personnel will not know the identity of the treatment. Approximately 75 patients
      will be randomized (patients are assigned to a treatment by a chance) in a 2:1 ratio to
      receive siltuximab plus best supportive care (BSC) (Group A) or placebo plus BSC (Group B).
      BSC includes RBC transfusion, antimicrobials, white blood cell (WBC) growth factors, and
      platelet transfusions. Patients who complete 12 weeks of treatment may qualify to receive
      siltuximab as open-label (identity of treatment will be known) treatment. Treatment may
      continue until death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the clinical cutoff
      (defined as 24 weeks after the last patient is randomized), whichever occurs first. The study
      will end approximately 36 weeks after the last patient is randomized. Patient safety will be
      monitored. Siltuximab and matching placebo will be supplied as a sterile, lyophilized
      formulation for reconstitution and intravenous (IV) infusion. Group A: siltuximab (15 mg/kg)
      administered as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks + BSC, or Group B: placebo administered as a
      1-hour infusion every 4 weeks + BSC.
