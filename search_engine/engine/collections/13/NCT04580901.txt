      Left untreated, these disorders increase the risk of future depressive episodes, postpartum
      depression in their partners, as well as emotional, behavioural, and cognitive problems in
      offspring. Unfortunately, up to 85% of these women will not receive treatment, which is
      estimated to cost the province of Ontario upwards of $6 billion annually. There is
      significant stigma surrounding perinatal depression which can result in less help-seeking by
      women, as well as a lack of awareness about available non-medication treatment options among
      both physicians and patients, even though most women prefer psychotherapy over medication.

      Despite the very strong evidence base for IPT, relatively few clinicians are trained to
      deliver IPT. Rather than travelling to tertiary care centres, the delivery of group
      psychotherapy virtually via telemedicine or Zoom allows women anywhere in the province to
      access this highly effective first-line treatment, thereby increasing access for women with
      perinatal depression and improving outcomes for mothers, babies, and families in Ontario.

      Study Objective: To compare the effectiveness of virtual group IPT to usual care in women
      with postpartum depression symptoms for reducing depression symptoms and anxiety, improving
      mother-infant attachment, and increasing social support, functioning, and quality of life.

      Study Design: RCT Population: postpartum women, aged 18 or older, with a baby under a year
      old Intervention: 12 weeks (15 sessions - 12 acute, 3 maintenance sessions) of group IPT
      delivered virtually via Zoom Comparison: 12 weeks of usual care followed by group IPT
      Outcomes: Pre-treatment versus post-treatment change in depression symptoms, anxiety,
      acceptability, mother-infant bonding, social support & functioning, and quality of life.

      All women in the study will be able to access care as usual from their physicians and other
      therapists throughout the study.
