    
      Background:

      Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare papillomatous disease of the
      aerodigestive tract that is caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) types 6 or 11.

      RRP can progress to cause severe voice disturbance, airway compromise, fatal pulmonary
      lesions, and invasive cancers.

      There is no proven effective systemic therapy for RRP that leads to cure. Participants
      require repeated surgical procedures for disease debridement and control.

      A recently completed phase II clinical trial investigating avelumab in subjects with RRP
      demonstrated an acceptable safety profile from avelumab and a high rate of partial responses,
      but no participants were cured.

      Laboratory analysis revealed that the ability to measure infiltration of papillomas by HPV
      antigen-specific T-cells is rare.

      A therapeutic vaccine may induce de novo HPV antigen-specific T-cell responses and decrease
      incidence of recurrence after surgical debulking.

      Objectives:

      To determine the safety and tolerability and recommended phase II adjuvant dosing of
      PRGN-2012.

      Eligibility:

      Histologically confirmed diagnosis of laryngeal RRP

      A history of 2 or more interventions in the last 12 months for the control of RRP

      Age 18 years and older

      Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 0 or 1

      Design:

      This is a phase I, 3+3 dose escalation clinical trial evaluating PRGN-2012 at two dose levels
      (1x10^11 and 5x10^11 particle units (PU)) administered as adjuvant therapy after
      standard-of-care debulking surgery.

      Participants will receive up to 4 separate injections of PRGN-2012 in separate limbs.

      The study will enroll up to 3-6 subjects at each dose level, and 12 subjects treated at the
      maximum tolerated dose.
