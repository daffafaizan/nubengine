      self-management efforts of asthmatic children aged 5-10 years and their families. This
      behavior change program will be designed to promote self-management by (a) increasing child
      and caregiver knowledge about asthma, (b) encouraging compliance with medication protocols
      and environmental controls, and (c) increasing self-efficacy to create and implement an
      Asthma Action Plan.
