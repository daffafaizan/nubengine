      of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) cccDNA exists for a long time in
      the liver of infected persons and serves as a template for HBV replication, which makes it
      difficult to eradicate HEPATITIS B virus infection. Antiviral drugs are commonly used
      clinically, including interferon and nucleoside analogues, but there are problems of
      recurrence and drug resistance. These drugs are not directly targeted at cccDNA and are
      therefore inefficient at reducing cccDNA. How to quickly and efficiently reduce the viral
      load of HBV-DNA, inhibit THE TRANSCRIPTION of HBV-CCCDNA RNA, and promote the negative
      conversion of HBeAg is an urgent problem to be solved at present, so it is particularly
      important to find other more effective drugs or methods. Plasma purification is a new
      treatment method in which the pathogenic factors (hepatitis B virus, etc.) are trapped in the
      hollow fibers by special membrane materials and removed. Therefore, this study adopts the
      randomized control method to explore the effect of plasma purification on HBV clearance,
      aiming to explore the effectiveness and safety of plasma purification in reducing HBV DNA
      viral load and inhibiting HBV cccDNA RNA transcription, so as to provide new treatment ideas
      and methods for future treatment of hepatitis B virus infection, which is beneficial to the
      society and individuals.
