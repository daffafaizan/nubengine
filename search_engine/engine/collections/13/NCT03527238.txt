      of acute rejection, improving graft and patient survival after transplantation. However,
      tacrolimus, one of the most widely used immunosuppressants and a mainstay of solid organ
      transplantation, has a narrow therapeutic index and wide pharmacokinetic variability. As
      such, there is a clear need for precision medicine to address post-transplant
      immunosuppression.

      The study team has developed a powerful platform [Phenotypic Precision Medicine (PPM)] that
      utilizes patient-specific clinical data which represents each patient's response to drug
      treatment. This platform can efficiently prescribe precise and optimized drug doses despite
      the frequent changes to patient treatment regimens following transplantation. This
      potentially can have a profound effect on drug metabolism.

      The aim of this project is to use PPM to uncover valuable and previously unknown information
      pertaining to patient dose requirements and correlate them with patient clinical and other
      contextual information. This study is also expected to reveal vital patient subpopulation
      information; and any future discovery of quantitative biomarkers as measures of
      immunosuppression will serve as a gateway towards even more effective personalized and
      relevant drug dosing.
