      thalidomide, melphalan or dexamethasone based regimens will decrease drug resistance when
      treating refractory multiple myeloma. We hypothesize that the addition of simvastatin and
      zoledronic acid will not increase the chemotherapy toxicity significantly and will be
      tolerable for patients. We believe simvastatin and zoledronic acid have antitumor properties
      and will contribute to reversal of resistance. Treatment will be significantly enhanced when
      these agents are combined
