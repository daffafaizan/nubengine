      tolerability. Since recommended chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent cervical carcinoma
      is either single-agent Cisplatin or Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, this is
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S-1 in combination with Cisplatin compared
      with single-agent Cisplatin.
