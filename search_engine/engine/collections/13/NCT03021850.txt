    
      Context: In the literature there is a disagreement of results and protocols regarding the use
      of thermal modalities associated with the training of flexibility of the hamstring muscles.
      Most studies on the subject, used the heat and cryotherapy prior to stretching these.
      Therefore, the investigators aimed to conduct an experimental study using the therapeutics
      term concomitant arrangements to passive static stretching these muscles.

      Methods: Clinical trial randomized crossover, which will a sample of 42 subjects (healthy
      young men, aged 20 to 30 years). Were divided into 3 groups (Group 1 passive static
      stretching hamstrings, Group 2 heat + passive static stretching hamstrings and Group 3
      cryotherapy + static stretching hamstrings passive) with 14 subjects each. Where the
      participants will control themselves, since all carry out the three interventions, only at
      different times. Each action will be performed every 7 days. Individuals will be subjected to
      active test of the range of motion of knee extension (goniometer) and hamstring muscle
      strength (dynamometer).
