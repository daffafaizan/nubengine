      Injection (ICSI) cycles, in which sibling oocytes were equally divided and incubated
      separately in one of the following pairs of culture media:

        1. Universal IVF medium vs. ISM1 medium ( Origio, Medi-Cult)

        2. P1 medium vs. ECM medium (Irvine).

      Fertilization rate,as well as embryo cleavage rate and morphology will be evaluated.
