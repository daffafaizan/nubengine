      disease (NAFLD), which in turn predicts the development of T2D and cardiovascular disease.

      Up to 80% of NAFLD patients with T2D have NASH and the presence of T2D is an independent risk
      factor for more-advanced fibrosis, higher rate of fibrosis progression, and increased
      mortality. Liver-related mortality is increased 10-fold in NASH patients compared with the
      general population. In addition, people with NASH are at an excessive risk of cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality.

      Currently, there are no established pharmacotherapies for NASH patients with T2D.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate efficacy of a combined treatment with semaglutide 1
      mg/week (GLP1RA) and empagliflozin 10 mg/d (SGLT2I) or ii) empagliflozin 10 mg/d monotherapy
      by means of histological resolution of NASH in T2D patients without progression of fibrosis
      after 48 weeks treatment.

      To confirm a histological diagnosis of NASH and proof efficacy of treatment, a liver biopsy
      will be performed prior to screening as well as at the end of treatment phase.
