      selenium-status, one being selenium-enriched yeast.

      Selenium is an essential micronutrient consumed through food, however the selenium contents
      of foods is variable, and depends upon the soil the food has been grown in. The UK population
      may not consume enough selenium through their diet, due to selenium levels in British soil
      being low and the use of North American wheat flour being increasingly replaced with lower
      selenium European flour.

      It is therefore relevant to explore the ability of selenium-enriched yeast to improve
      selenium status if initially low. It is also important to investigate if the sensory
      attributes of selenium-fortified foods are different to unfortified foods. Additionally,
      investigating Flavour-Nutrient Learning (how selenium-status might change sensory perception
      of selenium-rich foods) could improve understanding of food choices.

      This study aims to investigate the following topics:

        1. The relationship between selenium intake (through selenium-fortified biscuits) and
           selenium-status.

        2. How selenium-status affects sensory perception of selenium-fortified biscuits (Flavour
           Nutrient Learning, FNL).
