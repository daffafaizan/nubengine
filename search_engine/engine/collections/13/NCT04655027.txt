      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either roxadustat or rHuEPO arms for 2 weeks.

      The study will enroll eligible dialysis and non-dialysis patients ≥18 years of age, who have
      been on a stable dose of rHuEPO within 4 weeks prior to screening or are rHuEPO-naïve at the
      time of screening.

      Each patient will be contacted before the first Screening Visit (Visit 1) for the symptoms of
      COVID-19 and for any contact with COVID-19 positive person within the past 14 days.

      For each patient, the duration of participation in the study will be approximately 8 to 9
