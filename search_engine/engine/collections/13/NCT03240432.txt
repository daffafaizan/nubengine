      whom have hypoglycemic unawareness, cognitive impairment, or both. CGM offers the opportunity
      to reduce hypoglycemia and its related complications such as fractures from falls and
      hospitalizations and improve quality of life including reducing hypoglycemic fear and
      diabetes distress. Despite these potential benefits, CGM is used by only a small proportion
      of older adults with T1D. Previous studies assessing CGM efficacy have included only a small
      number of adults â‰¥ 60 years of age, excluded patients most prone to severe hypoglycemia,
      focused on improving HbA1c rather than hypoglycemia, and used older generation CGM sensors.
      These studies are not generalizable to the population of older adults with T1D. The potential
      benefit of CGM in reducing hypoglycemia in the older adult population has not been well
      studied. The goal of this study is to assess the potential benefits and risks of CGM in older
      adults with T1D.
