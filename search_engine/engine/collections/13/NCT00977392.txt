        -  To ascertain whether women who do not attend for cervical screening are more likely to
           respond to the opportunity to collect a self-sample for human papillomavirus (HPV)
           testing, or to respond to a further invitation to undergo a cervical smear.

        -  To ascertain whether such women will attend for further investigation if they have a
           positive screening test (HPV test or cervical smear).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Control: Patients receive an invitation for a routine cervical smear and a cervical
           screening survey. Information regarding attendance for smear or colposcopy is collected
           at the Primary Care Trust.

        -  Study (self-sampling kit): Patients receive an explanatory letter, an information sheet
           about the study, a consent form, information about human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV
           testing, a self-sampling test kit, and an invitation to take their own HPV sample and
           return it to the research group for processing. Patients also receive a cervical
           screening survey. Patients who attend for further investigation following a positive HPV
           result go to St. Mary's Hospital Colposcopy Unit, Paddington. During this visit cervical
           smear tests are performed and women are offered immediate colposcopy so that they would
           not need to return for colposcopic examination if their smear test is abnormal.
