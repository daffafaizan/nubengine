      treatment. The China extension to MK-7264-030 (NCT03449147) will enroll a total of
      approximately 160 Chinese participants. The initial China Extension protocol (amendment 3)
      will include the Gefapixant 15 mg BID treatment arm; this treatment arm will not be included
      in subsequent protocol amendments (eg amendment 5).
