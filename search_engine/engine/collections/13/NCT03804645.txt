    
      This study will be a randomized, open-label, single-centre crossover study in healthy male
      subjects. The study is divided into 2 parts, Part A and Part B. The subjects will participate
      in both Part A and Part B.

      Part A will be a 4-way cross-over study comparing the PK of AZD9977 as a reference capsule
      and 2 different capsule formulations and a tablet formulation under fasting conditions.

        -  Treatment A: Reference, AZD9977 capsule

        -  Treatment B: AZD9977 HDL capsule

        -  Treatment C: AZD9977 ODL capsule

        -  Treatment D: AZD9977 tablet In Part B, based on the interim results in Part A, 1 of the
           formulations will be selected and evaluated at the 300 mg dose level under fed
           conditions. The same formulation will also be evaluated under fasting conditions at a
           lower dose level (50 mg). The first dose tested in Part B will be the 50 mg (fasted)
           dose, followed by the 300 mg (fed) dose.

      In Part A, subjects will be resident from 1 day before dosing (Day -1 of Treatment Period 1)
      with AZD9977 until 48 hours post-final-dose (Day 3 of Treatment Period 4). Subjects will
      return to the unit for Part B at least 48 hours (and up to 5 weeks) after completion of Part
      A.

      In Part B, subjects will be resident from 1 day before dosing (Day -1 of Treatment Period 1)
      with AZD9977 until 48 hours post-final-dose (Day 3 of Treatment Period 2).

      Subjects will return to the unit for a final study visit 5-7 days post-last-dose for a Follow
      up Visit.

      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 12 weeks (including
      approximately 4 to 5 weeks for the interim analysis).

      Twelve subjects will initially be randomized to ensure at least 8 and 6 evaluable subjects at
      the end of the last treatment period for Part A and Part B respectively.
