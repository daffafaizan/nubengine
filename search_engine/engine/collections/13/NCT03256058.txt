      the tourniquet would be inflated immediately before incision and deflated after the use of
      the cement , and 10 minutes later(after the hardening of the cement) , reinflate the
      tourniquet and deflate at the end of the operation. On the other side the tourniquet would be
      inflated immediately before incision and deflated at the end of the operation.The total time
      of tourniquet inflation is controlled within 90 minutes. The postoperative pain, limb
      swelling , the score of surgical field, blood pressure during the operation, blood loss,
      operating time, transfusion rate, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence and clinical outcomes
      would be monitored for comparison.
