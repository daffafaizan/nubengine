      disorder world wide. In Singapore, 17% of the adult population experience recent psychiatric
      disturbances, yet only 6% use the services of any health professional. General practitioners
      are the most commonly preferred caregiver, and actually used by 41.1% of those who sought
      help. At the same time, suicide rates especially among the elderly remain at very high levels
      compared to other countries in the world.

      In recent decades, screening questionnaires have been developed and validated that are
      suitable for the initial detection of depression in the primary care setting. Previous
      research have shown that screening for depression do not result in increased recognition
      rates of mental disorders unless positive cases are selectively fed back to primary care
      physicians. They also do not translate into increased rates of interventional activities such
      as initiation of therapy and referral to mental health specialists. Neither dose primary care
      physician education or clinical practice guidelines result in any improved outcomes for the
      patients unless these are accompanied by more sophisticated strategies in the organization
      and delivery of care, such as structured, collaborative, multidisciplinary care together with
      quality improvement processes.

      More empirical data are therefore needed to establish whether screening for psychiatric
      disorders will enhance the recognition of clinical disorder, leading to better patient
      outcomes.
