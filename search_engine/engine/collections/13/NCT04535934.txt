    
      Approximately twelve healthy adult volunteers with no contraindicated medical conditions or
      medications will be recruited from CU/Denver and the surrounding community.

      Participants will be randomized to one of 2 sequences consisting of two directly observed
      dosing regimens with 2mg adenine 5+ per dose, 1 dose/week followed by 4 doses/week or 3
      doses/week followed by 7 doses/week. Each dose regimen will have a duration of approximately
      12 weeks and will be separated by an approximately 12-week washout period for a total study
      duration of approximately 36 weeks. The rationale for this study design is several fold.
      First, the lower doses are given initially to minimize the potential effects of carry-over in
      the second regimen. Second, 1 to 7 doses/week encompass a wide range of simulated adherence
      rates to assess the promise of this taggant, adenine 5+, as an adherence biomarker. Third,
      the 12 week duration is designed to achieve ~90% of steady-state given an estimated half-life
      of 20-30 days.
