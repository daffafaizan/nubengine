    
      Background : Response to a second-line anti-HCV treatment in non responder patients to a
      first-line dual therapy remains very poor. Preliminary studies of amantadine suggest that
      this drug could be potentially effective to treat hepatitis C.

      Design : randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial.

      Interventions compared : Peg-interferon alfa 2A + ribavirin + amantadine versus
      Peg-interferon alfa 2A + ribavirin + Placebo

      Eligibility criteria : Chronic hepatitis C, previously treated with combination of interferon
      plus ribavirin for at least 24 weeks,detectable HCV RNA.

      primary outcome : sustained virological response, defined as an undetectable HCV RNA level 24
      weeks after the end of anti HCV treatment.
