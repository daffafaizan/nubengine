      synthesized by the liver, has provided a better understanding of iron metabolism and the
      resulting anemia disruption of this homeostasis.

      Although morbidity decreased hepatic surgery remains a major surgery as by surgical
      difficulty by support intra- and postoperatively.

      A preliminary study, the investigators found that patients had preoperative anemia
      (oncological context) increased postoperatively, increasing the morbidity.

      Few clinical studies on hepcidin and anemia were carried out, because of the difficulty of
      metering (mass spectrometry) as well as its cost.

      In this clinical trial, the investigators plan to assess the value of iv iron administration
      versus iv placebo treatment immediately after liver surgery and consequences of inflammation
      on iron balance. In addition, an evaluation of the well being of patients will be performed
      postoperatively to measure the functional and psychological impact of anemia.

      This is a monocentric, randomized, double blinded and placebo controlled trial. Iron iv
      injection will be administered postoperatively. Hematology assessments, biological iron
      deficiency, inflammation and coagulation will be realized pre and postoperatively. Hepcidin
      is assayed by an ELISA method.
