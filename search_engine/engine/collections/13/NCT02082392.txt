      outpatients with MDD to "Research Frequency Management" (RFM, weekly study visits) vs.
      "Community Frequency Management" (CFM, every 4 weeks study visits) and antidepressant
      medication vs.placebo. Specifying visit frequency as the independent variable in this study
      has the distinct advantages of being easily operationalized for research purposes avoiding a
      priori assumptions about which components of study visits influence antidepressant and
      placebo response (i.e., behavioral activation vs. doctor-patient relationship vs. medical
      procedures). Close monitoring of all subjects will be assured by telephone evaluations of
      individuals randomized to CFM at intervals between monthly visits, and additional study
      contacts will be scheduled as necessary to maintain patient safety (all extra-protocol
      contacts will be recorded and included as a variable in outcome analyses). Additionally,
      subjects will be characterized extensively on clinical, demographic, and psychological
      measures to pilot the study assessment battery and search for predictor variables influencing
      the effects of contact frequency on medication and placebo response.
