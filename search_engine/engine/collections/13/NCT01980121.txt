    
      The aim of this prospective study is to provide a qualitative and quantitative description of
      the sonographic appearance of the gastric antrum in fasted pregnant undergoing elective
      Cesarean delivery.

      The investigators expect that the information obtained from the systematic ultrasonographic
      qualitative/quantitative assessment of the gastric content may help anesthesiologist to
      better assess aspiration risk and guide anesthetic and airway management, particularly in
      pregnant women scheduled for elective Cesarean delivery after standard preoperative fasting
      guidelines.
