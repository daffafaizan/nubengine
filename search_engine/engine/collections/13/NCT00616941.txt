    
      Subjects received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 by subcutaneous injection once every 3 weeks (Weeks 1, 4, 7,
      10, and 13) for a total of 5 vaccinations.

      Subjects were assigned sequentially to 1 of 3 dosing cohorts:

      Cohort 1: received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 alone; Cohort 2: received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 in combination with
      Montanide; Cohort 3: received NY-ESO-1 OLP4 in combination with Montanide and Poly-ICLC.

      Enrollment into each subsequent dosing cohort was dependent on a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
      rate of <33% in the preceding cohort. No dose escalation was planned.

      Subjects were observed by study staff for up to 30 minutes following each vaccination.
      Immunologic assessments were performed prior to the first vaccination and 3 weeks after each
      vaccination. Toxicity assessments were performed with each vaccination and 3 weeks after the
      completion of therapy (ie, the final study visit was Week 16). Immunologic assessments
      included measurement of the anti-NY-ESO-1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunsorbent assay
      (ELISA), detection of CD-4 and CD-8 cellular responses by tetramer and enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT), and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH).
