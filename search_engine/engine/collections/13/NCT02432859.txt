      randomly assigned to electrical stimulation (ES, n=15) or sham ES (placebo, n=15) groups. ES
      group received cathodal direct current for 1 h/day, 3 days/week, for 4 weeks (12 sessions).
      Wound fluid sample was collected for VEGF, VEGFR-2, HIF-1Î± and NO measurement in the first
      and last treatment sessions before and after intervention. Wound surface area (WSA) was
      measured at 1st, 6th, and 12th session.
