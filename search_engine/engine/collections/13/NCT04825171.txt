    
      The present IIT (Investigator-Initiated Trial) study is a prospective, single-group, pre-post
      study (phase IV).

      A past study showed that among Anthroposophical physicians the most frequent diagnosis group
      where BP preparations are prescribed are mental and behavioural disorders such as anxiety and
      sleep disorders. In the present study, we, therefore, want to investigate the effectiveness
      of Bryophyllum tablets in patients with anxiety symptoms.

      Study participants will be recruited among the patients on the waiting list of the Department
      of Psychiatry and Psychosomatics at the Clinic Arlesheim.

        -  Participant recruitment will continue until 60 patients have concluded the study.

        -  Recruitment period will probably last 15 months.

        -  Duration of the drug administration is 3 weeks.

      Participants will fill in a questionnaire three times. At baseline, after two and after three
      weeks of Bryophyllum intake.
