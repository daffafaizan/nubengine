      disease caused by contraction of fibrovascular proliferation, treatment of which is limited
      to surgery. Fibrosis and neovascularization are both associated with high levels of
      connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the
      eye. Small, nonrandomized studies have suggested that pre-operative adjunctive anti-VEGF
      administration may reduce intra- and post-operative complications and provide visual benefit
      in patients with this condition.
