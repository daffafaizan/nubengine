      incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is still estimated at 5.9-6.9% in hospitalised
      patients, and 5.0-5.9 in home care patients. Both skin conditions may occur in the same body
      region but are considered as separate entities, based on differences in etiology.

      At tissue level, it is assumed that pressure ulcers are characterised by ischemia and tissue
      deformation. In contrast, IAD is assumed to be characterised by an irritative pattern. These
      assumptions are reflected in current preventive strategies. However, a small scale study,
      performed by Houwing et al. (2007), described the additional presence of an ischemic pattern
      in patients with IAD. More insights into the histopathologic pattern of pressure ulcers and
      IAD is needed to optimise current preventive strategies.

      Tha aim of this study is to compare superficial pressure ulcers (category II and III) and IAD
      (category IIA) at tissue level.

      A prospective interventional study will be performed during which skin biopsies (punch
      biopsies) will be collected from 30 incontinent patients. In each patient patient, two punch
      skin biopsies will be performed, one at the border of the skin lesion and one at the adjacent
      healthy skin. Sections from the biopsies will be stained with hematoxiline and eosine and
      examined by two independently working, blinded skin pathologists. In addition, photographs
      from the skin lesions will be analysed by 10 national and international wound care experts to
      promote correct diagnosis. Finally, findings from the histopathologic examination will be
      compared with the clinical diagnoses based on photographs.
