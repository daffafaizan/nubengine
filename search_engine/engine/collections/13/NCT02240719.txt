      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus when administered in
      combination with bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) in defined hematologic
      malignancies.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of administering everolimus in combination with
      bendamustine chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of everolimus when administered in combination with bendamustine
      in adult patients with relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      2 and everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
