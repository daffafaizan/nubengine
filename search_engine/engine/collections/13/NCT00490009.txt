      diffuse large cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DLCL) who are not appropriate candidates for stem
      cell transplantation. DLCL is a relatively radiosensitive disease and patients with DLCL have
      been reported to respond to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (MAB) therapy. Therefore,
      radioimmunotherapy targeting CD20 is a rational and promising therapeutic approach for this
      patient population.

      This study evaluated if Bexxar is safe and efficacious for diffuse large cell Non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.
