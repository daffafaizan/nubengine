      radiation must be used. Both 3D and IMRT plans are acceptable. The cumulative radiation dose
      may range from 30 to 40 Gy as administered in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy fractions, 5 fractions per week.
      The dose is specified as defined by the ICRU (International Commission on Radiation Units and
      Measurements) report 50. Response is evaluated using CT 6 and 12 weeks after irradiation.
      Adverse effects are evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects
      (CTCAE)version 3.
