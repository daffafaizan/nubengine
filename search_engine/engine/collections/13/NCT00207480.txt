      Transtheoretical Model of Change (TMC) and the intervention will use Miller's Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) techniques. This intervention will be evaluated using (1) an
      audio/computer-assisted self-administered interview (ACASI) survey to assess changes in
      respondents' douching knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and (2) biological testing for
      Bacterial Vaginosis.
