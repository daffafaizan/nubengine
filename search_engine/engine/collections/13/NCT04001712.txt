      a respiratory stimulant which has well established therapeutic effects in apnea and
      facilitation of extubation. Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist ; it blocks selectively A2
      receptors and non selective blocks A1 receptors. Its effects include improved lung
      compliance, minute ventilation, respiratory muscle contractility, increased sensitivity to
      carbon dioxide, enhanced catecholamine activity and decreased airway resistance

      Early caffeine therapy was associated with a shorter duration of respiratory support and
      reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia , cerebral palsy, patent ductus arteriosis ligation,
      intracranial hemorrhage, apnea and death

      Despite its widespread use, information regarding optimal time to initiate therapy and
      appropriate time to discontinue therapy is limited. Recent studies have indicated that early
      initiation of caffeine therapy is associated with improved neonatal outcomes

      Little is known about the early use of caffeine citrate in preterm neonates. The
      investigators aim to explore the effectiveness of its very early use in reducing the duration
      of respiratory support.
