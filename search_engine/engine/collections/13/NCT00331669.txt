      therapeutic option for patients suffering from disabling neurological movement disorders such
      as essential tremor and ParkinsonÂ´s disease. Recently, deep brain stimulation has been
      successfully applied in patients with primary generalized and segmental dystonia.
      Additionally, a number of case reports suggest that pallidal deep brain stimulation may also
      improve tardive dystonia, which may for instance result from the intake of neuroleptics and
      which is notoriously difficult to treat medically. The present study will investigate the
      effects of pallidal DBS using a double blind, randomized design (sham- versus
      verum-stimulation within a 3-months interval post implantation of the electrodes).

      Initially 60 patients had been calculated in a power analysis to assess significant results
      based on an average improvement of dystonic symptoms of 30%. However, in a recent study
      (Damier et al., Archives of General Psychiatry, 2007), 10 out of 10 showed a successful
      outcome of approximately 50% decrease on the extrapyramidal symptoms rating scale score. The
      exact one- sided lower 95% confidence limit would be 0.794 for this result. If such an
      approach is chosen for sample size estimation with 18 verum and 18 placebo patients one would
      obtain a power of 82% against a placebo effect of 30% success rate. For a placebo effect of
      25% one needs 16+16 patients and for the placebo effect of 20% one needs 12+12 patients. We
      thus decided to reduce the sample size to 36- 32- 24 patients. It is expected that the
      continuous primary outcome measure will preserve even higher power than the binary one used
      in the study mentioned above. The local ethical committee has approved this.
