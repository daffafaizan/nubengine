    
      PSOLAR is an ongoing voluntary observational study in which infliximab-exposed patients,
      ustekinumab-exposed patients, and patients treated with other biologic and non-biologic
      standard of care therapies have been enrolled internationally and are followed for up to 8
      years. Additionally, enrollment is opened to include at least 2000 guselkumab-exposed
      patients and up to 2000 patients exposed to IL-17 inhibitors. The Registry does not require
      any study-specific testing, but may capture information collected as part of normal routine
      care. Patient information is collected at the enrollment visit and about every 6 months
      thereafter. At enrollment, information on demographics (e.g. gender, and race), medical
      history and family medical history, details of past and current psoriasis treatments, and
      current psoriasis medications is collected. At enrollment and each follow-up visit, data are
      collected regarding physical examination, clinical disease status, Quality of Life
      assessments, current psoriasis medications, patient-reported PsA assessments, and adverse
      events. No study agents are administered for the purpose of this registry; all patients
      receive standard of care treatment as prescribed by the patient's physician.
