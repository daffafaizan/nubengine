    
      The study is a non-randomized, prospective, multi-center, clinical study.Patients with early
      cervical cancer who were enrolled will be divided into two groups: minimally invasive surgery
      group (group A) and open abdominal surgery group (group B) according to the patient's choice
      on surgical methods.We will standardize the surgery details according to the factors that may
      affect the prognosis of cancer treatment in the minimally invasive surgery of cervical
      cancer, such as : emphasizing the tumor-free principle of surgery; using a ligation band to
      tighten the vagina before cutting the vagina; avoiding the use of the cup-shaped uterine
      manipulator；reducing frequent changes in CO2 abdominal pressure；or using a laparoscope-assist
      transvaginal hysterectomy and other methods to avoid the risk of tumor tissue shedding.
      Patients with high risk factors after surgery will receive follow-up treatment according to
      the 2018 NCCN guidelines.
