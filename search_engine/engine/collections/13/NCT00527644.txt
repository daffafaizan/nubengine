      leakage of bile (liquid made by liver and stored in gall bladder) after gallbladder surgery.
      It is not known if the Visu-Lock clip stops leaks better than other clips that have been used
      during gallbladder surgery.

      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in subclinical or clinical leak rate between spring
      and crush clips used for cystic duct ligation.

      Alternative hypothesis: Titanium spring clips decrease the rate of subclinical or clinical
      biliary leak from the cystic duct stump after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
