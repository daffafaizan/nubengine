        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant or adjuvant epirubicin,
           cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, in terms of the absence of any grade 3 or higher
           toxicity (aside from alopecia), in women with high-risk stage I-III breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Neoadjuvant or adjuvant EC therapy: Patients receive epirubicin IV over 3-5 minutes and
           cyclophosphamide IV (EC) on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 2-9 or
           10. Treatment repeats every 10-11 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Neoadjuvant or adjuvant paclitaxel therapy: After the completion of EC therapy, patients
           receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Patients also receive G-CSF as in EC
           therapy. Treatment repeats every 10-11 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who have not had prior surgery undergo definitive surgery after the completion of
      chemotherapy. Patients also may receive adjuvant radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
