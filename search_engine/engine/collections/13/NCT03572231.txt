      decisions regarding treatment are made at the sole discretion of the treating physician in
      accordance with the treating physician's usual practices and all eligible participants will
      be enrolled in a certain timeframe. OAB participants enrolled in the study will be
      categorized into one of two treatment groups, but the study does not plan to compare the two
      treatment groups.
