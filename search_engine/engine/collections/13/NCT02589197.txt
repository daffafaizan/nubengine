      study which showed the Medial Pivot (MP) system required lower quadriceps activation than
      subjects implanted with a Posterior stabilized (PS) system preforming the same activities of
      daily living. The propose of the current study is to determine the impact of Total Knee
      Arthroplasty (TKA) design on muscle activation following TKA surgery.
