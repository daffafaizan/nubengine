      are limited nursing interventions that can be done to prevent PONV. The American Society of
      PeriAnesthesia Nurses suggest nurses to teach patients with a high risk of PONV about
      acupressure application on P6 acupoint or to apply acupressure wristbands preoperatively.
      However this suggestion has a low evidence.
