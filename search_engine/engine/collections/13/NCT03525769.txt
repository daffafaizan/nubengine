    
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. We plan to include
      10,000 patients with type 2 diabetes, and use FibroTouch to screen for NAFLD, NASH cirrhosis
      and advanced fibrosis in these patients. In the group of patients who experienced liver
      biopsies in clinical practice, we compare their FibroTouch results and liver biopsy pathology
      results, to evaluate the clinical value of FibroTouch in diagnosing NAFLD, NASH cirrhosis and
      advanced fibrosis in diabetics. We will calculate the incidence and analyze risk factors of
      NAFLD, NASH cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. All patients
      will be followed-up for 5 years (once a year for patients without cirrhosis, twice a year for
      patients with cirrhosis), to observed endpoint events. This study will explore the
      significance of FibroTouch result and other clinical indicators in assessing the long-term
      prognosis of diabetic patients with NAFLD.
