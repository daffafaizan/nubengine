      disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and other dementias
      and movement disorders represent a very significant unmet medical need. Disease mechanisms
      are gradually becoming understood, and disease-modifying drugs are emerging that target the
      specific molecular pathology underlying each of these diseases. Tools for accurate and early
      differential diagnosis are thus necessary to determine the appropriate treatment for patients
      and to minimize inappropriate use of potentially harmful treatments. In addition, such
      diagnostic imaging tools are expected to permit monitoring of disease progression and will
      thus accelerate testing and development of disease-modifying drugs. Furthermore, the new
      imaging test may be useful as a prognostic tool by identifying humans suffering from
      neurodegenerative diseases before the clinical manifestations become evident.
