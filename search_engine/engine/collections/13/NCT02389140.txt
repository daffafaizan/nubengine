      yet would provide important objective evidence for a treatment effect and clarify the
      resolution process of a MTrP. The long-term goal is to understand how therapeutic
      intervention affects the physiology of the MTrP. The objective of the proposed research is to
      assess, in a placebo controlled trial, the effectiveness of trigger point release massage
      (also known as ischemic compression) on blood flow at an active MTrP. The central hypothesis
      is that the contraction nodule of an active MTrP is characterized by an ischemic state
      comprised of reduced blood flow and subsequent dysregulation in carbohydrate metabolism. The
      investigators hypothesize that trigger point release (TPR) can positively impact blood flow
      leading to a change in high energy carbohydrate tension. The present study has been
      formulated, in part, from a preliminary study conducted by the investigators, which supports
      reduced blood flow and physiological disruption at active MTrPs. The proposed research will
      provide a physiological basis for massage to corroborate subjective reports of reduced pain
      sensitivity, impart credibility to treatment techniques, and provide insight into a mechanism
      of action for healing the MTrP.
