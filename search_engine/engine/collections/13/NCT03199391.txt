      Secondary Objective

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To document the postmarket effectiveness of the BioWick SureLock implant using ASES
           scores, VR-12 scores, and VAS scores, with the corresponding assessments made at 3
           months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperative.

        -  To document the postmarket effectiveness of the BioWick SureLock implant using range of
           motion (ROM) measurements with the corresponding assessments made at 3 months and 6
           months postoperative.

        -  To document device safety via device-related adverse events reported over the course of
           the study.
