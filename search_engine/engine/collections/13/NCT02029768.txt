      surface area burns will participate in this study. A skin-fold caliper measurement will be
      performed to determine body fat percentage. Serum samples will be obtained and assayed for
      inflammatory cytokines to establish whether or not a link between obesity in women and
      pro-inflammatory cytokines exists. If so, obesity may be a factor which contributes to the
      gender disparity in burn wound survival.
