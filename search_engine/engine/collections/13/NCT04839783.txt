      intraoperatively, as part of performing an anterior posterior spine fusion surgery, can
      affect short term and long term outcomes. This will be accomplished through observational
      techniques that will not affect the care patients will receive for their spinal conditions.

      Patients will be asked to complete health and wellness surveys before and after survey to
      determine how they are doing before surgery and then what if any changes their respective
      surgeries have had on their lives. Further spine x-rays that they have taken to plan their
      surgeries and assess their recovery will be measured, when available. X-rays will not be
      taken only for research purposes. Additionally aspects of their surgeries will be noted such
      as where hardware is placed and how long different parts of the surgery took.

      Follow-up is planned to be out to 10 years post-operatively with the goal of collecting
      information about any revision spine surgeries that would happen during those 10 years as
      well.
