      types of primary or metastatic tumors near the spinal cord. The major goal of this study is
      to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a specific SBRT program in a prospective manner. The
      main outcome variables in this study are pain and neurologic function.

      A major issue in delivering SBRT is the number of treatment sessions. There are advantages
      and disadvantages to both single and multi treatment programs. In this protocol, patients are
      offered SBRT with either a single treatment or 25 treatment days. This study is not designed
      to compare different SBRT schedules. A single treatment program is more convenient and likely
      to relieve symptoms sooner than a multi-session program. A program with 25 treatments may
      produce better long-term results. Our protocol uses life expectancy, patient preference, and
      tumor size to determine whether SBRT is delivered with 1 or 25 treatments.
