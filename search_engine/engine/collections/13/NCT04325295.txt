    
      PCOS is a complex disease that is diagnosed by the presence of two of the following three:
      oligo/anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries by
      ultrasound . PCOS affects 4% to 21% of females in reproductive age . Although subfertility is
      abundant in women with PCOS, a majority of these women will achieve pregnancy naturally or by
      treatment.

      Different treatment modalities are present for ovulation induction. Life style modifications
      including weight loss are encouraged for those who are overweight or obese. Pharmacological
      induction of ovulation represent the first line therapy for induction of ovulation. Options
      include aromatase inhibitors (Letrozole), Clomiphene Citrate (CC) or Metformin, alone or in
      combinations.

      For second line treatment either Gonadotropins (Gn) or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS) are
      the recommended options .

      Systematic reviews done comparing LOD to Gn found no differences in live birth, clinical
      pregnancy or miscarriage rates. However, there was significant decrease in OHSS and multiple
      pregnancies with LOD . Giving these advantages together with being cheap, the surgical
      strategy may be a more favorable choice as second line treatment of anovulation . Also
      several randomised controlled trial (RCTs) reported normalization of ovarian reserve
      parameters after LOD, making it a long-lasting option compared to the one-cycle effect of
      medical treatment the objective of the trial is to study the effectiveness and safetey of
      surgical induction of ovulation strategy and compare it to medical induction strategy with
      Gonadotropins
