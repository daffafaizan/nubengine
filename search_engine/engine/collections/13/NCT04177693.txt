      with 36 total patients in 3 treatment arms. 36 women will be randomized to one of the
      following groups: EGCG daily alone, EGCG daily with clomiphene citrate and EGCG daily with
      letrozole. The randomization scheme will be stratified for age groups 18-29 and 30-40 and
      presence of uterine fibroids. The pharmacokinetics and hepatic safety of EGCG with clomiphene
      citrate and letrozole are unknown. The trial conducted in women with and without fibroids
      will allow comparisons between these groups. The results of this study will be used to
      confirm hepatic safety for the larger multi-center FRIEND study.
