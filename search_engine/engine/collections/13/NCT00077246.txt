      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel
           (albumin-stabilized Nanoparticle formulation) (ABI-007) in patients with
           chemotherapy-na√Øve stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive paclitaxel (albumin-stabilized Nanoparticle formulation)
           (ABI-007) IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ABI-007 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive ABI-007 as above at the MTD (determined in phase I). Patients
           are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months for 1.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 64 patients will be accrued for this study.
