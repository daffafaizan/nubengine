      measurements were performed like described before, using the TIVITA Tissue system
      (Diaspective Vision GmbH, Am Salzhaff, Germany). This HSI-camera provides hyperspectral
      images with a high spectral resolution (5 nm) in the visible and near infrared range
      (500-1000 nm). The distance between camera and object was 30 cm for all measurements. The
      Number of Effective Pixels at this distance is 640 × 480 (x-, y-axis. The resulting field of
      view (FOV) has the dimensions 6.4 × 4.8 cm2 and a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm/pixel. The FOV
      is illuminated by 8 halogen spots (20 W each). The ceiling lights and other light sources
      were switched off, to avoid artifacts during the measurement (approximately 10 seconds). A
      RGB image and 4 false color images that represent physiologic parameters are intraoperatively
      provided by an analysis software. This work is focused on tissue oxygenation (StO2), which
      represents the relative blood oxygenation in the microcirculation of superficial tissue
      layers (approximately 1 mm) and the near-infrared (NIR) Perfusion Index, representing tissue
      layers in 4-6 mm penetration depth.
