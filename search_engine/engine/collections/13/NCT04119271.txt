      remediation intervention study in 5-16 year old children with poor asthma control. At visit
      1, wristbands will be dispensed and collected to estimate exposure to a suite of common
      organic contaminants including phthalates, organophosphate esters, several pesticides and
      polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). During the initial home visit, the Healthy Homes Housing
      Specialist will conduct an environmental home assessment to identify asthma triggers in
      accordance with the EPA's recommendations for helping children with asthma. The Housing
      Specialist will follow the EPA document Home Characteristics and Asthma Triggers, and will
      provide the family with a Breathe Easy at Home Kit. The Specialist will provide training and
      instructions on how to use each of the supplies provided in the kit. If the Housing
      Specialist identifies necessary home repairs during the assessment process, the Housing
      Specialist can refer the family to organizations that offer home repairs, modifications, and
      weatherization services. The specialist will discuss the importance of clean air for
      maintaining lung health for all family members and will discuss the importance of banning of
      any indoor smoking, smoking anywhere around the household and smoking in any household
      automobiles (even when the child is not present). Follow up phone calls will be conducted to
      answer questions, complete questionnaires and complete a household environmental interview.
