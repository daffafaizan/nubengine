    
      50 former preterm infants who presented acute renal failure will be evaluated between 3 to 10
      years.

      They will be compared to 25 control former preterm infants without renal dysfunction for
      signs of nephronic reduction.

      At inclusion, in order to analyse renal function, all infants will have blood sampling, renal
      echography and blood pressure measurement. Urine sample will also be collected.

      Two months later, parents will be informed on the results.
