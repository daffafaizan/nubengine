      impact of GH treatment on insulin-stimulated glucose utilization (M-value) in a group of
      children affected by GH deficiency and to compare the clamp-derived index with the most
      commonly used surrogate indexes of insulin sensitivity.

      In all patients the auxological and metabolic evaluation was performed at baseline and after
      12 months of GH treatment, while in controls these evaluations were only performed at
      baseline. In all children the investigators measured body height, body mass index (BMI) and
      waist circumference (WC). A blood sample was drawn after an overnight fast for the
      measurement of glucose, insulin, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and IGF-I. This sample served as the
      baseline for the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood samples were collected every 30
      min for 120 min for glucose and insulin measurements. As surrogate estimates of insulin
      sensitivity the investigators used the insulin sensitivity index, a composite index derived
      from the OGTT and validated by Matsuda and DeFronzo (ISI-Matsuda). On a different day, as a
      gold standard measurement of insulin sensitivity the investigators performed the euglycemic
      hyperinsulinemic clamp. As other insulin sensitivity markers, the serum levels of adiponectin
      and resistin after an overnight fast were also measured.
