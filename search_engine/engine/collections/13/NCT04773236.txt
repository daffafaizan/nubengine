      will include 100 patients (extraction) who need dental extraction of upper teeth (premolar
      and molar teeth). The predictor variable is the use of buffered 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000
      adrenaline and non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline. The patients will be
      randomly assigned into two groups of 50 patients each using Microsoft Excel 2016; the first
      group (study group) will undergo dental extraction after receiving buffered 2% lidocaine with
      1:80,000 adrenaline, the second group (control group) will undergo dental extraction after
      receiving non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 adrenaline. The outcome variables include
      pain during injection, onset of anesthesia and effectiveness of anesthesia on buffered and
      non-buffered group.
