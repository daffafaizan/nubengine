      efficacy and safety of fixed dose combination of eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg and diclofenac
      sodium 50 mg three times daily with plain eperisone hydrochloride 50 mg three times daily in
      patients with musculoskeletal spasm associated with low back pain. A total of 240 adult
      patients of either sex, 120 patients in each arm, who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be included in this study. The patients will be evaluated at Days 3, 7 and 10
      of the study visit for efficacy and safety. The efficacy evaluation includes objective
      parameters like Finger-to-Floor distance, Lasegue's sign, tenderness of par vertebral
      muscles, lumbar and dorsal hypermyotonia, leg tendon reflexes, need for rescue medication and
      subjective parameters like improvement in lumbar cinesalgia, pain in lower extremities,
      sensory disturbances of lower limb, and Global Assessment of Response to Therapy (PGART).
      Patients will be evaluated for safety on the clinical adverse events reported during the
      study period, sedation on drowsy alert scale and Global Assessment of Tolerability to Therapy
      (PGATT). The patients will also be evaluated for laboratory safety as assessed by measuring
      laboratory parameters for hemogram, renal and hepatic parameters.
