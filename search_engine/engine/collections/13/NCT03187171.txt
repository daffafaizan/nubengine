      the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who agreed to be part of the study will be
      randomized to either Allograft or Cohere polyetheretherketone (PEEK) fusion group and will be
      followed for approximately 12 months following surgery according to the standard-of-care.

      Pain and function will be assessed using neck disability index (NDI), 36-Item Short Form
      Survey (SF-36), and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). A trained study team member will record a
      standardized neurologic examination, including motor, sensory, and reflexes. Neurologic
      success is defined as maintenance or improvement of all 3 neurologic parameters (motor,
      sensory, and reflexes). The clinical results will also be assessed using the Japanese
      Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring system for cervical myelopathy.

      Flexion and extension radiographs will be obtained pre-operatively, at 6-months and 12-months
      after surgery. A CT scan will be obtained at 6 months, if fusion has occurred no CT is needed
      at 12 months, if fusion did not occur another computerized tomography (CT) scan will obtained
      at 12 months. From previous literature, successful fusion is defined as ≤2° of angular motion
      on lateral flexion and extension radiographs, the presence of bridging trabecular bone
      between the vertebrae being fused, and the absence of any radiolucent zones spanning more
      than 50% of the allograft surface. Two independent blinded radiologists will assess the
      radiographs. In the event of disagreement about fusion healing, a third independent reading
      will be obtained from a third radiologist.
