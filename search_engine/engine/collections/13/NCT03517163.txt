      domains of social communication and restrictive and repetitive behavior. There is general
      agreement, in light of knowledge around optimal periods of neural plasticity, that ASD should
      be diagnosed as early as possible since young toddlers are at a critical stage in early
      development when intervention is theoretically most effective. The rate of persistence of an
      ASD diagnosis is heavily debated.Therefore this study attempts:

        1. To determine the rate of persistence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis and
           functional outcomes, as defined by cognitive level, adaptive functioning, language
           skills, persistence of ASD symptoms, and classroom placement at kindergarten age, among
           children who received a DSM-5 ASD diagnosis at < 36 months.

        2. To evaluate predictors of rate of persistence and functional outcomes among kindergarten
           grade level children ages 5-7 years, who received an ASD diagnosis as toddlers.
