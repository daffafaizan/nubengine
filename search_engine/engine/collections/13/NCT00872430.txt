      several years in Brazil for the treatment of constipation. This product contains fruit of
      Pimpinella anisum (green anises), fruit of Foeniculum vulgare (fennel), flowers of Sambucus
      nigra (elder tree) and flowers of Cassia angustifolia (senna). In spite of the beneficial
      effects of its components, separately demonstrated in vitro, it never had its effectiveness
      appraised in a randomized clinical trial.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of this product in a randomized crossover placebo-controlled clinical
      trial. Twenty patients presenting with the criteria of the American Association of
      Gastroenterology for chronic constipation were included, and concluded a two-phase crossover
      study. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the intestinal transit time measured
      through radiological technique. The secondary endpoints were the number of evacuations,
      subjective impression of the quality in the intestinal habit, quality of life appraised
      through WHOQOL-brief and adverse effects.
