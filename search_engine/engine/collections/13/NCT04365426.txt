      consent, will undergo to a cephalic (masseter) and extracephalic (finger) mechanical stimulus
      to evaluate the threshold of mechanical pain, and physiological records of systolic/diastolic
      pressure and heart rates. After, we will evaluate the threshold response and physiological
      rates to the same mechanical stimulus under a thermal (cold) conditional pain (TCP) at 3
      different moments of menstrual period in No contraceptive group (No OC) versus Contraceptive
      group (CO). Finally, we will compare the mechanical threshold response, physiological rates
      and pain perception between both groups.
