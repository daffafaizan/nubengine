    
      1. To test the feasibility of wearing an earphone system delivering acoustic stimulation
           during a night of sleep in adult epilepsy patients monitored in an inpatient unit.

        2. To determine the acute physiological effects of low-frequency acoustic stimulation on
           interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) frequency during NREM sleep in adult patients
           with epilepsy in an ambulatory setting.

        3. To determine the feasibility of applying low-frequency acoustic stimulation in a
           long-term home setting in adult epilepsy patients with frequent nocturnal seizures.
