      Enhancement (EASE). This program was designed to address ASD-specific obstacles to effective
      emotion regulation, such as reduced awareness concerning others' intentions, a limited
      repertoire of behavioral responses, and inadequate language for understanding emotional
      experiences. This new program is based on an acceptance-based approach in which awareness of
      emotion is developed, emotions (whether negative or positive) are accepted, and behavior is
      regulated in the face of intense emotion. The goal is not to learn to avoid negative
      emotions, but rather to develop a collection of abilities which allow the individual to
      manage stress and act in ways that are more adaptive. The investigators expect to find that
      participants' emotion dysregulation will decrease and their adaptive function will increase
      following completion of the EASE program.
