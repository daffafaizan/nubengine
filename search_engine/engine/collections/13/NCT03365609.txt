      therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy and concomitant therapy. The course of treatment is 14
      days. The primary outcome measure was the Hp eradication rate at 4-6 weeks after completion
      of treatment which was confirmed by a negative of 13 UBT. Secondary outcome measures included
      side effects, impact factor and changes of microbiome after the therapy.
