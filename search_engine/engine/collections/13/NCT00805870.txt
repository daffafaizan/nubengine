      will develop. Muscle soreness that peaks between 24-72 hours after exercise and diminishes in
      5-7 days is characterized as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). DOMS is associated with
      the eccentric phase of exercise, where the muscle is actively creating force while
      lengthening. The onset of muscle soreness is part of an inflammatory response due to the
      muscular damage caused by the exercise.

      Research has shown that fish oils have anti-inflammatory properties. Direct intake of various
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) alters the cell membrane fatty acid composition, which, in
      turn modulates cell/tissue response to infection, injury and inflammatory events. These
      properties may be beneficial to relieve muscle soreness.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of fish oil supplementation
      (Lovaza, GlaxoSmithKline, 3 grams per day for 65 days) on muscle strength, muscle soreness
      and inflammation following exercise.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Lovaza (3 grams/day) or placebo.
      Participants will consume either the Lovaza or the placebo for 65 consecutive days. On Day
      60, participants will have baseline measurements of muscle strength, muscle soreness,
      creatine kinase activity, and muscle inflammatory marker assessed. Participants will then
      perform eccentric exercise on an isokinetic dynamometer using the quadriceps muscles in order
      to induce muscle soreness. On each of Days 61-65, muscle strength, muscle soreness, creatine
      kinase activity, and muscle inflammatory markers will again be assessed.
