    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of CandinÂ® (Candida albicans
      Skin Test Antigen) at either 0.3 mL dose levels at up to 6 monthly injections (a maximal,
      cumulative dose of 1.9 mL, including the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) test) for
      treating common warts (Verruca vulgaris). A secondary objective is to understand the relative
      effectiveness of the 0.3 dose level for treating common warts, both those that were injected
      and those that were not injected as well as other types of warts that were not injected to
      allow a determination of appropriate dose levels to use in a future dose-ranging efficacy
      trial.
