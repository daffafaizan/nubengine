      The biological samples from these smokers are being collected since they do not currently
      exist in the biorepository (e.g. buccal cells). Potential smokers from the three racial
      groups who meet specific inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study.
      Should recruitment from the MEC sample be insufficient, smokers who meet the criteria will be
      recruited from the general population. This study will involve one to two home visits where
      tobacco use and medical history and biological samples will be collected including blood,
      buccal cells and urine.

      Approximately 300 smokers will be recruited from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study or the
      general population in Hawai'i. 100 participants from each of the three designated
      ethnic/racial groups: Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans and Non-Hispanic Whites. All
      participants will be recruited from Hawai'i to reduce variation due to geographical location
      and maximize ability to recruit the targeted ethnic/racial groups.

      This study will involve one to two home visits where demographics, tobacco use and exposure
      history, medical history and medication use, questionnaires assessing tobacco dependence,
      alcohol use, and environmental exposures will be administered. and biological samples will be
      collected including blood, buccal cells and urine.
