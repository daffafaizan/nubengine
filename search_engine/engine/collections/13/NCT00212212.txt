      functions. There is much interest in the role selenium may play in several disease processes.
      It is possible that certain diseases result in selenium deficiency because of the form of
      selenium taken in the normal diet.

      We propose to measure the selenium biomarkers associated with supplemental intakes of 200 or
      400 µg of selenium per day in the chemical form selenate, or with supplemental intake of 200
      µg selenium as selenomethionine. 144 patients with cirrhosis will be randomized to one of 4
      treatment groups, including a placebo. After treatement for 4 weeks, all participants will
      receive 400 µg of selenium per day as selenate for 4 weeks. Blood will be measured initially
      and at 4 and 8 weeks. Selenium, selenoprotein P and glutathione peroxidase will be measured
      in the plasma.
