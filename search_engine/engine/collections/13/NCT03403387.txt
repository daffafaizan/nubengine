      a combination prebiotic, probiotic, and enzyme supplement, and the gut environment.

      The study will be a split, 28-day randomized, partially blinded design. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will complete a 28-day treatment period
      with GlutenShield taken 3x/day with meals. The other group will complete a 28-day placebo
      period with the placebo taken 3x/day with meals. The placebo will contain Avicel (cellulose)
      and bentonite powder (to have a similar color as GlutenShield). Participants will be blinded
      to which group/ treatment they are being given. Serum and fecal samples will be collected at
      baseline and on day 29. Participants will also complete a gastrointestinal symptoms
      questionnaire, a food frequency questionnaire and a psychosocial measures of self
      questionnaire.
