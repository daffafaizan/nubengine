      after partial hepatectomy (PH). There is a growing body of evidence that HO-1 induction
      through CO production has an important role in cellular protection and regeneration. To test
      this concept, we will monitor endogenous CO production in patients who undergo PH and analyze
      the relationship between CO production and hepatic regeneration. Using this approach we will
      test the following two hypotheses: (1) HO-1 induction after PH is proportional to the extent
      of the surgical resection, and (2) failure to appropriately induce HO-1 is associated with
      impaired hepatic regeneration.

      Specific Aim 1: To monitor the extent of HO-1 induction (by measuring endogenous CO
      production) in relationship to the extent of hepatic resection 1.1 Monitor CO in exhaled air
      of patients before liver resection, at 4 hours and 24 hours after PH 1.2 Monitor
      carboxyhemoglobin(COHb) in the arterial blood gas of patients before liver resection at 4
      hours and 24 hours after PH 1.3 Analyze the relationship between CO production and the extent
      of hepatic resection assessed by computed scans liver volumetric study at one and three
      months after PH, size and weight of the resected specimen and operative report.

      Specific Aim 2: To analyze the relationship between HO-1 induction and the quality of
      post-hepatectomy liver regeneration after PH 2.1 Analyze the relationship between CO
      production and the quantity and quality of hepatic regeneration assessed by computed scans
      liver volumetric study at one and three months after PH and liver function tests after PH.

      2.2 Determine the relation between postoperative liver related morbidity in patients
      undergoing PH and the extent of postoperative HO-1 induction.
