      pulmonary and ventilator therapy. It remains a main complication of extreme prematurity and
      currently lacks efficient treatment.The mortality rate of one year after birth is still high
      and the quality of life is not optimistic.

      hUC-MSCs are widely used in clinic due to their low immunogenicity and convenient to get.Many
      animal study had shown that hUC-MSCs had therapeutic effects on a variety of animal models of
      lung disease.Furthermore,there are a large number of clinical trials of MSCs applied to
      various system diseases and the safety was verified.So,the main purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of hUC-MSCs in participants with moderate and severe BPD.
