    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of high-dose carmustine, etoposide, Ara-c (cytarabine) and melphalan
      (BEAM) and Thymoglobulin (antithymocyte globulin) as a high-dose immunosuppressive treatment
      (HDIT) regimen in patients with severe, refractory neurological autoimmune disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate disease responses and the duration of response to HDIT and autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      II. Determine the efficacy and safety of G-CSF (filgrastim) and prednisone or
      cyclophosphamide for hematopoietic stem mobilization in patients with neurological autoimmune
      diseases.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive carmustine intravenously (IV) on day -6, etoposide IV and cytarabine IV
      twice daily (BID) on days -5 to -2, melphalan IV on day -1, and antithymocyte globulin IV on
      days -2 and -1. Patients then undergo autologous or syngeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant on day 0. Patients also receive prednisone orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days
      7-21, followed by 2 week taper.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months, 1 year, and then
      annually thereafter for up to 5 years.
