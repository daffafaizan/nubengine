    
      Purpose:

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Pain Ease® spray, used as an adjunct
      to Ametop Gel™.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that using Pain Ease® spray as an adjunct to the standard use
      of Ametop Gel™ will increase the number of pain free venipunctures from 30% to 50% or more.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective

        1. To determine if using Pain Ease® spray as an adjunct to Ametop Gel™ will increase the
           number of pain free venipunctures Secondary Objectives

        2. To document the side effects of Pain Ease® spray and Ametop Gel™

        3. To document the number of attempts for a successful IV insertion

      Research Design:

      The investigators propose a patient-blinded randomized control trial of Ametop Gel™ with and
      without Pain Ease® spray as an adjunct.

      Statistical Analysis:

      An interim analysis will be performed at the study's halfway point after recruitment of 120
      participants. A score on the Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) of either 0 or 2 will be
      considered a pain-free IV start, while a score of 4-10 will be considered a painful IV
      cannula insertion. Fischer's Exact test will be used to determine statistical significance; a
      critical alpha of 0.05 will be considered for significance.
