      clinical research centers. After informed consent of the subjects and meeting the selection
      criteria, the subjects will be included in this clinical study. After the follow-up, all the
      data were sorted out and analyzed. Finally, the data of the two groups were compared to prove
      whether the high-pressure-resistant peripherally inserted central venous catheter developed
      by L&Z US, Inc. was not inferior to the control group.
