      prostate cancer patients. Eligible patients will have localized prostate cancer and be
      willing to undergo definitive local radiotherapy. 30 patients will be randomized in a 2:1
      ratio into two cohorts (see schema below) with patients in the vaccine arm receiving
      vaccination before, during and after primary standard radiotherapy (external beam alone or in
      combination with brachytherapy). When enrollment to these two cohorts is complete, enrollment
      will begin with up to 19 (9-10 HLA-A2 positive) patients to a third, non-randomized vaccine
      cohort. This cohort C will differ from the first vaccine cohort only in the IL-2 dose and
      schedule. The vaccine regimen will be composed of (1) a recombinant vaccinia virus that
      expresses the Prostate Specific Antigen gene (rV-PSA), admixed with (2) a recombinant
      vaccinia virus that expresses B7.1 costimulatory molecule (rV-B7.1); followed by (3)
      sequential vaccinations with recombinant fowlpox virus containing the PSA gene (rF-PSA). All
      patients on the vaccine arms will, in addition, receive sargramostim and aldesleukin as part
      of their vaccination schedule.

      The primary endpoint is to identify immunologic response as measured by in vitro analysis of
      the patients peripheral blood cells. The immune response of cohorts A and B will be analyzed
      at various times to determine whether a specific immune response can be affected by the
      vaccination as well as whether radiotherapy has an effect on that immune response. The serum
      PSA will be followed as a secondary endpoint.

      All patients with PSA-expressing adenocarcinoma of the prostate will be evaluated for
      eligibility that includes a history of prior vaccinia (as vaccine against smallpox) and
      immunocompetence.
