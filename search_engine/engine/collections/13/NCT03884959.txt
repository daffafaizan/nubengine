    
      Patient eligibility will be assessed during the Screening visit. The investigator should
      ensure that the chronic metabolic treatment (i.e. balance between low protein diet,
      supplements in amino acid mix, nitrogen scavenger and supplements in arginine and/or
      citrulline) of the patient is optimized for his/her metabolic condition.

      During the baseline period, 3 study visits will take place at 6 weeks interval for assessing
      the metabolic condition and the chronic metabolic treatment of the patient.

      A calculated dose based on patient's body weight will be administered via Permanent
      mesenteric Portal Access and Catheter for four times or a Transient Percutaneous Transhepatic
      Catheter for three times.

      The follow-up period will start approximately 12 weeks after the first HepaStem infusion day.
      This period will last approximately 9 months. Study visits will take place every 1.5month, FU
      visit 1 to FU visit 7.

      Primary Objective:

        1. To demonstrate the functional efficacy of HepaStem at 6 months after initiation of
           infusion in terms of ureagenesis improvement based on a functional test (13C tracer
           method)

        2. To evaluate the safety of Hepastem up to one year after initiation the Hepastem infusion

      Secondary Objective:

      1. To evaluate the efficacy of Hepastem in terms of functional, clinical, and biochemical
      parameters up to one year after initiation of the infusion.
