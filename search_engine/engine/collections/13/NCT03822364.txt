    
      This study will be conducted in 3 parts. Parts A and B will be conducted in healthy
      volunteers and Part C will be conducted in subjects with established Parkinson's disease. The
      primary objectives for each part are as follows.

      Part A: To compare the pharmacokinetics of a single low dose of AZ-009 with that of a
      therapeutically-relevant dose a commercially available apomorphine injector in healthy
      volunteers.

      Part B: To examine the tolerability and safety of AZ-009 of single ascending doses of active
      drug in healthy volunteers while; and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of single
      ascending doses of AZ-009 in healthy volunteers

      Part C: To examine the tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics of AZ-009 in subjects with
      established Parkinson's disease and to identify optimal doses to bring into multiple
      ascending dose safety and efficacy studies; and to assess the usability of AZ-009 in subjects
      with Parkinson's Disease
