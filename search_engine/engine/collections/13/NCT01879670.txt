    
      The CircuLite Synergy pump is a new minimally-invasive partial support left ventricular
      assist device (LVAD) that pumps blood from the left atrium to the right subclavian artery. Ex
      vivo pilot data suggests that the Synergy pump induces structural reverse remodelling, which
      proposes the Synergy device as a new disease-modifying therapy. We will assess whether the
      Synergy pump facilitates functional, structural and molecular LV reverse remodelling in vivo;
      assess how this can be determined and predicted by analysis of circulating micro RNA profiles
      and specific echocardiographic parameters; and evaluate the haematological abnormalities
      associated with this new LVAD.

      We will address these questions with a prospective, observational study comparing patients
      implanted with the Synergy device with matched heart failure controls. The two study centres
      will be Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust (Harefield Hospital) and University
      Hospitals Leuven, Belgium. We will recruit a total of 64 patients. The primary outcome will
      be change in peak VO2 at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include functional parameters,
      profiling of circulating microRNA, multimodal echocardiographic assessment and comprehensive
      assessment of platelet activation and coagulopathy.

      We will quantify the LV reverse remodelling associated with partial support; define new echo
      and microRNA markers of reverse remodelling for clinical use, with insights into underlying
      pathophysiology; and describe the haematological profile of these patients to guide future
      antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.
