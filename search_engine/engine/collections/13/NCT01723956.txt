      immunosuppression and lack of organized and effective screening and treatment programs in
      Africa. Other screening and treatment modalities need to be evaluated in resource limited
      countries as there is not capacity in most of these countries to implement a
      cytology/histology based program. The treatment modality of cryotherapy is easy to train and
      perform and can be done by a nurse. LEEP requires significant training usually doctors and
      skills in administering local anaesthetic. This study compares the two modalities of
      cryotherapy vs LEEP in a randomized controlled study in HIV positive women in South Africa.

      A. PRIMARY AIMS (S.A.):

        1. To compare the efficacy of cryotherapy and large loop excision of the transformation
           zone (LLETZ) procedures for the treatment of high-grade cervical intra-epithelial
           neoplasia (CIN2/3) among HIV-seropositive women by follow-up VIA, cytology and HPV.

        2. To determine the utility of subsequent HPV DNA testing as a marker of effective
           treatment following the treatment of CIN 2/3 among HIV-seropositive women.

        3. To compare the safety of cryotherapy versus LLETZ in HIV seropositive women.

      SECONDARY AIMS:

      1. To describe HIV disease status (CD4, HIV viral load), demographics, and sexual behavior in
      each treatment arm (LLETZ and cryotherapy) in HIV seropositive women.

      3. To determine the cervical disease recurrence rates with cryotherapy and LLETZ.

      4. To evaluate the relationship between HIV status, demographics, HPV, and sexual behavior
      with the clearance of cervical disease at the ectocervical and endocervical margins in HIV
      seropositive women.
