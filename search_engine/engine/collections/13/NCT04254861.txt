    
      This is a randomized, single-blind, parallel-group controlled trial comparing the efficacy of
      GTR and PRGF ENDORET in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. The trial will follow
      the recommendations of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.

      No negative control (SPPF alone) has been considered for this project since several studies
      have demonstrated that guided tissue regeneration (GTR) associated or not with bone grafts
      results in better clinical outcomes than access flap alone in the treatment of periodontal
      intrabony defects.

      The study consists of 9 visits over a minimum period of 13 months and will take place at the
      Centre for Oral Clinical Research (COCR), at the Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London
      School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London.

      treatment groups.

        -  Simplified Papilla Preservation Flap (SPPF) and guided tissue regeneration (GTR) with a
           porcine collagen membrane and a deproteinized bovine bone substitute.

        -  Simplified Papilla Preservation Flap (SPPF) and PRGF ENDORET.

      A balanced random permuted block approach (4-unit block size) will be used to prepare the
      randomisation tables. Minimisation will be carried out to facilitate balancing of smokers in
      each group.

      Allocation to treatment will take place via the study coordinator (or one of their delegate).
      Treatment allocation details will be concealed in an opaque envelope at the study site.

      At the time of enrollment, each participant will be sequentially issued a subject ID. The
      subject ID consists of two initials and a number. The ID number will consist of three digits
      and will be assigned in ascending numerical order beginning with 001.
