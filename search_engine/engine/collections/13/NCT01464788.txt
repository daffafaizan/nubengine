      ischemic stroke, fails to reperfuse brain in most patients with large thrombi. In our Phase
      2a low-dose safety study (n=65), the two drugs appeared safe when delivered concomitantly and
      recanalization rates were greater than historical controls. This study will provide
      evidence-based hypotheses and data needed to design a larger definitive trial.

      The purpose of this trial is to estimate overall treatment benefit (improvement in
      disability) among stroke patients treated with rt-PA who are randomized to also receive
      either low-dose Argatroban, high-dose Argatroban or neither.
