    
      The investigators will study 22 healthy subjects (18-35 yrs) four times as follows:

        1. Saline + Octreotide + euglycemia;

        2. Octreotide + hyperglycemia;

        3. Octreotide + hyperglycemia + insulin clamp and

        4. Octreotide + Euglycemia + insulin clamp.

      The sequence of admissions will be assigned randomly. The investigators will assess function
      in conduit (pulse wave velocity-PWV, augmentation index-AI and flow-mediated dilation-FMD),
      resistance (post-ischemic flow velocity-PIFV) and heart and skeletal muscle microvascular
      (contrast enhanced ultrasound-CEU) vessels.

      This work will:

      a) identify whether vascular stiffness and indices of NO action are impaired throughout the
      arterial tree with hyperglycemia.
