      series of movements that serve to prepare and expand the pharyngoesophageal segment (PES),
      which is the inlet into the esophagus. Under normal circumstances, a food bolus is safely
      propelled from the oropharynx, through the PES, and into the esophagus. Surgical and
      radiation therapy in the head and neck, as well as deficiencies such as poor coordination,
      mistiming, or obstructing lesions may prevent the food bolus from safely entering the
      esophagus and instead diverting toward the trachea.

      A number of patients with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia are not able to tolerate any diet
      without risking aspiration and subsequent pneumonia, often to a degree severe enough that
      they cannot manage to safely swallow their secreted saliva. These patients depend on a
      gastrostomy feeding tube in order to obtain adequate daily nutritional requirements and must
      suction or spit out their saliva to prevent aspiration and a sensation of asphyxiation.
      Despite these precautions, many of these patients ultimately suffer life-threatening
      pneumonia. Investigators will be testing if the use of use of a negative pressure suction in
      the hypopharynx will reduce the amount of aspiration during Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing
      Exam (VFSE) among patients with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia
