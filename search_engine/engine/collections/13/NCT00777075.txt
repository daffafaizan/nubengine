      oxide (NO) is a physiological signal essential to penile erection. NO synthase (NOS)
      catalyzes the production of NO from L-arginine. ADMA, a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase
      increases with age and many disorders that reduce NO in the erectile tissue are commonly
      associated with ED. Although new pharmacological strategies have been identified for medical
      treatment of ED, patients often seek alternative therapies for cost or side effect reasons.

      The aim of the present study is to determine the efficacy of orally administered L-arginine
      on ED not caused by established organic disease.
