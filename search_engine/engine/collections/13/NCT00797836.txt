        1. survey of HCWs working in high-risk units (respiratory diseases or infectious diseases
           with at least 5 case of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis par year) from 14
           University hospitals in France

        2. Follow-up of HCWs with unexpected exposure to a patient with contagious tuberculosis
           (delay in respiratory isolation of a smear-positive patient) in 4 University hospitals
           Main objective: Therapeutic impact of tuberculosis screening using TST compared to QFTG.
           The impact is defined by the decision to treat of not a HCW with latent tuberculosis
           using QFTG, compared to the decision which would have been based on TST alone

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Cost-effectiveness of replacing TST by QFTG

        -  Prevalence and incidence of latent tuberculosis in exposed HCWs (Part 1)

        -  Incidence of latent tuberculosis in HCWs exposed to an index case (part 2) Inclusion:
           HCWs who volunteer to participate in units with at least 5 patients with smear-positive
           tuberculosis each year (Group 1), HCWs exposed to a smear-positive patient non isolated
           at hospital admission (Group 2) Study population: 2000 (Group 1) and 600 (Group 2) HCWs
           Study duration: inclusion during 3 months, follow-up of one year (Group 1 ); Inclusion
           for one year, with a 3-month follow up (Group 2)

      Study exams:

        -  Group 1 : TST, QFTG, chest radiography at baseline and after one year

        -  Group 2 : TST, QFTG, chest radiography at baseline (within 3 weeks after exposure) and
           after 3 months

      Endpoints:

        -  therapeutic decision regarding tuberculosis treatment, with a cost-effectiveness
           analysis (Markov's modelling)

        -  prevalence and incidence of latent tuberculosis
