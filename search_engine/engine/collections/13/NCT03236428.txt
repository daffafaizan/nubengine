      investigational drug. Preliminary experience suggests that daratumumab may prevent or
      postpone SMM from becoming active multiple myeloma. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine if the this drug may improve the rate of prevention of multiple myeloma.

      Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cell, which is an important part of the immune
      system. Patients with active multiple myeloma generally require treatment. There are
      currently no approved therapies for smoldering multiple myeloma or Monoclonal Gammopathy of
      Unknown Significance.

      Daratumumab is a drug that may kill or stop cancer cells from growing through a variety of
      mechanisms by attaching to the CD38 molecule, which is over-expressed in multiple myeloma
      cells. This type of drug is called a monoclonal antibody. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration) has not approved Daratumumab for the participant specific disease but it has
      been approved for use in active Multiple Myeloma.
