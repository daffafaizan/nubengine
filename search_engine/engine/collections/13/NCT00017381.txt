      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of IDEC-Y2B8 when administered with rituximab in
      vivo purging and autologous stem cell rescue.

      II. To obtain correlative laboratory data of in vivo purging with rituximab in patients with
      0-35% marrow involvement.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      (IDEC-Y2B8).

      PART I: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1
      hour on day 25. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on day
      26 and continuing until autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested.

      PART II: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of the fourth rituximab infusion, patients
      receive indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 1 followed by dosimetry
      imaging on days 1, 2, 4, and 7. Patients then receive IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes once
      between days 8-15.

      The initial 3 patients receive the same dose of IDEC-Y2B8 and then subsequent cohorts of 3-5
      patients receive escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated dose is
      determined.

      PART III: All patients undergo PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) beginning after residual bone
      marrow radioactivity resolves. G-CSF is administered SC beginning 1 day after PBSCT and
      continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.
