      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast. II. Determine the objective response rate, time to
      progression, and survival in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxic
      effects of this regimen in these patients. IV. Assess the common functional polymorphisms in
      genes involved in chemotherapeutic response to improve prediction of clinical outcomes and
      provide insight into the potential for genotype-specific drug dosage.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD),
      partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) may receive 4 additional courses past SD,
      PR, or CR. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.
