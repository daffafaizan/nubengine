      of glutamate modulators during week 2 while engaged in a 5-week course of MET. They will meet
      with staff twice weekly, except for week 2 during which they will present to the clinic three
      times. Clinic visits include MET sessions, psychiatric monitoring, assessments, and study
      procedures (e.g., medication administration).
