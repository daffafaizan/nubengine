      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved LY2606368 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Olaparib for ovarian cancer but
      it has not been approved for other uses.

      LY2606368 is a checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor that is being developed as a treatment
      for patients with advanced cancer. CHK1 inhibitors work by preventing the cancer cells from
      being able to repair damaged DNA (one of the building blocks of a cell) which then leads to
      cell death.

      Olaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. PARP is a protein in the body
      that repairs damage to DNA. In cells that are rapidly growing such as cancer cells, blocking
      repair of DNA may be of benefit, since it will cause the cell to die.

      In this research study, the investigators are combining LY2606368 with Olaparib in the hopes
      that it will be a safe combination and that the LY2606368 will enhance how the cancer will
      respond to Olaparib. In previous laboratory studies performed by treating cancer cells with a
      CHK1 inhibitor and a PARP inhibitor, it was found that the CHK1 inhibitor was successful in
      increasing efficacy.
