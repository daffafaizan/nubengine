      at least a two year of follow-up. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare progression-free
      survival (PFS), complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) proportion at day 100, time
      to hematopoietic recovery, incidence of infection, grade III-IV toxicities, treatment-related
      mortality, incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and secondary acute myelogenous
      leukemia (AML).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive rituximab
      intravenously (IV) on days -21 and -14, and 90-yttrium ibritumomab tiuxetan IV on day -14.
      Patients also receive BEAM comprising carmustine IV over 4 hours on day -6; cytarabine IV
      over 2 hours twice daily (BID) on days -5 to -2; etoposide IV over 1 hour BID or once daily
      (QD) on days -5 to -2; and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients then undergo peripheral blood
      stem cell (PBSC) transplant on day 0. ARM II: Patients receive BEAM as in Arm I and undergo
      PBSC transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 30 days, 100 days, 6
      months, 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.
