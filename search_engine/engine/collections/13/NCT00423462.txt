      in dynamic psychotherapy, using an experimental dismantling design. One hundred psychiatric
      out-patients, referred to seven study therapists, to receive exploratory dynamic
      psychotherapy, were randomized to one year weekly dynamic psychotherapy, with and without
      transference interpretations.They suffered from mood,anxiety,and personality disorders or
      interpersonal problems not due to a mental disorder. All treatment sessions were audiotaped
      and treatment integrity carefully checked.All patients have been evaluated before treatment,
      after treatment, one year after termination of treatment, and three years after termination
      of treatment. The main outcome measures were the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales (PFS) and
      Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-Circumplex version (IIP-C).Chang over time is assessed
      using linear mixed model analyses.

      The main hypothesis is that patients treated with transference interpretations will have a
      more favourable course over the whole study period of four years.

      The second hypothesis is that suitable patients, that is patients with a life long pattern of
      more mature object relations (QOR) and/or patients without comorbid personality disorders
      will do better with transference interpretations.

      Insight and identification with the therapist will be analyzed as putative mediators of
      long-term change in interpersonal functioning
