    
      This trial is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      GSK1358820 for the treatment of patients with focal wrist, finger and in some cases, thumb
      spasticity post-stroke. Qualified patients will be eligible for enrollment upon completion of
      double-blind study 112958. Patients will receive a single treatment session with
      intramuscular injections of GSK1358820 "200U or 240U (if thumb spasticity is present)".The
      subjects will be observed for 12 weeks post injection.

      Each completed subject will attend 4 clinic visits. The maximum study duration is 13 weeks.
      The study includes a 1 week pretreatment period, during which the screening visit (visit 1
      could be the last visit of previous double-blind study 112958 or any time within 3 months
      after completion of previous study) is to take place. Only one upper limb (meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be evaluated and treated in the study. Subjects will
      receive a single intramuscular treatment with investigated drug at day 0 (visit 2). There
      will be two post-injection follow-up visits at week 6 and 12 (visits 3 to 4).
