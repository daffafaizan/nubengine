      therapy in ameliorating the adverse consequences of Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI). A
      secondary purpose is to investigate the interrelationship among measure of chronic venous
      diseases: lower limb muscle strength, mobility, and other symptoms of CVI important to the
      quality of life. Sixty patients will be randomized to a 6 months physical therapy program or
      to a control group. All subjects will undergo a complete hemodynamic and psychiatric
      assessment. Key measures will be repeated twice to quantify trend and stability of the
      baseline measures. Skin biopsies will be obtained in selected patients who demonstrate a
      response to the physical therapy to evaluate the ultrastructural response therapy. Physical
      therapy will be conducted 1-3 times per week. Participants will be visited at home and a
      program will be tailored for each individual to maximize compliance. Validated, standardized
      questionnaires (FIM, SF-36, OARS, CHART) and functional ratings will be employed at
      commencement,3,6 and 12 months. Evaluations of hydrodynamics, muscle strength, and ankle
      motion will be conducted monthly during active physical therapy. Participants in active
      therapy will be offered to wait listed control group after 6 months.
