      Cancer Centre to check the position of patients before RT. Using CBCT, the doctor is able to
      reduce the amount of tissues that receive RT because patients can be set-up with greater
      accuracy to only target the tumour and not harm the surrounding healthy tissue. In this
      study, children will receive one CBCT scan before starting RT as part of standard approach.
      Then after RT, another CBCT scan will be used to measure movement between the beginning and
      end of RT. The information gathered from this study will benefit other patients and cancer
      centres in the future, who can learn from these methods of using audio-visual distraction so
      that children have minimal or no motion for a more precise delivery of radiation during
      cancer treatment.
