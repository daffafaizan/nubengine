    
      Over a period of one year, a total of 500 lactating (encompassing both exclusive and partial
      breastfeeding) women were enrolled in the study and completed the first 24-hour dietary
      recall. The women attended a hospital for physical examination, dietary interview, and blood
      sampling. Blood samples were also collected from their infants who also went through a
      detailed clinical examination

      The blood samples from mothers and infant pairs were collected approximately one week apart.
      The blood was spun down, plasma separated and transferred into storage vials immediately.
      Plasma and blood pellets were stored in cryovials at -70 until analysis.

      All women were also requested to provide one breast milk and one urine sample.

      Plasma, blood pellet, urine, and breast milk was stored at -70 degrees celcius until
      analysis.

      Plasma was analyzed for iron, transferrin receptor, ferritin, cobalamin, folate, vitamin A,
      vitamin D, vitamin E, several amino acids and other micronutrient related metabolites.

      The breast milk will be analyzed for iodine, fatty acids, and several B vitamins

      The urine was analyzed for iodine.

      In phase 2, after 5 years we revisited the mother-child pairs and measured growth, diet, food
      security, and neurodevelopment.
