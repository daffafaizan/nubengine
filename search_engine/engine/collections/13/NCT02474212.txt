      pump CABG patients with a clinical indication for post-operative thromboprophylaxis will be
      studied in the Tampere University Heart Hospital. Study has two independent parts with 40
      patients in both. Results are reported separately from these two parts of the study.

      Firts part of the study: After written consent, 20+20 patients are randomized to receive
      enoxaparin either as continuous intravenous infusion (treatment group) or subcutaneous bolus
      injection (control group). Enoxaparin dose is 40mg/24h either CIV of SCB. Anti-Xa values are
      measured 12-14 times from blood samples to evaluate the anticoagulation effect of enoxaparin.

      Second part of the study: After written consent, 20+20 patients are randomized to receive
      enoxaparin either as continuous intravenous infusion (treatment group) or subcutaneous bolus
      injection (control group). Enoxaparin dose is 1mg/kg/24h in CIV group and 0,5mg/kg twice a
      day in SCB group. In this second part of the study with eleveted enoxaparin dosage, 4
      additional blood samples will be taken and analysed by ROTEM to investigate the overall
      coagulation status of the patients before and after the initiation of enoxaparin.

      The study will consist of two independent parts.
