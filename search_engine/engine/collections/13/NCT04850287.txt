      groups of ZIP Codes of similar cultural, socioeconomic, and ethnic/racial factors. Digital
      markers of population awareness about organ donation will be estimated from publicly
      available online conversations of users in social media. A clustered randomized control trial
      will be conducted and ZIP Codes from each demographic environment will be randomly assigned
      to control and intervention arms. Digital educational materials about organ donation will be
      exposed to online users in social media belonging to ZIP Codes assigned to the intervention
      arm.
