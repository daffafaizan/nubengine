        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of thiotepa in combination with carboplatin and
           topotecan with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with recurrent or
           refractory pediatric solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of thiotepa.

      Patients may receive 2 courses of mobilization comprising cyclophosphamide and etoposide with
      filgrastim (G-CSF) support and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection.

      Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days 0 and 1; topotecan IV over 30 minutes on
      days 0-4; and carboplatin IV over 2 hours on days 2 and 3. Patients also receive G-CSF
      beginning on day 5, 24-36 hours following the last dose of topotecan. PBSC are reinfused on
      day 6 (36-48 hours following the last dose of topotecan) of each course of therapy. Patients
      receive 3 courses of therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of thiotepa until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued into this study.
