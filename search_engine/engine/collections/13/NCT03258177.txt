      virtual care technology or by attending a standard in-person visit at the clinic. The virtual
      visit uses a camera-enabled device and internet access to provide live access to the medical
      professional. Surveys to assess patient satisfaction and convenience will be administered by
      email on the day of the postoperative follow-up visit. Additional information including
      demographics, hospital encounters within 30 days of surgery, length of time of the follow-up
      visit, travel cost and time, whether additional follow-up care is required, and complications
      after surgery will be collected to evaluate postoperative virtual care visits. Subject
      participation in the study will end after follow-up care is complete or at 30 days, whichever
      occurs last.
