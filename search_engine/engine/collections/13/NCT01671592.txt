                biopsy, at the discretion of the investigator/sub-investigator (Day 3 only, based
                on readout)

        -  Procedures on Day 15

             -  Complete physical examination (with ECOG PS and weight)

             -  CBC, platelet, differential

             -  Blood for in vitro assays

        -  Procedures during booster courses (Days 36 to 38, 64 to 66, and 91 to 93)

             -  Complete physical examination (with PS and weight) on the 1st day of each 3 day
                course (Days 36, 64, and 91)

             -  CBC, platelet, differential on the 1st day of each 3 day course (Days 36, 64, and
                91)

             -  Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) including: glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium,
                potassium, Cl, CO2, calcium, total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, AST,
                ALT, total bilirubin on the 1st day of each 3 day course (Days 36, 64, and 91)

             -  DTH tests: administration on 1st day and readout on 3rd day during 2nd and 3rd
                booster courses (Administration days 64 and 91, readout days 66 and 93)

             -  Biopsy of the DTH site can be performed in any subject who consented to such
                biopsy, at the discretion of the investigator/sub-investigator (3rd day of 3 day
                course, based on readout of DTH test)

             -  Blood for in vitro assays (1st and 3rd day of each 3 day course)

                routine care

             -  Photography

        -  Long term follow-up The subjects with lack of disease progression at 6 months after the
           last vaccination will be monitored for the disease free survival and overall survival.
           Subjects may be contacted every 3 months within the first three years after study
           intervention, every six months until year 5, and annually afterwards. In lieu of direct
           contact a medical record review may be performed to obtain the data for these time
           points for disease progression and/or survival.
