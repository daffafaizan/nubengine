      Primary

        -  To compare the activity of sunitinib malate when administered before vs after
           cytoreductive nephrectomy, in terms of response rate, in patients with metastatic renal
           cell carcinoma.

        -  To compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To compare the duration of response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy. Patients then receive adjuvant
           therapy comprising oral sunitinib malate once daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every
           6 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Some patients may continue treatment beyond 1 year at the discretion of the
           investigator.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy comprising oral sunitinib malate once daily
           for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses. After completion of
           neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy followed by adjuvant
           sunitinib malate as in arm I.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months for up to 1 year.
