      that H.pylori eradication is an effective approach to reduce the risk of developing gastric
      cancer. However, eradication rates of first-line therapy decreased over years due to the
      rapidly emerging antibiotic resistance of H. pylori worldwide. An ideal rescue therapeutic
      regimen to cure refractory H.pylori infection is currently warranted.

      Traditional sequential therapy failed to achieve an ideal eradication rates (over>95%) as a
      third line treatment in the region with high antibiotic resistance. The investigator's study
      aims to evaluate the efficacy 14-day modified sequential therapy in the patients with two or
      more treatment failure, and whether the adverse effects of this new modified sequential
      therapy are tolerable.
