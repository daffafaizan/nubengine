      eligible participants will require a pre-dose biopsy completed as part of the study within
      the screening window. All participants will undergo an End of Study (EOS) biopsy. Treated
      participants will be offered the opportunity to continue treatment in an open label extension
      during which they will undergo a final biopsy.
