      >65 years of age. As older individuals are at higher risk for surgical complications, the use
      of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for small renal masses (SRM) <4 cm in size, which include
      T1a tumors,may be a compelling treatment option for elderly patients. However, RFA uses heat
      to destroy abnormal tissue, with the risk of thermal injury to tissues and organs, including
      gastric tissue and nerve roots, which are in proximity to the targeted treatment zone. The
      incidence rate of major complication with RFA, including thermal wounds, has been reported to
      vary between 3.2% and 5.2%. Different thermal protection methods have been developed to lower
      the risk of injury to adjacent tissues during ablation, such as air dissection using CO2
      injection and hydrodissection using G5% for shielding. Although both of these options are
      effective, they are expensive. To lower the cost of thermal protection, the investigators
      have been using ambient air instead of CO2 for air dissection prior to RFA for SRM-RCCs.
