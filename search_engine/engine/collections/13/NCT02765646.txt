      in-hospital and follow-up data to determine primary composite endpoint of MACE (Major Adverse
      Cardiac Events) at 9 months and secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoints are defined as
      successful deployment of the Tryton stent and main vessel DES within the target lesion,
      angiographic success <30% residual stenosis in LM and LAD/LCX by visual estimate and TIMI 3
      flow post procedure, and freedom of in-hospital MACE.
