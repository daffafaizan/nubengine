      double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being
      taken, or at what dosage), repeated-dose, three-arm parallel group study conducted in three
      phases. Following a Prior Opioid Stabilization Phase, wherein patients were required to be on
      a stable dose of chronic opioid therapy, patients were converted, titrated and stabilized on
      hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) to achieve acceptable levels of analgesia in the
      Open-Label Hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) Conversion, Titration, and Stabilization
      Phase. Supplementary hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) was provided for breakthrough
      pain, and patients were considered stabilized on hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release)
      when the total daily dose of hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) remained unchanged with
      no more than three hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) breakthrough pain medication
      doses per day for 2 consecutive days. Patients who were able to achieve a stable total daily
      dose of at least 20 mg but not more than 60 mg of hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release)
      (exclusive of breakthrough pain medication) within the 14 day Open-Label hydromorphone HCI IR
      (immediate release) Conversion, Titration, and Stabilization Phase of the study entered the
      Double-Blind, Randomized, Repeat Dosing Phase of the study. Patients were randomized to
      receive 7 days of either OROS hydromorphone HCI SR (slow release) at a daily dose
      approximately equal to their stabilized total daily dose of hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate
      release), OROS hydromorphone HCI SR (slow release) at a daily dose approximately equal to
      one-half their stabilized total daily dose of hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) (1/2
      OROS hydromorphone slow release), or hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) at the same
      daily dose on which they were stabilized (hydromorphone immediate release). Patients who
      completed the study were eligible for participation in an open-label OROS hydromorphone SR
      (slow release) long-term extension study (Protocol DO-109). OROS hydromorphone slow release
      8, 16 and 32 mg tablets, hydromorphone immediate release 2 and 4 mg tablets, placebo
      immediate release 2 and 4 mg tablets and placebo slow release 8, 16, and 32 mg tablets taken
      orally for 7 days
