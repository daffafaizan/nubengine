      maintenance phase.

      Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Those who have a confirmed
      complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study.
      Subjects who experience ongoing stable disease (SD) or an ongoing partial response (PR) at 1
      year may enter the maintenance phase at the Investigator's and Sponsor's discretion. Subjects
      may remain in the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year.

      In the randomized component of the phase 2 portion of the study, the control arm will be
      treated with radiation according to established SoC protocols as determined by the
      Investigator.

      In the phase 2 single-arm component of the study, subjects will be enrolled in the first
      stage of Simon's two-stage optimal design. If the study proceeds to the second stage of
      Simon's two-stage optimal design, additional subjects will be enrolled in the second stage.
