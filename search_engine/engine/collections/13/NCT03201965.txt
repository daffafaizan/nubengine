      clinical evaluation will be done), Treatment Phase (monitoring of adverse events (AEs),
      laboratory abnormalities and clinical response), Post-Treatment Observation Phase (disease
      evaluations will be done) and a Long-term Follow-up Phase (Subsequent anticancer treatment,
      response to subsequent treatment, date of progression and survival status will be obtained
      every 16 weeks).The primary hypothesis is that daratumumab in combination with CyBorD will
      improve the overall complete hematological response rate compared to CyBorD alone in AL
      amyloidosis participants. Safety will be assessed by AEs, laboratory test results,
      electrocardiogram, vital sign measurements, physical examination, and Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.
