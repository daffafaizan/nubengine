    
      Thanks to neuroimaging biomarkers already validated in HD and the newly identified metabolic
      brain biomarkers using 31P-MRS, we can test for a reduction in neurodegeneration among HD
      patients resulting from an improvement in brain energy profiles with resveratrol.

      We plan to randomize 102 early affected HD patients (with a maximum of 120 included patients)
      in France (5≤UHDRS≤40) in a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Patients will receive
      either resveratrol at 80 mg (n=51), or placebo (n=51) for 12 months. Clinical benefit will be
      respectively evaluated by UHDRS and neuropsychiatric questionnaires; biological tolerance
      will be evaluated by routine biochemical blood tests and plasma measurements of resveratrol,
      these three factors will be tested every three months.

      The primary end-point will be the measure of the rate of caudate atrophy - the most sensitive
      biomarker identified to date in HD - after one year of treatment with resveratrol in early
      affected HD patients using volumetric MRI as we described.

      Secondary end-points include:

      The clinical and biological tolerance of resveratrol in HD patients will be evaluated by (i)
      neuropsychiatric questionnaires: Starkstein apathy scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale (HADS), Systems Behaviour Inventory (FrSBe) and SF36, (ii) a cognitive test; Symbol
      Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and (iii) routine biochemical tests The clinical benefit of
      resveratrol will be evaluated by a decrease in the progression of the UHDRS over a year of
      treatment The benefit of resveratrol on brain energy metabolism will be evaluated by the
      restoration of an increased ratio of inorganic phosphate/phosphocreatine - reflecting normal
      brain activation - during visual stimulation, using 31P-MRS as we described The progression
      of caudate atrophy over a year will be correlated with the changes in brain energy profile as
      well as changes in the progression of the UHDRS.

      The compliance of treatment and peak in plasmatic concentration through plasma measurements
      of resveratrol.
