      Taiwan, and all eligible participants signed informed consent. The eligible pre-frail or
      frail elderly were screened according to the frailty phenotypes proposed by Fried and
      colleagues in the outpatient clinics. Participants who were over 65 years old and were able
      to walk 14 m independently were eligible for recruitment. The main exclusion criteria were
      critical illnesses; impairment in communication; nursing-home residents; participating other
      studies or taking nutritional supplementation; severe depression (Geriatric Depression Scale
      (GDS) < 10 points) or cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination < 23 points).
      Participants were randomly assigned into study groups for 3-month intervention and 3-month
      self-maintenance period. The assessment of all participants were conducted by blind case
      managers at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.
