      majority of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the prognosis for adult ALL
      remains discouraging due to a high incidence of relapse. Optimal post-remission therapy,
      therefore, has been a matter of vital concern. In some pediatric ALL studies, the use of
      high-dose methotrexate (MTX) as a consolidation therapy, has been shown to improve outcome,
      however, there has been no randomized controlled trials to test its clinical efficacy in
      adult ALL. With this concern, the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) has planned a
      prospective randomized controlled trial comparing high-dose MTX and intermediate-dose MTX for
      ALL patients who are negative for BCR-ABL. Those who are positive for BCR-ABL can participate
      in a separate protocol.
