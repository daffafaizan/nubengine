    
      This is a pilot study to determine if patients with pneumonia in the intensive care unit can
      safely receive five days of antibiotics. All patients admitted to the medical and surgical
      intensive care units at Barnes-Jewish Hospital with pneumonia will be screened for the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized by sealed envelopes in groups
      of six to a five or seven day course of antibiotics. The choice of the antibiotic to be used
      is determined by the intensive care unit treating team. The patients will NOT be randomized
      to a specific antibiotic. The patients will be followed for a clinical response by
      improvement in maximum daily temperature, white blood cell count, and PaO2 to FiO2 ratio.
      Antibiotics can continue past the goal duration for patients in either group if the above
      criteria are not met or if the attending physician in the intensive care unit feels that a
      longer course is needed. The treating team in the intensive care unit will not be blinded to
      the patient's treatment assignment.
