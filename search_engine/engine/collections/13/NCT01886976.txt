      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-CD138 vector (referred to as CART-138 cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-138 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood and bone marrow will be used to detect and
      quantify survival of CART-138 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-myeloma response due to CART-138 cell
      infusions.

      II. To determine if the CD137 transgene is superior to the TCR zeta only transgene as
      measured by the relative engraftment levels of CART-138 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells
      over time.

      III. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-138 cells in bone marrow.

      IV. For patients with stored or accessible myeloma cells, determine myeloma cell killing by
      CART-138 cells in vitro.

      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD138, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-138 (loss of engraftment).

      VI. Determine the relative subsets of CART-138 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.

      Patients receive anti-CD138-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling
      domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.
