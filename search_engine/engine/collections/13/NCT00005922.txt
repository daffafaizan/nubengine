      right probably reflects the paucity of theoretical positions within which to organize the
      existing data and design new research. This research addresses the clinical significance of
      behavior-immune system interactions.

      This study will capitalize on conditioned immunosuppressive responses to reduce the
      cumulative amount of corticosteroid medication used in the treatment of psoriasis. We will
      continue to treat patients with steroid, but will shift experimental patients from their
      current schedule of continuous reinforcement (active drug whenever medication is applied) to
      a partial schedule of reinforcement (active drug a percentage of the time and placebo alone
      at other times). To equate amount of medication, we will treat another group of patients with
      a reduced dose of steroid in a standard treatment regimen (continuous schedule of
      reinforcement).

      We hypothesize that, holding cumulative dose constant, a partial schedule of reinforcement
      will enable patients to be maintained on lower cumulative amounts of corticosteroid than
      patients treated under a continuous schedule of active drug. This is the first attempt to
      adopt conditioning principles and use schedules of reinforcement to design regimens of drug
      therapy. If proven effective, this new approach to pharmacotherapy and placebo effects is
      likely to stimulate new interdisciplinary research in neuropharmacology and behavioral
      pharmacology for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and a variety of other chronic
      diseases.
