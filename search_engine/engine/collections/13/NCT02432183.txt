    
      A group of elite athletes (from the elite sport school in Leuven (n=35) in cooperation with
      'Sportmedisch Advies Centrum' (SMAC) UZ Leuven) and the future team of the Flemish Swimming
      Federation (n=15) will be recruited at the start of their career (first level) as an elite
      athlete. A group of healthy subjects (n=20) will be recruited to serve as a control.

      The investigators will compare lung function parameters and airway inflammation at the first
      visit in the autumn of 2011 and the second and third visit (one and two years later,
      respectively).

      Lung function will be assessed by spirometry. Sputum will be induced with an aerosol of
      inhaled hypertonic saline in concentrations of 3%, 4% and 5% for 7 minutes generated by a De
      Vilbiss nebuliser (Ultra-Neb 2000 model 200HI) after pretreatment with 400 mg inhaled
      salbutamol. Sputum will be processed as previously described and the obtained cell
      suspensions will be used for differential cell counts and cytokine mRNA analysis. The
      supernatant will be used to measure cytokine and chemokine levels.

      EIA diagnosis (visit 1,2 and 3) will be assessed by a diagnostic test for asthma (positive
      reversibility test with salbutamol) and a positive EIB-test. Eucapnic voluntary
      hyperventilation test will be used as a test for EIB (gold standard of IOC-MC). Dynamic lung
      function parameters will be assessed before and immediately after, 5' after, 10' after and
      15' after eucapnic hyperventilation. Patients were asked to breath at 85% of the maximal
      ventilation (predefined as maximal voluntary volume) for 6 minutes through a mouthpiece
      connected to a reservoir. The reservoir is be filled with a gas mixture of 21% 02, 5% CO2 and
      74% N2. The test is considered positive when a drop in FEV1 of >10% occurred at one of the
      time points after eucapnic hyperventilation.
