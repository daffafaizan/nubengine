        -  Compare the time to treatment failure in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
           breast cancer treated with paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab.

        -  Compare the objective response rate, duration of response, overall survival, and time to
           progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease-free interval (no more than 24 months vs more than 24 months), number of
      metastatic sites (less than 3 vs 3 or more), treatment with prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes
      vs no), and estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative vs unknown). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 followed by
           bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in arm I. In both arms, courses repeat every 4
           weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and on day 1 of weeks 17 and 33.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 316-650 patients (158-325 per treatment arm) will be accrued
      for this study within 31 months.
