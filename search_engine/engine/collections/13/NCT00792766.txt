      in six thousand. Angiomyolipomas occur in eighty percent of persons with TS, and in up to 60%
      of persons with LAM. They are fatty tumors that often occur in kidney or liver as well as
      other parts of the body. They can grow and cause damage to surrounding kidney tissue and even
      renal failure. They may also leak blood causing potentially life-threatening hemorrhage.

      Laboratory studies have shown that RAD001 suppresses the chemical that cause tumors to grow
      in tuberous sclerosis and sporadic LAM. The use of RAD001 to treat angiomyolipomas in
      tuberous sclerosis or sporadic LAM is considered experimental.
