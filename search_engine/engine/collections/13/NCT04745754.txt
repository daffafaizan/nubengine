    
      A quasi-experimental non-randomized pre/post with control group trial of two models of cancer
      survivorship care in early-stage colorectal and breast cancer survivors cared for in a
      community-based, integrated health care setting. The trial will test the efficacy of an
      embedded primary care provider (PCP) model (experimental condition) in which PCPs are
      embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk survivors who will be
      transitioned at 6-12 months post-treatment for comprehensive survivorship care. We
      hypothesize that a) patients in the PCP model will have superior receipt of recommended care
      compared to usual care; b) patients in the PCP model will perceive significantly better care
      coordination, self-efficacy, and confidence in their PCP compared to usual care; and c) use
      of unplanned and non-recommended care will be less in the PCP model compared to usual care.
