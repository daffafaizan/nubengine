      partners and from mother to infant. Antiretroviral medication taken prior to exposure to
      HIV-1 can prevent viral transmission from a mother to her infant. Raltegravir (RAL), by
      blocking integration of viral cDNA into the host's genome, makes an excellent candidate for
      preventing HIV-1 infection. RAL is licensed for treatment with twice-daily dosing based on
      plasma trough concentrations; however, intracellular concentrations of RAL which are relevant
      to blocking infection of cells have not been previously studied. P-glycoprotein pumps, which
      are involved in regulating drug absorption and metabolism, can influence intracellular drug
      concentrations. P-glycoprotein concentrations appear to vary with menstrual cycle suggesting
      it may affect intracellular drug concentration of RAL in women.

      Women will be enrolled in the study and followed during the course of a menstrual cycle while
      taking a dose of 400mg PO twice daily. An initial screening visit will be performed prior to
      enrollment and participation in the study. Review of medical history as well as blood and
      urine collection will occur during the screening visit. Once enrolled, participants will have
      blood and genital tract samples collected once a week for four weeks to assess intracellular
      concentrations of RAL in the blood and genital tract tissue.
