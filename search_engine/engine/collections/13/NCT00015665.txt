      chemotherapy, transplantation, HIV infection has lead to an increase in the incidence of
      invasive fungal infections. Moreover, despite the availability of newer, less toxic
      preparations of Amphotericin B and azole antifungals such as fluconazole and itraconazole,
      invasive mycoses remain a therapeutic challenge.

      Voriconazole is a new triazole that has shown in phase II studies to be very active against
      Aspergillus sp. Its side effect profile has been very benign, comparable with those of other
      FDA approved triazoles. In vitro studies also show that voriconazole has a very broad
      spectrum ranging from opportunistic to endemic fungi. In addition, the availability of
      intravenous and oral formulations add to its potential advantages because the therapy of
      these infections usually require long courses on antifungals.

      In this study, voriconazole is used as a salvage therapy for those patients who are unable to
      tolerate or who have failed other antifungal therapies. Because of the abundance of
      immunocompromised patients at our center, we believe that having such a protocol ready for
      enrollment would mitigate delays in such crucial moments. We seek to enroll and treat 40
      patients over a 3 year period.
