      not a uniform diagnostic criteria for microcephaly. The World Health Organization (WHO)
      recommended a criteria of head circumference (HC) less than 2 standard deviations (SD) below
      the mean of the Intergrowth-21 standard, which was found not applicable to the newborns and
      infants in Guangzhou.In the GSCSM, the HC measures of newborns are conducted by trained
      midwives using a standard tool, and extensive information including adverse perinatal
      outcomes are collected. Longitudinal follow up of infants' neurodevelopment in cognitive,
      motor, emotional and other domains are also to be conducted. The GSCSM intends to find out
      the infants who are 'real microcephaly' and most at risk of short-term or long-term adverse
      outcomes in Guangzhou.
