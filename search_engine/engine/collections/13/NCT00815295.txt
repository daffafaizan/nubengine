    
      This is a non-randomized phase I B/II trial enrolling 43 patients with recurrent and/or
      metastatic SCCHN who are not candidates for surgical salvage or definitive radiation.
      Subjects will receive Cetuximab and sorafenib until disease progression. Cetuximab will be
      given at standard approved dose: 400 mg/m2 loading dose followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly.
      Sorafenib will be given 200 mg twice daily oral, continuous dosing to the 6 patients in
      cohort 1. If less than 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at the 200mg BID
      dose, then 6 patients will be accrued at the 400mg BID dose level and toxicities will again
      be examined. Sorafenib will be given 400 mg twice daily oral, continuous dosing to the
      patients in cohort 2. One cycle equals 28 days. Tumor assessment will be performed every 8
      weeks. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.

      Participating subjects will be asked to take part in an optional correlative study to provide
      previously archived diagnostic or therapeutic tumor samples obtained during the course of
      their routine medical care for their cancer of the head/neck. The optional tissue repository
      project is Duke University Health System (DUHS) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved
      (eIRB # 11138 / "Tissue Acquisition Protocol for Analysis of Effects of Novel
      Chemotherapeutic Compounds). Subjects will be asked to sign a separate consent form to
      participate in the tissue collection study.
