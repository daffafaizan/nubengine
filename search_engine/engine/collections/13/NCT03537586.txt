        1. Investigate platelet activity and inflammation in patients with and without coronary
           microvascular disease who are referred for coronary angiography for the evaluation of
           stable ischemic heart disease and are found to have non-obstructuve epicardial CAD

        2. To identify correlates of coronary microvascular dysfunction in non coronary
           microvascular beds that can be characterized in vivo.
