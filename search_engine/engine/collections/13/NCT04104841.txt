      and this comorbidity is associated with far greater impairment than either disorder alone,
      including higher rates of inpatient hospitalization and increased risk for suicidal ideation
      and behavior. Despite these adverse outcomes, existing evidence-based interventions for ADHD
      have not demonstrated effects in reducing depressive symptoms nor do established depression
      prevention programs work as well for adolescents with ADHD. Reward responsivity (RR) and
      emotion regulation (ER) are two key factors demonstrated to mediate the association between
      ADHD and depression and are thus key targets for prevention. In an effort to address the gap
      between access and utilization of mental health care, which is especially stark among
      adolescents with ADHD, we aim to develop and test a modified behavioral activation prevention
      program [Behaviorally Enhancing Adolescents' Mood in Schools (BEAM-S)] that incorporates
      modules to directly target these purported mechanisms. In line with the Deployment-Focused
      Model of Intervention Development and Testing, we will develop a program that can be easily
      implemented and sustainable in the high school setting as delivered by school mental health
      staff that reduces depression and improves overall functioning in adolescents with ADHD, by
      way of improving RR and ER. As a first step, we will conduct focus groups with community
      stakeholders (e.g., school mental health providers, school administration, adolescents,
      parents, teachers) to develop an acceptable and sustainable selected and indicated prevention
      program for school staff to utilize. We will then initially train school staff to deliver
      this prevention program via to pilot the intervention for implementation of the prevention
      program in a case series to evaluate preliminary feasibility. We will then conduct a stage 1
      RCT with a hybrid-type 1 implementation effectiveness design in three high schools where
      adolescents will be randomized to either the BEAM-S condition (n= 54) or treatment as usual
      (n = 54). Finally, qualitative and quantitative data from aims 1-3 will be used to prepare
      final procedures for a future large-scale effectiveness trial R01 (aim 4).
