    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the two most commonly employed
      methods of cerebral protection upon mitigating neurologic injury in participants planning to
      undergo elective aortic arch and hemiarch surgery. Participants will be recruited from
      patients undergoing ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement using hypothermic circulatory
      arrest at Emory University Hospital and Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital. Participants will be
      randomized to receive a cerebral protection strategy of either: deep hypothermic circulatory
      arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion (DHCA+RCP) or moderate hypothermic circulatory
      arrest and unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (MHCA+uSACP). Evidence of
      neurologic injury will be assessed with neurologic exams, neurocognitive tests, MRI imaging
      of the brain and measurement of plasma S-100 levels during post operative follow up. Follow
      up visits will be conducted at Days 1, 3, 7, and 180 post operation.
