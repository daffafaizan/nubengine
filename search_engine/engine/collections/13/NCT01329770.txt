    
      -  Objective: To evaluate the effect of the combination of the antioxidant Ascorbic acid
           and tocopherol, as therapy of the Fragile X Syndrome in young males.

        -  Design: Pilot clinical trial, Phase II , 6-month randomized, double-blind
           placebo-controlled one-way crossover clinical trial, with two treatment periods of 12
           weeks duration.

        -  Setting: IMABIS Foundation. Carlos Haya Hospital, Malaga.

        -  Subjects: Children aged 5-11 years (infants) and 12-18 years (adolescents) diagnosed
           with Fragile X syndrome.

        -  Intervention: 30 participants randomly assigned, to receive antioxidant vitamins C
           (ascorbic acid) and vitamin E (d-alpha-tocopherol) once a day or placebo for 12 weeks
           double-blind. In Study Period 2, all participants receive (open) active treatment.
           Outcome measures: improvement in plasma antioxidant levels, oxidative stress (indicated
           by glutathione status, thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) and carbonyl
           content of proteins) and HPA axis response. Behavioral problems will be studied using
           "Developmental behavior checklist" and "Teacher's and ParentÂ´s Questionnaire, C. Keith
           Conners", also learning improvement will be analyzed using "Wechsler Intelligence Scale
           for children" at 0, 3, 6 months during the trial and 3 months after completing the
           treatment.
