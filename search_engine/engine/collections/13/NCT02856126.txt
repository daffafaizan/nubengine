    
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely used palliative treatment for
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Our previous prospective study also revealed that
      TACE confers a survival benefit to patients with HCC and portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT).
      Recently, the results of our preliminary pilot study suggested that, compared with TACE,
      hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for patitens with
      BCLC stage C HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control
      study to find out it.
