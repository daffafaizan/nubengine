      recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous head and neck cancer. Apatinib is a novel vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved for
      the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or more lines of
      prior chemotherapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor is highly expressed in non-squamous
      head and neck cancer and its expression correlates with stage, tumour size, vascular
      invasion, recurrence and metastasis. In this study, the investigators try to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of apatinib in advanced non-squamous head and neck cancer and to validate
      the correlative biomarkers.
