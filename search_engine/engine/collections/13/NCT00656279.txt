      secondary to declining renal function. hPhos increases the risk of developing metastatic
      calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy and cardiovascular
      complications. Patients with hPhos are advised to restrict their dietary phosphorus intake to
      800-1000mg/d, as per National Kidney Foundations'Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative
      (KDOQI). Adherence to a phosphorus restricted diet is often challenging for CKD patients, as
      they may be required to follow various dietary restrictions, and there is significant
      quantities of hidden phosphorus in processed foods. This randomized controlled trial is
      designed to compare the effectiveness of more intensive phosphorus education (IPE) using the
      innovative Phosphorus Point System ToolÂ© versus standard phosphorus education (SPE) using the
      Choose/Avoid list on 1) serum phosphorus levels (primary outcome) 2) dietary adherence,
      dietary knowledge and satisfaction in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. We hypothesize that
      patients receiving IPE will have lower serum phosphorus than those receiving SPE. Fifty
      patients attending a pre-dialysis CKD clinic with serum phosphorus > 1.49 mmol/L will be
      randomly assigned to IPE or SPE and followed over 12 weeks. Serum phosphorus, dietary intakes
      using the 5-pass repeat 24-hour dietary recall method, dietary knowledge and satisfaction by
      validated questionnaires, will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The study's
      findings on the impact of more intensive innovative dietary phosphorus education in patients
      with pre-dialysis CKD will serve towards developing best practice of care and potentially
      reduce long-term complications.
