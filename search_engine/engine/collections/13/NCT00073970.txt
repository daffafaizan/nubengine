        -  Determine the effect of celecoxib on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients
           with prostate cancer in biochemical relapse after prior definitive radiotherapy or
           radical prostatectomy.

        -  Compare the PSA doubling times in patients treated with this drug vs historical
           controls.

        -  Compare the PSA doubling times in patients treated with this drug vs pretreatment PSA
           values.

        -  Determine the time to clinical recurrence in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Treatment continues for 5 years in the
      absence of disease progression. Patients may continue treatment beyond 5 years at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
