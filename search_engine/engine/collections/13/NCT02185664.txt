      insertion of central venous catheters. However, its usage is limited by various factors which
      include availability, space constraints and perceived lack of need according to surveys
      including cardiovascular anesthesiologists. We will conduct a prospective randomized
      controlled trial to compare the conventional landmark technique with the static ultrasound
      (US) technique that utilized the transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) ultrasound probe which
      is supplied along with the transesophageal echocardiography machines for internal jugular
      vein cannulation in adult cardiac surgical patients.

      After ethical committee approval and patient consent, adult patients scheduled for elective
      cardiac surgery will be randomized to undergo internal jugular vein cannulation by either of
      the two methods: standard landmark technique (group A: control group), static US technique
      using the TTE probe (group B: ultrasound group). The success rate, number of attempts, total
      cannulation time and complication rate in the two groups will be compared.
