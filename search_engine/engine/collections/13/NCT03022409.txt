      place at any time between Day 10 and Day 21 (depending on when it can be scheduled), but must
      occur with 24 hrs following three consecutive treatment days. During the treatment period,
      safety assessments must be completed at least weekly.

      Follow-up will be completed after surgical resection or biopsy has been completed and can be
      part of standard post-surgery follow-up. If this follow-up visit occurs prior to 30 days
      after the final dose, a further visit or telephone call must be conducted to assess that any
      toxicity has resolved and to check for late toxicity.
