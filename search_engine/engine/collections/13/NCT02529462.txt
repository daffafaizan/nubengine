    
      NEUROPHARMAGEN is a genetic test developed by AB-BIOTICS S.A. that enables the specific
      analysis of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms related to the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of different psychoactive drugs. The aim of the test is to provide the
      psychiatrist with information that can help him/her identify the most suitable medication for
      each patient.

      In the study group, the psychiatrist will have the results of the NEUROPHARMAGEN test as
      supporting information to help him/her select the best treatment for the patient. In the
      control patient group, the treatment will be selected and prescribed in accordance with
      routine clinical practice.

      This is a naturalistic, double-blind, randomized, multicentric clinicaltrial carried out in
      Spain at psychiatry departments of several public hospitals. The study aims to include a
      total of 520 patients with MDD, including patient with significant psychiatric comorbidities
      such as anxiety or substance abuse.

      The study will compare groups based on the rate of treatment responders, defined as a score
      of 2 or less (i.e. "Much better"/"Very much better") in the Patient Global Impression of
      Improvement scale (PGI-I). This scale will be collected by blind telephone interviewers, so
      as to have a double-blind assessment (patient and interviewer).
