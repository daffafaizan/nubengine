      IC-CO2(intraoperative colonoscopy (IC) using carbon dioxide (CO2)) in colon and rectal
      surgical practice, coincident with laparoscopic surgery, and assess whether it provides
      useful information that influences the type of surgical therapy intended. Investigators will
      further define the safety and extent of bowel distension when using IC-CO2. Furthermore, the
      investigators will evaluate the therapy and technique of using this combined approach to the
      treatment of colorectal polyps and other localized, benign lesions of the large intestine. In
      this study, the colonoscope is used both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, and is often
      used in order to avoid a major bowel resection, yet effectively treat localized lesions of
      the large intestine.

      The hypothesis of this study is that IC-CO2 will provide useful information which does affect
      surgical decision making at the time of operation, and that it is safe and does not result in
      any significant bowel distention during or immediately after the procedure. We additionally
      hypothesize that certain localized lesions of the intestines may be treated using a combined
      laparoscopic-IC-CO2 approach to effectively treat the underlying disease, minimize risks to
      the patient, and avoid a major bowel resection.
