      (determined with the Household Hunger Scale1) into one of three groups: 1) NAC alone , 2) NAC
      plus food assistance, or 3) NAC plus cash transfers. Food assistance will be a standard food
      ration consisting of maize flour, groundnuts, and beans. The cash transfer will be the
      equivalent value as the food ration (approximately $13 USD/month). Participants will receive
      the monthly food ration or cash transfer for up to six months if they continue to receive
      monthly HIV care (the standard of care). The investigators will compare the effect of NAC and
      food or cash assistance to the effect of NAC alone on ART adherence and retention in care at
      6, 12, and 24-36 months (Objective #1). The investigators will also compare the effectiveness
      of NAC plus food assistance and NAC plus cash transfers to determine if their effects are the
      same (Objective #2).
