    
      This is an exploratory phase IIA trial with unique elements of design and patient selection
      with an aim to:

        -  Identify responsive tumor types that were not predicted from preclinical and Phase I
           studies,

        -  Determine if tumors are more likely to stabilize than shrink, and

        -  Identify a dose with almost no toxicity.

        -  To determine whether response (or stabilization) can be observed on either a daily or
           weekly schedule, or both. Since the efficacy goal of the study is to look for any
           evidence of activity with perifosine, the daily and weekly arms will be combined when
           assessing response.

        -  Response to therapy will be based on either tumor regression (objective response,
           partial or complete) OR stabilization of disease.

      It is not anticipated that this study will provide "proof of principle" regarding the use of
      perifosine or serve as a pivotal trial for regulatory purposes. Information obtained from
      this study will be used to design additional trials that will be more definitive in nature.
