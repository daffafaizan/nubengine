      breathing/power of breathing, resistance and elastance), derived using esophageal pressure
      measurements, and their corresponding non-invasive estimated values (noninvasive work of
      breathing/power of breathing, resistance and elastance), computed using airway pressure and
      flow measurements only. Vent settings will be adjusted to test accuracy over a range of
      respiratory support conditions.
