      of gestation either by normal pregnancy or ICSI. For women in their 1st trimester of
      pregnancy, early ultrasound assessment will be done. Measurement of mean sac diameter (MSD)
      from 6 to 8 weeks ,crown-rump length (CRL) from 10 to 12 weeks. Combined tests will be done
      between 11weeks - 13 weeks+6 days (PAPP-A and free beta HCG). For women in their 2nd
      trimester of pregnancy, tests done will include the triple test (α-fetoprotein, free β HCG,
      and E3) will be done at 14 to 20 week . fetal ponderal index which is the inverse ratio of
      estimated foetal weight in grams to the third power of the femur length at weeks (20 to 24)..
      For women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy, routine ultrasound assessment of fetal growth
      will be done including measurement of fetal ponderal index.at 32,34 and 36 weeks of
