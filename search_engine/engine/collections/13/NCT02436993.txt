    
      OBJECTIVES The study component is to evaluate the treatment response and toxicity of the
      protocol.

      Objectives for treatment study component:

      1.1 To estimate 2-year progression-free survival in patients with breast cancer with tumor
      more than 1 cm and/or with clinically detected lymph node treated with neoadjuvant weekly
      Carboplatin and Paclitaxel combined with Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab in HER2-positive disease or
      with Bevacizumab in HER2-negative disease.

      1.2 To measure the microscopic complete pathological response (pCR) rates defined as ypT0 or
      ypTis tumors in patients treated with this regimen in the neoadjuvant setting.

      1.3 To assess complete clinical response (cCR) rates after treatment by physical exam and
      imaging tests (ultrasonography, mammography, or magnetic resonance imaging) clinical
      objective response rate (by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)) 1.4 To
      determine the toxicity of this regimen. 1.5 To determine treatment adherence and delivered
      dose intensity of this regimen.

      1.6 To assess the correlation between pCR and cCR. 1.7 To determine the rate of breast
      conservation following neoadjuvant therapy. 1.8 Determine treatment efficacy according to
      subgroups defined according to stage and receptor status.
