      The specific aims of this study are to integrate a new electronic medication reconciliation
      (MR) system with an electronic prescribing system, conduct a randomized controlled trial of
      MR, and determine whether electronic facilitation of MR alters MR and the incidence of
      medication errors in ambulatory care. On a patient's hospital admission, a new Web-based MR
      module will receive an automatically compiled outpatient medication list. Following
      discussion with the patient, medical personnel will update the list, which will then be
      delivered to the computer-based provider order entry system and become actionable for
      prescribing. Main outcomes include adverse drug events and erroneous discrepancies between
      the pre-admission medication list and the medication list upon the patient's return to
      ambulatory care. We hypothesize that electronic facilitation of inpatient MR will improve
      completion of MR and will decrease the incidence of drug-related medical errors.
