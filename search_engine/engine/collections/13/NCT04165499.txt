      increased production of uric acid, decreased excretion of uric acid, or both. This can cause
      gout and nephrolithiasis, and it has also been related to metabolic syndrome, diabetes
      mellitus, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.

      Some plant extracts have diuretic activity that could contribute to improve uric acid
      excretion. This effect would lead to a decrease in uric acid plasma levels and, secondarily,
      to an action on its metabolic pathway of endogenous biogeneration.

      On the other hand, uric acid has a double reabsorption-elimination step in the renal tubules
      and the flavonoids of both extracts impede the processes of renal resorption promoting
      urinary elimination, in addition to increase the pH of the urine (higher than pH 5.8), which
      favors the non-precipitation or formation of urate stones.

      Finally, the routine (present in the used extracts) inhibit the uric acid formation pathway
      from purines, which would act synergistically.

      In this project, the effect of the intake of a combination plant extracts on uricemia levels
      will be studied.
