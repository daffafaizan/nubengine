      first-line therapy for or treatment of insulinomas. However, the surgical resection of
      pancreatic neoplasm is conditional for specific patients and may be associated with
      substantial life-threatening complications. Several studies declared that endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS)-guided lavage may offer an alternative to surgical resection of insulinomas.
      Nevertheless, their sample sizes were small and conclusions were built based on short-term
      outcomes. In addition, the amount of ethanol administrated for different types of insulinomas
      were inconsistent among those studies.

      The present study aims to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of EUS-guided ethanol
      ablation therapy of insulinomas. We will use cytopathology and immunohistochemistry in
      combination with EUS-FNA for diagnosis of insulinoma. After EUS-guided ethanol ablation
      therapy, the safety and efficacy will be assessed at the baseline and different time points
      during follow-up by physicians blinded to the treatment or control status.
