      collected in 2,700 patients, treated by specialized as well as non-specialized physicians in
      hospitals and office based centres in 11 European countries. Patients from different
      countries and care settings (primary care and secondary care, different specialties) to
      ensure representativeness and extended assessment is planned for collection of VTE
      recurrences for up to 18 months after last data collection point for patients who entered the
      study early. The enrollment period of patients will be 2 years per country. Documentation of
      baseline and follow up information at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months (only when available) will
      be collected. In addition, recurrence of symptomatic VTE and death will be captured
      retrospectively at time point of Last Patient Out per country.

      Patients who discontinue permanently edoxaban during the observational period will be
      followed up according to the same scheme. The results gained in ETNA-VTE-Europe will be
      compared to data from the PREFER in VTE disease registry. The PREFER registry, was selected
      as it is similar in bleeding definition, comparable in data collection point schedules, with
      a robust number of patients (~3,500 patients) enrolled.
