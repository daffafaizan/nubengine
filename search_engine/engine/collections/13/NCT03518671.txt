      in patients with surgically-treated HNC. Reliable, validated patient-reported outcome (PRO)
      measures of BID will be collected before, 1 month and 3 months after the CBT intervention to
      provide preliminary data on the effectiveness of CBT for BID in patients with
      surgically-treated HNC, addressing this critical knowledge gap. It is expected that
      time-limited CBT implemented in the post-treatment period will decrease BID and improve QOL
      in affected patients.
