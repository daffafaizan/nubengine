      mitochondrial beta-oxidation to phenylacetate. Preclinical studies have shown that continuous
      exposure to phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate can induce tumor cytostasis and differentiation
      in a wide variety of cell lines including malignant gliomas and neuroblastomas. However,
      phenylbutyrate has been shown to be a more potent differentiating agent than phenylacetate in
      a variety of tumor cell lines. In addition, phenylbutyrate appears to have molecular
      activities that are distinct from phenylacetate. The objective of this trial is to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose and the toxicities of phenylbutyrate administered as a continuous
      intravenous infusion for 28 days. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of phenylbutyrate and its
      metabolite, phenylacetate, will be studied using both model-dependent and model-independent
      parameters.
