      Those individuals with high level spinal cord injury, cervical region, may experience reduced
      diaphragm function. This reduction in function may affect daytime activities as well as sleep
      quality. Sleep quality in people with spinal cord injury is considered to be worse than sleep
      quality in the general population. The use of respiratory resistance training devices has
      been shown to increase muscle strength in people with spinal cord injury. There have been not
      studies to document potential improvements in sleep quality among individuals with spinal
      cord injury following respiratory resistance training.
