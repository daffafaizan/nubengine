      dose-response evaluation of Cellavita-HD intravenous administration in Huntington's disease
      patients (maximum 35 subjects). Because it is a extension study, with an open scenario, the
      subjects will receive the maximum dose tested in the last clinical trial (ADORE-DH),
      corresponding to 6 x 10^6 cells/weight range for each treatment cycle planned. Throughout of
      24 months, the subjects will receive total dose planned divided into three administrations
      per cycle (2 x 10^6 cells/weight range), that each will occur every 30 days. The maintaining
      the effectiveness of intravenous administration of Cellavita-HD product over time on clinical
      progression Huntington's disease will be verified by comparing the UHDRS total score at the
      end of the 24th study month against baseline score. Secondary evidences of efficacy will be
      evaluated by through the data of functional state, total functional capacity, functional
      independence, psychiatric symptoms and cognition from UHDRS scale. Additionally, related data
      to clinical worsening, change of Body Mass Index (BMI), risk of suicide attempt and
      neurological image improvement will be evaluated. Safety evaluation will included the
      incidence and classification of the adverse events experienced by the subjects during the
      study.
