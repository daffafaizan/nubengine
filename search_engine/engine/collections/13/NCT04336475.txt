      2-month follow-up period, carried out in rheumatology outpatient clinic, between March 2017 -
      January 2019. Systemic sclerosis patients with an oral aperture of <40mm were included in the
      study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. Randomization was done as the sealed
      envelope method. After the informed consent was taken, the opaque envelope that the patient
      have chosen was opened and patients were offered the allocated treatment regimen. Group 1 was
      given exercise regimen and oral hygiene care advices for the first one month; followed by no
      exercise but oral hygiene care advices for the next four weeks. Group 2, as the control
      group, received oral hygiene care advices for the first one month, followed by the exercise
      regimen twice a day along with oral hygiene care advices for the next four weeks. Oral care
      advices were given to every participant by a dentist involved in the study at their first
      visit. With this protocol, we aimed (a) to investigate whether there is a benefit of the
      exercise program on microstomia; (b) to observe the carryover effect of exercise therapy on
      microstomia after discontinuing the treatment over a period of time; (c) to estimate the
      intervention strategy by comparing the same medical approach with different sequences. The
      exercise program was demonstrated to patients by a clinician at the first visit and given to
      all patients printed as a manual to be done every day for one month duration of the exercise
      program. Additionally, a diary was given to patients to mark when they have completed the
      exercise and to note in the case of pain on daily basis. The exercise regimen was developed
      on the basis of previous studies and clinical knowledge.
