      effective in improving post-intervention cognitive complaints and neuropsychological (NP)
      test performance. Because practice effects may influence NP performance, it is important to
      compare the intervention participants to women who are not exposed to the intervention. Thus,
      this randomized controlled trial will compare the active intervention to a control group of
      patients who will receive the intervention at a delayed time point. The primary outcomes are
      improvements in cognitive complaints and NP test performance 2 months after completion of the
      intervention program. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) measurements will be used as a secondary
      exploratory endpoint to see if this may be an effective biomarker of cognitive performance.
