      disorders neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Normal diet consists of all food consistencies
      including liquid, pudding and solid foods, and CD causes inability to intake solid food. This
      condition can affect development, nutritional behavior and child-parent interaction in
      children. Thus, it is important to determine CD in an early period with appropriate
      assessment methods and plan appropriate therapies in NMD. We aimed to evaluate chewing
      function (CF) in children with NMD, and investigate reliability of the Karaduman Chewing
      Performance Scale (KCPS).
