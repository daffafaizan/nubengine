      subject experiences a DLT, at which time a cohort will be expanded to up to 6 subjects.
      Provided there is only one DLT in that cohort, the dose will be escalated. However, if there
      are 2 DLTs in that cohort of up to 6 subjects, previous dose level will be expanded to total
      of 9 subjects.

      If none of the dose levels are acceptable at study completion (i.e., >33% of subjects
      experiencing a DLT), an OD will not be identified, and the drug does not warrant further
      investigation.
