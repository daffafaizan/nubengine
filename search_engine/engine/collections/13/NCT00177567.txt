           funded Intervention Research Center for Late Life Mood Disorders

        -  to implement standardized care pathways compatible with STEP-BD treatment algorithms for
           mood stabilizing pharmacotherapy.

        -  to document short- and long-term treatment response with respect to affective symptoms,
           sleep, general life functioning, cognition, treatment-emergent side effects

        -  to establish the clinical infrastructure necessary for randomized controlled clinical
