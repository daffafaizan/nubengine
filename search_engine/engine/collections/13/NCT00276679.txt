      Primary

        -  Determine the anti-tumor activity of temozolomide in young patients with high-risk
           relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine tolerability of this drug in these patients

        -  Determine the tumor expression of the cellular repair mechanisms which repair DNA damage
           (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase [MGMT] and mismatch repair [MMR] systems) in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate MGMT and MMR expression with outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine if MGMT and MMR expression/activity changes in the tumor during initial
           presentation, treatment, and relapse/progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the activity of MGMT in bone marrow taken at relapse, in terms of
           hematological toxicity, in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      2 courses. Patients achieving stable or responding disease after completion of the 2 courses
      may receive up to 10 additional courses of treatment in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
