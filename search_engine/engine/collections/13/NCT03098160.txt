      via myeloid-derived suppressor, myofibroblast and regulatory T cells. Disruption of these
      hypoxic regions within the tumor microenvironment by the hypoxia-directed cytotoxic agent
      evofosfamide may enhance the ability of the CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab to reject
      otherwise resistant solid tumors. Additionally, induction of immunogenic cell death of tumor
      cells by evofosfamide may enhance dendritic cell presentation of tumor antigens to
      lymphocytes in draining lymph nodes, leading to clonal expansion of tumor-specific T cells,
      especially in combination with ipilimumab.
