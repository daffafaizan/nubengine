    
      The aim of the study is to characterize the profile of circulating monocytes as predictive
      biomarker of osteoclastogenesis in CF related bone disease.

      Investigators will evaluate the presence and regulation of CD115 (MCSF receptor) and CD265
      (RANK) membrane receptors of circulating monocytes of cystic fibrosis patients.

      They will also analyze the impact of the F508del CFTR mutation on the differentiation of
      monocytes into osteoclasts. We will 1) Quantify the training and functional activity of
      osteoclasts and, 2) Test in vitro the effects of correctors and potentiators of CFTR on the
      resorption activity of differentiated osteoclasts.

      The study will be explained to patients and they only will have one blood test.
