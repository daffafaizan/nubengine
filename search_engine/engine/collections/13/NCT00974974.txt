    
      A randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel-group 13-week comparison of IPX066
      versus regular carbidopa-levodopa (CD-LD). Prior to randomization, subjects on a stable
      regular LD regimen will enter a 3-week dose-adjustment period for IR CD-LD, followed by a
      6-week dose-conversion period to IPX066.
