      implant and follow-up protocol. Twenty-one adolescents and young adults (10-21 years of age)
      with Down Syndrome with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea after adenotonsillectomy
      will be identified through a Multi-Disciplinary clinic for patients with Trisomy 21 at each
      of our participating sites Patients and their parents will be screened by a senior
      pulmonologist and pediatrician for medical clearance and willingness to participate. Subjects
      will then undergo preoperative evaluation with an in-lab polysomnogram (PSG), evaluation by a
      pediatric otolaryngology surgeon, and drug induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) to ensure all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will then be
      implanted with the Inspire® Upper Airway Simulation System, Model 3024 IPG, and any
      subsequent iteration thereof that are approved under P130008 for the treatment of obstructive
      sleep apnea, a hypoglossal nerve stimulator, after informed consent. Surgery will be
      performed by senior pediatric otolaryngologists who have completed a training program for the
      Inspire® system. Subjects will then adhere to a follow-up schedule. The device will be
      activated and settings titrated during an in-lab sleep study 1 month postoperatively. Quality
      of life surveys and device interrogation will be conducted at timed intervals. Subjects will
      then undergo in-lab polysomnography at 2 months, 6 months, and 12-months, then on an annual
      basis, and the device titrated as needed. All personnel adjusting device parameters will be
      trained in programming the Inspire® system. For this pilot study, we will evaluate safety and
      efficacy over the first year after device implantation.
