    
      When tumor tissue known or presumed to be a primary or secondary bone cancer or solid tumor
      with known elevated intra-tumoral pressure such as retinoblastoma is being removed or has
      been removed for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons a small sample of it will be obtained for
      this study. The tumor samples will be used to study in vitro, determinants of chemotherapy
      resistance and oncogenesis. These determinants will be correlated with histologic response to
      preoperative chemotherapy and clinical outcome (event free survival). In addition, blood
      samples (20ml) may be obtained before or after the procedure.
