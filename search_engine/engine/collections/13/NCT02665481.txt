      meditation techniques. Mindfulness meditation practices appear to produce neurocircuitry
      changes that are the reverse of those seen in age-related cognitive decline. It is widely
      available, acceptable to older people, and carries minimal risk of side effects or adverse
      events. Exercise - specifically, intense, multi-component exercise - also appears to affect
      brain structure and function and improve cognitive performance.

      The investigators will randomize 580 non-demented healthy adults aged 65 to 84 to one of four
      conditions: MBSR alone, exercise alone, MBSR + exercise, or a health education discussion
      group control condition.

      The study will consist of a 6-month acute intervention phase with weekly visits followed by a
      12-month maintenance phase with weekly or monthly visits and other prompts to maintain
      intervention behaviors.

      Assessments include cognitive tests, biomarkers, neuroimaging assessments, functional
      assessments to examine real-world benefits of the interventions, and other behavioral
      assessments to characterize participants and pave the way for further exploratory analyses.
