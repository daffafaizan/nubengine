      I. The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the ability of fluorescent imaging
      and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in a clinical setting to distinguish benign from malignant
      tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To qualitatively determine the possible benefit of PAI and fluorescent imaging over
      traditional white light imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fluorescence imaging and PAI during robot assisted laparoscopic surgery.
