    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess changes in total lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to 12
           months in postmenopausal women treated with zoledronate for osteopenia or osteoporosis
           and letrozole for hormone receptor-positive, stage I-IIIA primary breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine changes in total lumbar spine BMD from baseline to 2, 3, 4, and 5 years in
           these patients.

        -  Determine changes in femoral neck BMD from baseline to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years in these
           patients.

        -  Determine time to disease progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy: Patients receive oral letrozole daily for up to 5
           years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Osteoporosis management: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 1.
           Patients also receive oral elemental calcium twice daily and oral vitamin D daily for 6
           months. Treatment repeats every 6 months for up to 5 years in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo total lumbar spine and hip (femoral neck) bone density testing by dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and annually for 5 years.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
