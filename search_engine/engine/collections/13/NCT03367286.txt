    
      This is a prospective, non-blind, single-center clinical trial to evaluate whether baseline
      computed tomography perfusion (CTP) profiles have a comparable ability to magnetic resonance
      perfusion (MRP) in identifying acute ischemia stroke (AIS) patients who have a robust
      clinical response after early reperfusion.

      The study will enroll 1000 patients, and patients will be divided into 2 groups according to
      the imaging available situation (to see which can provide immediately): CTP scan group and
      MRP scan group.

      Core: CT: cerebral blood flow <30% of that in normal tissue / MR: ADC < 600 ×D10-6 mm2 / s.

      Hypoperfusion: CT / MR: time to maximum >6.

      For patients accepting CTP or MRP over 4.5 hours after stroke onset, only patients who meet
      imaging criteria (infarct core volume < 70mL, perfusion lesion volume / infarct core volume
      >1.2, and absolute mismatch >10 mL) at baseline will receive recombinant tissue plasminogen
      activator (rt-PA) intravenous thrombolysis. CTP or MRP will be performed at 24 hours after
      thrombolytic therapy. Modified Rankin score (mRS) will be measured at 3 months after stroke
      onset.

      Study Endpoints: Primary endpoint: mRS 0-2 at 3 months. Secondary endpoints: (1) symptomatic
      intracranial haemorrhage, (2) reperfusion, (3) recanalization, and (4) infarct growth at 24
      hours.

      Criteria:

      Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Provision of informed consent;

        2. Male and female adults aged 18-80 years old;

        3. For patients accepting CTP or MRP over 4.5 hours after stroke onset, imaging criteria:
           infarct core volume <70mL, perfusion leison volume / infarct core volume >1.2, and
           absolute mismatch >10 mL.

      Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Standard contraindications to rt-PA;

        2. Contraindication to imaging with contrast agents;

        3. Pre-stroke mRS score of ≥2 (indicating previous disability);

        4. Participation in any investigational study in the previous 30 days;

        5. Any terminal illness such that patient would not be expected to survive more than
           one-year.
