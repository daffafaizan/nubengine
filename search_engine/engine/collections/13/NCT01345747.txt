      For standard procedure, the endotracheal tube is used to ventilate the anesthetized patients
      who undergo gynecological laparoscopic surgery that increase intrabdominal pressure. Now
      there is a new supraglottic airway device, laryngeal tube suction (LTs) can be use instead of
      ETT.

      Objective This study the investigators compare peak airway pressure (PAP), expire tidal
      volume (TV), end tidal CO2 (ETCO2), SpO2, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR)
      after the insertion of laryngeal tube suction or endotracheal tube in patients undergoing
      elective gynecological laparoscopic surgery.

      Material and methods Prospective single blinded randomized control trial, the patients were
      divided into two groups, LTs group and ETT group n = 60 for each group. All patients were
      induced anesthesia with fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg then
      maintained anesthesia with air : oxygen 30%. Respirator setting are tidal volume 10 ml/kg,
      I/E 1:2 adjust RR base on ETCO2 keep ETCO2 35-40 mmHg.

      Results No statistical difference in demographic data between groups. PAP and ETCO2 in the
      LTs group were significant higher than ETT group in the first 5 and 10 minutes but no
      statistically significant after 10 minutes until the end of operation. No statistically
      significant in TV and SpO2 between groups. In ETT group MAP and HR after insertion are
      significant higher than LTs group, no statistically significant about postoperative
      complication such as sorethroat, hoarseness and nausea vomiting.

      Conclusion LTs can be used in gynecological laparoscopic surgery like ETT.
