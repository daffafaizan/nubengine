      in the world. Recent data from the investigators and others highlight that impairments in
      reward and loss learning are central to depression, have distinct neural substrates, and
      improve with successful treatment. Together, these findings suggest an urgent need to
      delineate the relationships among neural and behavioral learning impairments and depression.
      Equally important, these insights suggest new targets for treatment such that manipulating
      the neural and behavioral substrates of learning may facilitate symptom change in depression.

      To address these issues, the investigators use functional neuroimaging and a computational
      psychiatry framework to i) systematically characterize the neural and behavioral substrates
      that attend reward- and loss- learning in depression and ii) assess the degree to which
      learning in depression responds to two behavioral methods that target learning in different
      ways. The investigators test the broad hypotheses that i) that depression may be
      characterized by distinct neural and behavioral disruptions of learning, and ii) these
      disruptions and associated symptoms may be ameliorated through different methods of guiding
      learning. Recent advances in computational psychiatry provide a mechanism-based framework
      within which to understand the nature and trajectory of potential learning impairments in
      depression and suggest new ways that disrupted learning and associated symptoms may be
      improved in depression
