      the harms of routine screening for dementia among older adults in primary care when the
      screening program is coupled with primary care practices prepared to provide care for those
      who screen positive.

      The specific aim of the study is to conduct a pragmatic randomized clinical trial assessing
      the harms and benefits of screening for dementia, compared to no screening for dementia,
      among 4,000 typical, older adults, cared for in typical, primary care practices, prepared to
      deliver best practices dementia care.

      Primary Specific Aim 1:

      Test the impact of dementia screening on health-related quality of life of the patient at 12
      months.

      Primary Specific Aim 2:

      Test the impact of dementia screening on the mood and anxiety symptoms of patient at 1 month
      (i.e., primary potential harms).

      Secondary Aims: Estimate the cost effectiveness of dementia screening.
