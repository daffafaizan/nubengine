      regimen were performed on a 28-day/21-day cycle respectively. Subjects who met the entry
      criteria were treated in a 2:1 group according to a randomized list: the treatment group was
      treated with nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin + endostatin regimen, and the control group was
      treated with paclitaxel + carboplatin. In this trial, the efficacy is evaluated every 8 weeks
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity,or until the investigator deemed that the
      patient's condition was unacceptable for further treatment. The follow-up period was 24
      months after the end of treatment (follow-up patient survival information and new anti-tumor
      treatment). The planning enrolled sample size for nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin + endostatin
      group and paclitaxel-carboplatin group were 90 patients and 45 patients, respectively.
