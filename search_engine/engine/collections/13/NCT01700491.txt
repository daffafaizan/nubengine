      efficacy but superior in maintenance of blood pressure. This is a double blind, randomized
      control trial comparing paravertebral catheters to epidural catheters for the management of
      post thoracotomy analgesia. Both groups will undergo placement of a pre-induction epidural
      catheter as well as a surgically placed paravertebral catheter. Patients will also receive
      PCA morphine. The primary outcome will be daily morphine use measured in milligrams. The
      co-primary outcome will be time spent with a systolic blood pressure below 90mmHg. Outcomes
      will be measured during the first five postoperative days.
