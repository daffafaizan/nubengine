      60% of postmenopausal women experience hot flashes, and 10-20% of all postmenopausal women
      find them nearly intolerable. Despite the prevalence of hot flashes, their pathophysiology is
      not well understood. Treatment options include non-pharmacological approaches, hormonal
      interventions, and non-hormonal pharmacological agents. The most effective treatment for hot
      flashes is estrogen. The most promising non-hormonal treatments for hot flashes are selective
      serotonin or noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRI/SNRI). Although estrogen withdrawal is
      implicated in the initiation of hot flashes, and serotonin's role is well established in
      thermoregulation, the relationship between estrogen and serotonin is not known. Preclinical
      studies suggest that both estrogen and SSRI down regulate the serotonin transporter. Clinical
      studies that further delineate the relationship between effective treatments for hot flashes
      and the serotonin transporter may shed a new light into the pathophysiology of these symptoms
      and more importantly, into design of new-targeted treatments.
