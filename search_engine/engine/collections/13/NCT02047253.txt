      with androgen inhibitors modestly extends overall survival. Carfilzomib is anticipated to
      enhance progression-free survival (PFS) as well as reduce pain and toxicities.

      Proteasome inhibitors are promising agents used in the therapy of prostate cancer.
      Carfilzomib is a more potent and irreversible proteasome inhibitor than the frequently used
      proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib. In Phase I trials Carfilzomib demonstrated substantial
      antitumor activity while exhibiting tolerable side effects.

      Carfilzomib has been approved by the FDA for patients with multiple myeloma. The drug,
      however, is not approved for the use with CRPC patients. This trial will evaluate the
      tolerance and effectiveness of Carfilzomib in men with metastatic progressive CRPC following
      chemotherapy and androgen inhibitors.
