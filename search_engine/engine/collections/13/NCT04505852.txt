      studies patients report only approximately half of their seizures, and even less during
      sleep.

      Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the cause of premature death of up to 17% of
      all patients with epilepsy and as many as 50% with chronic refractory epilepsy (with rates as
      high as 1% per year). Its etiology is probably due to peri-ictal respiratory, cardiac, or
      autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

      Wristband sensors help caregivers assist patients during seizures and may reduce risks for
      complications such as injuries and SUDEP.

      Accurate seizure detection may improve the quality of life (QoL) of subjects and caregivers
      by decreasing burden of seizure monitoring and may facilitate diagnostic monitoring in the
      home setting. Possible risks are occurrence of alarm fatigue and invasion of privacy.

      The wristband Embrace has an overall sensitivity of 89.1% and an overall specificity of
      93.1%. The investigators hypothesize that the participants will be satisfied with
      artificial-intelligence wristband Embrace.

      Methods:

      When the smart wristband detects the seizure, the mobile phone sends a text message to the
      companion and the nurse, the latter will see or get in touch with the companion and keep a
      record.

      In-patients receiving video-electroencephalography (VEEG) exam use Embrace during the VEEG
      recording which usually takes 3-5 days.

      Out-patients use Embrace for 8 weeks. The investigators will enroll 30-50 patients, half
      in-patients and half out-patients.

      The benefits are evaluated in terms of satisfaction. .
