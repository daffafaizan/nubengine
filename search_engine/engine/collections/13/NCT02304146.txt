      (UGFS) and surgical stripping, outcomes with regard to clinical, and ultrasound recurrence,
      progression of venous disease, predictive value of the presence of central / deep venous
      obstruction for recurrence of varicose veins and the long term cost analysis.

      Recurrence of varicose veins was defined as the presence of one or more venous symptoms such
      as pain, cramps, restless legs and a tired/heavy feeling in the treated leg, in combination
      with the presence of reflux longer than 0Â·5 s.

      The initial definition of recurrent reflux, which is defined as reflux for more than 2 cm in
      length in the treated vein segment (proximal great saphenous vein (GSV) ) as measured by
      colour flow duplex ultrasound (DUS). DUS findings of the treated proximal GSV were
      categorized as: 1, absence of reflux; 2, reflux; 3, occlusion; 4, partial occlusion with
      reflux; 5, absence of vein, is being used. Patients in categories 2 and 4 are considered to
      have reflux.
