      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of binimetinib plus imatinib in patients with
      advanced KIT-mutant melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of binimetinib plus imatinib in patients with
      advanced KIT-mutant melanoma.

      II. To estimate efficacy and survival parameters in patients with advanced KIT-mutant
      melanoma treated with binimetinib plus imatinib.

      III. To estimate efficacy in patients with advanced KIT-mutant melanoma treated with
      binimetinib plus imatinib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate association between changes in drug phosphorylated end products (p-KIT,
      p-MEK, p-ERK) and clinical response.

      II. To investigate association between clinical response and baseline Neurofibromatosis 1
      (NF1) and SPRED1 status.

      III. To investigate pathologic correlates of acquired resistance. IV. To investigate whether
      NF1 and SPRED1 loss contribute to acquired resistance.

      V. To generate patient-derived xenograft models. VI. To determine the relationship between
      clinical outcomes and clinicopathologic features including KIT exon mutated, melanoma
      subtype, melanoma primary site, race/ethnicity, prior treatment history including immune
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-experienced versus (vs) - naive.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and imatinib PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30 and 100, and then
      every 3 months.
