      take a first step toward clarifying how the benefit of oral carnitine supplementation depends
      on basal mitochondrial fatty acid processing (MFAP) and MFAP modification, with a specific
      focus on the liver. Approximately 24 healthy young individuals will be enrolled, with 20
      expected to complete. Before and after 14 days of oral carnitine supplementation or placebo,
      MFAP will be measured using measures of acetyl-carnitine concentration (from long-TE proton
      MRS) and de novo lipogenesis (DNL, from analysis of blood metabolites following 13C-labeled
      acetate infusion and high-fructose drink challenge). The MFAP measures will be collected
      before and after loading participants with a high-fructose drink. Fructose is solely
      metabolized by the liver.
