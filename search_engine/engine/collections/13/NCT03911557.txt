    
      This study is phase II basket trial to evaluate the benefit of immunotherapy (Durvalumab and
      Tremelimumab combination) in treatment of relapse/refractory solid tumor patients whose
      tumors express a high tumor mutational burden (TMB high >20 mutations/MB) or moderate tumor
      mutational burden (10-20 mutations/MB) as based on next generation sequencing (NGS). The
      primary endpoint of the study is the TTP (time-to-progression) ratio or growth modulation
      index (GMI) which is defined for individual patients as the ratio of their TTP on the current
      therapy to their TTP on the most recent previous therapy.
