      The purpose of this study is to create an extensively annotated bio-repository platform for
      hypothesis-driven research that will lead to advancements in the diagnosis, treatment and
      prevention of diseases common to the population of Indiana. The second phase of this research
      platform will be created by collecting blood samples from two groups of individuals in the
      Central Indiana community, one with documented evidence of Diabetes Mellitus Type II(T2D),
      and a second group of age, gender and ethnicity matched individuals without clinical evidence
      of Diabetes. Each individual's blood sample will be linked to their clinical, demographic and
      epidemiological information, gathered both retrospectively and prospectively.

      Recruitment:

      This study will include 500 individuals with T2D (the T2D Group) and 500 individuals who are
      age, gender, and ethnicity matched to the T2D Group, but without presentation of clinical
      evidence of T2D (the Control Group). To reflect the growing representation of Hispanics in
      Central Indiana, Hispanics will be overly recruited in both groups so that the study
      population accurately reflects the general population of Central Indiana.

      Follow-up:

      As this is a prospective, longitudinal study, follow-up of study subjects is intended to
      include two follow up visit and continue indefinitely, unless, of course, at any time,
      consent for further follow-up is withdrawn by the subject. Follow-up will include visits at 2
      and 5 years post initial contact and continuing access to the subject's medical record to
      pursue data concerning changes in the subject's health. Subjects may be contacted by
      telephone, mail or email every twelve months to ask if they wish to continue participation in
      the study. The 2 and 5 year follow up visits mirror the initial visit.

      The collected dataset (made up of the collected blood samples linked to clinical and
      epidemiological information collected retrospectively and prospectively), will be used in
      medical research to find genes, or gene products such as RNA or proteins that will help in
      understanding the causes of disease and will guide the development of new treatments
