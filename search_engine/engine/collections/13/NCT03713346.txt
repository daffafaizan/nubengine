      acute diarrhea, or fecal urgency when they ingest excessive amounts of lactose. The intensity
      of these conditions can be mild or severe and likely depends on numerous variables including
      dose, transit time, intestinal residual lactase activity and microbiome potential to ferment
      lactose. Jersey cattle produce milk containing high levels of the A2 β-casein protein . There
      are claims that high A2 β-casein milk is more easily digested by people who are lactose
      maldigesters . We propose to conduct a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial to
      determine if high A2 β-casein milk from Jersey cattle is actually better digested and
      tolerated by lactose maldigesters.

      This proposed protocol comparing the dairy intolerance symptoms from milks containing
      predominantly the A1 variant versus A2 variant will establish if high A2 milk is better
      digested and/or tolerated than high A1 milk.

      Participants will be asked to consume four different commercially available milks in random
      order. The samples will be fed for breakfast separated by at least 10 days, after overnight
      fasts. The commercial milk treatments will include; high A1 β-casein milk (commercial milk),
      high A2 β-casein milk, Jersey cattle milk (which contains a mixture of A1 and A2 β-casein),
      and a lactose free milk control. Milk will be 2% fat content to control for transit. Each
      subject will be fed milk containing 0.5g lactose per kg body weight. There will be two arms
      in this study: dairy intolerant who are lactose maldigesters, and dairy intolerant who are
      lactose digesters.
