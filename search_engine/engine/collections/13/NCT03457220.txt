      2016, a time period before the approval of AZD9291, to supply the unlicensed AZD9291 for the
      NSCLC patients who received at least one prior EGFR TKI therapy. At the end of September
      2016, more than 450 patients have been under AZD9291 treatment through the EAP. This
      observational study aims to evaluate the clinical benefit of AZD9291 treatment for these
      patients who were in the EAP
