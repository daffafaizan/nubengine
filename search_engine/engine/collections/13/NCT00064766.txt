      bleeding (BTB) and spotting that causes impaired lifestyle and results in decreased
      compliance with this contraceptive method. There is a need for an effective, low-cost, easily
      adapted treatment to reduce the bleeding and spotting in progestin-only contraceptives. The
      molecular environment of the endometrium of women with BTB and spotting contains abnormally
      high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) and abnormally high
      levels of proteases (matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs] and neutrophil elastase), which prevent
      normal tissue repair. Doxycycline (DOX) is an inexpensive, FDA approved antibiotic that
      inhibits MMPs and reduces nitric oxide synthesis. This study will evaluate DOX treatment of
      progestin-only contraceptive induced BTB and spotting, characterize the endometrial molecular
      biologic changes that occur in DOX treated patients, and determine the effect of Norplant on
      sexual functioning and testosterone levels.

      All participants in this study will receive Norplant. Participants will then be randomized to
      receive either DOX (20 mg twice a day) or placebo for 6 months. Participants will have 9
      study visits during the 24 weeks of the study. Study visits will include a medical history,
      physical exam, and blood and urine tests. Participants will also have three periodontal
      evaluations and three endometrial biopsies. At the end of the study, participants may choose
      to have the Norplant implant removed if they wish to discontinue Norplant use; otherwise the
      implant may remain in for up to 5 years.
