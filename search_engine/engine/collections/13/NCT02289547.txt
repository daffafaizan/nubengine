      favorable toxicity profile compared to cisplatin for patients with advanced gastric cancer.
      The safety profile of oxaliplatin makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapy.
      However, oxaliplatin induce sensory neuropathy, a cumulative, dose-related toxicity. The
      response with XELOX regimen generally occurs earlier. It may therefore be possible to devise
      capecitabine maintenance regimen which achieves maximum treatment effect before cumulative
      neurotoxicity appears. This regimen was studied in colon and breast cancer.

      - Objective: Primary: To evaluate progression free survival Secondary: To evaluated overall
      survival, response rate, toxicity profile of chemotherapy, quality of life

        -  Design :Multicenter randomized controlled phase III open label trial Study subjects will
           be randomized to two groups in a ratio of 1:1 Subjects More than stable disease after 6
           cycle 1st line of XELOX chemotherapy (OR non-complete response/non-progressive disease
           in cases of non-measurable disease before XELOX chemotherapy),

        -  Treatment Groups Group A : Capecitabine: Capecitabine 1000mg/m2 bid D1-14, q 3 week
           Group B : Observation

        -  Evaluation of response and toxicity A response will be evaluated radiologically every
           two cycles thereafter, or when progression is suspicious by RECIST criteria version 1.1.

      A progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date
      of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause.

      An overall survival is defined as the time from the 1stdate of chemotherapy to the date of
      death.

      Safety will be evaluated every treatment by NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.
