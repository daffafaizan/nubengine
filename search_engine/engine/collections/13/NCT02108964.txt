      participants are enrolled in the study. The study treatment begin on Cycle 1, Day 1 with the
      first administration of EGF816. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days. Oral EGF816 is
      administered once daily on a continuous schedule until patient experiences unacceptable
      toxicity, progressive disease (PD), and/or treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the
      investigator, patient withdrawal of consent, or due to any other reasons. Treatment with
      EGF816 may be continued beyond RECIST 1.1 defined PD, if, in the judgment of the
      investigator, there is evidence of clinical benefit and the patient wishes to continue with
      the study treatment.
