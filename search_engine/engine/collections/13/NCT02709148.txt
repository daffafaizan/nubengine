      neurophysiology of human movement disorders with two goals: 1) Assess the feasibility of
      chronic brain recording using a novel fully implantable pulse generator (Medtronic Activa
      PC+S), which has the capability of sensing and storing local field potentials (LFPs) recorded
      from implanted electrodes, in addition to providing therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS).
      2) Study acute and chronic effects of therapeutic DBS on cortical LFPs. 3) Study feasibility
      of the use of brain signals as feedback either directly to the patient or for DBS stimulation
      adjustments.
