        -  To further develop a new method of in vivo imaging of the breast using
           vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging.

        -  To demonstrate and evaluate the capability of VA imaging in detecting
           microcalcifications and lesions inside the human breast.

      OUTLINE: Participants undergo vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging of the breast using
      ultrasonography over 90 minutes. Participants may also undergo further imaging using clinical
      ultrasonography.
