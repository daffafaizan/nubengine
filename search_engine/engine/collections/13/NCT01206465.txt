      I. To determine the recommended dose of PDX (pralatrexate) given in combination with a fixed
      dose of 5-FU (fluorouracil) administered as a 48-hour infusion given every other week.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess clinical response to therapy in subjects with measurable disease and time to
      disease progression in all subjects.

      II. To assess the toxicity profile of the combination of PDX and 5-FU. III. To determine the
      pharmacokinetics of PDX and 5-FU and correlate with clinical toxicity.

      IV. To analyze polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase
      (TS) and correlate with clinical toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pralatrexate.

      Patients receive pralatrexate intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 48 hours on days 2 and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
