      production of collagen fibers. Additionally, periostin is synthesized in tissues exposed to
      constant mechanical forces such as the periosteum, periodontal ligament, tendon, heart valve
      and skin. Periostin mediates inflammation and fibrosis during diseases of various organs,
      including the heart, lung, kidney, skin, liver, skeletal muscle and retina.

      This study evaluated periostin levels in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with chronic
      periodontitis, gingivitis and periodontally healthy as well as the effect of non-surgical
      periodontal treatment on gingival crevicular fluid periostin levels.
