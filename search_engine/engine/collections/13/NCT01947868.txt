        1. To estimate symptom improvement rates at weeks 2 and 12

        2. To estimate mean change from baseline in overall QoL scores using the FACT-L instrument
           and LCS score at Week 2, 4 and 12.

        3. To estimate the proportion of patients exhibiting an LCS change of 7 points or more at
           weeks 2, 4 and 12.

        4. Subgroup information of symptom improvement rate, QoL and disease-related symptom scores
           by gender, smoking status, smoking pattern, WHO performance, number of metastatic sites,
           female/never smokers and patients with COPD at week 2, week 4 and week 12.
