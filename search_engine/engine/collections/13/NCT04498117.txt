    
      Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to compare the safety and
      efficacy of four administrations of oregovomab 2 mg IV versus placebo, administered in
      combination with specific cycles of a standard six-cycle chemotherapy regimen (paclitaxel and
      carboplatin), for the treatment of subjects with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer who have
      undergone optimal debulking surgery and are either pending initiation of chemotherapy (Cohort
      1 - Primary Surgery) or resumption of another three cycles of chemotherapy, having already
      completed three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Cohort 2 - NACT + Interval Surgery).

      For Cohort 1 - Primary Surgery, 372 subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., chemotherapy
      with oregovomab or chemotherapy with placebo). For Cohort 2 - NACT + Interval Surgery, 230
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (i.e., chemotherapy with oregovomab or
      chemotherapy and placebo).
