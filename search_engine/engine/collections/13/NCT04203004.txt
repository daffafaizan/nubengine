    
      This is a monocentric, pilot, randomized controlled study. Each eligible transplant candidate
      will be enrolled once an eligible graft has been allocated to him/her. Each enrolled patient
      will be randomized to either the experimental arm (HOPE-CytoSorb) or the control arm
      (HOPE-standard).

      End-ischemic HOPE will be performed at our center after standard procurement of the graft at
      the donor hospital, static cold storage preservation during transport and back-table
      preparation. Dual HOPE, by portal continuous flow and arterial pulsatile flow, will be
      pressure controlled: portal pressure will be ≤5 mmHg and mean arterial pressure will be ≤30
      mmHg. HOPE will be performed in an open system, so the graft will swim in the perfusate
      flowing out of the vena cava. The recirculating perfusion solution will have the same
      composition of University of Wisconsin Machine Perfusion Solution. HOPE will be maintained
      for 4 hours. CytoSorb will be included in the circuit only in the experimental arm.

      Scheduled samples of both the perfusate and patient's blood will be analyzed for the levels
      of TNF-alfa, IL-6, IL-8 and ET-1. A biopsy of the implanted graft will be taken 2 hours after
      its reperfusion. The patient will be followed for 1 year after transplantation.

      Once 10 patients have been enrolled, an interim analysis will be performed by an independent
      Clinical Endpoint Committee.
