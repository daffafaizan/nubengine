      criteriaS to choose the objectS of study from the gastric cancer patients coming to our
      hospital 2013-06 to 2013-12 .The included patients will be randomly divided into two groups A
      and B, two groups of patients 4 days before operation begin to give parenteral nutrition: A:
      the control group of normal intravenous nutrition. B: the trial group,add Omega-3
      Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids 0.2 g/kg to parenteral nutrition, no use on the day of surgery,
      postoperative 2 days continue to add Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids 0.2 g/kg. Detect and
      compare CRP、TNF-α、IL-1、IL-4、lL-6、 IL-8、lL-10 levels of two groups in days before parenteral
      nutrition and applicating 3rd day and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 5th,and detect liver function
      in preoperative and postoperative 2nd,5th,7th day. Record postoperative anal exhaust time,
      postoperative complications, postoperative hospital days, preoperative and postoperative body
      weight.Results: Trail group patients compared with the control group,Omega-3 Polyunsaturated
      Fatty Acids can reduce early postoperative inflammatory cytokines release, reduce the
      postoperative fever time, reduce the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome,
      promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, improve the nutritional state of patients,
      reduce infection and related complications after the surgery and reduce postoperative
      hospitalization days. Conclusions: Perioperative application of omega 3 PUFA can reduce the
      release of inflammatory cytokines, regulating cell and humoral immunity, reduce the
      postoperative fever time, reduce the local inflammation medium that inhibit the
      gastrointestinal peristalsis, promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, improve the
      nutritional state of patients, thereby reducing the occurrence of postoperative infection and
      related complications, reduce postoperative hospitalization days.
