      selenium or placebo. All women will be given standard prenatal care, including nevirapine for
      the prevention of mother-to-child transmission and prenatal multivitamin supplements. We will
      examine the effect of the selenium supplements on intermediate outcomes predictive of the
      risks of transmission of HIV and to disease progression.
