      treatment leads to response in 75-80% of the patients, with median duration of response of
      only 14-18 months. Once the patient becomes hormone resistant, there is no effective therapy
      to prolong life. For patients with HRPC, the median life expectancy is 17 months.2 Thus
      palliative care remains the standard therapy for HRPC. The most widely used chemotherapy
      regimens are combinations of mitoxantrone with prednisone and taxanes with estramustine
      phosphate.3,4,5 Taxotere has also demonstrated activity in prostate cancer cell lines.6
      Several clinical studies have demonstrated its activity in patients with metastatic prostate
      cancer as a single agent or in combination.4, 5 Taxotere may exert its effects in part
      through anti-angiogenic effects.7 Recent work in animal models has provided additional
      evidence for the beneficial role of angiostatic agents in the treatment of malignant
      diseases. This is the first study of the two drugs used together in prostate cancer.
