      the blood) of Fluticasone Propionate (Flixotide), a commonly used steroid drug that is
      inhaled in patients with asthma. We will use standard clinical Flixotide Nebules that are
      used with clinical nebulisers (machines used in hospital and at home - to deliver drug to
      patients with asthma). Current clinical nebulisers deliver a 'coarse' mist of drug, which has
      the potential for side effects and this is an important consideration with steroids. These
      Flixotide nebules will be used to deliver the drug (fluticasone propionate) as monodisperse
      aerosol clouds (that is the drug will be delivered as a 'fine' mist cloud to patients). In
      order to deliver the drug as a monodisperse aerosol, the Flixotide Nebules will be used with
      a spinning top aerosol (a large research nebuliser machine)which is able to selectively
      generate aerosol clouds that have a fine mist. A fine mist cloud leads to less deposition in
      the throat of the patients and a greater control of the inhaled drug reaching the lungs, and
      fine mist drug clouds have the potential to reduce side effects. We will also compare this to
      the use of a standard routine clinical dose of a Flixotide metered-dose inhaler ( a 'press
      and breathe' inhaler) with a spacer (plastic bubble on the end of an inhaler) delivered to
      patients.
