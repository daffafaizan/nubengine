      antimicrobial resistance genes) and microbiome (populations of bacteria) in feces obtained
      from people when they consume diets containing beef derived from cattle raised conventionally
      (i.e. using antimicrobial drugs(AMDs)) vs. those produced in raised without antibiotics (RWA)
      systems. In addition, the researchers will investigate whether specific antimicrobial
      resistant (AMR) genes are transmitted from food to people.

      The hypothesis is that beef is not a significant source of resistant bacteria, and there is
      no difference in the likelihood of gut colonization with resistant bacteria in people eating
      beef derived from cattle raised conventionally (i.e. using AMDs) vs. those eating beef
      produced in RWA systems.
