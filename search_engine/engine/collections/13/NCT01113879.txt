      activity demonstrate greater improvement in language abilities with treatment than patients
      who do not participate in aerobic activity. As secondary objectives, we will determine if
      there is a direct relationship between either brain efficiency or increases in Brain Derived
      Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) after exercise and higher learning rates in aphasia.
