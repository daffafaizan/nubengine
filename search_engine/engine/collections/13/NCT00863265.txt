      subjects with greater than ideal levels of LDL cholesterol who do not require
      anti-cholesterol drug treatment. Subjects will consume a baseline diet provided by a feeding
      center that is deficient in phytosterols for three periods of 21 days separated by 7-day
      washout periods. Treatments will be given in random order During period B placebo
      phytosterols and placebo ezetimibe will be given; during period C placebo phytosterols and
      active ezetimibe will be given; during period A active phytosterols and active ezetimibe will
      be given. Study endpoints are fecal cholesterol excretion and percent cholesterol absorption
      determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and circulating LDL cholesterol.
