      Primary

        -  Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and define the safety profile of multitargeted
           receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor MP470 in humans.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the therapeutic response rate for patients receiving MP470.

        -  Define the human pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of MP470
           capsules

        -  Evaluate PK-PD relationships.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor MP470 until the
      maximum tolerated dose is determined.

      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses are carried out to determine changes in
      phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Rad51 expression, number of
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and tumor glucose metabolism measured by
      2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).
