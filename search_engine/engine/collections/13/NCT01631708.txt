      haemochromatosis (HH) is not necessary. This project aims to undertake a randomised
      patient-blinded trial of erythrocytapheresis compared to sham erythrocytapheresis (using
      plasmapheresis) in individuals who have serum ferritin (SF) above the upper limit of the
      normal range but < 1000ug/L (defined here as moderate iron overload) due to HFE mutations and
      to compare the prevalence of symptoms and objective markers of disease in the two treatment
      arms.
