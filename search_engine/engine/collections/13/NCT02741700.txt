      African-American Veterans with gout with ULT medication possession ratio of <80% at
      Birmingham, St. Louis and Philadelphia VA clinics. The investigators will compare the
      efficacy of the storytelling intervention to usual care in improving Urate Lowering Therapy
      (ULT) adherence, assessed with MEMSCaps (electronic monitoring) at 6-months (primary
      outcome); reducing gout flares needing treatment, improving patient satisfaction, improving
      the ability to achieve target serum urate <6 mg/dl and improving self-reported ULT adherence
      at 6-months (secondary outcomes). The investigators will assess these outcomes at 12-months
      as evidence for sustenance of the effect of intervention.

      Alignment with VA mission and priorities: This study serves the VA's mission of improving the
      health of Veterans and addresses two priority areas, 1) decreasing health care disparities
      and 2) improving health care delivery using a low-cost, technology-based solution to poor
      medication adherence. Study results will lead to a ready-to-implement low cost
      patient-centered intervention for AA Veterans with gout to improve medication adherence and
      patient outcomes. This study will provide the proof of efficacy of "storytelling" for
      improving medication adherence in chronic symptomatic diseases. The "storytelling"
      intervention can be easily adapted for similar chronic symptomatic conditions such as COPD
      and CHF.
