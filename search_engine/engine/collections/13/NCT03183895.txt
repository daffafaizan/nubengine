    
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      AccuCinch Ventricular Repair System for the treatment of heart failure and functional mitral
      regurgitation in symptomatic adult patients with or without functional mitral regurgitation
      (FMR) and left ventricular remodeling due to dilated cardiomyopathy (ischemic or non-ischemic
      etiology), who remain symptomatic despite optimized medical therapy.

      Subjects with FMR must present with at least moderate FMR, a reduced ejection fraction (≤40%)
      and high operative risk as assessed by the Heart Team. The Heart Team may utilize established
      risk scores (STS, Euro-Score II) in conjunction with comorbidities as recommended by MVARC
      (frailty index; major organ system compromise not to be improved postoperatively; procedure
      specific impediments).

      Subjects without FMR must present a markedly dilated left ventricle with LVEDD ≥ 55 mm and
      reduced ejection fraction (≤40%). These patients are not potential candidates for
      "conventional intervention", because their mitral valve is not in need of repair or
      replacement. Therefore, AccuCinch represents the sole treatment option for these patients,
      who are not selected on the basis of high surgical risk.
