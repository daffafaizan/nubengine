      Nebulizer results in:

      A-shortened duration of oxygen-dependence.

      B-reduced side effects by assessing the patient's heart rate before and 30 minutes after the
      first aerosol and noting the occurrence of desaturation <90% during the nebulisation
      sessions.

      C-increased acceptance of the aerosol, measured via a questionnaire given to the patient's
      parents at the end of hospitalization (a single questionnaire will be completed by either
      parent or both parents).

      D-shortened length of stay based on the following discharge criteria: observation of a
      respiratory severity score â‰¤ 2 (Clinical Asthma Score (CAS)) for at least 12 consecutive
      hours and a transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2)> 94% when awake or > 91% during sleep.
