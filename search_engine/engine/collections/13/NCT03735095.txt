    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of endobronchial ultrasound with
      transbronchial needle (EBUS-TBN) guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (EBUS-TBN I-PDT)
      and/or I-PDT and/or photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients with locally advanced lung cancer
      (LALC) in the central airway, using porfimer sodium as a photosensitizer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. To assess the tumor response to treatment.

        -  II. To evaluate local progression-free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine porfimer sodium retention in the target tumor tissue. II. Examine the relationship
      between immune biomarkers and response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes 2-4 hours prior to the
      delivery of I-PDT. Patients then undergo EBUS-TBN guided I-PDT over 30-45 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks.
