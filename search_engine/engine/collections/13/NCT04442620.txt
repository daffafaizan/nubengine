      Liver Disease (NAFLD), this is why nutritional and lifestyle strategies are pivotal to
      ameliorate risk factors and prevent disease progression. Weight loss achieved by a weight
      loss diet and exercise is certainly the principal treatment for the amelioration of fatty
      liver, nevertheless quality of diet composition could also play a crucial role. Since
      oxidative stress and inflammation have been cited among the mechanisms involved in NAFLD,
      foods containing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactive components should be considered
      when designing a nutritionally sound diet. The Mediterranean Diet, naturally rich in
      antioxidants and antinflammatory foods, together with personalised physical activity could
      have a variety of positive health effects, including the slowing down of degenerative
      diseases such as liver steatosis.

      The present study aims to compare and evaluate the efficacy of three interventions on the
      pathophysiological mechanisms that may affect changes in liver fat deposits and progression
      of NAFLD in patients with obesity and presenting at least three of the main Metabolic
      Syndrome traits.

      The first intervention group receives a caloric restricted Mediterranean Diet coupled with
      physical activity (delivered through guided gym classes); the second group receives a caloric
      restricted Mediterranean Diet distributed over 7 meals and advise to walk 10.000 steps a day;
      the third group receives the conventional diet proposed by the American Association for the
      Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and advise to walk 10.000 steps a day.
