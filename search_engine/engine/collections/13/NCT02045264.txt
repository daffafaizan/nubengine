    
      Icatibant has been studied for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE),
      an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent and self-limiting episodes of edema
      of the skin, larynx, and gastrointestinal tract. The most serious manifestation of an HAE
      attack is laryngeal edema, causing obstruction of the upper airways that may lead to death by
      asphyxiation if undiagnosed and/or untreated.

      Icatibant has been approved in over 40 countries around the world including the United States
      (US) and Europe for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults.
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of icatibant in a
      Japanese population and to evaluate whether race/ethnicity impacts the pharmacokinetics of
      icatibant after single subcutaneous injection.

      This is an open-label, single-arm study that will enroll at least 12 Japanese subjects (in
      order to have 12 subjects complete the study), age 18-55 years inclusive. All subjects will
      receive a single subcutaneous injection of 30mg icatibant. The study will be conducted at 1
      site in the US. The study will consist of a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a
      Follow-Up Period.
