      push on the pedals and produce mechanical work. An eccentric cycling ergometer has a motor
      that rotates the cranks with a predetermined torque, the cyclist needs to resist to the
      movement of the cranks. This leads to eccentric muscle contractions, the work is thus
      produced while the muscle is lengthening (negative work). This mode of exercise is known to
      produce a lower oxygen consumption (energy cost) for the same mechanical power output and
      also leads to muscle damage which can interfere with fuel selection.
