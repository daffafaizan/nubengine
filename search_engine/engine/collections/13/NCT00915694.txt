      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of nelfinavir mesylate when given concurrently with
           radiotherapy and temozolomide followed by temozolomide alone in patients with
           glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the safety and dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare the observed median values of PFS and OS obtained in this study to the
           historical median values of 6.9 months and 14.6 months, respectively.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nelfinavir mesylate.

      Patients receive oral nelfinavir mesylate twice daily beginning 7-10 days before the
      initiation of chemoradiotherapy and continuing until the completion of chemoradiotherapy.
      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week and receive concurrent oral
      temozolomide once daily for 6 weeks. Beginning 4 weeks after completion of nelfinavir
      mesylate and chemoradiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide alone once daily on days
      1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
