      separate days. On the first day, they were given a pizza prepared with dough fermented for 8
      hours (pizza A), and on the second study day they received a pizza prepared with dough
      fermented for 24 hours (pizza B). Participants and their parents were blinded to the type of
      pizza served on each day. Both meals were served at 7.00 pm at the pizzeria where the pizza
      had been prepared, and consumed within 30 minutes.
