      investigators aimed to investigate whether walking assist device with auxiliary lser
      illuminator (laser quad-cane) providing visual feedback during ambulation could improve
      parameters of gait cycle and function among patients with chronic stroke.

      Methods: This was a randomized-prospective study and participants were recruited to each the
      experimental and the control group equally. Patients in the experimental group (EG) received
      30-minutes rehabilitation, consisting of 15 minutes of walking training with laser quad-cane
      and 15 minutes of traditional physical therapy (such as strengthening and balance training).
      Patients in the control group (CG) received the same rehabilitation except that the walking
      training was by conventional strategy without lase quad-cane. The rehabilitation lasted for 4
      weeks, twice per week. Gait parameters were measured by Rehab watch as primary outcomes and
      Berg's balance scale (BBS), timed-up-and-go test (TUG), and Barthel index were used as
      secondary outcomes. Both the primary and secondary outcomes were measured before the
      rehabilitation (baseline), 4 weeks (week 4), and 8 weeks (week 8) after the rehabilitation.
