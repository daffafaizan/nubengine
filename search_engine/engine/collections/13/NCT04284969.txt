      aging, older patient represent an increasing proportion of cancer patients. Increasing age is
      also associated with increased risk of co-morbidities as well as a decline of functional
      reserve of multiple organ systems, eventually leading in the context of the disease-and/or
      the treatment-related stress to functional deconditioning or organ failure.

      Surgery or complex medico-surgical procedures can be considered as one proof-of principle of
      such risks, since major cancer surgery the older population is at higher risk of
      morbi-mortality and unplanned hospitalization for geriatric events1.

      In order to reduce complications after surgery, prehabilitation has often been considered,
      and 71% of the surgeons would accept a 4 weeks delay before surgery to improve patients'
      outcomes if shown to be beneficial2. However, the actual level of evidence depends on the
      interventions: high for pre-operative nutrition3, but low for physical exercise, due to
      heterogeneous programs with often bad adherence4. In addition, geriatric validated
      interventions, in order to prevent iatrogenic event, may be added in a multi-interventional
      model of intervention.
