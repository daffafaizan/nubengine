      cholecystectomy. Recently, gallbladder drainage with EUS-guided gallbladder drainage (EGBD)
      has been described as a treatment option. However, whether this is an effective treatment
      option in surgically fit patients are uncertain.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the feasibility of performing EGBD as a treatment
      of acute calculous cholecystitis in patients that are indicated for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. The investigators hypothesis that the technique is safe and feasible.
