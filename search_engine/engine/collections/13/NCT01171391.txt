    
      Nocturia, defined as waking to void at least once per night between periods of sleep, is a
      common complaint and shows an age-dependent increase in both prevalence and severity (number
      of nocturnal voids). The most common causes are detrusor over-activity, reduced nighttime
      functional bladder capacity, and nocturnal polyuria.

      VA106483 is a selective vasopressin V2-receptor agonist in development for nocturia. VA106483
      is a non-peptide drug that displays much improved oral availability over desmopressin and low
      dependence on glomerular filtration for its elimination.

      VA106483 has been administered to 184 subjects (including healthy adult subjects [males and
      females], children [males and females] with nocturia and 48 elderly males [aged 65 years and
      over]). It has been administered as single doses both intravenously, up to doses of
      approximately 250 mg and orally up to 50 mg It is also being investigated in approximately
      123 male subjects (two-thirds on active medication, one third on placebo) with nocturia in a
      current study with dosing for up to 8 weeks.

      This intra-subject dose escalation study has previously been conducted in 10 elderly male
      subjects to determine whether subjects demonstrated a dose-dependent pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic (urine osmolality and diuresis) response and whether the dose of VA106483
      could be titrated within an individual patient to achieve optimal clinical response in
      clinical practice. Given that to date, only 8 females have been exposed to VA106483, the
      purpose of this study is to confirm that the described duration of pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of VA106483 in males is similar in females.
