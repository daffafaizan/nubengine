        -  Screen acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples to correlate high relative expression levels
           of PLAGL2 and putative PLAGL2 target genes (implicated in microarray study) with
           potential pathogenic relevance with respect to AML development.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved mRNA from diagnostic samples is analyzed for gene expression by
      reverse transcriptase-PCR.
