    
      Methods: A physiological study which measured pressure intra-nasally with micro (750 Âµm)
      pressure probes (Millar, USA) in 10 (5M / 5F) healthy newborns with mean gestation age 37.18
      (SD 1.29) wk and mean birth weight of 2414 (SD 503.13) g. NHF was applied at 8 L/min (AIRVO
      2) through smaller (OPT 314) and larger (OPT 316) Optiflow nasal cannula; CPAP 5 cmH20 was
      produced by a Bubble CPAP system and nasal mask interface at constant flow 8 L/min (Fisher &
      Paykel Healthcare, NZ). Values are expressed in cmH20 as means and standard deviations (SD).
