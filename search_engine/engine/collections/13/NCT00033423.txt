        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan when
           administered in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory
           low-grade, follicular, or transformed CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

        -  Determine the toxicity of different doses of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the frequency of reversal of bone marrow involvement with NHL in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan.

      Patients receive rituximab IV once weekly on weeks 1-4. After 4 doses of rituximab, patients
      without bone marrow involvement and cellularity greater than 50% expected receive rituximab
      IV once weekly on weeks 6 and 7 and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes with
      the final dose of rituximab (day 43).

      Cohorts of 5-6 patients receive escalating dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 4 of 5 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks, every 2-3 months for 2 years, and then every 6
      months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
