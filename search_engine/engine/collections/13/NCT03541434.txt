      enlarged in childhood, until the age of 11. Obstructive sleep apnea caused by adenotonsillar
      hypertrophy is a major contributing factor to cardiorespiratory morbidity in the pediatric
      population. It is also responsible for otitis media with effusion, the most frequent cause of
      children's hearing loss. Even so, there is scarce knowledge of its molecular pathogenesis.

      Objective: Identification of clinical/molecular markers of adenotonsillar enlargement and
      investigation of their participation in the process of tissue hypertrophy.

      Methods: A prospective cohort of children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy were recruited
      starting on 02/01/2017 and ending on 12/22/2017. Demographic and clinical data including age,
      gender, sleep apnea severity, tonsillar size, presence of middle ear effusion, family
      history, review of systems as well as tympanometric and complete blood count results were
      recorded. Blood samples and tissue specimens from the therapeutic adenotonsillectomy
      procedure were archived for future analyses. Children with chronic tonsillitis and/or
      adenoiditis, who also underwent excision of tonsils and/or adenoids served as study controls.
      Informed consent was obtained from parents of all study participants.
