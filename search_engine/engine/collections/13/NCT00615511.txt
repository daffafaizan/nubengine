    
      Pregnenolone is a steroid health supplement which is readily available in health food stores.
      We are using it in this study at higher doses than you would normally take as a health
      supplement because preliminary studies have indicated that negative symptoms improve and
      certain aspects of cognition improve at these doses. We do not require you to stop your
      existing treatment in order to enter the study. After four months we will test your symptoms
      and cognition and ask if you would like to continue taking pregnenolone, at no cost, in a
      follow-up study designed to determine the long-term costs and benefits of taking
      pregnenolone.
