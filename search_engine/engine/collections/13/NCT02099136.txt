      I. Quantify changes in the erythema response in human subjects exposed to minimally erythemic
      doses of solar-simulated ultraviolet light before and after celecoxib treatment.

      II. Determine the effect of celecoxib on various biomarkers following ultraviolet
      (UV)-irradiation. The modulation of the following biomarkers, before and after treatment with
      celecoxib are being examined: apoptosis and proliferation indices, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
      cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2) levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo UV-irradiation to the right buttock at baseline. Chromameter readings are
      obtained at 24 hours post UV-irradiation and patients undergo skin biopsy at 24 and 96 hours
      following UV-irradiation.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive placebo orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 14 days.

      GROUP II: Patients receive low-dose celecoxib PO BID for 14 days.

      GROUP III: Patients receive higher dose celecoxib PO BID for 14 days.

      GROUP IV: Patients receive same dose of celecoxib PO as Group III once daily (QD) for 14
      days.

      GROUP V: Patients receive high-dose celecoxib PO QD for 14 days.

      After 10 days post-treatment, patients undergo UV-irradiation to the left buttock.
      Chromameter readings are obtained at 24 hours post UV-irradiation and patients undergo skin
      biopsy at 24 and 96 hours following UV-irradiation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 25.
