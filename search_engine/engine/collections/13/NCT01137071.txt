      strategy in patients with relapsing platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal and
      fallopian tubes cancer who achieve a second Complete Response after a platinum-based
      chemotherapy after platinum-based chemotherapeutical regimen. Fifty-one (51) patients with
      relapsing platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tubes adenocarcinoma
      will receive doses of 30 mg/m2 of Hu3S193 as a single agent every two weeks, in a total of 12
      doses (treatment period duration: 23 weeks). After the treatment period, patients will be
      evaluated every 3 months for the first two years, and every 6 months for more 3 years, and
      then in an annual-basis until disease progression or death, whichever happens first.
