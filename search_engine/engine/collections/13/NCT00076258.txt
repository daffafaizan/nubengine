      with significant morbidity and reduced quality of life. Pharmacological therapies have been
      used to augment the effect of antidepressants; however, such therapies are associated with a
      range of adverse effects. Studies indicate that exercise may be safe and effective in
      augmenting depression treatment. This study will determine whether exercise can complement
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy in people with MDD who have residual
      symptoms of depression despite drug treatment.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either high frequency exercise or low frequency
      exercise for 12 weeks. Depression symptoms will be measured weekly. Quality of life and
      satisfaction with the study will also be measured. Depression scales and self-reports will be
      used to assess participants.
