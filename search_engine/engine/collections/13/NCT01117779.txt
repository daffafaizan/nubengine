      performed nor define the post-surgery follow-up of each subject. A subject's participation in
      the registry will not influence or direct subject treatment procedures or follow-up care.
      Physicians will use their discretion and personal standards of care to select subjects,
      perform the cryoablation procedures and define appropriate follow-up visit schedules for
      their subjects; it is anticipated that subjects will be seen at least once per year during
      the five-year follow-up period of TRACE. Subjects may be followed by the physician performing
      the cryoablation procedure or by their local/personal physician. The enrolling physician will
      be responsible for providing the follow-up data to the registry and will, as appropriate,
      work with a subject's local/personal physician to collect the follow-up data.
