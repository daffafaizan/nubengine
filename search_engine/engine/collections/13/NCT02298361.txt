        1. Changes to eligibility criteria. We changed patient eligibility to include all pediatric
           patients through age 19 with >=1 clinical visit in the study period. These decisions
           were based on: 1) at age 20, individuals are no longer eligible for children's Medicaid
           or CHIP in Oregon; 2) identification of PCP assignment was difficult in the EHR.

        2. Added second comparison group/study arm. In the intervention clinics, the tools were
           used on a smaller number of pediatric patients than anticipated, and there were
           significant demographic differences between intervention and control site patients,
           despite the clinics being matched. Thus we added a second comparison group,
           "within-clinic comparison patients" as pediatric patients with >=1 visit at an
           intervention clinic in the study period but on whom the tools were NOT used. This
           provided a comparison group that accounted for clinic-level effects and was more
           demographically similar to the "intervention patients" on whom tools were used.

        3. Revision of Aim 3 - CHIPRA recommended care assessment. We did not pursue assessment of
           CHIPRA quality care measures due to 1) limited follow-up time due to the need to
           implement iterative modifications to the study HIT tools, and 2) the tools were used on
           a smaller set of pediatric patients than anticipated, thus we had a very limited
           denominator for these analyses.
