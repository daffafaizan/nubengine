      placebo-controlled, double blind trial testing citalopram in acute ischemic stroke.

      Randomization Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with either citalopram or
      placebo. Treatment allocation is double-blinded based on computer-generated algorithm via a
      dedicated website. Patients whose treatment is stopped within 31 days after inclusion will be
      replaced.

      Intervention and follow-up Patients randomized to citalopram will receive oral treatment with
      20 mg tablets (10 mg if age â‰¥65 and/or reduced liver function) for 6 months with telephone
      contact after 2 weeks and 3 months and follow-up visits at 1 and 6 months. If patients
      develop depression dosage is initially doubled, followed by an additional control to evaluate
      effect and, if necessary, shifted to open-label antidepressant treatment. After 6 months,
      treatment will either stop or switch to open-label antidepressants at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      Substudy 120 of patients will begin treatment within 12 hours after treatment with
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. These patients will receive a standard acute
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with additional perfusion and angio sequences. The 24-hour
      control scan will be done using MRI instead of conventional CT.

      Data monitoring When 300 patients have been included in the trial, an interim analysis will
      be performed. The unblinded results of this analysis will be reviewed by an independent data
      monitoring committee.
