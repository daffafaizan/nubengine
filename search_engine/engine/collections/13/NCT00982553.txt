    
      Phase I (study day 1 - 14):

        -  14 healthy volunteers with a documented negative HIV-1 antibody test during screening
           procedures will be enrolled.

        -  On day 1, fasted subjects will be administered ribavirin 800 mg without food (witnessed
           dosing). This will be followed be a 12 hour detailed pharmacokinetic assessment; blood
           sampling drawn at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours.

        -  This will be followed by a wash-out period.

        -  As steady state pharmacokinetics of ribavirin are not reached for several weeks, single
           dosing pharmacokinetics will be assessed in this study

      Phase II (study days 15 - 19):

        -  On day 15, subjects will commence raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. Subjects will attend
           for safety visits and witnessed dosing during this phase.

        -  Day 19 - after 4 days of dosing when steady state pharmacokinetics has been reached,
           subjects will attend for a 12 hour detailed pharmacokinetic visit where following
           witnessed administration of raltegravir 400 mg without food, blood sampling will be
           drawn at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours post dose for the assessment
           of raltegravir plasma exposure.

      Phase III (study day 20):

      â€¢ Subjects will be administered raltegravir 400 mg and ribavirin 800 mg without food. This
      will be followed by a 12 hour detailed pharmacokinetic assessment with blood sampling drawn
      at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours.
