      breastfeeding is needed for clinical practice and research. Many methods for measuring milk
      intake have been studied. While the intake of formula fed infants can be directly measured
      based on the amount of fluid in the bottle, determining the actual milk intake for breastfed
      infants is more difficult. Precise feed volumes are especially important for infants in the
      NICU. Most premature infants are unable to breastfeed because they are not able to coordinate
      suckling and swallowing.

      The FEEDBACK system includes a nipple shield and a monitoring unit. It helps protect the
      nipple of a breastfeeding mother as well as measures and displays the volume of milk, in mL
      or oz, that an infant consumes during a breast feeding session. Based on this information, a
      mother has quantitative data regarding her infant's milk intake for her own use or to share
      with her health care provider.

      This study is designed in two phases. First, data will be collected from breastfeeding
      mothers of pre-term infants to develop an algorithm that can identify feeding patterns in the
      pre-term infant. Once established, accuracy of FEEDBACK will be assessed comparing pre and
      post weights of the breastfed infant to the volume intake measured by FEEDBACK.
