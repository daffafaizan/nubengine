      virus. It is one of the biggest single-stranded RNA viruses. SARS-CoV2 Viral polyproteins are
      responsible for viral replication and transcription while its protease enzymes are
      responsible for polypeptides cleaving and immune system blockage. They are considered to be
      an important therapeutic target.

      Host immunological response against SARS-CoV2 could affect the disease outcome. Patients
      requiring ICU admission have higher levels of interleukins 6 - 10, tumor necrosis factor α
      (TNF-α), and fewer CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The level of cytokines and lymphopenia is
      associated with pulmonary damage and respiratory distress.

      Till now, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19. Multiple current and investigational
      drugs are used such as Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and Remdesivir.

      Ivermectin: A potent anti-parasitic drug has shown to have an in-vitro antiviral activity
      against a broad range of viruses. It inhibits the interaction between the human
      immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase protein (IN) and the importin (IMP) α/β1. But on
      the other hand, Ivermectin showed limited efficacy against DENV in phase III clinical trial
      that was done in Thailand in 2014-2017. Recent Studies proved the In-vitro effect and
      "subsequently" the possible therapeutic role of Ivermectin in the management of SARS-CoV2.
