      based surgical devices (ESDs) created less surgical smoke, involved less visual obstruction,
      and produced less lateral thermal damage than monopolar ESDs. However, there was no study
      comparing ultrasonic ESD and monopolar ESD in laparoscopic colpotomy in terms of surgical
      smoke and lateral thermal damage. Therefore, the aim of this randomized trial was to compare
      the degree of surgical smoke obstructing vision and thermal damage caused by two different
      ESDs (ultrasonic versus monopolar ESD) in colpotomy during total laparoscopic hysterectomy.
