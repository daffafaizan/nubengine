      diseases. However, its use has been extended to improve pregnancy rates in assisted
      reproductive techniques (ART). These new indications has been called screening for aneuploidy
      (PGS, preimplantation genetic screening). The current indications for PGS include advanced
      maternal age, recurrent miscarriage, repeated implantation failure, severe male factor
      infertility, previous aneuploid pregnancy, poor embryo quality, chemotherapy and radiotherapy
      and elective single embryo transfer to avoid multiple pregnancies. Nevertheless, the results
      obtained in the last decade have failed to clearly demonstrate any benefit of PGS in these
      indications and there are no studies evaluating the effect that biopsy could produce on
      embryos.

      Markers of embryo quality are still very limited and are based on subjective morphological
      parameters (such as cell number, size and degree of fragmentation) or on the study of
      embryonic development by measuring the percentage of embryos reaching the blastocyst stage
      after 120 hours of in vitro culture. Counting the cell number of blastocysts involves the
      staining and subsequent nuclei counting, which is incompatible with later embryo transfer. A
      valid alternative to avoid nuclear staining would be a morphometric study using optical
      sections of different focal planes of the blastocyst and three dimensional (3D) virtual
      reconstructions.
