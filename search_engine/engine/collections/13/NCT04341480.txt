      named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) emerged at December 2019 in
      Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This infectious disease soon caused a large global outbreak and
      became a major public health issue. As of 19:00, 12 March 2020, the total number of confirmed
      cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China has reached 80982 with 3173 death, and 110 other countries have
      officially reported 45164 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with 1520 death.

      In this particular time, only patients with SARS-CoV-2 or other diseases with an emergency
      condition were receipted by most of the hospitals in Hubei Province, even in many other
      regions of China. The delayed treatment for many chronic diseases, such as malignant tumors,
      is an increasing serious problem. One major concern was that patients with malignant tumors
      were generally older in age with low immunity. Preliminary study has shown that cancer
      patients are most susceptible to infect SARS-CoV-2 and more likely to develop a severe
      pneumonia. But many other researches suspected that conclusion. Moreover, many of the
      patients with malignant tumors are facing short term death from tumors rather than the risk
      of infection. Nevertheless, there is not sufficient evidence to insure the safety of
      chemotherapy in high-risk region of COVID-19, and there is also not sufficient information to
      judge which patients' tumor therapy can be appropriately delayed. Here the investigators
      investigate the safety of chemotherapy for patients with gynecological malignancy in Wuhan,
      the center of high-risk regions of COVID-19.
