      January 2014 and January 2019 consecutively due to gastric cancer were analyzed. The
      diagnosis was made by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy. Clinical
      staging was done using contrast computed tomography (CT). Positron emission tomography (PET)
      was used in patients with suspected metastasis.The patients were divided into two groups
      according to the technique applied (open, laparotomy). The first group (Group 1; n: 30)
      consisted of patients who underwent open surgery, and the second group (Group 2, n: 30)
      laparoscopic surgery.
