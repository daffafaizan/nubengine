      reduce high risk injecting and sexual behaviors in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam. We will be
      conducting this study in collaboration with the Thai Nguyen Centre for Preventive Medicine
      (CPM). We will compare standard HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) to an intervention
      that adds a continuum of psychosocial support for HIV-positive IDUs. The intervention
      consists of a two-tiered approach that addresses structural and individual level barriers to
      risk reduction: 1) The structural level of the intervention consists of community-based
      programs and targets HIV stigma that is a primary obstacle to risk reduction for HIV-positive
      individuals; 2) The individual level of the intervention consists of 2 HIV posttest
      counseling sessions and 2 skill-building support groups for HIV-positive IDUs. Our research
      questions for the overall project are:

        1. What is the impact of perceived HIV-related stigma on disclosure, social support, and
           coping among IDUs?

        2. What roles do disclosure, social support, and coping play in facilitating the reduction
           of HIV-risk behaviors

        3. Are combined individual and structural level interventions more effective in reducing
           injecting and sexual behaviors among HIV-positive IDUs than individual or structural
           interventions alone and more effective than the standard HIV VCT?
