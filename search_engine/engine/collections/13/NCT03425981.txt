      measurements, participants were randomized into two groups: (i) WB-EMS group and (ii) Control
      Group (CG). Participants in the WB-EMS group were instructed to reduce their running training
      program volume, whereas the CG continued with their running training in term of volume and
      intensity: two or three times per week (45-60 minutes per day) at an intensity of 60-70%
      hearth rate reserve, which was controlled by heart rate monitor (Polar RS300X, POLAR,
      Kempele, Finland), and with 24-48 hours of rest between sessions
