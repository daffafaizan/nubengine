      Convergent evidences from clinical and experimental studies indicate that albuminuria and
      proteinuria are not simply a marker of CKD progression, but an active player in the evolution
      of the disease. Mechanistically, it has been shown that proteinuria induces endoplasmic
      reticulum stress in tubular cells, leading to induction of lipocalin 2/NGAL, a critical
      element of CKD progression. Moreover, proteinuric mice treated with phenylbutyrate are
      protected from CKD progression.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of phenybutyrate, a molecular chaperone
      which inhibits ER stress, on the proteinuria-induced NGAL expression. Urinary NGAL/creatinine
      ratio will be evaluated in proteinuric patients before and under treatment with
      phenylbutyrate.
