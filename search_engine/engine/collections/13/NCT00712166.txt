      infections are often caused by a bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Treatment with
      antibiotics can stop or slow down the growth of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given by
      mouth, intravenously (IV), or by inhalation as a mist. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of AZLI, an investigational formulation of the antibiotic
      aztreonam and administered three times a day using the PARI eFlowÂ® electronic nebulizer, in
      CF patients with PA and mild lung disease.

      In this study, participant eligibility was assessed at a screening visit that occurred up to
      14 days prior to the baseline visit (Day 0). Those participants who met eligibility criteria
      at Day 0 were randomized and began a 28-day course of blinded study treatment (AZLI or
      placebo TID). Participants returned for clinic visits at Day 14, an end of treatment visit at
      Day 28, and a follow up visit 14 days after the last dose of the trial drug (Day 42).
