      patients who meet eligibility from up to 50 sites worldwide. Patient participation will be 12
      months including post procedure follow-up contact at 3, 6 and 12 months. The study duration
      is estimated at 36 months.

      A patient's treatment is determined by the treating physician based on the clinical situation
      and local practices. In contrast to a randomized, controlled trial, there are no pre-defined
      experimental interventions.
