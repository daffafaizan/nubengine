      the first 8 weeks of the study. Following 8 weeks of dosing, participants continued in the
      study for an additional 16 weeks in an open-label phase where all participants still enrolled
      in the study received 150 mg elagolix once daily.

      There was no pre-specified primary efficacy end point for this study as there is no single
      key efficacy outcome measure in this exploratory Phase 2 study. However, the efficacy
      measures of primary interest included the daily assessment of dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual
      pelvic pain and dyspareunia on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe)
      using an e-Diary.
