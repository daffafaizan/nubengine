      involves the application of a continuous 360-degree umbilical traction force with centripetal
      rotation in such a way that it runs at the level of the introitus perpendicular to the
      direction of the birth canal.

      The aim of this prospective randomized study is to compare the Windmill placental development
      technique with traditional placental development strategies. It also analyzes the need to
      carry out MROP in both groups.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the success rate of removing the placenta in
      retained placenta pregnancies between the Windmill technique and the control group. Based on
      this objective, we expected the difference of success rate between groups of 30% (from the
      previous study, the success rate of the Windmill technique was 86%]. The sample size of 35
      participants per group will be required to provide 90% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance
      level.
