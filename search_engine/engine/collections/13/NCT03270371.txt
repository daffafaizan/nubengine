      maintenance hemodialysis. Thus expectancy of life for these patients is comparable to the
      prognosis of metastasized cancer. So far the exact mechanisms causing excess mortality in
      hemodialysis patients remain elusive, but chronic inflammation seems to play a central role
      in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in HD patients.

      Keeping this in mind the Theranova medium-cut off membrane, with its ability to clear middle
      molecules (0,5-50 kDa), seems suitable to further improve clearance of inflammatory mediators
      as the non-protein bound inflammatory mediators lie within the cut off range of this
      membrane. The investigators designed this study to get information on the changes in the
      inflammatory milieu in dialysis patients when using medium-cut off membranes which are know
      to significantly reduce cytokines compared to standard high-flux dialyzers.
