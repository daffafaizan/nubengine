      range of cardiovascular risk factors such as raised plasma triglycerides, HbA1c and C
      reactive protein and aid in body weight regulation. A proposed mechanism includes higher
      satiety and prolonged satiation by virtue of improved postprandial metabolic control,
      although, whether lower GL meals result in greater weight loss or increased satiety is still
      a matter of debate. One matter complicating the issue is that the desire to consume food may
      be driven by psychological factors; food reward centres in the brain may override hormonal
      regulation of food intake. Amongst psychological factors disinhibition has the largest and
      most consistent body of empirical data that associates it with weight gain although the
      mechanisms involved are unknown. This study will investigate whether, irrespective of BMI or
      habitual diet, disinhibited eaters have greater glycaemic excursions following a high
      glycaemic load drink and whether this predicts subsequent satiation.
