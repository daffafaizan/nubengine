      short-term changes in biomarkers. The first 3 boys will receive canakinumab at a dose of 2
      mg/kg, and the second 3 will receive a dose of 4 mg/kg. The study is comprised of four
      visits: a screening visit with baseline lab assessment, treatment day, a 10-14 day
      post-treatment evaluation with safety labs, and a 30 day post-treatment evaluation with
      safety labs. There will be a phone assessment on day 3-5 after treatment to screen for any
      side effects.

      Clinical evaluation will screen for clinical AEs and SAEs. If dose escalation (4 mg/kg) must
      be terminated due to dose-limiting toxicities, the remaining subjects may be enrolled to
      evaluate the safety of canakinumab at the lower dose level (2 mg/kg).

      One blood draw will occur after consent at least 48 hours prior to treatment day and on days
      10-14 and 30 after the canakinumab injection to screen for laboratory abnormalities and
      collect serum for biomarker analysis. After obtaining consent, prior to treatment, 2 red top
      and 1 purple top 4 cc tubes will be obtained for screening labs and serum biomarker
      collection. Tuberculosis screening (Quantiferon-Gold) will use 4 blood tubes (grey, yellow,
      purple, green) with 1 cc of blood in each. At the following 2 visits with blood draws, two
      red top and one purple top collection tubes of 4 cc will be collected per subject. For red
      top blood collection tubes, one tube will be sent to the clinical lab for safety lab
      processing. The second tube will be processed in the research lab for serum biomarkers.
