      However, several trials comparing platinum versus non-platinum based chemotherapy regimens
      failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in terms of time to tumor
      progression or survival. Newer agents such as gemcitabine, docetaxel and vinorelbine have
      shown significant activity in the treatment of NSCLC. Gemcitabine/vinorelbine combination as
      first line treatment has demonstrated a response rate (RR) of 18-43% and a median overall
      survival (OS) of 9.8-13 months. Similarly, the gemcitabine/docetaxel combination has shown a
      RR 32-35% and a median OS of 9-12 months. Given their proven efficacy, the combination of
      these two doublets, would be interesting.
