      Department. After verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria by principal
      investigator and signature of consent, patients will be randomized by 1: 1 randomization
      (centralized randomization by statistician into 2 groups at M0). They will participate in
      sessions in a deferred manner due to two per week for each group:

        -  Interventional "A" group: 48 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from M0 to M6 in 30
           patients.

        -  Control "B" group: 24 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from M3 to M6 in 30
           patients.

      Patients of "B" group will be not performing sessions with "A" group patients. Sessions
      lasting about 60 minutes will be proposed from Monday to Friday in a room planned from this
      activity within the CHU. They will be adapted and personalized according to each one.
      Evaluations will be carried out for group 1 (interventional) before the first session of
      tango at M0, before the session at M3 and at the end of the protocol at M6. The same
      evaluations will be carried out for group B (control) at M0, before first session of tango at
      M3 and at the end of the protocol.

      Assessment of pain and stress will be done before and after each session. Final assessment
      will be done at 6 months after randomization. Fitness assessment and tango sessions will be
      conducted by an argentine tango teacher
