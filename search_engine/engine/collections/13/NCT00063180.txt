      is also remote functional depression of non-lesioned areas. This functional depression,
      called diaschisis, likely contributes to the functional deficit of the patient.

      The objective of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of
      diaschisis with the integrated methods of neuroimaging (positron emission tomography (PET)
      and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS)).

      Study population: We will recruit patients with subcortical stroke in the subacute state and
      in the chronic state, and normal controls.

      Design: The stroke lesion will be the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, or
      cerebellum. The frontal cortex, including the motor cortex, is chosen as a remote area.
      Neurochemical changes in the diaschitic area will be investigated by measuring the glucose
      metabolic rate with PET, and concentrations of neurochemically important metabolites, such as
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, with H-MRS.

      Outcome measures: Metabolic change in the diaschitic areas relative to the contra-lateral
      unaffected side will be calculated as a laterality index. First, this index will be compared
      among patient groups and control group. As a second analysis, the relationship of glucose
      metabolism measured by PET and concentrations of the metabolites detected by H-MRS will be
      evaluated.
