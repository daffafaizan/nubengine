      transplantation will be included. Patients scheduled for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation will be evaluated four times; pre-transplantation, post-transplantation,
      100th day after transplantation and 1st year after transplantation. Recipients will be
      randomized into study and control groups. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programme includes
      inspiratory muscle training, upper extremity aerobic exercise, progressive resistance
      training will be performed study groups. Upper extremity aerobic exercise and progressive
      resistance training will be performed control groups. Exercise capacity, physical activity,
      pulmonary functions, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, respiratory muscle
      endurance, dyspnea and fatigue perception, depression and quality of life will be evaluated.
      Primary outcome measurements are exercise capacity and which outcome measures influence
      survival. Secondary outcomes are respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, respiratory
      muscle endurance, pulmonary functions, physical activity, dyspnea and fatigue perception,
      depression and quality of life.
