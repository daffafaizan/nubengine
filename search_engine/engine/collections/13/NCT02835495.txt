      served by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Recent lifestyle interventions have
      demonstrated that weight-loss achieved through reductions in calorie intake and increases in
      physical activity can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. The Healthy Living Partnerships
      to Prevent Diabetes (HELP PD), a community-based adaptation of the lifestyle intervention
      used in the Diabetes Prevention Program, achieved more than a 7% weight loss at 6 months.

      In HELP Vets, researchers will test the feasibility of further translating the HELP PD
      lifestyle intervention, tailored for use in the Veteran population, in the Kernersville
      Community-Based Outpatient Clinic operated by the VA. The investigators plan to recruit 50
      overweight or obese Veterans at high risk for developing diabetes from the existing patient
      population to participate in a 6-month weight loss intervention led by community health
      workers who are also Veterans. As VA outpatient clinics have the requisite infrastructure to
      identify, screen, and enroll participants and access to Veteran community health workers from
      within their patient populations, they are ideal potential homes for diabetes prevention
      programming. Data gathered during this planning grant will be used to develop a large-scale
      study to test implementing the HELP Vets intervention in a larger segment of the Veteran
      population.
