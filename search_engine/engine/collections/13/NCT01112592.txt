      function, and serves about 80% of Israel's population. Patients are referred subsequent to
      recurrent, persistent, or unusual infections and after completing preliminary screening of
      the immune system and ruling out a humoral, cellular or complement immune deficiency. Initial
      workup includes chemotaxis, superoxide production (SOP), and bactericidal activity (BA).
      Based on test findings, further evaluation for a qualitative phagocytic disorder is
      conducted. Overall, impairment of phagocytic activity is found in about 33% (impaired
      chemotaxis in 16%, SOP in 6%, and BA in 24%). In the other 67%, no impairment of the immune
      function is found that can explain their tendency for recurrent pyogenic infections.

      In 2004 a novel function of the neutrophil was identified: formation of neutrophil
      extracellular traps (NETs). Apparently, neutrophils are able to extrude part of their
      cellular contents in the form of DNA, histones and proteases, to form extra cellular NETS
      that trap and kill bacterial pathogens without the need for phagocytosis. We aim to study if
      pathological NETs formation could be the underlying pathology among these patients with
      recurrent infections and a normal screening of the immune system.
