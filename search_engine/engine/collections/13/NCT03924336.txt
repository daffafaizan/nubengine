      and growth factors have been applied and investigated as possible periodontal regenerative
      therapy.The application of platelet rich fibrin in management of intraosseous and furcation
      defects produce more favorable outcome compared to open flap debridement.

      A-PRF represents the latest generation of platelet concentrates that could provide sustained
      and increased release of growth factors and could serve as an autologous cost-effective
      membrane in periodontal tissue regeneration procedures
