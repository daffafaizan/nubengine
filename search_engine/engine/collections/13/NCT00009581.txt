      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis and acute chest
      syndrome are common complications of sickle cell anemia. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been
      proposed as a possible therapy for the acute chest syndrome. Anecdotally, NO has been
      described to rapidly improve the hypoxemia and the clinical course of the acute chest
      syndrome. Furthermore, a number of recent studies have suggested that NO may have a favorable
      impact on sickle red cells at the molecular level and could improve the abnormal
      microvascular perfusion that is characteristic of sickle cell anemia. This clinical trial is
      designed to test the hypotheses that 1) individuals with sickle cell anemia have endothelial
      dysfunction with reduced local synthesis and release of NO, that may reduce regional
      perfusion at rest and impair the vasodilator response to stress, and 2) during NO inhalation,
      delivery of NO bound to hemoglobin will be enhanced and will improve these abnormalities in
      regional vascular perfusion. Studies will be performed on untreated sickle cell anemia
      patients and on patients managed with chronic hydroxyurea therapy. Demonstration of improved
      regional perfusion with NO therapy could have significant implications for patient management
      during acute pain crisis and the acute chest syndrome.
