      rarely cured and recurs frequently after regional therapy or transplantation. Hepatic
      resection can improve 5-year recurrence-free survival by up to 25%. Micrometastases of HCC
      have been detected by molecular techniques in 88% of patients at the time of surgery, and
      probably cause postoperative recurrence. Efforts to reduce the risk of recurrence after a
      curative resection have been tried, including various regimens of adjuvant and neoadjuvant
      therapy.

      In this study , an anti-angiogenic agent, PI-88, is being used as an adjuvant therapy for HCC
      patients after curative hepatic resection. The efficacy endpoints, including tumour
      non-recurrence rate, time to first recurrence and 1-year survival rate are being evaluated.
      Several risk factors associated with tumour recurrence are also being analysed.
