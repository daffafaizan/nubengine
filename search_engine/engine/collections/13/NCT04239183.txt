      least 5 points in the StomaQoL questionnaire) among descending colostomy patients,
      establishing the following comparisons:

        1. Patients with recent surgery who after one month using a current two-piece mechanical
           device switch to the new Be1 device with capsule system versus patients who after one
           month continue to use the same current two-piece mechanical device during four months.

        2. Patients who have been using a current two-piece mechanical device during more than 6
           months after an ostomy and agree to switch to the new Be1 device with capsule system
           during four months.

      The following secondary objectives have been defined:

        -  Assessment of patient satisfaction with the new Be1 device with capsule system versus a
           current two-piece mechanical device.

        -  Demonstration that the new Be1 device with capsule system improves the microbiota of the
           colostomized patient.
