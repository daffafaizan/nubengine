      ill children with sepsis. However, whether those patients will benefit from the vitamin A
      supplementation is unknown. We design an randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multi-center trial to investigate the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the outcome of
      critically ill children with sepsis.
