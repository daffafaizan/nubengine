      study. Patients diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer with overt distant metastases and
      who will receive chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, given
      as 3-weekly cycles, will be randomly assigned to receive either lactobacilli (GefilusR) or
      placebo during the first 3 cycles of chemotherapy (for 9 weeks). Following this, the groups
      will be crossed over and those study participants who were allocated to lactobacilli will
      receive placebo for 9 weeks, and vice versa. Lactobacilli and placebo are administered twice
      daily. The total daily dose of lactobacilli is 20 billion CFU. The primary outcome measure is
      frequency of moderate/severe diarrhoea (grade 2-4). Adverse effects (including the frequency
      of diarrhoea, flatulence, bloating, constipation, and nausea) will be longitudinally
      monitored based on a patient diary and study visits. The study will also address safety and
      tolerability of chemotherapy, response to chemotherapy, progression-free survival,
      resectability of liver metastases, and serum growth factor levels. A total of 84 patients are
      planned to be entered.
