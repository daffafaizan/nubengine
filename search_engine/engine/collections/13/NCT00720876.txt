        -  To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of vorinostat and rituximab, in terms of objective
           response rate, time to progression, and survival, in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin
           lymphoma.

        -  To assess the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily on days 1-14 and rituximab IV on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
