      stimulate expression of persistent proviral HIV from resting CD4+ cells, 2) generate an
      HIV-specific immune response, and 3) when combined, clear persistent infection in
      HIV-infected participants in whom viral replication and spread is inhibited by uninterrupted
      antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      This is a phase I, single-site, pilot study intended to evaluate the association of serial
      AGS-004 vaccinations in combination with serial VOR doses on the expression of persistent
      proviral HIV, HIV-specific immune responses, and the frequency of resting CD4+T cell
      infection. Twelve participants with durable viral suppression will be enrolled. All
      participants will receive the same treatment and doses of AGS-004 and VOR and continue their
      baseline ART regimen throughout the study.
