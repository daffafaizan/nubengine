    
      ONC201 (TIC10) is a first-in-class small molecule that inactivates the Ras effector target
      kinases, Akt and ERK, selectively in tumor, but not normal, cells to safely trigger cancer
      cell death. The dual inactivation of Akt and ERK by ONC201 results in broad-spectrum
      cytotoxic activity that includes activation of TRAIL-mediated apoptotic and other downstream
      antitumor effects to produce a potent antitumor response. The safety margin (ratio of
      therapeutic dose to lowest dose with a mild adverse event) of ONC201 is at least 10-fold in
      rats and dogs in GLP toxicology. The efficacy of ONC201 has been consistently demonstrated in
      multiple in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo preclinical cancer models. Favorable attributes of
      ONC201 observed in preclinical models include antitumor efficacy with infrequent
      administration, broad-spectrum activity independent of mutations or tumor type, orally
      active, high safety margins, synergistic activity with many approved therapies, highly
      stable, highly water soluble, and ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. In the phase
      I portion of the trial, the hypothesis is that ONC201 will exhibit an acceptable safety
      profile in patients with advanced cancer. In the phase II portion of the trial, the
      hypothesis is that ONC201 will show preliminary signs of efficacy in patients with advanced
      cancer as defined by endpoints that include progression-free survival, response rate,
      biomarkers, and overall survival.
