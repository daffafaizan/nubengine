      between 20 and 60 years of age with a diagnosis of MetS, HOMA index greater than 2.5, BMI ≥30
      and ≤ 40 kg / m2 and who signed the consent letter. Patients who had any added pathology,
      pregnancy, smoking or consumed medications were excluded. Once the letter of informed consent
      was accepted, the patients were assigned to the respective treatment group. These individuals
      were advised to consume the recommended diet for subjects with MetS according to the
      guidelines of the ATPIII. Participants were randomly distributed to consume a) placebo
      treatment or b) genistein capsules (50 mg/day). The participants were followed for 2 months.
      In the previsit, informed consent letters were given, and blood samples were taken to
      evaluate glucose concentration, lipid profile, lipopolysaccharide and serum insulin. Also
      determined blood pressure, body weight, height, body composition and gut microbiota. The
      presence of insulin resistance was determined by means of the HOMA-IR index and by an oral
      glucose tolerance test. After 2 months, the same variables were assessed, and an expert
      surgeon in the operating room performed a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy, then RNA extraction
      and gene expression microarray assay was performed
