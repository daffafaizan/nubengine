    
      This study is developed in two phases: pilot phase and experimental phase. The pilot phase is
      preliminary and progressive in order to demonstrate a sufficient effect of improving the
      quality of life of patients and to be able to continue in an experimental phase with more
      investigational sites and more patients, and to evaluate other secondary objectives.

      Once the pilot phase is finished, an intermediate analysis of the results will be carried out
      to evaluate the magnitude of the variation in quality of life at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. If
      the expected success expectations are achieved and it is approved by the Ethics Committee,
      the study will continue to the experimental phase.
