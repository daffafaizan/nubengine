      with the dermatologist before having a dermatologic procedure has any effect on patient
      anxiety levels and satisfaction following the procedure. The goal of the study is to help us
      understand if pre-operative consultation is beneficial to patients to reduce anxiety and
      increase satisfaction following the procedure.
