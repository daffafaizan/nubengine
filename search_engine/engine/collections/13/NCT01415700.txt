      central nervous system's injury such as hemiplegia secondary to stroke. It aims to improve
      the patient's walking floor by removing the STEPPAGE, reducing the effort of walking,
      facilitating the flow and removing anomalies compensatory (such as the mowing of the hip).
      Its objective is to improve the patient's autonomy locomotor.
