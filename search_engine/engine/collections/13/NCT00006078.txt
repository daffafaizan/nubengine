        -  Determine any dose limiting toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose of lycopene
           administered orally as a food based delivery system in healthy male subjects 18-45 years
           of age for the chemoprevention of prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this population.

        -  Determine the dose range of this regimen to be used in the 3 month multiple dose study,
           based on the toxicity, pharmacokinetics and feasibility resulting from the present study
           in this population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive a single dose of oral lycopene in a mixture of tomato paste, water, and
      olive oil over 15 minutes on day 1. Patients are asked to maintain a diet that contains
      negligible carotinoid for 28 days.

      Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating doses of lycopene until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 5 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
