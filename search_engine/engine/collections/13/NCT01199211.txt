      occur as a physiologic response to exercise (athletic remodeling aka "athletic heart"), but
      is most frequently encountered as a pathological manifestation of cardiovascular disease. The
      early determinants of athletic remodeling in the general population are largely unknown. In
      order to longitudinally explore the early determinants of athletic remodeling, we will
      recruit from the community, physically untrained women who have volunteered to run a
      marathon. We will prospectively assess left ventricular mass and function by echocardiogram
      during three consecutive stages/visits:

        -  Baseline: prior to starting intense physical training

        -  Trained: at the end of at least 12 week training period, prior to running the marathon.

        -  Post-marathon: 6 weeks after running the marathon.

      In addition, exercise impacts lipid metabolism and short-term exercise is known to increase
      HDL levels in plasma. Human HDL is structurally heterogeneous, comprising at least sixteen
      discrete species. It has multiple functions, pertinent to cardiovascular medicine such as the
      ability to accept effluxed cholesterol from the artery wall, culminating in sterol uptake in
      the liver. This "reverse cholesterol transport pathway" is thought to prevent the
      accumulation of cholesterol in the artery wall. We will assess the clinical and genetic
      determinants of the HDL response to physical exercise.
