      metastatic breast cancer by targeting the precursors of these recurrences, bone marrow
      disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) present after definitive treatment. This trial targets unique
      mechanisms by which DTCs maintain a dormant phenotype (autophagy) and by which they escape
      dormancy (upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase4/6 (CDK4/6) pathway and
      microenvironmental factors such as immune evasion). The selection of these agents is based
      upon strong preclinical data demonstrating the relevance of autophagy (inhibited by HCQ), the
      CDK4/6 pathway (inhibited by palbociclib) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/Programmed
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint pathway (blocked by avelumab) as critical mechanisms
      of cellular and immunological tumor dormancy.

      The phase II trial is designed to provide "proof of concept" and estimates of effect of
      various combinations and durations of these therapies on bone marrow DTCs as a surrogate for
      ultimate reduction in recurrence. The correlative science aims will provide additional
      insight into the relationship between the primary tumor and both the biology of DTCs and host
      immune surveillance for target validation and development, as well as evaluate the role of
      additional biomarkers both in the bone marrow (with a novel flow-based assay), and in the
      peripheral circulation (including both circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA), to
      identify patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) and targets for intervention and
      measurement of DTC response.
