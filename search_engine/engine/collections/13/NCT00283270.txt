    
      Objectives: The aim of the study is to test if screening followed by brief problem-solving
      counselling by primary care doctors can improve the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of
      elderly patients with previously undiagnosed psychological problems. It will also find out
      the effects of undiagnosed psychological problems on HRQOL and consultation rates of elderly
      patients.

      Design, Setting & Subjects: This is a prospective single-blinded randomised controlled trial
      on 450 patients aged 60 or above attending a Government General Outpatient Clinic in Hong
      Kong, who have been screened for psychological problems.

      Methods: Elderly patients attending the General Outpatient Department of the Ap Lei Chau
      Clinic who are not known to have the diagnosis of psychological problems with the Hospital
      Anxiety & Depression Scale (HADS) were screened in order to recruit 300 subjects who are
      screened positive for undiagnosed psychological problems will be randomised into the
      counselling or no-counselling groups, and 150 subjects who are screened negative for
      psychological problems will be selected as normal controls

      Interventions: The counselling group will receive brief problem-solving counselling from a
      trained primary care doctor in addition to their usual medical care; the no-counselling group
      will receive general health education and their usual medical care; and the normal control
      group will continue with their usual care only.

      Main Outcome Measures: Health-related quality of life measured by the SF-36, the HADS scores
      and consultation rates. The baseline and changes in outcomes of the three groups will be
      compared at 0, 6, 12, 36 and 52 weeks after screening.

      Conclusions: The results will provide evidence on whether screening followed by brief
      problem-solving counselling in primary care is effective in improving quality of life and
      reducing consultation rates for the elderly with undiagnosed psychological problems.
