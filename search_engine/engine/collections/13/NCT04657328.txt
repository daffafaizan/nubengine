    
      This trial is a prospective, multi-center study .More than 900 patients will enrolled, most
      of them with CEUS,MRI and pathological follow up.With pathology as the gold standard, based
      on quantitative and qualitative analysis, Sonazoid-CEUS was compared with MRI to explore the
      diagnostic efficacy (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) of Sonazoid-CEUS for breast tumor
      in different pathological types.

      Investigators will also record the parameter information of imaging examination, pathological
      type of pathological examination and immunohistochemical index.Contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      includes lesion location, initial peak tumor volume, 1-minute tumor volume, 2-minute tumor
      volume, and 5-minute tumor volume, as well as the time for contrast enhancement, contrast
      agent clearance, and contrast agent clearance.Whether there is no enhancement area in the
      lesion after contrast enhancement, shape after contrast enhancement, edge after contrast
      enhancement, order of enhancement, uniformity of enhancement, intensity enhancement, pattern
      of enhancement, clear boundary after contrast enhancement, aspect ratio after contrast
      enhancement, etc.The magnetic field strength of the equipment is planned to be recorded in
      the enhanced MRI information, the name of the MRI contrast agent, the lesion location, the
      size of the LESION, and the scanning performance are enhanced (lump-like enhancement,
      non-lump-like enhancement, point-like enhancement), time-signal intensity enhancement curve,
      DWI signal, ADC value, etc.
