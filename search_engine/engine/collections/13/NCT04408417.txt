      safety seat with visual indication of successful tensioning technology reduces the amount of
      harness slack compared with a standard safety seat. The secondary objective of the study is
      to assess caregivers' perceptions of the quality, design, and ease of use of the prototype
      child safety seat tensioning progress indicator lights. Participants will be
      parents/caregivers aged 18 to 75 years of children between 6 and 24 months of age.
      Approximately 130 caregiver-child dyads will be enrolled. Participants will be asked to
      harness their child into two versions of a convertible child safety seat, twice in each car
      seat. The intervention seat will be equipped with the technology that gives visual indication
      of successful harness tensioning. Participants will be observed, assessed, and asked a series
      of survey questions after each harnessing period.
