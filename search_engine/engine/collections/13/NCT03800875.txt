      consequently, accurate carbohydrate counting is recommended for type 1 diabetes. Advances in
      glucose sensors have motivated the development of the closed-loop system to automatically
      regulate glucose levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes. In the closed-loop system, a
      dosing algorithm adjusts the pump insulin infusion rate based on continuous glucose sensor
      readings.

      Closed-loop system systems that are shown to alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting
      without degrading glucose control are still lacking. In this proposal, the investigators aim
      to develop a novel, fully-automated, closed-loop system that delivers insulin and pramlintide
      that controls postprandial glucose levels without any input from the user. Thus, the two
      hormones' role in the postprandial state will be as follows:

        1. Insulin: to reduce plasma glucose levels. Insulin delivery needs to be aggressive to
           counter-act fast increase in post-meal glucose levels.

        2. Pramlintide: to slow gastric emptying and aim insulin in efficiently controlling
           postprandial glucose levels.

      The aim of this study is to assess a fully automated, dual-hormone, closed-loop system that
      delivers insulin, and pramlintide to control glucose levels without degrading overall
      glycemic control compared to an insulin-alone closed-loop system with carbohydrate-matched
      boluses.

      The investigators hypothesize that the dual-hormone closed-loop system will alleviate
      carbohydrate-counting burden (fully reactive system) without degrading glucose control
      compared to the insulin-alone closed-loop system.
