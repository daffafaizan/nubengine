      plaster and acupuncture」 will be performed at Genomic Medicine Research Core Laboratory-
      GMRCL in Chung Gang Memorial Hospital. Allergic rhinitis patient will receive herbal plaster
      treatment in the first year, blood sample was attained before and after therapy. Then
      investigators use oligonucleotide chip to analyze the immunomodulatory effects of TCM in the
      treatment of allergic rhinitis. In the second year, the patient received herbal plaster and
      Acupuncture treatment in the same time.

      Many allergic rhinitis patients accept TCM treatment here in Taiwan. According to recent
      journal reports, Traditional Chinese medicine performed in accordance with the principles of
      TCM would show significant immune-modulating effects, herbal plaster is an effective, safe
      and convenient treatment for allergic rhinitis. The mechanism of its efficacy needs further
      study. This project plan to combine the experience of clinical doctor and GMRCL Microarray
      for the mechanism of herbal plaster on allergic rhinitis.

      Investigators study the effects of herbal plaster treatment for allergic rhinitis in the
      first year. And study the combine effect of herbal plaster and Acupuncture treatment in the
      second year. All patients during 18-45 years old were treated over a time period of 4 weeks.
      Patients' general well-being and several peripheral blood parameters were determined before
      and after the herbal plaster treatment. RNA was extracted from the blood and pooled into
      patient pool. Oligonucleotide chips were used to analysis the pooled RNA each year. The
      microarray analysis for the genomic change before and after the herbal plaster treatment or
      herbal plaster with Acupuncture treatment was studied .
