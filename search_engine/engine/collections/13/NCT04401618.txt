      (GI) and resin-modified glass-ionomer (RMGI) materials in Class V carious and non-carious
      cervical lesions restored by dental students. Ninety-six (96) restorations performed with
      either GI (Fuji IX) (n=39) or RMGI (Fuji II) (n=57) were evaluated using the modified USPHS
      (United States Public Health Systems) criteria by two independent investigators at two
      follow-up evaluations (two years apart). The Fisher statistical test was used to compare
      USPHS criteria and examine significant differences by setting p<0.05 for statistical
      significance and the Kaplan-Meier algorithm was used to calculate the survival probability.
