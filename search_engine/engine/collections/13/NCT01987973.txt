      arms, either (1) Partial Repair/Debridement or (2) Allograft Reconstruction.

      The patients will complete a structured clinical examination conducted by a sports medicine
      fellowship trained orthopaedic consultant, Pre-operatively and Post-operatively at 6 weeks,
      3, 6, 12, 24 months. The examination will consist of range of motion testing by goniometer as
      well as strength testing by hand dynamometer. The patient will also complete the Western
      Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) questionnaire.

      The main benefit of this procedure is that patients who have currently irreparable massive,
      chronic rotator cuff tears may acquire a means for their cuff to be repaired. This may aid in
      improving function of the shoulder, restoring ability to complete activities of daily living,
      while decreasing pain and sleep disturbances. This would allow the participant to become more
      functional after rehabilitation. It is our belief that this study could provide new
      information in helping to understand this relationship, which would in turn lead to future
      study in this area of orthopaedic surgery.
