      laparoscopic cholecystectomy have provided conflicting results. One of the factors that might
      contribute to failure of the instillation technique may be related to inadequate distribution
      of local anesthetic throughout the peritoneal surface. In contrast, nebulization should
      provide a uniform spread of drugs throughout the peritoneal cavity and thus may be beneficial
      to improve pain relief after laparoscopic procedures. A recent study reported that
      bupivacaine nebulization significantly reduced pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy
      compared with bupivacaine instillation in the gallbladder bed. However, these investigators
      used a custom-made nebulization system that needs a separate gas source and tubing that is
      cumbersome and may not be easily available.

      Recently, the investigators reported that a microvibration-based nebulization device (Aeroneb
      Pro® system, Aerogen, Galway, Ireland) could be used for ropivacaine delivery into the
      insufflation gas required to create pneumorpeitoneum. The investigators hypothesized that
      intraperitoneal ropivacaine nebulization would provide superior pain relief after
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy than intraperitoneal ropivacaine instillation. This randomized,
      double blind, controlled clinical trial was designed to assess the analgesic efficacy of
      ropivacaine nebulization using the Aeroneb Pro® device laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared
      with intraperitoneal ropivacaine instillation.
