      (above 50 micrograms/liter) through contaminated drinking water and thus suffer from
      arsenic-related health hazards called arsenicosis. Arsenic keratosis is one of the commonest
      skin manifestations of arsenicosis that occur in the palm and sole that is troublesome for
      the working people and females suffered a negative socio-economic impact.

      Two studies were conducted in the same department where topical ointment prepared from the
      crude extract of S. melongena peel was found effective in arsenical keratosis.

      The present study was conducted to confirm the previous study and identify that solasodine
      isolated from S. melongena peel is responsible for the cure of the lesions of arsenical
      keratosis. Thus, it may be possible for the chemical synthesis of solasodine, and an
      effective, inexpensive topical ointment can be prepared for the cure of arsenical keratosis.
