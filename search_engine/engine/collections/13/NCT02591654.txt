      classically by immunohistochemical evidence of increased Ki-67 expression, can be reliably
      determined in vivo using radiolabeled thymidine. The development of [18F]-fluorothymidine
      (FLT) PET has been reliably identified as a marker of cellular proliferation, and has been
      shown to identify changes in proliferation in successfully treated patients.
