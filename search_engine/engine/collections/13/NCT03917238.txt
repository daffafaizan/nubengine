      poorly understood. Further research on beta cell mass is essential to obtain more insights
      that might aid in the development of diabetes treatment. This study aims at a specific phase
      of T1D that is called the 'honeymoon phase' or period of partial remission. Once insulin
      treatment has started, the honeymoon phase will arise in most patients. In this period, T1D
      patients become temporarily less insulin-dependent. Unfortunately, the honeymoon phase is
      only temporary, in which a decline in blood glucose regulation will be seen afterwards,
      leading to an increasing demand for insulin. To increase understanding of this change in
      metabolic control after the honeymoon phase, repeated measurements of the beta cell mass and
      function are performed during and shortly after the honeymoon phase. The comparison of both
      measurements might lead to an increased understanding whether changes in insulin demand after
      the honeymoon phase is mainly dependent on a decline in the beta cell mass, or because of a
      decrease in functional beta cells. The outcome of this study can provide new insights, which
      can contribute to the development of novel treatment options.
