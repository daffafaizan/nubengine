      the mucosal visualization during colonoscopy, and consequently the quality of such
      evaluation. Undoubtedly, this can have unfavorable implications like missed lesions. One of
      the most commonly encountered scenarios is the presence of multiple bubbles that interfere
      with mucosal visualization. When this occurs, simethicone (an antifoam agent used to reduce
      bloating when ingested orally) is injected through the colonoscope to eliminate the bubbles
      and get a clear view of the mucosa. A few studies have used oral simethicone in conjunction
      with oral preparation agents (PEG, magnesium citrate, sodium phosphate) in an attempt to
      improve the quality of the preparation. Unfortunately these studies have not used the exact
      same preparation agent with and without simethicone, making it difficult to draw conclusions
      on its efficacy. However, it is important to understand that simethicone is not intended to
      decrease the amount of stool in the colon, and it's purpose is to decrease the amount of
      bubbles interfering with the visualization of the mucosa provided that there is no stool
      present . Furthermore, it is unclear if adding simethicone to a standard bowel preparation
      makes a significant difference in key aspects of screening colonoscopy such as adenoma
      detection rate or withdrawal times. This prospective randomized controlled, observer blinded
      study at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, aims at studying the effect
      of simethicone on the overall colon preparation as well as on adenoma detection rate and
      withdrawal times.
