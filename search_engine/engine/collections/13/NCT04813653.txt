    
      This phase 1, open-label, single-arm, prospective, single center study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of cyclosporine in combination with carfilzomib and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The patients
      will consist of adult men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of RRMM, who have received
      at least two prior lines of therapy including carfilzomib, and were non responsive or
      refractory to carfilzomib as specified below, and who were found to have elevated expression
      of Peptidylprolyl Isomerase A (PPIA) in scRNA sequencing of their myeloma cells, and who meet
      other protocol outlined eligibility criteria.

      The patients will be treated with cyclosporine with dose titration based on repeated
      determinations of whole blood concentrations to achieve a target trough concentration of 250
      ng/mL, in combination with carfilzomib plus dexamethasone.

      Patients may continue to receive treatment for 4 months or until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity, the earliest of them.

      Subjects will be followed for Adverse Events (AEs), clinical status-Overall response rate
      (ORR) as defined by International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, Progression Free
      Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DOR), Time to Progression (TTP), stringent Complete
      Response (sCR 0, Complete Response (CR), Very Goog Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response
      (PR), Depth of Best Response (DpR), Time To Response (TTR), Progressive Disease (PD), Overall
      Survival (OS) and laboratory parameters for up to 4 months, unless they terminate early due
      to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or due to meeting one of the withdrawal
      criteria
