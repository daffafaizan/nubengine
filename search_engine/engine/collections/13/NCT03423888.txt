    
      Pilot study for acceptability of high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in palliative care
      Population: 30 patients in palliative care (for lung cancer, terminal respiratory failure)
      who suffer from dyspnea and have oxygen therapy. Patients with curative care are excluded and
      patients who require non invasive ventilation.

      An oral consent is asked.

      Primary objective: acceptability of HNFC in patients with dyspnea in palliative care during
      one week

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Tolerance of HNFC at short term (1h and 24h) and long term (7 days) after initiation of
           HNFC

        -  Efficiency of HNFC at short term

      Primary outcome: duration of use of the HNFC during 7 days

      Secondary outcome:

        -  Tolerance: noise of the system of HNFC, side effects of high flow (nasal dryness..)

        -  Efficiency: evaluation of dyspnea by Borg scale and measure of respiratory rate and
           saturation of oxygen one hour after initiation of HNFC
