      studying peripheral blood, stool, disease status and course, and treatment of subjects with
      MG. The EXPLORE-MG Registry focuses on varied aspects of MG such as disease management,
      health care utilization, health costs, disease characteristics, and diagnostic tools. As
      such, it will aid in a broader understanding of MG, while providing a registry from which
      questions about the disease may be better answered.
