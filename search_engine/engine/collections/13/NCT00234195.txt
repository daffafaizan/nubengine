      with breast cancer who are depressed may report greater pain, poorer quality of life and
      worse overall functioning than those without depression. The study will determine whether or
      not bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XLTM) is useful in lessening the symptoms of
      depression in women with breast cancer. One reason for conducting this research with
      bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XLTM) instead of another antidepressant is because
      bupropion has a lower likelihood of causing the side effects of weight gain, sexual
      dysfunction, and fatigue, which may be important for women with breast cancer and may even
      have a beneficial effect on these symptoms.

      Bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XLâ„¢)is approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depression.
