      pharyngeal and oral axes and facilitate endotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy. There
      have been scarce clinical studies about the appropriate degree of neck flexion for
      endotracheal intubation. In the present study, the laryngeal view and physician's discomfort
      during endotracheal intubation were evaluated according to the two degrees of neck flexion(4
      cm vs 8 cm) using a 4 or 8 cm height of pillows, respectively, in adult patients.
