    
      Objective: To determine plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon-like polypeptide-1
      (GLP-1), glucose-inhibitory-polypeptide (GIP) and amino-acid responses, following
      administration of human and cow milk, either natural or with experimentally-modified casein
      and whey-protein content(s).

      Design. Young healthy volunteers of both sexes will receive iso-lactose loads (0.36 g lactose
      / kg body weight) of: natural cow milk; natural human milk; and of cow milk with modified
      casein and whey protein contents. Blood samples will be frequently collected over 4 hours.
      Plasma glucose, amino acids, insulin and incretin concentrations will be measured.
