      extending onto the cornea, most commonly on the nasal side. Management of pterygium can be
      medical, surgical or combined. Alternative treatments as photocoagulation of blood vessels of
      the pterygium, have been described, especially in recurrent pterygia.

      To determine whether Argon laser treatment reduces the symptoms and pterygium size in primary
      type I pterygia patients when compared with medical treatment. Subjects and Methods:
      Prospective, comparative and interventional study. Patients with type I pterygia in both eyes
      were included. The eyes were randomly divided to receive either Argon laser treatment or only
      topical medical treatment
