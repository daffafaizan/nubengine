      heart rhythm disturbances. Fluoroscopy is a imaging modality routinely used for the ablation
      of arrhythmias.Due to the rising concern regarding the harmful effects of radiation exposure
      to both the patients and operation staffs; three-dimensional mapping systems, including CARTO
      and Ensite NavX, have been developed and implemented in electrophysiological procedure for
      the navigation of catheters inside the heart chambers. Ensite NavX system can be used for
      zero-fluoroscopy approach for catheter ablation of arrhythmias. This study is intended to
      compare the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a zero-fluoroscopy approach using Ensite NavX
      as the only imaging modality with conventional fluoroscopic approach for the catheter
      ablation of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias; conventional fluoroscopic approach use
      fluoroscopy plus Ensite NavX or plus Carto as the imaging modality.
