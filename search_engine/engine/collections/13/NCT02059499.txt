    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% for treatment of anal high-grade
      squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) compared to observation only.

      II. To assess the efficacy of intra-anal topical 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil) 5% for
      treatment of anal HSIL compared to observation only.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical
      5-fluorouracil 5%.

      II. To compare the efficacy of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical 5-fluorouracil 5%.

      III. To assess for partial response of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% or topical 5-fluorouracil 5%
      as compared to observation only.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical 5-fluorouracil 5% on
      human papilloma virus (HPV) persistence.

      V. To evaluate anal HSIL outcomes at week 44. VI. To evaluate the effect of behavioral
      patterns including tobacco smoking and sexual activity on treatment efficacy, tolerability
      and HPV.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients apply imiquimod intra-anally once daily (QD) for 16 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients apply fluorouracil intra-anally twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive no treatment. Patients who still have HSIL at week 20 and who agree
      to randomization may cross-over to Arm A or B.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 20, 24, 26, 32, 40,
      and 44.
