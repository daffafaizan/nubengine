      Papanicolaou smear or abnormal human papillomavirus (HPV) testing whose cervical lesions are
      colposcopically identified. Generally, no anaesthesia is needed for the procedure which can
      be done on an outpatient basis.The degree of pain associated with this procedure varies from
      mild to severe and many studies suggested that pain levels are often high reaching a score of
      more than 40 points on a 100-point visual analogue scale (VAS). Tramadol hydrochloride is an
      orally active centrally acting synthetic opioid. It is an atypical analgesic with a dual
      mechanism of action: serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and modest l-opioid
      agonist. It has a lower incidence of respiratory depression, cardiac depression, side effects
      on smooth muscle and abuse potential as compared to typical opioid agents
