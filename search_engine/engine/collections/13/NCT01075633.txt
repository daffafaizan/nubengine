    
      This is an observational, controlled, randomized phase III study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the iFOBT for detecting advanced neoplasia (polyps > 1cm in size, high grade
      dysplasia or with villous component, or CRC) in first degree relatives of patients with CRC.

      Index cases will be interviewed to obtain the family tree and their first-degree relatives
      will be contacted to invite them to participate in the study. Index-cases, will be randomized
      into one of the following two groups in order that their relatives receive the same screening
      strategy: A) colonoscopy; or B) annual iFOBT test (OC-Sensor®, cut off ≥50 ng/ml) and
      colonoscopy if positive. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the iFOBT strategy,
      individuals randomized to group B will be invited to undergo a complete colonoscopy following
      two years follow-up. In addition, epidemiological data, personal history of disease, family
      history of neoplasm, characteristics of lesions at colonoscopy and histological diagnosis
      will be recorded.

      To test the hypothesis of equivalence between the iFOBT test and colonoscopy for detecting
      advanced colorectal neoplasm, it was considered a probability of participation, detection
      capability and prevalence of advanced adenomas for iFOBT of 0.750, 0.565 and 0.077,
      respectively, being the product of them 0.033. In the case of colonoscopy, the likelihood of
      participation, detection capability and prevalence of advanced adenomas in this population at
      risk are 0,500, 0.965 and 0.077, respectively, and their product 0.037. Accordingly, for a
      Type I error (alpha) of 5%, a power of 80% and a maximum deviation between the probabilities
      of the two tests of 0.03 the number of subjects to be included per arm is 744
