      degenerative scoliosis and sagittal malalignment. These surgeries remain a significant
      physiologic burden with high blood loss and long operative times. Thromboelastography
      provides a quantitative measure for blood product transfusion surrounding procedures. We aim
      to utilize thromboelastography to guide transfusions for multi-level spinal instrumentation.
      This two-arm, randomized, non-blinded prospective analysis will clarify reduced transfusion
      requirements for TEG-arm compared to non-TEG arm. We will also evaluate postoperative
      outcomes at the 1 year time-point.
