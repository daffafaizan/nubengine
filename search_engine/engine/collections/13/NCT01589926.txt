    
      Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease and is diagnosed
      by a new infiltrate on chest x-ray and one of the following: chest pain, fever, or
      respiratory signs or symptoms (tachypnea, cough, new onset hypoxemia, or increased work of
      breathing.)The treatment for acute chest syndrome is focused on supportive care with
      hydration, antibiotics, blood transfusions and respiratory support. Unfortunately, despite
      these treatments many patients fail to have improvements in their respiratory status, or have
      respiratory decompensation. These patients require more aggressive treatments, which
      frequently include exchange transfusions, pediatric intensive care unit (PCCU) management,
      and respiratory support.

      The study objective is to perform a prospective double blind randomized control trial to
      investigate if early initiation of effective BiPAP in addition to providing standard clinical
      care for ACS alters the clinical course of these patients vs. sham BiPAP and standard
      clinical care. Investigators hypothesize that participants receiving effective BiPAP will
      have milder clinical courses resulting in shorter hospital stays and fewer transfers to PCCU
      and exchange transfusions.
