      number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), capable of both homing to the bone
      marrow and regenerating a full array of hematopoietic cell lineages with early and late
      repopulating ability in a timely fashion.

      Omidubicel is a stem/progenitor cell-based product composed of ex vivo expanded allogeneic
      cells from one entire unit of umbilical cord blood. Omidubicel utilizes the small molecule
      nicotinamide (NAM), as an epigenetic approach to inhibit differentiation and to increase the
      migration, bone marrow (BM) homing and engraftment efficiency of hematopoietic progenitor
      cells (HPC) expanded in ex vivo cultures.

      The overall study objectives are to provide access to omidubicel for transplantation in
      patients with hematological malignancies and to collect additional safety and efficacy data.
