    
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer death in the UK and worldwide.
      Improving outcomes depends in part on achieving earlier diagnosis of the disease.

      The Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) is replacing the less accurate Faecal Occult Blood Test
      (FOBT) in the UK and has the potential to help achieve earlier stage diagnosis of CRC. Whilst
      FIT has been validated as a screening test for the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP),
      its role in diagnosing CRC in symptomatic populations is yet to be defined.

      Nottingham is a pioneering centre using FIT to stratify risk and determine
      first-investigation in its two-week-wait (2WW) pathway. To optimise use of FIT and minimise
      the chance of missed cancers, this project aims to better understand variation of FIT results
      over time and how certain factors affect FIT result.

      Much of the literature has focused on the evaluation of FIT in an asymptomatic population,
      which is inherently low risk (4,6,7). Expanding use of FIT to stratify risk and guide
      investigations for cancer in (higher risk) symptomatic populations necessitates a thoroughly
      evaluated testing strategy. At present there is insufficient information to advise on
      "negative" FIT results in symptomatic patients. This study will comprehensively measure FIT
      variation over time in patients with the target condition (CRC) and help answer whether
      additional samples are likely to improve accuracy of FIT.

      Risk factors for false positives and false negatives have been previously identified but are
      not widely established (4). Our study will record the presence of these risk factors, and
      evaluate their effects on FIT-positivity with subsequent statistical analysis.
