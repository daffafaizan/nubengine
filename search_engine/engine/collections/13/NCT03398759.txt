      mu-receptor antagonist activity. It is commonly used for the management of cancer,
      postoperative, gynecologic, and obstetric pain. Additionally, Butorphanol has less
      respiratory depression and sedation effects, which make it may become a good medicine to
      alleviate the agitation. However, there is no clinical evidence to confirmation of such
      effectiveness of butorphanol. The objective of present study is to explore the effectiveness
      of butorphanol in the alleviation of emergence agitation in patients undergoing Functional
      Endoscopic Sinus Surgery.
