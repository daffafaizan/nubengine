      discontinue current medications (NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor) 5-14 days prior to randomization.
      Paracetamol (acetaminophen; â‰¤2 gm/day) may be used for breakthrough pain. Other NSAIDs, COX-2
      inhibitors, opioids, and corticosteroids may not be used at any time during this study. Only
      subjects recording average WOMAC pain score of 4 to 8 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale during
      the washout period and meeting all other inclusion criteria will be randomized into the
      study.

      Male and female adults, ages 20 and older, with a history of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee
      or hip diagnosed by radiograph obtained within the past 20 years and with pain at least 3
      months from OA can participate in this study. OA must be confirmed by radiographs and
      diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines. Subjects must
      qualify as ACR global functional status I, II, or III (excluding IV) and Kellgren-Lawrence
      grade 1, 2 or 3 (excluding grade 4).

      Subjects meeting screening criteria will be randomized to receive 28 days dosing of an active
      dose of CG100649 or comparator (celecoxib).

      Antiarthritic efficacy will be evaluated by changes in the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities (WOMAC) OA index completed on Day 1 (Baseline) and on Days 14, 28 and 42. The
      WOMAC pain subscale will be evaluated at screening and on Days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42.

      All doses will be administered orally once daily in the morning. There are 3 planned
      treatment arms (2 with active compound + one comparator (celecoxib) group) with n=44 per
      treatment arm. Total number of subjects will be 132.

      Treatment A: CG100649: 2 mg/day (Days 1-28); Treatment B: CG100649: 4 mg/day (Days 1-28);
      Treatment C: celecoxib: 200 mg/day (Days 1-28); Active and comparator medications will have
      identical appearance.
