      fibrosis of the lung tissue. It is caused mainly by long-term inhalation and deposition of
      mineral dust, with varying levels of pathogenicity, into the lungs during occupational
      activities. Currently, there are a lack of effective therpy options for pneumoconiosis.
      Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) present a favorable prospect in treating pneumoconiosis.
      But the quality of the research was low. This needs to be further investigated by
      well-designed RCT to demonstrate the effect of TCM for pneumoconiosis.

      In this study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled trial was
      designed. Patients with coal worker's pneumoconiosis were randomly divided into treatment
      group and control group by central random distribution system. For the treatment group, which
      was given symptomatic treatments, patients were additionally given Chinese medicine compound
      based on TCM syndrome differentiation. For the control group, which was given symptomatic
      treatments, patients were additionally given Chinese medicine compound placebo based on TCM
      syndrome differentiation. The intervention course is 52 weeks.The Six-minute Walking Distance
      (6MWD) and the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test (CAT) score were taken
      as the primary outcomes, while the Modified British Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale
      (mMRC) score, Pulmonary function, Clinical symptoms and signs questionnaire, the Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, and the Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire
      (SF-36) score as the secondary outcomes, third-party data management and blind evaluation
      were adopted.
