      or omega-3 alone. They will take the vitamin 12 weeks, after which time they will return for
      all laboratory tests. Persons who are currently taking a supplement must undergo a 2-week
      washout period before beginning the study. Participants taking the Cooper Complete one-a-day
      vitamin plus omega-3 fatty acid will have greater improvement in homocysteine, LDL
      cholesterol, and C-reactive protein than those taking the other supplements.
