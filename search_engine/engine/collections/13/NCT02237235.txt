      when the positive symptoms have been treated. The primary goal of this study is to determine
      the effectiveness of 9 weeks of supplementation with MMFS-202-302 as augmentation of atypical
      antipsychotic medication, to improve a critical specific domain of cognitive function, i.e.,
      working memory, in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. To support this
      primary goal, global function will be assessed with the Clinical Global Impression assessment
      of change.

      The investigators will also examine the effect of MMFS-202-302 on other domains of cognition
      (e.g. attention, executive function, declarative memory, etc.); negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia; positive symptoms of schizophrenia; MRI measures of brain structure, resting
      state functional connectivity, and function during evaluation of emotional/unemotional and
      rewarding/aversive images and anticipation and receipt of reward and punishment, and working
      memory; and EEG measurement of network interactivity during learning and memory recollection.
