      patients having colorectal liver metastases. Combined with chemotherapy, the overall 5-year
      survival is 40-50%. The disease free 5-year survival is about 20%, and about 70% of resected
      patients experience recurrence from their disease. Even if surgery is superior all other
      treatments, most patients will finally die from their cancer. However; surgery contributes by
      adding years of life, and for a minority, a disease free life. There has been much effort to
      study predictors for outcome after surgery, but little has been focused on quality of life
      following this treatment.

      Method: EORTC Validated questionnaire (European Organisation Research of Treatment of Cancer)
      version QLQ-C30 (3.0) and QLQ LMC21. The patients fill out the questionnaire before surgery
      as a baseline, and then after 3,6 and 12 months after surgery. The investigators also
      register important clinicopathological data about each patient prospectively.
