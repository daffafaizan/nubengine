      potential range of clinical applications. The topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan is a
      potent DNA damaging drug. mTOR appears to enhance cancer cell survival following DNA damage,
      so it's reasonable to expect that mTOR inhibition combined with irinotecan may result in
      synergistic activity.

      This is a single arm, non-randomized phase I trial of temsirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) and
      irinotecan (a topoisomerase I inhibitor) in refractory soft tissue sarcoma patients.
      Successive groups of three patients will be entered at escalating dose levels. Irinotecan and
      temsirolimus will be administered weekly for three weeks followed by one week of rest. One
      course will therefore be four weeks. No intra-patient dose escalation will be allowed. Each
      patient will be treated until disease progression or intolerable side effects develop. Dose
      limiting toxicities will be assessed and the maximum tolerated dose will be reported.

      Note that this trial was originally designed as a phase I/II study, but only the phase I
      portion was completed and will be reported.
