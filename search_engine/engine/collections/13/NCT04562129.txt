    
      This is a Phase II study of high dose bolus interleukin-2 (HD IL2) in combination with low
      dose ipilimumab followed sequentially by nivolumab in patients with advanced inoperable stage
      III or stage IV melanoma who have failed prior anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

      The planned treatment consists of 3 courses (One cycle is 21 days and one course is 4
      cycles). HD IL2 will be given during week 1 of the 2 initial cycles or each course.
      Ipilimumab will be given concurrently at the low dose of 1 mg/kg on Day 1 of the 2 initial
      cycles of each course for up to 2 doses, total. Nivolumab will be given on Day 1 of the 3rd
      cycle of each course. No systemic treatment will be administered during the 4th cycle.
      Response assessment will occur at the end of the 4th cycle. Patients without evidence of
      disease progression (RECIST v.1.1) or limiting toxicities will be offered additional courses
      of treatment for up to a maximum of 3 courses, total
