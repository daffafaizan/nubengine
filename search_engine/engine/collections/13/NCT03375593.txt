    
      The purposes of this noninferiority randomized clinical trial are to determine whether: 1.
      the most commonly used non-narcotic analgesic (ibuprofen 600 mg + acetaminophen 500 mg)
      provides pain relief that is not unacceptably worse than the most commonly prescribed
      narcotic (hydrocodone 5 mg + acetaminophen 500 mg) in patients with a hand or wrist fracture.
      2. the following covariates affect pain outcomes: sex/gender, age, gender-related pain
      expectations, paid/unpaid work roles, comorbid health status, baseline pain intensity, and
      employment status.
