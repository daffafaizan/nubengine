    
      Specific Aim 1. To assess changes in fatigue severity (primary outcome measure) and quality
      of life, motor, cognitive and emotional functions (secondary measures) the intervention
      groups (wahls paleo plus and wahls diet group)to usual care.

      Hypothesis 1a: The Wahls Paleo plus group and the wahls diet group will both demonstrate more
      improvements in quality of life and fatigue between baseline and 12 weeks than usual care
      group.

      Hypothesis 1b. The wahls paleo plus group will demonstrate more improvement in quality of
      life and fatigue than the wahls diet group.

      Specific Aim 2. To assess changes in the blood biomarkers and endothelial function as the
      subject progresses through the study interventions.

      Hypothesis 2a: The wahls paleo plus and the wahls diet group will demonstrate more favorable
      changes in blood biomarkers obtained at baseline and week 12 than the usual care group.

      Hypothesis 2b: The wahls paleo plus group will demonstrate more favorable changes in blood
      biomarkers and quality of life than the wahls diet group experiences obtained at baseline and
      week 12.

      Hypothesis 2c: The wahls paleo plus and the wahls diet group will demonstrate more favorable
      changes in measures of endothelial function between baseline and week 12 than will be
      observed in the usual care group.

      Hypothesis 2d: The wahls paleo plus will demonstrate more favorable changes in measures of
      endothelial function between baseline and week 12 than the wahls diet group.
