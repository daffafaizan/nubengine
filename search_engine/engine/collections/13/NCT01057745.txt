      Experiments in animals and humans have tried to collect, freeze and store eggs to see if they
      can be saved for possible later use. While studies are promising, it is still uncertain
      whether such approaches will ultimately prove to be useful in practice for achieving
      pregnancy in humans. The main purpose of this study is to see whether it is possible to
      remove and store ovarian tissues by freezing. It is hoped that, in the future, frozen, stored
      ovarian tissue can be used to achieve pregnancy. Before receiving chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy, subjects will have a piece of the ovaries, or one of two ovaries, removed by
      surgery. The tissues will be frozen by a special method in an effort to prevent the eggs from
      being damaged. The majority (80%) of the tissue will be stored for potential use in case the
      patient is unable to achieve pregnancy in the future, and part of the tissue (20%) will be
      used for studying how the eggs can be grown in the laboratory.
