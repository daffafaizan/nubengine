    
      This is a single center, investigator-initiated, randomized, controlled trial to examine the
      effects of meditation on the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and the psychological
      profiles in patients with implanted cardiac defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization
      devices. The former are used to protect patients against cardiac fibrillation and the latter
      for synchronizing the contractions of the two ventricles.
