      behavior. Evidence suggests that herbal remedies may be as effective as standard drug
      therapies in treating ADHD symptoms. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of an
      herbal treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD.

      This study will last 9 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either an
      herbal product or placebo three times a day for the duration of the study. Participants will
      come in for weekly study visits at which their ADHD symptoms and any side effects will be
      assessed by self-report rating scales.
