    
      Subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer with KRAS-wildtype will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive a 2nd line treatment regimen of panitumumab plus oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine (XELOX) or XELOX alone. Before randomization tumour of all subjects will be
      analyzed to detect the KRAS mutational status. Subjects will only be randomized into these
      two arms if the tumour shows KRAS wild-type. Subjects with KRAS mutant colorectal tumours
      will receive XELOX alone. Subjects will receive treatment cycles every three weeks. Treatment
      will continue until subjects are diagnosed with disease progression or intolerable toxicity,
      at which time the subjects will be withdrawn from the treatment phase. If a subject withdraws
      from chemotherapy due to toxicity the subjects will be allowed to continue with panitumumab
      monotherapy with or without one of the chemotherapy components until disease progression.
      After withdrawing panitumumab and XELOX treatment, all subjects will end the treatment phase
      and will enter a follow-up phase until 6 months after the last patient stopped treatment
      (with a safety follow-up visit after 56 days ± 3 days and long term follow-up visits every 12
      weeks). During the treatment phase subjects will be evaluated for tumour response every 9
      weeks (± one week) through to week 45, and every 12 weeks (± two weeks) thereafter, until
      disease progression. Subjects with symptoms suggestive of disease progression should be
      evaluated for tumour response at the time symptoms occur.
