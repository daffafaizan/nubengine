      technique is very important factors affect the outcomes of AVF. Rope-ladder cannulation is
      one kind of the standard puncture techniques which is used commonly in maintenance
      hemodialysis (MHD) patients. There are many complications for rope-ladder cannulation, such
      as venous aneurysm and vascular stenosis, which may induce AVF dysfunction. For the venous
      outflow way, there always be aneurysm followed by stenoses at the sites of needle connected
      with the arterial line in rope-ladder cannulation patients. The investigators hypothesis that
      the directions of inserted arterial needles should affect the AVF outcomes. The present
      prospective study will compare the outcomes of AVF between the puncture direction at arterial
      needle sites same as blood flow and opposite to blood flow.
