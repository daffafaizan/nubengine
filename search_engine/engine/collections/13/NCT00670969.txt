           health professionals need accurate and convenient tools to help personalize weight loss
           programs. Portable indirect calorimetry measurements are more expensive than handheld
           devices and often limited to research setting only, making them impractical for clinical
           use. Additionally equations used to estimate resting metabolic rate may be significantly
           inaccurate in overweight patients. Several studies have been conducted to determine the
           accuracy of handheld devices, however none have been done in the overweight and obese
           populations. If handheld calorimeters can accurately measure resting metabolic rate in
           overweight and obese patients, these tests may be used to improve and personalize weight
           management programs.

        2. Key Objectives: To determine in a group of overweight or obese volunteers if a handheld
           indirect calorimeter can accurately measures oxygen consumption to determine resting
           metabolic rate.
