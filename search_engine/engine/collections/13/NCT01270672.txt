      euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, and norepinephrine (NE). NE
      release is thought to mediate the cardiovascular effects of MDMA and may also contribute to
      its psychostimulant effects. However, the functional role of adrenergic postsynaptic
      receptors in the cardiovascular and subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear.
      To determine the role of alpha- and beta adrenergic receptors in the response to MDMA in
      humans the investigators test the effects of the alpha- and beta-receptor blocker carvedilol
      on the physiological and subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design with four experimental sessions. Carvedilol
      or placebo will be administered 1 h before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers.
      Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the
      experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is
      that carvedilol will significantly reduce the blood pressure response to MDMA.
