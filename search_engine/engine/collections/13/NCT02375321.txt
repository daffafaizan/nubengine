      measured before and 12 weeks after the start of treatment through the administration of
      the13-item self-rated Pichot depression scale (QD2A). Each subject will be assigned to one of
      the following categories:"absence of alterations in mood" or "presence of mood disorders,"
      according to the test result (score <7 or score â‰¥7).

      The subjects in which, for whatever reason, the QD2A test after 12 weeks of treatment will
      not be available, will be considered failures, and will be assigned to the class "presence of
      mood disorders." Secondary endpoint Evaluation of adherence to CPAP treatment, considering as
      adherence the use of CPAP, during the observation period, for at least 4 hours per night.

      After 12 weeks of treatment, each patient will be classified as "adherent" or "non-adherent"
      to the treatment itself. The subjects in whom, for whatever reason, after 12 weeks of
      treatment, the total number of hours of use of CPAP will not be available, will be assigned
      to the class of "non-adherent".
