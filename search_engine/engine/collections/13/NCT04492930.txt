      feeding/eating. Time restricted eating splits the day into a period of regeneration
      (non-eating or natural fasting) and a period of nourishing. Providing the body a period of
      regeneration allows the body to go into ketosis, or the elevation in circulating ketone
      bodies, a byproduct of fat metabolism. Breath acetone concentration is a good predictor of
      ketosis and loss of body fat. In healthy individuals, low concentrations of breath acetone
      are 1 to 2 ppm. Engaging in weight loss via nutritional ketosis (engaging in high-fat,
      low-carbohydrate diets, caloric restriction diets, or fasting) increases fat utilization,
      resulting in increased formation of ketone bodies and breath acetone concentrations ranging
      from 4 to 30 ppm. In individuals with obesity, nutritional ketosis facilitates weight loss
      and improves insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and reduces inflammatory markers.

      This study will investigate the effect of participating in two different time restricted
      eating schedules for 8 weeks on body weight, blood glucose, and ketones.

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all eligible participants giving
      written informed consent will be randomized to a different time restricted eating schedule
      (ie, one group fasts for a longer period of time). In both of these groups, fasting will
      begin each evening and end the following morning.

      This is a remote study. All procedures will be conducted at home.
