      visual impairment and blindness in nearly 50 million people globally. Although geographic
      atrophy and neovascularization represent the advanced forms of AMD, neovascular AMD is the
      more aggressive form and accounts for almost 90% of blindness from this disease. It is
      characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) which is the development of abnormal
      blood vessels underneath the retina. Randomized clinical trials (MARINA, ANCHOR) have
      conclusively demonstrated that continued intravitreal therapy with Lucentis (ranibizumab) in
      patients with subfoveal CNV from AMD leads to stabilization of vision in over 90% of patients
      and improvement in vision in at least a third of the patients and has led to the approval of
      Lucentis for the treatment of neovascular AMD (see investigator brochure). This study could
      provide insight as to the reasons that some patients do not experience vision stabilization
      with Lucentis, and could possibly help physicians to determine which patients are the best
      candidates for receiving Lucentis.

      This is an open-label study of 100 treatment-na√Øve (study eye only) AMD patients treated
      on-label with intravitreally administered Lucentis. Consented, enrolled subjects will receive
      multiple open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab administered monthly for
      the first 4 months, and then as needed for a total duration of 12 months. Their blood will be
      genotyped and sequenced for various SNPs on VEGF and HTRA1.
