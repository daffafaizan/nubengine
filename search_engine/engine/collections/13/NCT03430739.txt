      will be babies with deformational plagiocephaly. Plagiocephalometric assesments will be
      utilize to follow improvement of head symmetry. Scales asking sensational integration and
      severity of plagiocephaly will also be used. Time of daily usage will be follow with daily
      asking the caregivers how long the baby wear the helmet in a day. Participants will follow
      for three months. After the follow period completed, participants will be allocated two
      groups; avarage using 15-18 hours a day and avarage using 19-23 hours a day. Results will be
      compared for the two groups and correlation between the time of usage and cranial symmetry
      will be compare.
