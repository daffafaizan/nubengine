      arrhythmia syndromes and other diseases or conditions. In order to achieve this objective the
      investigators will collect comprehensive phenotypic data and corresponding blood and/or
      tissue samples into a biorepository registry of patients, presenting for cardiac arrhythmia
      evaluation and/or treatment, and control subjects without arrhythmias. This biorepository
      will be composed of two parts: 1) An Arrhythmia Biorepository of blood and tissue from
      patients undergoing arrhythmia procedures, cardiac surgery, or inpatient or outpatient
      evaluations for arrhythmias, and 2) A Collaborative Sample Biorepository for de-identified
      samples and data from outside institutions and clinical trials.
