      imaging viable neonate and infant populations. This MR system has a smaller size and design
      features that may make it more feasible to locate the system in close proximity to care areas
      for neonates (birth - 1 month) and infants (>1 month to two years), such as clinical neonatal
      intensive care units (NICUs) and other infant and neonatal care departments.

      This is a two-phase prospective clinical study evaluating the performance and safety of the
      investigational MRI device for neonates and infants, including:

        -  Phase 1 - Initial feasibility assessment and optimization study (Phase 1) which may
           include hardware and software modifications. These studies are guided by a series of MR
           scanning procedures defined in sequential Sponsor-provided MR Procedure Documents

        -  Phase 2 - Controlled image and data collection study based on Phase 1 results, in which
           optimized scan procedure(s) according to MR Procedure Document(s) will be provided at
           the start of Phase 2 scanning and a fixed hardware and integrated software configuration
           will be applied for all subjects.
