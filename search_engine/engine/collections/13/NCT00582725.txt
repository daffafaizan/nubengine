      this regimen, to assess overall response rates, event-free survival and overall survival; and
      to assess toxicities associated with R-CHOP + GM-CSF. Patients will receive 6 to 8 cycles of
      R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), with GM-CSF.
