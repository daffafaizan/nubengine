    
      Main Objective:

      The main objective is to assess the efficacy of autologous transplantation of monocytes in
      monolayers grown on a biological substrate of amniotic membrane in the treatment of stable
      vitiligo. Using a system of digital imaging analysis the percentage of re-pigmentation
      obtained will be studied after 3, 6 and 9 months of treatment.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To demonstrate differences in efficacy (as measured by the percentage of re-pigmentation) of
      each of the 2 techniques used: pure melanocytes in suspension and amniotic membrane with
      melanocytes in monolayers.

      To assess how rapidly epithelialization occurs and the cosmetic result in the short and long
      term of the areas treated with each of the techniques.

      To assess if de-epidermization with CO2 laser may be by itself a stimulus for the reservoir
      of melanocytes in the adjacent epidermis or hair follicles or if the re-pigmentation obtained
      with this procedure is merely postinflammatory as a result of trauma to the epidermis.
