      infusion on days 1-4, prednisone orally (PO) or IV twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 5. Patients also receive inotuzumab ozogamicin IV over
      1 hour on days 8 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days then annually for up
      to 5 years.
