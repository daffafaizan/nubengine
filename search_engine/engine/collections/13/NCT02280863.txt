      approximately 4 to 5 days prior to initiation of the HCL PID-IFB system in a hotel setting
      for another 4 to 5 days. All participants with diabetes and the parent/ guardian of
      participants < 18 years of age will be asked to stay overnight in a hotel while the HCL
      PID-IFB system is on and to remain close to Stanford University during the day. For
      participants > 18 years of age, designated remote monitors will be asked to receive alerts
      for low/ high glucose levels.

      Enrolled participants will be asked to complete evaluations to describe their user
      experience/ evaluation of the system.Each participant had a companion (parent/ legal guardian
      of participants < 18 years of age, or the designate remote monitor for participants > 18
