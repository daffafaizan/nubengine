    
      Open clinical trial with 1 year follow up comparing the impact of an Early Respiratory
      Rehabilitation (ERR) program with the conventional Respiratory Rehabilitation (CRR) in COPD
      re-admitted patients. Outcomes will be exacerbations, symptoms, functional capacity and
      quality of life related to health (HRQOL). Sixty patients will be randomized into the two
      groups: ERR starts the program during admission and continues at home immediately after
      discharge for a period of 3 months; CRR was started at home one month after discharge from
      hospital and continues for 3 months. Recruitment of patients and starting the RR program will
      occur in the first year. In the second year we will continue the intervention to those who
      have not completed the year. Follow-up will last until the completion of the year of all
      patients.
