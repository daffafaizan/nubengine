      which will reflect the views of patients and physicians regarding the use of email as a
      smoking cessation intervention, and another smoker's profile in relation to Information and
      Communication Technologies (ICT), which collects information on the actual use of them in
      smokers. The result of both will help to release data on the type of participants who would
      be involved in the clinical trial.
