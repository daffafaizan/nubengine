      common. However, a orotracheal tube blindly passing through the oral cavity and oropharynx
      may easily result in oral cavity and oropharynx damages.

      The advancement of the tube from oropharynx into trachea may assist using the video stylet.

      The aim of the study is to investigate use which angulation including 45 degree, 70 degree
      and 90 degree is appropriate to assist the orotracheal tube passing the oral cavity,
      oropharynx, and advanced into the trachea.

      Patients are randomized into three groups by 45 degree, 70 degree and 90 degree to facilitate
      orotracheal tube sliding through into trachea and compared with each other group. Hemodynamic
      changes in each time interval, each time taken of tube going through the oral cavity, tube
      advanced from oropharynx into trachea will be recorded.

      The incidence of using the video stylet with different angulation to accurately place tube
      tip into trachea, intubation related side effects and complications are recorded at
      postoperative time stages.
