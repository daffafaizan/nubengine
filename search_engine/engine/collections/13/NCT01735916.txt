    
      Medtronic, Inc. is sponsoring the MIRACLE EF study, a prospective, randomized, controlled,
      double-blinded, global multi-center, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) in Heart Failure
      (HF) clinical study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate market released CRT pacemaker
      (CRT-P) devices in symptomatic HF patients with less severe left ventricular systolic
      dysfunction, specifically patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in
      the range of 36% to 50%. This study will support expansion of indications for CRT worldwide.
      The outcome of this study is expected to support modification of existing U.S. and Japanese
      labeling for Medtronic's implantable CRT-P devices and to provide further evidence to support
      changes to cardiology practice guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC guidelines) regarding the use of CRT
      in patients with mild to moderate HF.

      Following enrollment and the baseline assessment, eligible subjects will be implanted with a
      CRT-P system and randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either treatment (CRT-P ON) or control (CRT-P
      OFF) groups. Study subjects will be followed for a minimum of 24 months or until study
      closure, and will remain in their randomized groups until their 60 month visit or until the
      study is stopped, whichever comes first. The effectiveness of CRT-P in this population will
      be assessed using a composite endpoint of time to first event, with event defined as
      All-cause mortality or HF Event. To assess the safety of CRT-P in this population, the
      primary safety endpoint will measure freedom from system-related complications at 6 months
      post-implant.
