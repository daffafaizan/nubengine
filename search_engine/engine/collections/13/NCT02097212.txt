    
      Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) and HyperDynamic Airway Collapse (HDAC) are two distinct airway
      diseases that lead to airway collapse which can in turn lead to the symptoms of dyspnea,
      cough, and inability to expectorate sputum effectively. TBM entails flaccid tracheal and
      bronchial cartilages leading to airway collapse, emanating primarily from the anterior wall
      of the lumen. It is seen in conditions such as Relapsing Polychondritis and saber sheath
      tracheal deformity. HDAC on the other hand is the hyper-flaccidity of the membranous portion
      of the tracheobronchial tree leading to airway collapse. This condition is commonly seen with
      obesity and severe emphysema. TBM and HDAC frequently coexist.

      In patients with TBM/HDAC sleep disorders are common. Patients often complain of poor quality
      sleep, snoring, daytime fatigue, and somnolence. These patients are often diagnosed with
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) upon workup.
