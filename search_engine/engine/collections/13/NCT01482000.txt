    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, none-blind, controlled study to evaluate the effect of
      pulmonary daoyin therapy in moderate to very severe COPD subjects. Following a 14 day run-in
      period, approximately 464 subjects will be randomly assigned to none-blind treatment for 3
      months. The primary measure of efficacy is the Exercise Capacity (6MWD) and spirometric
      values (e.g. FEV1). Secondary efficacy measures include Dyspnea (MMRC), Quality of life
      (CAT,SF-36), frequency of exacerbations. Safety will be assessed through the collection of
      adverse events. There will be a total of 4 study visits (randomization, and after 1,2,3
      months of treatment).
