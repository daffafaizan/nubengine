      ME/CFS, the study will collect blood samples (finger stick) and information from up to 500
      subjects for analysis. In addition, urine will be collected for all subjects to evaluate the
      study subject's metabolomics.

      All participants will complete a single Study Collection event consisting of at least one MCD
      (2nd sample is optional) and one urine collection from home: 10% of each group (ME/CFS and
      Control) will complete a second Study Collection event approximately 1 to 2 weeks after the
      initial Study Collection. The second collection is to compare data between two collections
      from the same participants to observe any time-related changes in the results.
