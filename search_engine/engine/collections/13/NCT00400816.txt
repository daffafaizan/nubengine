        -  Determine progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic
           oligodendroglioma (AO) or mixed oligoastrocytoma (MOA) treated with temozolomide.

        -  Determine the response rate in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients with AO or MOA treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease type (anaplastic oligodendroglioma vs mixed oligoastrocytoma).

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before courses 1, 3, 5, and 7, every 3 months for
      the first year after completion of treatment, every 4 months for the second year, every 6
      months for the third and fourth years, and once a year thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
