    
      This study builds on the National Rural Opioids Initiative (NROI), a multi-state consortium
      studying access to care, overdose, and infectious consequences of opioid use disorder (OUD)
      in Rural America. It includes counties in rural Oregon and Appalachian Kentucky and Ohio with
      high rates of drug overdose.

      Aim 1: Conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-driven study
      retention intervention for retaining PWUD in Kentucky, Ohio, and Oregon Rural Opioid
      Initiative sites.

      Aim 2: Elicit preferences of PWUD in the Kentucky, Ohio, and Oregon Rural Opioid Initiative
      sites Aim 2a: Administer baseline survey of discrete choice experiment preferences for
      participating in clinical trials of potential medical innovations (e.g. new treatments for
      OUD, HIV, and HCV vaccination). Aim 2a will be accomplished as part of the NROI studies. The
      data will then be merged for PROUD-RÂ² analyses.

      Aim 2b: Compare participant survey preferences regarding willingness to participate in
      clinical trials at baseline, 6, and 12 months.

      Aim 3: Explore participant perceptions of clinical research participation and retention among
      PWUD in rural America.
