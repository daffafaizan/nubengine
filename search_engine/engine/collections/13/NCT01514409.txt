      low mood for over 30 years due to its ability to raise levels of neural serotonin. However,
      evidence for the efficiency of 5-HTP is limited and the mechanism of action of 5-HTP in
      offsetting low mood has not been well-characterised.

      The current study assessed the ability of 5-HTP to induce biases for positive emotional
      material in healthy volunteers, similar to those induced by serotonergic antidepressants and
      the nutritional supplement tryptophan. The effects of 5-HTP on subjective mood and depressive
      symptoms were also assessed.

      Participants were randomised to receive either 150mg of 5-HTP or placebo daily for 14 days.
      Depressive symptoms and subjective mood were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Emotional
      processing was assessed on the 15th day using a battery of emotionally valenced cognitive
      tasks.
