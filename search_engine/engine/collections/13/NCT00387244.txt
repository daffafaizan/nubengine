      anesthetic injections, ablation, surgery, implantable intraspinal infusion pumps, and spinal
      cord stimulation. For a significant number of patients, however, these treatments are
      inadequate or cannot be tolerated. Those patients require another option for pain relief.

      The therapy afforded by spinal cord stimulators is dependent on overlapping paresthesia with
      the painful areas. One of the leading reasons for explant of SCS systems (not including
      device failure or surgical complication) is the complaint of inadequate pain relief due to
      poor coverage of the painful area. Mounting evidence suggests that the clinical efficacy
      afforded by SCS varies with each manufacturer's technology. For instance,
      previously-implanted SCS patients report more complete coverage, better pain relief, and a
      more pleasant sensation associated with the paresthesia of the Precision system. The tight
      lead spacing and current fractionalization achievable with the Precision system may provide
      pain relief after failure with another SCS system.

      This study will assess pain relief with the Precision system for patients with chronic,
      intractable pain who are refractory to treatment with other types of SCS systems and/or
      implantable intraspinal infusion pumps. Because Precision allows unique programming
      combinations not possible with other systems, it is expected that subjects will enjoy
      significant pain relief.
