      placebo during one randomly selected investigational period. Randomization is conducted
      separately for males and females.

      The washout period between dosing occasions is at least 7 days. Screening takes place from
      Day -22 to Day -2. Subjects are admitted to the clinic in the afternoon of Day -1 of
      investigational period 1, 2, 3 and 4 for pre-dose assessments.

      On Day -1 of all investigational periods, subjects do not take any food or drink for at least
      10 hours before the anticipated dosing time on Day 1. For the duration of their stay in the
      clinic, subjects are not allowed to consume caffeine or other xanthine-containing drinks.

      The subjects are discharged on Day 4 of each investigational period. The End of Study Visit
      (ESV) is planned to take place 7-14 days after early discharge or after Day 4 of
      investigational period 4.
