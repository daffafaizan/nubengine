           advantages compared to previously classical approaches. However, no studies focused on
           the effects of these different surgeries on patients' perception recovery and walking
           efficiency according the initial physical fitness. Therefore, the purpose of this study
           is to compare the effects of surgical procedures on perceptual walking skills and
           efficiency according to the patients' physical fitness.

        -  Abstract : Some earlier studies report differences between surgery types in self-
           reported mobility, functional recovery and residual hip pain. The direct anterior
           approach to the hip has been suggested to have several advantages compared to previously
           popular approaches through its use of an intra-muscular and intra-nervous interval
           between the tensor fasciae latae and sartorius muscles. However, patients' physical
           fitness, postural response and perceptual walking skill relation was not taking account.
           80 patients will be tested, one before and at various times after hip surgery. In
           randomized conditions, our patients will be divided in two groups, according the surgery
           approaches and their physical fitness. All patients performed a Performance-Oriented
           Mobility Assessment Walking test with and without step and the PMA, Harris, Oxford 12
           and Womac scores will be evaluated before, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 1 year after
           the surgery. During the Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment Walking test,
           self-reported walking capacity, rating of exertion perception and walking parameters
           will be measured.
