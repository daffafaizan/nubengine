    
      This is an open label, single-arm, prospective, multi-center, uncontrolled Phase III clinical
      study to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of Omr-IgG-amâ„¢ in patients with
      primary immunodeficiency diseases.

      Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled for 16 Months:

      screening- 1 month treatment-12 months follow-up-3 months

      Subjects will be infused every 21 to 28 days according to their previous IVIG treatment
      schedule. Subjects treated every 28 days will receive 13 study IGIV infusions. Subjects
      treated every 21 days will receive 17 study IGIV infusions.

      We will record the incidence of acute infections, especially acute serious bacterial
      infections, during the year each subjet is on study.

      We will record the incidence of adverse events that occur during each infusion and up to 48
      hours after each infusion.

      At the time the study is explained to the subjects, each investigator will ask all subjects
      whose body weight is above 37 kg (or greater as defined by local standards) about their
      willingness to participate in the pharmacokinetic (PK) portion of the study. This will
      involve 4 additional visits after the 5th or 6th study IGIV infusion in order to draw blood
      samples for analysis.
