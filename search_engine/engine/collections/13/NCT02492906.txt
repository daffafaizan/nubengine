      with severe knee osteoarthrosis and chronic knee pain or healthy and non-symptomatic
      volunteers.

      The researchers performed anamnesis to collect clinical and demographic information, the
      intensity of pain was assessed by the self-rated Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the pressure
      pain threshold was evaluated with an algometer, the knee function was assessed with the
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scale and the images
      were collected with the use of the Magnetic Resonance.

      Covariates, such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI) and comorbidities as diabetes, cardiac
      diseases, pulmonary diseases, endocrine diseases and the practice of physical activities were
      also collected.
