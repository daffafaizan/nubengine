      Scanning volunteers will allow us to optimize the imaging technique by 1.) Determine the best
      combination of pulse-sequence and magnetization transfer technique to obtain the greatest
      contrast and 2.) Determine the parameters of repetition time (TR), echo time (TE) and
      magnetization transfer time and power in order to reduce overall image acquisition time while
      optimizing image quality. Honing this technique on volunteers will allow us to decrease scan
      time and potential discomfort for patients.
