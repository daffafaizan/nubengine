      Primary

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab in combination with
           temozolomide and external beam fractionated regional radiotherapy as first-line
           treatment in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma.
           (Pilot phase)

        -  To estimate the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Expansion
           phase)

      Secondary

        -  To further investigate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.
           (Expansion phase)

        -  To isolate DNA, RNA, and protein from frozen and paraffin-embedded archival tumor
           samples for evaluations, such as immunohistochemical pathway profiling of vascular
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenic pathways, gene expression
           microarray, and O-6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation
           status to define important molecular features of treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo external beam fractionated regional radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week
      for 6 weeks and receive concurrent oral temozolomide once daily for 6 weeks. Patients also
      receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks beginning on the first day of
      radiotherapy and continuing in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Beginning 2-5 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive oral temozolomide on
      days 1-5. Treatment with temozolomide repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and frozen and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples are collected for biomarker and
      genetic analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
