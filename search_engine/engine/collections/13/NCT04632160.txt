      hemodynamic evaluation. Following right heart catheterization at rest and during supine
      bicycle exercise, patients will undergo a brief intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) or
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) exam for septal suitability.

      Eligible patients continue with, fluoroscopically and echo guided transseptal puncture and
      IASD System II implant procedure. If a previously unknown protocol exclusion is discovered
      during the index procedure, and device is not implanted, participant is followed for 30 days,
      and then exits the study.

      Participants return for follow-up exams 30 days after the implant procedure and annually for
      5 years after the implant procedure. In-person visits will take place for the first 2 years.
      Telephone follow-up and medical chart review will be conducted for years 3-5.
