      in discomfort and functional deficit in individuals over the age of 35. Supraspinatus tendon
      repair surgery represents one of the most widely performed types of orthopedic operation.
      Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding tendon-to-bone healing during the postoperative
      period. Despite advancements in surgical technique, re-tear of a previously repaired
      supraspinatus tendon is a fairly common complication, especially in a larger size tear. Such
      repair technique employing suture anchor devices alone has not yet produced functional
      results demonstrating both anatomical and biomechanical properties. Therefore, tendon tissue
      engineering using a combination of scaffolds, cells, and growth factors stimulation offers a
      potential solution as a biological augmentation in tendon repair.

      Human amniotic membrane (HAM) has been widely used as a natural scaffold in tissue
      engineering due to many of its unique properties such as providing growth factors, cytokines
      and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, adequate mechanical strength, and
      biocompatibility. Whereas, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) constitute one of the adult stem
      cells that promote replacement and repair of damaged tissue along with normal tissue
      turnover. These MSCs are seeded to the HAM scaffolds to biologically augment tendon repair,
      with MSCs acting as cytokines/growth factors to stimulate tissue repair. This approach serves
      as the foundation to conduct the present study. The investigators aim to investigate the
      efficacy of using allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs and human amniotic membrane (AAdMSC-HAM)
      composite for supraspinatus tendon repair augmentation.
