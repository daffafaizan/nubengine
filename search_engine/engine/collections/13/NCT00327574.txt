      This population is likely to be particularly prone to CVD, has the poorest access to quality
      care, and is often prescribed expensive drugs by GPs.

      Screening visit: The Community Health Workers (CHW) will pay home visits to invite all
      subjects aged 5 years or over to participate in the survey. The screening would have three
      levels: 1) Household screening for subjects aged 5 years and over (n= 17,850 individuals,
      3000 households). 2) Adult screening for individuals aged 40 years or over (n= 4200
      individuals). 3) Hypertensive adults screening (n= 1860 individuals) for those identified to
      have hypertension on adult screening will be invited for re-measurement of BP to confirm
      hypertension.

      Intervention Effectiveness Study: This is a 2x2 factorial design, cluster allocation
      intervention study comparing controls with intervention by primary care GP, with or without
      health education. The main comparisons relate to the reduction of BP in a) all household
      members (aged > 5 years), and b) hypertensive adults (aged > 40 years).

      Interventions: The sample will be assigned to four intervention groups:

        -  Group A: Routine care.

        -  Group B: Routine care plus Health Education

        -  Group C: Care provided by trained GP

        -  Group D: Care provided by trained GP plus Health Education.
