      long term antiretroviral therapy. A promising approach may be the simplification of treatment
      maintenance strategies, sparing certain antiretroviral drug classes. This is a two-year
      prospective phase II/III, multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance
      of a lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy as a maintenance regimen in HIV-infected adults.
      Enrolled patients must have had stable antiretroviral treatment and HIV-1 RNA below 50 cp/mL
      over the previous 12 months, and no prior treatment failure. Provided informed consent, 420
      patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to two open-label treatment groups and receive either
      lopinavir/r 800/200mg per day or EFV/FTC/TDF 600/200/245 mg per day (fixed dose combination).
      The main objective is to assess treatment efficacy and tolerance after 2 years. In 80
      patients, repeated DEXA measurements are performed during the trial in order to evaluate
      changes in bone mineral density and in body composition.
