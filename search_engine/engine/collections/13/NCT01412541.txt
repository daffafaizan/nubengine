    
      The Moxy Drug Coated Balloon is indicated for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of
      obstructive de novo or non-stented restenotic lesions in native femoropopliteal arteries up
      to 15 cm in length and ≥4.0 to ≤6.0 mm in diameter. This study will randomize approximately
      476 patients who will receive either the Moxy balloon or standard balloon angioplasty at 55
      global investigational sites. Subjects will be blinded to treatment until 12 months and will
      participate in long term follow-up for 5 years.
