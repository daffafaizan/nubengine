      with stable heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). After completing the
      Screening period, a total of 71 subjects were randomized, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either
      placebo, 4 mg elamipretide, or 40 mg elamipretide once daily for 28 consecutive days.

      Each treatment group went through 3 distinct periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow up.
