    
      The study is designed to clinically demonstrate device acute safety and technical performance
      (Primary Endpoints) along with longer FU device safety and effectiveness evaluation
      (Secondary Endpoint).

      The main objectives of the study are:

        -  Evaluate the Acute safety of the implanted Mistral device post procedure and at 30 day
           follow up period.

        -  Evaluate the long term Safety of the device.

        -  Demonstrate effectiveness of the Mistral device in reducing TR.

      Primary endpoints:

        -  Safety: Acute safety. Rate of all SAEs including device related SAEs, all caused
           mortality, stroke, MI, cardiac tamponade, surgery for failed percutaneous repair and
           non-elective cardiovascular surgery to treat an adverse event. At discharge and 30 days.

        -  Performance: Mistral Implantation rate of technical success (defined as successful
           device implantation with grasped chords from at least two leaflets.).

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Safety: Safety at 3,6, 12 and 24 months. Rate of all SAEs including device related SAEs
           at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

        -  Effectiveness: TR reduction post-procedure, at discharge and 30 days, 3,6, 12 and 24
           months. Improved NYHA class, 6MWTdistance and KCCQ (quality of life) at 30 days, 3,6, 12
           and 24 months.
