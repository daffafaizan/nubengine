      be recruited to participate. They will give data regarding their physical exam, including
      measurements by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification exam and medical and surgical
      history. In addition, they will complete validated questionnaires including the Incontinence
      Severity Index, the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (short form) and question # 35 from the
      Epidemiology of Prolapse and Incontinence Questionnaire. All women will also complete two
      sexual health questionnaires; the Female Sexual Function Index and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse
      Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (Revised). Women will receive standard care for
      their pelvic floor disorders. They will then be recontacted to repeat the same set of
      questionnaires to determine the responsiveness of the new measure. Reliability of the
      questionnaire will be measured by having a subset of women complete the questionnaire twice;
      a factor analysis will be performed to determine the underlying factor structure. Responses
      to the other QOL measures will be compared to those to the new instrument to establish
      validity.
