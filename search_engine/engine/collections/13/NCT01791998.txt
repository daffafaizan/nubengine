      I. To evaluate the procedural success rate of using the Visualase magnetic resonance
      (MR)-guided laser system to target, access, thermally monitor, and focally ablate MR-visible
      breast cancer lesions.

      2. To obtain preliminary data on ablative success using pathologic assessment for specimen
      excised subsequent to the ablation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MR-thermal image guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) over 1
      hour.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-7 days.
