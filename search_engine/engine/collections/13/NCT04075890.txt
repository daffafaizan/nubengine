      and education-matched healthy (medically, neurologically and psychiatrically) controls for
      this project. Each participant will come for three sessions. There will be 3-4 days interval
      between sessions:

      Session 1 that includes initial clinical assessment and obtaining T1 structural image (needed
      for neuronavigation analysis and electric field modeling).

      Session 2 and 3 that include performing two separate decision-making and symptom
      provocation-avoidance tasks by participants with OCD and healthy controls under two
      conditions: while scanned inside the MRI scanner (no tDCS) or while receiving neuronavigated
      tDCS neurostimulation outside the scanner (no fMRI imaging). As participates will perform
      each task twice, there might be an order effect on task performance. For minimizing the
      impact of such a potential order effect on imaging and tDCS results, participants will be
      randomly assigned to undergo scanning in the session 2 and then receive tDCS in the session 3
      or in the opposite order (tDCS in session 2 and then imaging in session 3) but in each
      session only one of imaging or tDCS experiments (for both tasks) will be conducted for each
      participant. OCD-relevant and aversive picture rating (explained below) will be done always
      in the session 3 as the last experiment.
