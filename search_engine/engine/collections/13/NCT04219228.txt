      Asia. It is still not entirely clear whether and how visual experience in an urban
      environment with less outdoor exposure could have an impact on the development and
      progression of myopia. Zhaoqing has a relatively stable population of 4,084,600, which are
      representative of the Chinese population in term of demographic and socioeconomic
      characteristics.

      Therefore, the investigators will conduct a longitudinal cohort study in both urban and rural
      settings to examine prevalence and incidence of myopia, identify digital biomarkers
      associated with myopia, and validate algorithms for the detection and/or predition of
      incidence and progression of myopia and other ocular abnormalities in school-aged children in
      Zhaoqing.
