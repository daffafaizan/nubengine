    
      REALIZE-K is a Phase 4, multinational, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized-withdrawal, parallel-group study that includes the following 3 phases: screening,
      4-6 week open-label run-in phase where sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) and
      spironolactone will be optimized, followed by an 8-month double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized withdrawal treatment phase.

      Patients meeting the following criteria will enter the 4-6 week open-label run-in phase:
      symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); receiving an
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), or
      angiotensin receptor-Neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi); receiving no spironolactone or eplerenone,
      or receiving low-dose spironolactone (<25 mg daily); receiving a beta-blocker unless
      contraindicated; AND with hyperkalemia (sK+ 5.1-5.9 mEq/L) and an eGFR >/= 30 mL/min/1.73m2,
      OR normokalemic (sK+ 3.5-5.0 mEq/L) and 'at risk' of developing hyperkalemia (ie, history of
      hyperkalemia within the past 24 months and eGFR >/= 30 mL/min/1.73m2, or sK+ >/= 4.5 mEq/L
      and eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73m2 and/or age >75 years).

      Patients who are normokalemic on SZC and receiving spironolactone >/= 25 mg daily at the end
      of the open-label run-in phase will enter the 8-month double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized withdrawal treatment phase.
