      common world wide. Drug treatment is often necessary to achieve adequate blood pressure
      reduction but blood pressure control in studied countries is unsatisfactory low. Reasons for
      failure in treatment are several. Among others reasons intolerable side-effects may prevent
      successful treatment irrespective of the number of drugs.

      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) constitutes no risk of interaction with
      pharmacological agents and previous studies have reported blood pressure reduction.
