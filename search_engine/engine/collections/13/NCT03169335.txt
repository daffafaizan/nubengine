      study. It is planned to enroll 512 treatment-naïve patients with non-squamous non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects are randomized into the QL1101 combined with
      paclitaxel/carboplatin or Avastin® combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment group by a
      ratio of 1:1, and stratified by age (≥65 years, <65 years), sex (male, female) and EGFR
      subtype (sensitive mutation type, wild type).
