      Although a fluorescent imaging technique using indocyanine green has recently been developed
      for hepatobiliary surgery, limitations in its application for real-time navigation persist. A
      nove augmented reality surgery navigation system (ARSNS) can be combined with indocyanine
      green Fluorescence imaging to guide the surgery real-time.
