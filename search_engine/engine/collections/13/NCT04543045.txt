    
      This is a non-interventional study using interviews to explore head and neck cancer patients'
      experience of preparing for and completing radiotherapy utilising an immobilisation mask.

      The study will be conducted in 2 stages:

      The first stage is Item generation. Approximately 20 interviews will be conducted with head
      and neck cancer patients who have completed or partially completed radiotherapy. The
      interviews will capture their experiences and views pertaining to mould making, scans and
      radiotherapy, reported associated fear of restriction, suffocation, loss of control and fear
      of public embarrassment during treatment.

      The data from the interviews will be used to develop potential items for a screening tool for
      identification of those patients likely to experience anxiety and claustrophobia before they
      start their treatment.

      The second stage is cognitive interviews. Approximately 5 patients included in Stage I will
      be invited to take part in a further interview to review the themes and potential
      questionnaire items identified from interviews.
