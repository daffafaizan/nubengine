      vaginal hysterectomy for non-prolapse benign conditions (6) and pelvic organ prolapse (6).
      Samples of tissues will be divided and portions will be snap-frozen, placed into transport
      medium for subsequent tissue digestion, and receive paraffin processing. Cells in transport
      medium will be transported to the Mayo Collaborative Research building (lab of Dr. David
      Lott) for isolation of fibroblasts and adipose derived stem cells.

      The other samples will be transported to the lab of Dr. Andre van Wijnen (RST) to isolate RNA
      and protein for mRNA, microRNA and additional protein analysis.

      Isolated fibroblasts and ASC's from the lab of Dr. Lott (MCA) will be expanded and passaged
      3-5 times. ASCs phenotype will be confirmed by flow cytometry. Cells lines will be duplicated
      and biobanked at the Mayo Clinic Rochester Biotrust and separately biobanked at the Arizona
      State University lab of scaffold collaborator, Dr. Stephen Massia. Additional frozen cell
      lines will transported to the lab of Dr. Andre van Wijnen for further processing. . All cells
      and materials will be used for testing and to advance the science of regenerative medicine.
      No biobanked cells or materials from this specific project will be used for any future
      intervention or treatment in humans.
