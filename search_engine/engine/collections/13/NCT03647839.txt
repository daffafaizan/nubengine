    
      This is an open-label, multicentre, parallel phase II study designed to assess the efficacy
      of the combination of nivolumab and BNC105 and the combination of nivolumab and BBI-608.
      Patients with microsatellite stable adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin that is not
      resectable are eligible and will be randomised in the ratio of 1:1 using permuted block
      randomisation with stratification by screening ECOG performance status (0 or 1) to receive
      either nivolumab and BNC105 or nivolumab and BBI-608.

      The expected sample size is 90 patients over a 24 month recruitment period.
