      from the center of the tumor. Adjacent healthy skin was biopsied as a control
      (intraindividual control). miRNA expression profiles of specimen were detected by microarray
      miRNA expression profiling. Microarray results were confirmed by TaqMan real-time
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
