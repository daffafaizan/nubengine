      smoking cessation in adolescents. The guiding design philosophy was to model the adult
      smoking cessation literature (allowing for indirect comparisons of efficacy in different
      populations) while fine-tuning some elements specifically geared for adolescents. After
      assessment and inclusion into the study, participants will be randomized to receive a 12-week
      double blind course of varenicline or placebo. Participants will provide smoking self-report
      (cigarettes per day) throughout the study. Biological confirmation with carbon monoxide
      breathalyzer will occur at all visits, and urine cotinine measurement will occur at key time
      points (baseline, end of treatment and final post-treatment follow-up). Psychiatric/medical
      visits will occur weekly throughout active treatment to systematically monitor safety and
      tolerability. After the 12-week treatment course, participants will return for 3
      post-treatment follow-up visits (Week 13, Week 18, and Week 26).
