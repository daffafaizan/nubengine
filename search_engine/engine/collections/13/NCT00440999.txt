      anti-malarials in terms of efficacy and lower propensity to resistance. Pyronaridine
      artesunate is a new ACT in development to treat acute uncomplicated malaria. Pyronaridine and
      artesunate are antimalarial agents with a history of clinical use both separately and in
      combination with other drugs. Each drug has powerful blood schizonticidal actions. The aim of
      a fixed dose combination of pyronaridine and artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated
      acute malaria is to provide rapid reduction in parasitemia with once-daily three-day regimen,
      thereby improving compliance and reducing the risk of recrudescence through the slower
      elimination of pyronaridine.Importantly, there is a need for new drugs that are efficacious
      against both P. falciparum and P. vivax, because in areas where both species exist and health
      systems are undersourced, it is often not possible to distinguish between the two species at
      the initial diagnosis.
