      hyperplasia (CAH) from a fatal to a chronic lifelong disease. Long-term treatment, in
      particular the chronic (over-)treatment with glucocorticoids, may have an adverse effect on
      the cardiovascular risk profile in adult CAH patients. The objective of this study was to
      evaluate the cardiovascular risk profile of adult CAH patients.

      DESIGN: Case control study Primary objective : detection of cardiovascular damage in patients
      with classical or non classical CAH diagnosed in childhood. The patients will be compared
      with age- and gender- and tobacco status- matched control.

      Secondary objective Study of microvascular function Evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors
      Total cumulative (TCG) and total average (TAG) glucocorticoid doses will be calculated from
      pediatric and adult files and correlated to arterial macro- and microcirculatory dysfunction.

      Primary outcome Ultrasound evaluation of intima-media thickness at common carotids, carotid
      bulbs and left ventricular function Secondary outcome Peripheral and central blood pressure
      Skin capillary density and pulse-wave velocity Glucose and insulin during an oral glucose
      tolerance test Circulating cardiovascular risk markers (hsCRP, adiponectin, Interleukin-6)
      Lipid profile Anthropometry, fat and lean mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
      Total cumulative dose of glucocorticoid Number of subjects : 90 patients/90 controls
