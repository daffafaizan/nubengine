      with single fetus monitored by the Hospital Healthcare Network, to investigate by serial
      transvaginal ultrasound performed between gestation weeks 16 (0 day to 7 days) and 24 (0 day
      to 7 days) those patients who have a cervical length between 10 mm and 25 mm, and/or women
      with a single fetus and cervical length â‰¥10 mm presenting one or more of the following risk
      factors:

        1. preterm birth prior to 35 (34 weeks and 6 days) weeks of gestation;

        2. premature rupture of membranes prior to 35 (34 and 6 days) weeks of gestation.

      After insertion of the pessary or beginning of the administration with vaginal progesterone
      capsules and until 28 weeks of gestation, participants in the 3 treatment groups will be
      monitored every 4 weeks at the most or more often, if the site has established so as a
      control standard. After 28 weeks, patients should be monitored every 2 weeks.

      The proportions of spontaneous preterm delivery before gestation weeks 32 and 34 will be
      compared between the control group and the 2 groups with the pessaries containing different
      doses of progesterone.
