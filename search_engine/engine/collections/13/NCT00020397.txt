        -  Determine whether an immunologic response can be obtained after administration of ESO-1
           peptide vaccine comprising class I , II, or both peptides in HLA-A*201 or HLA-DPB1*04
           positive patients with refractory metastatic melanoma expressing ESO-1.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this vaccine in these patients.

        -  Determine whether prior immunization with this vaccine results in increased clinical
           responsiveness in patients treated with interleukin-2.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to HLA type.

        -  Group 1 (HLA-A*201 and HLA-DPB1*04 positive): Patients receive ESO-1 peptide vaccine
           comprising class I (ESO-1:157-165 [165V]) and class II (ESO-1:161-180) peptides
           subcutaneously once every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group 2 (HLA-A*201 positive and HLA-DPB1*04 negative):Patients receive ESO-1 peptide
           vaccine as in group I comprising class I peptide only.

        -  Group 3 (HLA-A*201 negative and HLA-DPB1*04 positive):Patients receive ESO-1 peptide
           vaccine as in group I comprising class II peptide only.

      Patients who develop disease progression discontinue vaccinations and receive high-dose
      interleukin (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 4 days (maximum of 12 doses).
      Treatment with IL-2 repeats every 10-14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression (after at least 2 courses) or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who have stable disease or a mixed or partial response to vaccination or IL-2
      therapy may be eligible for additional vaccine therapy. Patients who have a complete response
      to vaccine therapy are eligible for 1 additional treatment.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-90 patients (15-30 per treatment group) will be accrued for
      this study within 1 year.
