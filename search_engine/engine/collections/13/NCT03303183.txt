      impression material. To use the silicone impression for a hearing aid manufacturing process
      the geometry of the impression is needed. Modern processes scan the silicone ear impression
      with specific scanners. Afterwards the digitalized ear impression is uploaded in the modeling
      software for further proceed. A new ear impression technique is now provided with the direct
      ear scanner technology. The direct ear scanner can create a digital scan of the outer ear and
      ear canal. The scan than can directly transferred to the modeling software. The research
      question of this study is to determine the scan quality of the direct ear scanner concerning
      consistency, accuracy and reliability and to compare the data to common silicone ear
      impressions.
