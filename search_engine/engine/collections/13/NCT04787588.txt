      expression of TSLP. Two cohorts will be used. Cohort One will include 100 hospitalized
      patients with Covid-19, and 100 hospitalized patients without Covid-19. Cohort 2 will include
      mild/moderate asthmatics and healthy controls with bio-banked biopsy material used from
      donors who have previously consented for samples to be used for future research.
