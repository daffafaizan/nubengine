      chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) may retard CKD
      progression. Dual pharmacological blockade of the RAAS with ACEI and ARB is recommended as a
      standard renoprotective management at least in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD.
      However, neither ACEI nor ARB, even in high doses or in concomitant usage, abrogate the
      progression of CKD completely. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with CKD off
      dialysis. Additional statin (Atorvastatin) pathway may prove to be such beneficial
      therapeutic concept.Given these facts additional administration of statin to combination
      treatment with ACEI and ARB, may provide additional renal protection. To shed more light on
      this issue, we performed a randomised open controlled study to evaluate the influence of
      triple therapy with ACEI and/orARB and statin on surrogate markers of kidney injury, i.e.
      proteinuria, markers of tubular involvement and kidney fibrosis.
