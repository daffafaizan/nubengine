      patients admitting to intensive care units with a diagnosis of sepsis. The sepsis is defined
      by the quick SOFA score. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes
      included stroke, myocardial infarction, amputation, and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

      We plan to enroll 150 patients. Patients will be grouped into patients with PAD and patients
      without PAD. We then compare them in the following parameters: clinical data, laboratory
      data, survival and other outcome data. Two-sample student's t-tests will be used for the
      comparisons of continuous variables. Chi-square test will be used to detect the difference
      between categorical variables. The difference is considered statistically significant if P <
      0.05. All statistics works were analyzed using the SPSS 17.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA), R
      software (Gimc packages).
