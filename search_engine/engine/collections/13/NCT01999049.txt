      single-center study. The purpose of this current study is how it affects people's visual
      function and activities of daily living and to collect additional data on Argus II users in
      order to monitor the System's safety. In addition, data about the long-term reliability of
      the System will be gathered.

      The Argus II retinal implant will be surgical implanted into patients who are blind but the
      surgical procedure is not a part of this observational study. Our hypothesis is that the
      visual results in our hands will be comparable to those reported in the FDA study. We will
      use the results of this study to plan future enhancements to the service and to explore the
      use of the device for other blinding conditions.
