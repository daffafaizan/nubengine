      that cannot adequately address the challenges of chronic care management. While medical
      training has increasingly included chronic care management, quality care necessitates
      education approaches that go farther. In April 2005, the Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC
      implemented a weekly Diabetes Shared Medical Appointment (SMA). Results indicate that SMAs
      are sustained and, as such, SMAs offer an important opportunity to improve chronic care and a
      unique setting for training physicians. SMAs offer the potential to provide training in
      crucial skills that have to date remained less amendable to traditional educational
      practices. In order to equip physicians with resources to effectively and efficiently manage
      chronic care, the ways in which SMA experiences are processed and integrated into learning
      about interdisciplinary approaches and expanding trainees' understanding of chronic care
      issues need to be examined. Without addressing this gap, it is not possible to develop a
      comprehensive care model that links education and patient outcomes for chronic conditions,
      such as diabetes. Building on previous pilot work, we continued to address evaluating and
      validating instruments. The proposed pilot project included using a think-aloud protocol to
      evaluate and validate new items and scales assessing interdisciplinary team and chronic
      care/diabetes beliefs, and evaluating and adjusting direct observation coding tools for
      chronic condition care.
