      superior to the plastic stent in previous studies. However, there are few studies comparing
      the two methods in patients with malignant hilar biliary obstruction. In contrast to the
      distal common bile duct obstruction, the advantage of plastic stents over SEMSs exists, and
      plastic stents are used commonly in real clinical practice.
