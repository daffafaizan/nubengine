      young adults, causing damage to the supporting apparatus of the teeth, leading to rapid bone
      resorption and tooth loss. Its clinical features have been shown to result from several
      genetic and environmental factors.

      This has increased the interest to research those genetic host factors as they may provide
      useful risk markers, reveal important information regarding the pathogenesis and also
      identification of effective preventive agents that might help decrease the disease burden.

      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3,apart from these traditional calcium-related actions, this active
      form is being increasingly recognized for its potent anti-proliferative, anti-differentiative
      and immunomodulatory activities.

      The calcitriol activity is largely mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) whose expression
      has been described in some tissues. VDR is localized in both the cytosol and nucleus and
      accumulates in the nucleus in response to 1,25,dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding.

      Expression and nuclear activation of the VDR are necessary for the effects of vitamin D.
      Thus, alterations in the vitamin D pathway lead to disturbances in mineral metabolism. It may
      be hypothesized that the rapid bone loss which occurs in aggressive periodontitis patients
      may be due to decreased or absence of expression of Vitamin D receptor in the nucleus.
