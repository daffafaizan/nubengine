      potent regulator of energy metabolism by promoting insulin production and adiponectin
      synthesis and decreasing fat stores.UcOC has a potential role in the physiopathology of
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common disorder defined by the constellation of
      anovulation, insulinresistance, hyperinsulinemia, obesity and androgen excess.Circulating
      ucOC concentration is related to key endocrine PCOS characteristics in a weight-dependent
      manner. Within the bone-pancreas loop, high ucOC may favor insulin release in lean
      hyperandrogenic women to compensate for impaired insulin sensitivity.We will investigate
      serum uc-OC responses to insulin sensitizing therapies in lean hyperandrogenic polycystic
      ovary syndrome (PCOS).
