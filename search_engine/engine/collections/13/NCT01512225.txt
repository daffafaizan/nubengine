      assisted ventilation, surfactant, antenatal corticosteroids) have greatly enhanced the
      survival rate of very low birth weight and extremely low birth weight infants. A compelling
      body of evidence now exists to suggest that use of breast milk to feed preterm infants during
      initial hospitalization positively impacts their neurodevelopment during early childhood and
      beyond. In order to provide breastmilk, mothers of preterm infants have to begin to produce
      and mechanically express milk. However, these mothers are often faced with challenges in
      maintaining an adequate volume that will meet their infants' nutritional needs, as well as
      declines in production after several weeks despite a myriad of measures designed to assist in
      production. The primary hypothesis for this study is that Domperidone, through its
      pharmacologic action on increasing prolactin levels, will assist mothers experiencing
      inadequate breast milk production in increasing breast milk volumes to a level identified as
      being sufficient for continued pumping in the hospitalization period.
