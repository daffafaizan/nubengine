      treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Spain.

      Etoricoxib is a marketed product indicated for the relief of symptomatic osteoarthritis,
      rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, pain and signs of inflammation associated with
      acute gouty arthritis. In ankylosing spondylitis,the recommended dose is 90 mg once daily.

      Clinical pharmacology studies demonstrate that Etoricoxib induce dose-dependent inhibition of
      COX-2 without inhibit COX-1, up to 150 mg daily dose.

      Etoricoxib did not inhibit the gastric synthesis of prostaglandin and had no effect on
      platelet function. Cyclooxygenase is responsible for the prostaglandin synthesis. Were
      identified two different isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2. It has been shown that
      COX-2 is the major enzyme responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators involved in
      pain, inflammation and fever.
