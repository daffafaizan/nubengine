      generally have a prognosis similar to patients who are clinically or radiologically
      classified as having Stage IV disease. Similar, although fewer, observations have been made
      in patients with pancreatic cancer. If identified prior to scheduled resection, an extensive
      operation may not be required. The purpose of this pilot trial is to investigate the ability
      of a quantitative RT-PCR assay to detect cancer cells in peritoneal washings of patients
      undergoing laparoscopy for gastric or pancreatic cancer. This assay may detect mRNA overly
      expressed in gastric or pancreatic cancer patients with malignant cells in the peritoneum
      which cannot be detected by less sensitive means. Results of this assay will be compared to
      cytology results, as detected by standard Papanicolaou staining, during routine laparoscopic
      peritoneal washings in the absence of visible M1 disease. We anticipate enrolling 50 gastric
      cancer patients and 50 pancreatic cancer patients who will be undergoing laparoscopy as part
      of their initial management. We plan to enroll 30 patients undergoing laparoscopy for a
      presumed benign condition (e.g., gallstones, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
      [BSO]) as negative controls. We estimate accrual will take approximately 12 months. Once this
      assay is established with this pilot study, we plan to evaluate prospectively the incidence,
      predictors, and clinical significance of positive cytology, as detected by standard
      Papanicolaou stainingand RT-PCR of tumor markers. This study does not conflict with any
      existing protocol at Memorial Hospital.
