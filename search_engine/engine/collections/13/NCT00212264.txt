      and durability of conservative therapies for persistent post-prostatectomy urinary
      incontinence in a prospective, controlled, randomized trial comparing an 8-week,
      multi-component behavioral training program (pelvic floor muscle exercises, self-monitoring
      with bladder diaries, regular office visits, bladder control techniques, and fluid
      management) to the same program with the addition of biofeedback and pelvic muscle electrical
      stimulation.

      The second purpose of the study is to examine and compare the cost-effectiveness of the
      8-week, multi-component behavioral training program to the same program with the addition of
      biofeedback and pelvic floor electrical stimulation.

      Prostate cancer is the most common internal cancer in men in the United States. The most
      common treatment for early disease is radical prostatectomy, the removal of the prostate
      gland. The two most common sequelae of prostatectomy are incontinence and erectile
      dysfunction. The incontinence improves and often resolves in the first year after
      prostatectomy, but surveys of patients show that 40% of men have incontinence severe enough
      to require pads 1 and 2 years after their surgery. There are currently no randomized,
      controlled studies of non-surgical treatments for persistent post-prostatectomy incontinence.
