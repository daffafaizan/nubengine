      Osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease mineral-bone disorder (CKD-MBD) are risk factors for
      skeletal fractures. However, most CKD patients did not have data of bone mineral density
      before the recommendation of KDIGO guideline. The correlation of the CKD-MBD and osteoporosis
      was not fully elucidated. Also, the effect of a multifaceted intervention on those having
      both diseases was less studied.

      Aims: To observe the clinical outcomes and the trends of biochemistry laboratory data before
      and after the multifaceted intervention Method: Sixty subjects with CKD stage 3-4, and eGFR
      >20 mL/min/1.73m2 and high risk of fracture (FRAX screening: risk of hip fracture (HF) and
      major osteoporotic fracture (HF: men>6%, women >7%; MOF: men>15%, women>12.5%) are enrolled.

      Subjects received CKD-MBD and osteoporosis-related assessments, treatments, consultation on
      diet, medications, exercise. Followed assessments and interventions are conducted every 3
      months.

      Primary outcomes include one-year mortality, cardiovascular events, subsequent fracture, and
      fall events during the one-year intervention.

      Secondary outcomes include trends of biochemistry laboratory data before and after
      interventions.
