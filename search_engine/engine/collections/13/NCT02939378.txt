      proteins can lead to ketogenic metabolism and might limit energy production in tumor cells
      and inhibit tumor growth.

      In a pilot of recurrent glioblastoma, ketogenic diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given
      as interventional group and standard diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given as control
      group.

      The study examines whether a ketogenic diet adjunctive to salvage chemotherapy can be applied
      to the patients and may inhibit tumor growth and influence the quality of life of the
      patients.
