      sun protection and dilute bleach baths might decrease the chances or the severity of skin
      changes that occur during treatment for brain tumors.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive a study treatment regimen that involves a daily sun protection,
      daily gentle skin care and every-other-day dilute bleach baths for the duration of the study.

      Participants enrolled in this study, will be in this research study during the course of
      their anti-cancer treatment and receive skin examinations and complete a survey about their
      skin condition at the initial visit when anti-cancer treatment is started, at six weeks after
      the start of anti-cancer treatment, and at twelve weeks after the start of anti-cancer
      treatment.

      Participants will be followed for twelve weeks.

      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.
