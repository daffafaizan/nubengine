      due to damage and death of photoreceptors. One of the mechanisms causing damage is high
      levels of oxygen in the eye. This damage produces specific biomarkers which can be measured.
      In this study, these biomarkers will be assessed in people with Retinitis Pigmentosa and
      compared to controls.
