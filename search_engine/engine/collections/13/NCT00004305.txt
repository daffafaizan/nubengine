      Participants undergo qualitative genetic analysis of complement-related proteins. Studies
      include: genomic re-arrangement of 4-gene unit, C4 DNA sequence and RNA expression, type-1
      complement receptor DNA sequence, Fc-gamma receptor IIIA isoform analysis, classical and
      alternative complement activation pathway assays, plasma C4 and C4d protein levels, and
      immunoglobulin patterns in glomerular deposits.
