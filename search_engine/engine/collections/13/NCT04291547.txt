      18 making depression one of the leading causes of illness and disability in young people.
      Although receiving effective treatment is important, as few as 35% of young people seek help,
      with treatment-related issues (e.g. stigma, negative attitudes about help-seeking,
      accessibility, reluctance to engage one-to-one with a therapist, etc) outlined as reasons for
      this. Computerised therapies, which have increased availability and accessibility, reduced
      stigma and can be delivered in a format attractive to many young people may avoid some of
      these barriers and provide a more effective treatment option for young people.

      Behavioural Activation (BA) - a type of talking therapy focused on increasing liked
      activities has demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression in adults and, owing to
      this, is an evidence-based treatment for depression within NICE (2009) guidelines. Despite
      this, less research has examined its use with young people.

      We have developed BALM (Behavioural Activation for Low Mood), an online BA programme designed
      for use with young people experiencing mild to moderate low mood or depression. The
      development of BALM was based upon the findings of a systematic review and a series of
      qualitative interviews and focus groups with young people and healthcare professionals.

      Eligible young people will be referred to the programme via healthcare professionals working
      in local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and mental health practitioners based in
      local secondary schools.

      The findings of this research will allow us to refine the intervention and the research
      methods we employ in preparation for a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new
      treatment.
