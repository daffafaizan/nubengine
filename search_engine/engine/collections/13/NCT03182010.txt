      the depth of cesarean section scar defect after uterine incision closure with barbed or
      conventional sutures. Primigravida patients undergoing transverse lower segment cesarean
      section will be included in the study.Cesarean section incision will be closed with double
      layers of continuous barbed or conventional sutures. Ultrasound examination will be performed
      6 months after the operation to measure the residual myometrial thickness and the scar depth.
