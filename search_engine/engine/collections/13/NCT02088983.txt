    
      -  A sample of 40 patients will be recruited from the Champlain First Episode Psychosis
           Program, a service of The Ottawa Hospital, which is run in conjunction with the
           Schizophrenia Program of the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Center.

        -  In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study,
           participants will attend the laboratory for four test sessions and will receive either a
           single dose of CDP-choline (500 mg, 1000 mg or 2000 mg) or placebo at each test session

        -  EEG recordings (with a focus on the P50 ERP) and cognitive testing measures will be
           collected in each test session to determine any possible gating or cognitive effects of
           CDP-choline. A saliva sample will also be collected to determine any genetic differences
           in the effects of CDP-choline

        -  The investigators carefully engineered study aims to assess the optimal dosing of a
           nicotinic cholinergic agonist, CDP-choline to increase P50 suppression and cognitive
           efficacy in an early schizophrenia population with abnormal P50 suppression.
