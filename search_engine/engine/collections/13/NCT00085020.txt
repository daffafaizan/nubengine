      Primary

        -  Determine the optimally tolerated regimen of GW572016 when administered with trastuzumab
           (Herceptin^®) in patients with metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2/neu.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of GW572016.

      Patients receive oral GW572016 once daily on days 1-28 and trastuzumab (Herceptin^®) IV over
      90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of GW572016 until the optimally tolerated
      regimen (OTR) is determined. The OTR is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the OTR is determined, 10-18 additional
      patients are entered and treated at the OTR.

      Patients are followed at 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
