    
      LX201 was a novel sustained-release silicone implant containing 30% cyclosporine A by weight.
      LX201 is intended for surgical episcleral placement in the eye.

      The study was a Phase 2/3, multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group,
      dose-ranging study of LX201 for prevention of corneal allograft rejection or graft failure in
      subjects who have had one or more rejection episodes following penetrating keratoplasty.

      After Visit 12 (Week 52), subjects in the USA and India with the implant in the study eye
      were to be followed for safety at least once per year for a 2 year period or until time of
      implant removal. In Germany, the implant was to be removed at Week 52 with a 3-month safety
      follow-up period after removal.
