      I. To establish the MTD and toxicity profile of oral capecitabine in combination with q 2
      weekly intravenous oxaliplatin in patients with advanced malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of capecitabine at the recommended phase II
      dose for combinations of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin, as well
      as for the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

      II. To observe for and record any antitumor activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV on
      days 1 and 15. Patients also receive oral capecitabine every 8 hours on days 1-2 and 15-16.
      Leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil administration is held at dose level 4 and above. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
