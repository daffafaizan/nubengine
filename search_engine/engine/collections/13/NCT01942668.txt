    
      Postmenopausal subjects with an intact uterus who meet the study entry criteria will be
      randomized to one of five treatment arms (four active and one placebo) and followed for 12
      months. During the Screening period all subjects will be provided with a diary to self-assess
      the frequency and severity of their vasomotor symptoms. Subjects experiencing a minimum daily
      frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will participate in a VMS
      Substudy during the first 12 weeks of treatment. The Substudy subjects will be stratified by
      treatment arm within the sites, and only Substudy subjects have the possibility of being
      randomized to placebo. Subjects who qualify for the study except for experiencing a minimum
      daily frequency of ≥7 (or ≥50 per week) moderate to severe hot flushes will be stratified
      within sites to one of the four active treatment arms and followed for 12 months, but will
      not participate in the VMS Substudy. (However, VMS information will be collected from all
      subjects during the first 12 weeks of treatment.) All Study Subjects: Postmenopausal women
      with an intact uterus who seek relief from hot flushes and meet all other inclusion/exclusion
      criteria are eligible for 12 months of study treatment.

      VMS Substudy Subjects: A subset of All Study Subjects who have ≥7 per day or ≥50 per week
      moderate to severe hot flushes (as determined during Screening) are eligible for the 12-week
      VMS Substudy and for a total of 12 months of study treatment.
