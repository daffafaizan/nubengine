      clinically. Therefore, it is most desirable to begin a neuroprotective therapy before or
      during this premanifest period with the aim of delaying onset, as well as slowing functional
      decline. Cellular energy depletion is present early in HD and can be ameliorated by creatine,
      which helps regenerate cellular ATP. Preclinical evidence for creatine's potential
      neuroprotective effects in animal models of HD has been well-documented. Before the clinical
      efficacy of creatine can be tested in premanifest HD, its long-term safety and tolerability
      must be assessed in these individuals and its ability to favorably modify biomarkers of HD
      should also be confirmed. This extension trial will continue to follow eligible individuals
      who completed the Pre-CREST-X extension study on open-label creatine (up to 30 grams daily)
      for long term safety and tolerability for an additional 24 months. Other biological and
      imaging biomarkers of disease progression and potential response to treatment will also be
      assessed.
