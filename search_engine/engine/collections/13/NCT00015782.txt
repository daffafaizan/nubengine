      Mucolipidosis type IV (ML-IV), is a developmental and degenerative disease caused by
      mutations in the MCOLN1 gene leading to an absent or dysfunctional protein called mucolipin.
      The goal of this protocol is to assess the neurological and medical status of these patients
      and characterize the clinical and laboratory abnormalities in order to determine the natural
      history of the disease. Patients will be followed at least yearly with comprehensive
      clinical, neurological and ophthalmological examinations combined with neuropsychological,
      blood, urine and radiological tests.
