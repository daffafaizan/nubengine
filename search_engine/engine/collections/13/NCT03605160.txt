      can cause after cataract, affecting visual quality and increasing the medical cost for
      further laser posterior capsulotomy. However, conventional polish is inconvenient and
      time-consuming. We use an innovative fluid-jet method to remove RLFs, and compare the
      efficacy of fluid-jet and polish to prevent posterior capsular opacity after
      phacoemulsification.

      Design: Single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study Subjects of study:
      Age-related cataract patients receiving phacoemulsification from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center,
      Guangzhou, China.

      Methods: patients are 1: 1 randomized to two groups. Polish group: After irrigation and
      aspiration (I/A), the RLFs on the posterior capsule are removed by polishing before
      intraocular lens (IOL) implantation; Fluid-jet group: Polish is not performed. RLFs on
      posterior capsule are removed by jetting fluid with an irrigating syringe after IOL
      implantation. The posterior capsular images of all the patients are obtained immediately
      before and after IOL implantation, and at the end of surgery, then the amount of RLFs is
      quantitatively analyzed by using LYZ-PCO, a software we developed. Best corrected visual
      acuity and parameters of visual quality, such as objective scattering index(OSI), Strehl
      ratio (SR) and Modulation Transfer Function (Mtf)-cut off are evaluated by objective visual
      quality analyser (OQAS) at 1 day, 1 week and 1 year after surgery. The patients receives
      telephone follow-up every month. The severity of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) and
      incidence of laser posterior capsulotomy is recorded.

      Main indicators for the study: The incidence of laser posterior capsulotomy a year after
      surgery.
