      conducted at the I.H. Asper Clinical Research Institute in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The study will
      be divided into 2 groups of 24 healthy volunteers each. In Group 1, eligible participants who
      have provided consent will be asked to attend 6 clinic visits in a fasted state. Participants
      will be given white bread at their first and last visits, peas with rice at 3 visits and rice
      at 1 visit. At each visit participants will provide 7 blood samples via finger poke, 6
      questionnaires about their appetite and a questionnaire about the acceptability of the test
      food. Each visit will last approximately 2.5h and be separated by 3-10 days. Group 2 will
      undergo the exact same study procedures as group 1, but rice will be replaced with potato.
