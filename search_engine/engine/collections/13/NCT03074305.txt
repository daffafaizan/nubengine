      percutaneous coronary intervention for coronary artery disease. Although 2nd generation
      drug-eluting stent (DES) has enhanced the efficacy and safety of DES, However, along with the
      widespread use of this newer generation DES in most clinical conditions, including high-risk
      patients with more complicated lesion profiles, ISR has continued to be a major concern, even
      in the era of newer generation DES. In this regards, the concept of BRS has introduced and
      has showed promising results. Nevertheless, previous reports showed that even BRS has not
      been free from restenosis, leading target lesion revascularization up to 7.4% during 3-year
      follow up. Currently, previous researches which comparedsafety and efficacy of treatment
      options for ISR lesion showed similar clinical outcomes following 2 representative options,
      namely, drug-eluting balloon or drug-eluting stent. In this regards, current European Society
      of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) guidelines
      recommend drug-eluting balloon (DEB) and 2nd generation DES as class IA recommendations for
      the treatment of BMS or DES-ISR. However, all the previous reports evaluated the ISR of
      metallic stents, and there has been no evidence for treatment option for BRS ISR.

      Therefore, the Smart Angioplasty Research Team: Safety and Efficacy of Drug-Eluting Balloon
      versus 2nd Generation Drug-Eluting Stent in Treatment of In-Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold
      Restenosis (SMART-BRS-ISR) trial will randomly allocate patients with BRS ISR into DEB or 2nd
      generation DES and compare safety and efficacy of both treatment options.
