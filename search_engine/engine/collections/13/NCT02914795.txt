      included into the study the morning after the index event. Patients get dual platelet
      inhibition at the discretion of the interventionist. Patients are treated with therapeutic
      hypothermia according to the local Standard operating procedure for 24h and rewarming is
      performed within an additional 20h. Platelet function is measured every morning and Aspirin
      mediated as well as P2Y12 (purinergic G protein-coupled receptors-12)-inhibition mediated
      platelet function inhibition is recorded. All relevant clinical data including APACHE (Acute
      Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) and SOFA ( Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
      score) scores are collected.

      The degree of platelet inhibition over time (7 days) and differences between the three drugs
      tested will be evaluated by optical aggregometry and by using the commercial VerifyNow test
      system.
