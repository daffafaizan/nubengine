      training-controlled, 6-session (over 2 weeks) clinical trial of opioid approach bias
      modification (OABM) in 20 male and female veterans with chronic pain at high risk for
      opioid-related adverse events at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System,
      between ages 18-69. The study consists of screening, 2-week cognitive training, Week-3
      post-assessment. Assessment of the neurobiological mechanisms of opioid approach bias will be
      administered at baseline and Week-3.
