    
      Approximately 56 healthy volunteers will be enrolled at 1 study center in the Netherlands for
      Parts 1 and 2, and approximately 39 subjects will be enrolled at up to 6 sites in Central and
      Eastern Europe for Part 3. Dose escalations in Parts 1 and 2 will be driven by an assessment
      of the safety profile. Review of safety and PK parameters may inform decisions to add cohorts
      with intermediate dose levels in order to reach an optimal target exposure.
