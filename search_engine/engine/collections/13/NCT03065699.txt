      Device in Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) patients and will compare the outcome with
      patients treated under standard of care (SOC).

      The hypothesis is that DIALIVE will significantly improve the prognosis of ACLF patients by
      modulating systemic inflammation.

      The target patient population are men and women ≥18 years, ≤81yr. Patients with ACLF grade 1
      and ACLF grade 2 on the background of alcoholic cirrhosis. During the study, inclusion
      criteria were expanded to include also AKI-1 and ACLF 3a patients. Treatment will be
      undertaken in an intensive care (ICU) or renal dialysis unit setting if the patients are
      randomised to the DIALIVE treatment arm. For patients randomised to the 'Standard of care'
      arm, the location of treatment (ICU or general ward) will be determined by their clinical
      need and will be decided by the site Principal Investigator.

      innovation programme under grant agreement No 733057.
