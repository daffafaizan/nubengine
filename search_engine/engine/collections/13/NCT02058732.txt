      cord and brain microstructure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) patients who have had a
      stem cell transplant compared to ALS patients who have not had a stem cell transplant.
      Investigators intend to determine cervical spinal cord chemical concentrations and cervical
      spinal cord and brain microstructure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) patients who have
      had a stem cell transplant and compare these to corresponding measures in amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis(ALS) patients who have not had a stem cell transplant.
