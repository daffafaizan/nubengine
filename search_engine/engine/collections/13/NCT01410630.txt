    
      -Primary Objective

      Investigate whether the PPV of FLT-PET/CT is significantly higher than that of FDG-PET/CT by
      following up patients for at least 24 months post-therapy or until evidence of persistent
      disease/disease progression.

      -Secondary Objectives

      Investigate whether the event free survival (EFS) of patients with FDG-PET/CT-positive and
      FLT-PET/CT negative scans is not significantly lower than that of patients with concordantly
      negative FDG-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT scans and that the NPV or FLT-PET/CT is similar to that of
      FDG-PET/CT

      Correlate interim FLT-PET/CT and FDG-PET/CT with the International Prognostic Index (IPI), a
      well-established predictor of outcome in DLBCL, to determine their independent prognostic
      value from the IPI
