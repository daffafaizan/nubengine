      dose (180 mg) ticagrelor, the second group were prescribed with 90 mg ticagrelor. We measured
      both platelet activity and platelet reactivity using the LTA at baseline, pre-operation and
      post-operation. All bleeding or dyspnea events were recorded in hospital period.

      Primary endpoints: platelet activity, platelet reactivity using the LTA and safety events
      were recorded in hospital period.
