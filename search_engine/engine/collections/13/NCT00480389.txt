      twice daily given for 12 weeks preoperatively in patients with advanced metastatic kidney
      cancer scheduled for cytoreductive surgery. Patients will be fully staged for disease
      progression with Brain MRI, CT, whole body Bone Scans, Kidney ultrasound and biopsy.
      Additionally, patients' cardiac status will be evaluated pre-enrolment with an ECG and MUGA
      Scan. Once enrolled into the study, patients will have clinic visits on weeks 2, 8 and 12 for
      monitoring visits with vital signs and adverse event recording plus blood evaluations for
      hematology and chemistry. Patients will be called on weeks 3,5,6,7,9,10 and 11 to determine
      any changes in health status. Surgery will occur at week 13, after a one week washout from
      study drug. Patients will resume on study drug 6 weeks post operatively (or later, if wound
      is not completely healed). Patients will continue on study drug and will be monitored every 4
      weeks until disease progression, as determined by bone imaging and CT.
