    
      Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that has been shown to be effective in both the core
      PTSD symptoms and psychotic symptoms associated with combat-induced PTSD in males. Case
      series have shown that risperidone is possibly effective in monotherapy or adjunctively in
      treating PTSD patients. However, risperidone has never been tested in women with severe PTSD.
      Thus, we propose extending and expanding this research to another antipsychotic, risperidone,
      in a cohort of women who suffer PTSD as a consequence of domestic violence and/or rape
      trauma.
