    
      With the objective of using vocal biomarkers for diagnosis, risk prediction/stratification
      and remote monitoring of various clinical outcomes and symptoms, there is a major need to
      develop surveys where audio data and clinical, epidemiological and patient-reported outcomes
      data are collected simultaneously.

      The objectives of CoLive Voice are:

        -  To launch an international anonymized survey where vocal recordings are associated with
           large validated clinical and epidemiological data, in the context of various chronic
           diseases or frequent health symptoms in the general population

        -  To extract audio features and train supervised machine learning models to identify key
           candidate vocal biomarkers of the aforementioned chronic conditions or related symptoms.

      Participants will be recruited online and will complete the survey using a web application.

      They will first answer a detailed questionnaire on their health status and then do 5
      different voice records:

        1. read a 30 sec prespecified text (from the Human Rights Declaration),

        2. sustain voicing the vowel /aaaaaa/ as long and as steady as they can at a comfortable
           loudness

        3. cough 3 times

        4. breath in and out deeply 3 times

        5. Count from 1 to 20 at a normal speed

      Vocal records will be pre-processed and converted into features, meaning the most dominating
      and discriminating characteristics of a vocal signal. Following the selection of features,
      machine or deep learning algorithms will be trained to automatically predict or classify the
      clinical, medical or epidemiological outcomes of interest, from vocal features alone or in
      combination with other health-related data.
