    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicentre study in
      patients with Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) and mid-range Ejection
      Fraction (HRmrEF). The study will be conducted at approximately 15 sites in 5 countries (USA,
      Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands). Patients suitable for the study will be checked for
      eligibility, signing the informed consent and enrolled to the study at visit 1. The study
      will be divided into two parts, Part A and Part B. In part A 37 patients will be randomized
      at visit 2 in a 2:1 ratio to once daily dosing of AZD4831 or matching placebo for
      approximately 90 days. After approximately 30 days of treatment, an interim analysis will be
      done to analyse the safety, tolerability and target engagement. After the evaluation, the
      randomization to Part B may proceed. In Part B the approximate 59 remaining patients will be
      randomized and treated for approximately 90 days.
