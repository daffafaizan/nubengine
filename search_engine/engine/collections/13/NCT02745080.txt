    
      The total maximum study duration, including the screening period was up to 76 weeks.

      At Baseline, patients whose eligibility was confirmed were randomized to 1 of 2 groups (1:1):
      Group 1 (secukinumab 300 mg) or Group 2 (adalimumab 40 mg).

      In order to maintain the blind, both groups received 1 or 2 placebo s.c. injections to keep
      consistency in the number of injections at each dosing visit. Secukinumab (300 mg) was
      available in 2 x 1.0 mL pre-filled syringes (PFS) and adalimumab was available in 1 x 0.4 mL
      PFS. Placebo (1.0 and 0.5 mL PFS) was also available.

      Secukinumab 300 mg s.c injection (2 x 1 mL PFS) was administered at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3
      and 4, followed by dosing every 4 weeks to Week 48.

      Adalimumab 40 mg (1 x 0.4 mL PFS) was administered at Baseline followed by dosing every 2
      weeks until Week 50.
