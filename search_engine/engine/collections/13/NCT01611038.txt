      that change throughout the day, including body temperature, sleep, hunger, activity, hormone
      levels, etc. The circadian rhythm of the body is controlled by the amount of light that
      enters our eyes, so on our planet the length of the rhythm is 24 hours long. It is therefore
      reasonable to suspect that upsetting the timing of the rhythm would lead to changes in body
      function (as commonly experienced in "jet lag") and that prolonged changes might even lead to
      alterations in bodily functions and contribute to disease. This suggests that people whose
      service to the community that requires that they often work at night (nurses, doctors,
      police, hospital staff, firefighters, airline crews, factory workers, etc), might be at
      elevated risk of developing diseases. Studies have shown that women who do shift work have an
      elevated risk of breast cancer, probably as a result of altered hormone levels and cycling.
      Other studies have shown that vitamin supplementation with a naturally occurring dietary
      amino acid called organic selenium (i.e., methylselenocysteine) can restore this disrupted
      rhythm and possibly decrease this disease risk. Thus, the purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether taking daily selenium (i.e., methylselenocysteine) will restore the
      disrupted circadian rhythm in shift workers.
