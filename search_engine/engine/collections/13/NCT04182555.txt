      color calibration card placed on their chest. This makes it possible to measure the skin
      color precisely regardless of the specific light source that is used to illuminate the
      newborn. The measured skin color is then compared with items in a database of simulated
      newborn skin colors. These simulated newborn skin colors have been created using numerical
      simulations of how light moves through skin, with varying skin parameters including, but not
      limited to, skin thickness, blood concentration, melanin, and of course bilirubin, the
      pigment that causes jaundice. By comparing the measured skin color with the simulated skin
      colors that are most similar to it, the investigators can then estimate the bilirubin
      concentration in the newborn's skin by e.g. averaging the bilirubin concentrations used to
      create these simulated skin colors.

      In a group of 200 newborns with varying degree of jaundice, correlation between smartphone
      bilirubin estimates will be compared with total serum bilirubin and standard transcutaneous
      bilirubinometry.
