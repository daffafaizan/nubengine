      esophageal cancer will be recruited from the Mackay Memorial Hospital. All tests will be
      performed at baseline (prior to cancer treatment), weekly during treatment, prior to surgery,
      and one month after surgery. Tests will include demographic data collection, respiratory
      muscle performance (maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure tests combined with
      diaphragmatic surface electromyography, and pulmonary functional test), dyspnea, and the
      functional exercise test (6-min walk test).Repeated measure ANOVA will be used for analyzing
      difference of parameters among various time points.
