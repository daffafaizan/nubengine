      the morphologic and histologic similarities between pancreatic cancer and biliary tract
      adenocarcinoma, nab-Paclitaxel may be a promising regimen, and S-1 has been approved for
      biliary tract cancer in Japan. Untreated patients with advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma
      will receive Nab-paclitaxel 120 mg/m2 (D1, D8, q3w) and S-1 (40mg BID for body surface
      area<1.25 m2; 50mg BID for body surface area of 1.25-1.5 m2; and 60mg BID for body surface
      area>1.5 m2; D1-14, q3w) as the first-line treatment. The investigators will investigate the
      efficacy and safety of the combination treatment, and expect to provide a more effective
      treatment plan for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer in China.The primary endpoint
      is objective response rate(ORR), and the secondary endpoints are progression-free
      survival(PFS), overall survival(OS) and the safety.
