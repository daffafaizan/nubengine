      non-antibiotic prophylaxis for postmenopausal women on vaginal estrogen therapy (VET) with a
      history of symptomatic, culture-proven recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) by means of a
      randomized, controlled trial. Recurrent urinary tract infections have a significant impact on
      patient health, quality of life, and finances (personal and societal).

      The most common uropathogen for both acute and recurrent UTIs is Escherichia coli.

      Historically, patients with rUTI have been placed on long-term prophylactic antibiotics to
      prevent recurrence. Long term antibiotic use can lead to antibiotic resistance, collateral
      damage to normal flora, and organ damage, such as pulmonary and hepatic toxicity with
      long-term nitrofurantoin use. There is an increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance of
      uropathogenic E. coli and other uropathogens. Antibiotic resistance and its consequences have
      resulted in a need for non-antibiotic prophylaxis regimens.

      A growing body of literature supports the use of vaginal estrogen therapy as a first-line
      non-antibiotic UTI prevention strategy in postmenopausal women. While VET has been shown to
      significantly reduce the risk of rUTIs, some women continue to have rUTIs. Other
      non-antibiotic strategies have been utilized including D-mannose, a nutraceutical. Three
      prior studies examined D-mannose as an isolated therapy with promising results, but in our
      experience, a multimodal approach has often been needed. Therefore, additional studies, such
      as this proposed research, are needed to determine the potential additive effect of a
      nutraceutical as a non-antibiotic prophylaxis for postmenopausal women using vaginal estrogen
      therapy.
