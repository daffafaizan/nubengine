    
      SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) screening
      and a biopsy for biomarker screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be
      taken during leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA203 product.

      MANUFACTURING: IMA203 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

      TREATMENT: Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will occur in the days
      before the IMA203 product infusion to improve the duration of time that IMA203 product stays
      in the body. The patient will be admitted to the hospital during the T-cell infusion.

      After the IMA203 product infusion, a low dose of IL-2 will be given subcutaneously twice
      daily for 14 days.

      In group 2, atezolizumab will be administered every 4 weeks.

      Patients will be monitored closely throughout the study. The treatment and observation phase
      ends 3 years post infusion.
