      for two days after the ERCP, in an attempt to reduce the risk of pancreatitis caused by ERCP.
      Pancreatitis, or injury and inflammation of the pancreas, is the most common complication of
      ERCP and occurs in approximately 6 out of every 100 patients undergoing ERCP. It may result
      in pain and lead to hospitalization and, in some cases, a need for further procedures such as
      surgery.

      Aprepitant is a medication that is currently used to prevent nausea and vomiting in some
      patients caused by chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer. It is also approved for the
      prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting. There is theoretical evidence from animal
      studies that the way in which Aprepitant works in the body may prevent pancreatitis.
