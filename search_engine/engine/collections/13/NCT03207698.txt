      various materials has been investigated in addition to access therapy. Platelet-rich fibrin
      (PRF) having concentrated growth factors and cytokines and Metformin (MF), an efficacious
      member of biguanide group are known to enhance periodontal regeneration. The aim of the
      present trial is to evaluate the efficacy of PRF with 1% MF in treatment of mandibular class
      II furcation defects and its comparison to PRF and access therapy alone.

      Methods: This randomized trial was conducted on 75 patients with mandibular class II
      furcation defects. Defects were surgically treated with either access therapy alone (Group
      1), access therapy+PRF (Group 2), and access therapy+ PRF+1% MF (Group 3). Clinical
      parameters like probing depth (PD), relative clinical attachment level {vertical (RVCAL) and
      horizontal (RHCAL)}, modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI) and site specific plaque index
      (PI) were evaluated at baseline and 9 months post-operatively. Radiological assessment of
      bone defect fill was done at baseline and 9 months.
