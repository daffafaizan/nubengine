    
      Patients on waiting list for treatment at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for back,
      neck and shoulder rehabilitation, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Norway,
      due to low back and/or neck pain are the target group for this study. The average waiting
      time for receiving treatment is 8-10 weeks. The use of digital solutions can be a beneficial
      approach to support self-management during the waiting period. Therefore, the effectiveness
      of these tools in this patients group needs to be evaluated.

      A total of 279 participants will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of the three
      groups: 1) the selfBACK app in addition to usual care; 2) the e-Help webpage in addition to
      usual care; and 3) usual care only. Participants who receive either the selfBACK app and the
      e-Help webpage will be allowed to seek care, treatment or help elsewhere as usual.

      Self-reported outcome measures will be collected through web-based questionnaires at three
      follow-up time points: 1) 6 weeks; 2) 3 months (primary endpoint); and 3) 6 months. In
      addition, participants receiving the selfBACK app will be asked a set of weekly tailoring
      questions to individualize self-management plans. Objective registry based data linked to
      social security number in Norway will be used to investigate health care consumption and
      sickness absence at 1 year (and up to 5 years).
