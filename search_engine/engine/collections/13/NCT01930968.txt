      to undergo enucleation of their eye for the tumor. Definity®, a perflutren containing
      microsphere manufactured by Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc., is commercially available and FDA
      approved for cardiac imaging. It is contraindicated for use in patients with pulmonary
      hypertension, unstable cardiopulmonary conditions, and cardiac shunts (right-to-left,
      bi-directional, or transient right-to left). After informed consent is obtained, a
      cardiologist will examine the patient's history, perform lung and heart auscultation, and
      obtain a blood pressure in order to ensure the patient has no contraindications to using
      Definity®. If there are no contraindications, routine ocular ultrasonography, both A and B
      scans, will be performed using an Ellex Eye Cubed ultrasound machine. Definity® will be
      prepared per package instructions and the appropriate dose will be calculated. If necessary,
      a second 10 microliter/kg dose may be give 30 minutes after the first IV injection. A bubble
      test (intravenous small amount of Definity injected with cardiac echo) will be performed in
      the cardiology imaging suite, clinical building A, in order to ensure that the patient does
      not have a right to left shunt. After that, Definity® will be administered as a slow IV bolus
      followed by a normal saline 10cc flush. The ultrasonographer will continue the ocular B scan
      during administration of Definity®. Vital signs will be obtained and documented at 30 minutes
      after administration of the last dose of Definity® and longer if needed.
