      groups, including hyaluronic acid group and hyaluronic acid combined dextrose group.

      The hyaluronic acid group will receive 3 times of hyaluronic acid injection per week in three
      weeks; the hyaluronic acid combined dextrose group will receive 3 times of hyaluronic acid
      combined dextrose injection per week in three weeks.

      The pain, physical activity, and functional performance will be evaluated.

      All the evaluations will be re-evaluated at one week after injection, one month after
      injection, three months after injection, and six month after injection.

      Subjects and the evaluator will be both blinded to the group's classification during the
      whole course of study.
