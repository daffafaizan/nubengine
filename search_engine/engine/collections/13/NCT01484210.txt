      similarity of plasma concentration-time behavior of parent drug in assessing bioequivalence.

      For this reason, a pharmacodynamic study was designed in order to assess the therapeutic
      equivalence of the new formulation of Fluticasone/Salmeterol with the innovative one. The
      test and reference Fluticasone/Salmeterol formulations will be compared in terms of their
      bronchodilator effects in lung function. Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) will be
      the primary efficacy measure and will be measured in such a way that a similar time-dependent
      increase in pulmonary function can be demonstrated for both Fluticasone/Salmeterol
      formulations in patients with asthma. In terms of safety comparison, repeated measurements of
      adverse events, vital signs, heart rate, blood hematology and biochemistry as well as ECG
      changes will enable the establishment of the similar safety profile of the test and reference
      Fluticasone/Salmeterol combinations.
