      nerve is formed when fibers that overlay the retina come together. This layer is called the
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL).

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a machine that scans eyes and has the capability of
      measuring thickness of various layers in the retina and RNFL. This provides important
      anatomical information.

      VEP (visual evoked potential) is an imaging system that measures electrical signals from the
      eye to the brain by using electrodes placed on the forehead and back of head. This is similar
      in principal to an electrocardiogram of the heart.

      Visual field testing is done to evaluate the extent of side vision loss caused by various
      diseases of the eye, including glaucoma. This testing is performed as you stare at a small
      light directly in front of your eye while lights flash one at a time in every direction on a
      screen surrounding the central light. You push a button each time you see a flash out of the
      corner of your eye.

      Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye has been shown to result in reversal of
      glaucoma changes of the optic nerve in some patients. It has also been suggested that
      improvement in function (visual field) has been associated with improved optic nerve
      appearance.

      This study seeks to provide evidence for reversal of disc appearance and visual function
      following IOP lowering interventions.
