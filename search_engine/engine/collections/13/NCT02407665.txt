      will undergo Tai Chi intervention twice weekly for 12 weeks of practice. fMRI resting state
      and brain structure data will be collected before and after treatment. For the healthy
      control group, the fMRI and structure data will only be collected once, contemporaneous with
      the 12 week scan for the fibromyalgia patients.

      The primary outcome will be rsFC of rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a key region in
      descending pain modulatory system (DPMS). The secondary outcome include change of the
      cortical thickness changes, fibromyalgia symptom severity, widespread pain index, depression,
      stress/anxiety, sleep quality, and quality of life. Covariates include age, gender, body mass
      index, disease duration, depression, and comorbidities. Clinical outcome measurements will be
      collected at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention for the fibromyalgia cohort and at a
      single visit for the healthy controls. The Tai Chi classes will be taught at Tufts Medical
      Center and the fMRI scans will be performed at Massachusetts General Hospital Martinos
      Center.

      The project will advance science in the field of mind-body medicine for chronic pain
      management, both mechanistically and clinically.
