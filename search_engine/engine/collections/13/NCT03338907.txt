      endotracheal intubation patients will be managed by the study team to perform the
      intervention and the measurements.

      According to randomization, investigational medical product (IMP) or comparator will be
      administrated by ventilator 1/ventilator 2.

      At time point 1 apnea will be performed by disconnecting the ventilator from the endotracheal
      tube until the NIRS value has dropped by 20% from baseline. After that, re-ventilation will
      be resumed immediately, until parameters have returned to baseline.

      During apnea time NIRS and vital signs will be recorded permanently, blood samples will be
      drawn at definite time points.

      Application of IMP (or comparator) will be performed in this cross-over study design in the
      same manner after the baseline level is reached again.

      At the end of the study procedure, after the baseline level of end-expiratory CO2 is reached
      again, patient will be taken over by the clinical anesthesia team and surgeons.
