      available, Internet web-based videoconferencing platform to deliver routine schedules of
      counseling in an opioid agonist treatment program. It has outstanding potential to help
      determine transportability of this technology to other treatment programs by demonstrating
      the benefits of integration of web-based therapy with on-site services to expand the
      continuum of care.
