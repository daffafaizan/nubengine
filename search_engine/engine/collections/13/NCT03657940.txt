      receive normal outpatient care, which includes physical rehabilitation when needed.

      Intervention group (training) The intervention will consist of a multicomponent exercise
      training programme -VIVIFRAIL-(A Practical Guide for Prescribing a Multi-Component Physical
      Training Program to prevent weakness and falls in People over 70, Showed in
      www.vivifrail.com), which will be composed of supervised progressive resistance training,
      balance-training, flexibility and cardiovascular for 7 days/week. During the training period,
      patients will be trained between 2 and 120 minutes each day.

      The supervised multicomponent exercise training programme will be comprised of upper and
      lower body strengthening exercises, tailored to the individual's functional capacity, using
      dumbbells aiming for 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions at an intensity of 30-50% of 1RM combined
      with balance-training, flexibility and gait exercises that progressed in difficulty. The
      resistance exercises focused on the major upper and lower limb muscles. During the
      progressive resistance training, instruction will be provided to the participants to perform
      the exercises at a high velocity of motion. However, care will be taken to ensure that
      exercises were executed with correct form. Balance and gait training exercises that
      progressed in difficulty will be also implemented: e.g. semitandem foot standing, line
      walking, stepping practice, walking with small obstacles, proprioceptive exercises, and
      altering the base of support and weight transfer from one leg to the other. An experienced
      physical trainer will carefully explain all the exercises. Participants and their carer /
      family members will be carefully familiarized with the training procedures in advance.
