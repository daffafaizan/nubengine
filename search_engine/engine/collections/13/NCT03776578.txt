      and survival rates, but the treatments often result in dysphagia (a difficulty in swallowing)
      as a side effect. Swallowing function is affected by the tumor itself, surgical resection of
      the lesion and neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. It is well accepted that pre-treatment
      swallow function is indicative of post-treatment status and is helpful in identifying
      patients with high risk of aspiration and dysphagia. In recent years, the concept of "use it,
      or lose it" has been widely advocated by specialists. Preventive swallowing rehabilitation
      including evaluation patient's swallowing function and propose rehabilitation and adaptive
      maneuver or change in food texture. The aim is to ensure safe swallowing and prevent
      deglutitive muscles from deconditioning. Moreover, aspiration can be prevented and adequate
      nutrition was maintained through the cancer treatment course. Investigators include patients
      with advanced oral cavity cancer who were treated by radical operation and free flap
      reconstruction, and provided them with preventive swallowing rehabilitation. Investigators
      then analyze the swallowing function, oral intake status, and nasogastric tube dependence
      rate and tracheostomy tube dependence rate.The participants received interventions as part of
      our routine medical care, and Investigators studied the effect of the intervention.
