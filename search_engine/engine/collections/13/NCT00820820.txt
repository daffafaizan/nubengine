      and involves T lymphocytes cells. Measles vaccination, as well as measles vaccine, induces a
      temporary immunosuppression; furthermore, an improvement of AD has been observed during
      measles infection.

      This trial is aimed at demonstrating that measles vaccine is able to create an
      immunomodulation and to improve AD symptoms.
