      swallowed and may be absorbed through the GI tract or excreted. Minimal amounts are absorbed
      through the oral mucosa. Serum concentrations of silver and fluoride will be be proportional
      to the dose of silver and fluoride administered topically to the teeth as part of Advantage
      Arrest. This is an open label exposure-response study with up to 50 healthy children ages
      3-13 years of age. Subjects will be treated with Advantage Arrest and have one blood sample
      withdrawn at a randomly assigned time point. A minimum of 3 subjects per time point at
      2,4,6,24,48,96 and 168 hours. Serum samples will be analyzed for F and Ag.
