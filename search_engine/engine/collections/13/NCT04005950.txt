      patients are more likely to require a cricothyroidotomy, due to failure rates of routine
      airway management. Relevant landmarks can be difficult to palpate. And the greater depth of
      the soft tissues overlying the larynx. Due to this reasons the investigators modified the
      adult intubation manikin AirSim Combo X with a drunk baby diaper to simulate the neck of an
      obese patient.

      As a further modification the investigators prepared freezer bags filled with faked blood to
      simulate a possible bleeding.

      35 medial doctors of the department of anesthesiology and 35 paramedics are going to perform
      two cricothyroidotomies in each model.

      For the one time participants use the ScalpelCric Set and for the other time participants use
      the ScalpelCric Set plus a speculum.

      Primary endpoint is the evaluation of reality of the two different manikins.
