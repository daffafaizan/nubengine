      group.

      To perform a thoracic surgical procedure, all patients were premedicated with midazolam, and
      then, paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fentanyl, propofol, pancuronium or
      rocuronium (in children < 10 years old) and suprane were used to introduce and maintain the
      anesthesia. Thoracic epidural catheters were placed following induction of anesthesia and
      endotracheal intubation.

      Intraoperative analgesia was introduced by a single dose of lidocaine 2% (2 mg/kg). Then
      after 15 minutes, the patients from the RF group received ropivacaine 1% (1-3 mg/kg) and
      those from the BF group bupivacaine 0.5% (0.5-1 mg/kg). After 60 minutes 0.2% ropivacaine
      solution with fentanyl or 0.125% solution of bupivacaine with fentanyl was infused with the
      flow rate of 0.1 ml/kg/hr.

      Depending on the allocation to the group, postoperative analgesia was continued either with
      0.2% ropivacaine and fentanyl or 0.125% bupivacaine and fentanyl, based on the concentration
      and the flow rate described above. In addition, intravenous paracetamol was administered as
      standard every 6 hours (the maximum of 60 mg/kg daily) along with non steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. In children > 14 years of age, ketoprofen was injected at the dose
      of 1 mg/kg (the maximum of 200 mg daily) and in younger children ibuprofen (orally or
      rectally, up to 30 mg/kg daily) every 8 hours. Metamizol was given as a "rescue drug" (20
      mg/kg).
