    
      Healthy volunteers will be sequentially assigned to the following dosing regimens:

      Part A:

      A single, open-label dose of 3000 mg orally (2 subjects)

      Part B:

      Subjects will be randomized within a dose regimen to active or placebo treatment:

        -  300 mg PO TID (three times daily) given as a single 300-mg capsule of LMN-101 orally
           three times daily for 28 days (4 subjects) or identical-appearing placebo capsule (2
           subjects).

        -  1000 mg PO TID given as two 500-mg capsules of LMN-101 orally three times daily for 28
           days (4 subjects) or identical-appearing placebo capsules (2 subjects).

        -  3000 mg PO TID given as six 500-mg capsules of LMN-101 orally three times daily for 28
           days (4 subjects) or identical-appearing placebo capsules (2 subjects).

      The primary endpoint is:

      â€¢ Safety and tolerability of LMN-101.

      The secondary endpoints are:

        -  Peak serum drug concentration following administration of the initial dose and peak
           serum drug concentration following a course of treatment (if systemic absorption is
           observed).

        -  Area under the serum drug concentration versus time curve (AUC) following administration
           of the initial dose and following a course of treatment (if systemic absorption is
           observed).

        -  Induction of serum anti-drug antibodies (if systemic absorption is observed).
