      methods of postoperative pain management. Patients assigned to nerve block will receive
      regional anesthetic nerve block using an indwelling femoral nerve catheter and a single shot
      sciatic nerve block. Patients assigned to periarticular injection will receive periarticular
      local injection into the periarticular soft tissues at the time of knee replacement using a
      combination of ropivacaine, epinephrine, ketorolac, and morphine sulphate. Additionally, all
      patients will be given a standardized combination of oral analgesic medications
      preoperatively and postoperatively. All patients will receive a posterior stabilized total
      knee replacement through an medial parapatellar approach.
