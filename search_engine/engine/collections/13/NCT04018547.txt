    
      This is an observational study to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a wrist sensor
      pulse oximeter (Oxitone Medical Oxitone 1000M) to identify obstructive sleep apnoea cases in
      patients referred to the London Sleep Centre (case finding screening, or case only study).
      The wrist sensor pulse oximeter streams data (pulse rate, heart rate variability (HRV), blood
      oxygen saturation levels (SPO2), actigraphy data and skin temperature data) to a software
      application using bluetooth connectivity to be stored in a securely encrypted database cloud
      for analysis. The investigators at the sleep centre will be masked when analysing the data
      from the wrist sensor pulse oximeter when deciding on diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea.
      Data from the wrist sensor oximeter device will be statistically compared with the data from
      a conventional PPG fingertip oximeter and Peripheral Arterial Tonometry device currently in
      use. The study outcome will be whether the wrist sensor pulse oximeter device could be used
      in patients to screen reliably for obstructive sleep apnoea. The study also will include
      patient feedback on convenience of the screening procedure. The study will not affect routine
      patient medical management and care for patients assessed at the sleep centre.
