    
      Resection of the patella to prepare it for placement of a patellar prosthesis is a procedure
      that is performed routinely in the vast majority of total knee arthroplasties (TKA) in the
      United States and at the Mayo Clinic. This procedure is performed by a number of different
      techniques that have been proved to be safe and effective. Despite this, patellar
      instability, tilt, obliquity, and maltracking are all possible complications of improperly
      resected patellae during TKA. The goals of resection are to create a patella that is
      symmetrical, absent of obliquity (slanting), and thick enough to receive a patellar
      prosthesis. Although outcomes are generally good for most described methods, to date, little
      had been published regarding direct comparison of these methods.

      Patients undergoing TKA with planned patellar resection were randomized to have their patella
      resected by one of three methods during primary TKA: 1) use of a cutting guide, 2) haptic
      feedback, or 3) free-hand resection guided by four quadrant measurements. There were three
      experienced fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons (hip and knee) performing the procedures
      who were all familiar and experienced with each of the three techniques being investigated.
      Each surgeon, within a group of 30 of their patients, performed a total 10 resections using
      each of the three methods listed above (30 resections per surgeon for a total of 90
      resections).

      Before and after resection measurements of knee-cap thickness were taken and used to
      determine patellar symmetry. The resulting symmetry of each of the three techniques was then
      be compared between and within each of the three techniques and surgeons. Each procedure was
      also be timed from first measurement by the staff surgeon to the final measurement by that
      surgeon.
