    
      Multi-center, open-label Phase 2 study to evaluate the PK, bioavailability, PD, efficacy and
      safety of a daily SC treatment regimen with MarzAA for bleeding prophylaxis in adult subjects
      with hemophilia A or B with an inhibitor. The study will enroll and dose, both intravenously
      and subcutaneously, a total of 12 adult male subjects with severe congenital hemophilia A or
      B with an inhibitor, and history of frequent bleeding episodes during the 6 months prior to
      enrollment, as per the individual's bleeding and treatment records.

      Once a subject is enrolled into the trial, the study will be conducted in three parts
      (occurring consecutively):

      Part 1a (24 hours): Single IV administration of MarzAA; Part 1b (48 hours): Single SC
      administration of MarzAA; Part 2: Daily SC administration. Dose escalation in Part 2 will
      occur if breakthrough bleeding occurs. Subjects are treated for 50 days at the final dose
      level required.
