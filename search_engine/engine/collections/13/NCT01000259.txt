      I. To validate the ability of intratumoral tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) to predict
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with suboptimally debulked advanced stage III or
      IV ovarian epithelial cancer.

      II. To validate the ability of intratumoral TILs to predict PFS in patients with optimally
      debulked disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To validate the ability of intratumoral TILs to predict overall survival of patients with
      suboptimally debulked disease.

      II. To validate the ability of intratumoral TILs to predict overall survival of patients with
      optimally debulked disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are stratified according to status of debulked disease (suboptimal vs optimal).

      Previously collected tumor tissue samples are analyzed for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
      (TIL) via immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence assays using standard
      immunostaining.
