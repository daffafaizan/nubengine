        -  To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with overall survival
           (OS) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with normal cytogenetics.

        -  To develop and evaluate in an independent validation set a prognostic score for OS based
           on the identified DMR.

        -  To determine whether the prognostic score can group patients into risk groups based on
           OS.

      OUTLINE: Archived blood or bone marrow samples are analyzed for DNA methylation alterations
      by CHARM array-based genome assay. Each patient's clinical data is also collected.
