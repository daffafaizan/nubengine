      symptom questionnaire at the beginning of the study and at each follow-up visit. The subject
      will be randomly assigned (much like the flip of a coin) to one of two treatment arms in
      addition to the prescribed medical treatments: 1) nasal rinses twice daily with a saline
      solution (standard therapy) or 2) nasal rinses with a saline solution mixed with manuka honey
      (the experimental therapy.) Subjects in the manuka honey/saline rinse arm will perform the
      experimental rinses twice daily for one month, and then will continue with saline rinses
      twice daily, with manuka honey added to the rinses only as needed. Nasal rinsing of some kind
      will be continued through the entire study period.
