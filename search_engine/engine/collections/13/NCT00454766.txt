      biopsy. However, data collected by research groups and others shows that women with abnormal
      Pap smear results have limited understanding of the meaning of the results, the causes of
      cervical dysplasia, and the procedures used to evaluate and treat it. This situation is
      further complicated by the fact that many patients, particularly those with less education,
      have low health literacy in general. This means that much of the existing patient education
      materials will likely be inappropriate or ineffective for this group. One approach is to
      develop materials at low literacy levels; however, it is not known whether such materials
      will be provide sufficient information and be effective for patients with high health
      literacy.

      The long term goal is to study the importance of tailoring patient education materials to
      colposcopy patients' level of health literacy. To this end, researchers have developed two
      educational brochures with approximately the same information, but which vary in their health
      literacy (readability) level. As a first step in this research, researchers propose to
      present these materials to colposcopy patients returning for colposcopy visits to assess
      changes in knowledge and obtain patient feedback on the brochures.

      The proposed pilot study represents the first step at evaluating the patient education
      materials and determining the patient's level of understanding of what they receive.
