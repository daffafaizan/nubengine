      language characteristics and functional communication by dubbing scenes from TV series that
      represent daily situations. It will be a randomized, crossed over, interventional pilot study
      recruiting 54 patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia from the departments of Neurology
      and Rehabilitation from La Paz University Hospital and also from the "Afasia Activa"
      association. After meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria and signing
      informed consent, patients will be randomised (1:1) in two different treatment groups. The
      first group will receive therapy within the first 3 months of their inclusion with a
      subsequent period of another 3 months without therapy (thus, serving as group 2 controls).
      Group 2 will initiate therapy after 3 months since their inclusion (serving as group 1
      controls during the first 3 months). Therapy consists of 17 sessions performed in a eight
      week period (1 baseline session and 16 dubbing sessions), each lasting 40 minutes, in which
      the patient will be asked to dubb words or sentences previously selected and considered as
      functionally meaningful for them. These words will be chosen through an online survey
      performed by a representative group of aphasic patients and the study patientsÂ´own relatives
      in the baseline treatment session. Outcomes will be assessed as significant differences in
      two aphasia tests (CAL questionnaire and the BDAE).
