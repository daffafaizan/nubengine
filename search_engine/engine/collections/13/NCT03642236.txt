      followed by emergence of drug-resistance in FLT3-ITD mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). How
      to overcome the resistance to FLT3 inhibitors or chemotherapy needs further study. Bruton's
      tyrosine kinase (BTK) is reported to be a therapeutic target in this subtype leukemia. Our
      previous study showed inhibition of BTK onvercome drug-resistance to FLT3
      inhibitors/chemotherapy in refractory/relapsed FLT3 mutant AML. In this prospective
      randomized controlled study, we are going to inhibit BTK with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in the
      patients with refractory/relapsed FLT3 mutant AML, and then test the enhancing effect and
      safety of combination of ibrutinib with chemotherapy with/without FLT3 inhibitor, to make
      sure inhibition of BTK overcomes drug-resistance in FLT3 mutation AML.
