        -  Determine the frequency of genetic polymorphisms of UGT1 in Hispanics with colorectal
           cancer.

        -  Determine if pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites, SN38 and SN38G, are
           associated with the genotype of UGT1 and clinical toxicity.

        -  Determine whether the genetic polymorphisms of UGT1 are associated with clinical
           toxicity and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of irinotecan in patients with
           unresectable colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan.

        -  Determine the response, time to progression, and survival in patients with UGT1A1
           polymorphisms treated with irinotecan.

      OUTLINE: Genomic DNA is isolated from blood samples from patients and analyzed for UGT1
      polymorphisms. Patients are stratified according to UGT1 genotype (homozygous for wild type
      vs heterozygous for abnormal allele vs homozygous for abnormal allele).

      Patients receive irinotecan over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
