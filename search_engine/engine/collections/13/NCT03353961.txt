      Treatment effects will be evaluated according to the intention-to-treat principle. Primary
      end-point for all outcomes is post-treatment. Secondary end-point include a controlled 3
      month follow-up.

      Primary Analysis

      The primary outcome analysis will include treatment group (ERITA , TAU) and weekly reports of
      NSSI frequency measured once every week 4 weeks prior to treatment start, once every week
      during treatment, and once every week four weeks after treatment termination. Regression
      analysis modelled for count data will be used to estimate trend over time. Four weeks after
      treatment termination will be considered primary endpoint. Pairwise contrasts (group x time
      interaction) from the regression model will be used to evaluate between-group differences at
      primary endpoint (4 weeks after treatment termination).

      Secondary Analyses

      Secondary outcomes measured once before, during, and after treatment will be analyzed in a
      similar fashion as for the primary outcome, modelled after data's distribution (count or
      continuous). Measures collected only once at baseline and post-treatment will be analyzed
      with regression analyses including treatment group (online ERITA , TAU) as the
      between-subjects factor, time (baseline to post) as the within-subjects factor, and group Ã—
      time interactions, modelled after data's distribution (count or continuous).

      3 Month Follow-Up

      Data collected at 3-month follow-up will be used to determine the extent to which potential
      treatment gains were maintained both within and between treatment conditions
