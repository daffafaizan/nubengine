      rate compared with the slow freezing protocol. The evidence is scarce to support superior
      results for vitrifying certain stages of preimplantation embryos. Anecdotal evidence suggests
      that blastocyst vitrification is more forgiving than cleavage stages. However, data obtained
      from the procedure of assisted shrinkage of blastocysts before vitrification show a higher
      survival rate, suggesting that fluid accumulation insides the blastocyst can be a barrier for
      cryoprotectant to reach the cells. Although reassuring, whether facilitating the
      cryoprotectants transfer to cells by the laser-assisted shrinkage or other modalities is
      completely safe remains elusive. Moreover, other claims compare between day-3 embryos
      vitrification and blastocyst stage, suggesting no difference exists.

      One of the most critical stages in embryo development is the maternal to zygotic genome
      activation (MZA), which occurs at the 4 to 8 cell stages. Therefore, it seems the morula
      stage is still cleavage but passed the MZA. Morula in the most grading system has compaction
      for all or the majority of cells so if vitrified, the morula stage can bypass the earlier
      stage of vitrification as well as the need for the artificial shrinkage for blastocyst stage.
      Therefore, comparing the vitrification at Day-4 (morula stage) with the blastocyst stage
      vitrification outcomes with the transfer of all day 5 after warming seems need evaluation. To
      the best of our knowledge, there has been no random-controlled trial conducted such
      comparison. Altogether, this trial is to evaluate the morula stage vitrification to
      blastocyst vitrification on the ongoing pregnancy rate after ICSI.
