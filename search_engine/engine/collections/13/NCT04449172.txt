      Disease among Older People across Europe, NCT02691546). SCOPE has retrieved data on a wide
      panel of biomarkers of CKD in a large study cohort enrolling about 2,450 older people in
      Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Poland and Israel. The innovative biomarkers
      have been already validated by the literature, and include e.g. Cystatin C (CysC), Î²-Trace
      protein (BTP), and Beta2-microglobulin. Others promising novel biomarkers of CKD, based on
      metabolomic and proteomic determinations or other techniques have been evaluated. The
      objective of the SCOPE-plus study is to to verify the accuracy of newly developed equations
      based on innovative and novel biomarkers of CKD function by calculating the percentage of
      estimates within 30% (P30) of the measured GFR (mGFR). The mGFR will be obtained by the
      assessment of nonradioactive iohexol clearance. Patients previously enrolled in the SCOPE
      study, are invited to participate in this additional protocol. Iohexol is an iodinated
      contrast medium with characteristics similar to those of inulin, being freely filtered by the
      glomerulus, neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the renal tubules and recovered almost 100% in
      the urine. These characteristics made it an ideal agent for the determination of the renal
      function.
