      with hypometabolisms characteristic of the pathologies sought. The diagnosis is given by the
      clinician after a visual analysis of the data. To complete the diagnosis, a semi-quantitative
      analysis of the images is recommended (European recommendations) in addition to the visual
      analysis.

      PET technology is improving from year to year thanks to the arrival of a new PET technology
      called digital. In addition, correction methods have been developed to improve PET images and
      thus improve the detection of different pathologies in PET.

      The PSF (Point Spread Function) tool enables partial volume effects to be corrected. The PSF
      consists of correcting the impulse response of the system, and allows a visual improvement of
      the images. Currently not recommended in brain PET/CT reconstructions, it remains to be
      evaluated for the quantitative analysis of acquisitions.
