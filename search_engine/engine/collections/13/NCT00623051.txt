      demonstrated that male circumcision (MC) can reduce the risk of HIV acquisition by more than
      50% among young men. This result has been confirmed by two similar studies conducted in
      Uganda and in Kenya.

      Giving these findings, the next logical step is to demonstrate whether or not MC can be used
      as an effective public health prevention tool that will have an impact on HIV in populations
      as well as among individuals.

      This research study aims to establish a MC intervention in the community where the first
      randomized controlled trial of the impact of MC on men's risk of acquiring HIV infection was
      carried out in order to evaluate its impact on:

        1. knowledge, attitudes and practice regarding MC

        2. existing means of prevention (sexual behavior change, condom use, STI treatment-seeking
           behavior and VCT (voluntary counseling and testing) attendance)

        3. the spread of HIV and HSV-2

      This research will be carried out over a period of 60 months and will have three major
      components: (1) the delivery of the intervention, (2) quantitative studies (cross-sectional
      surveys), and (3) qualitative studies.
