      inconsistent or non-use of contraception. Increasing use of the most effective methods of
      contraception will reduce unintended pregnancies and their social, medical and economic
      consequences. The contraceptive etonogestrel implant (ENG implant) is 20 times more effective
      at pregnancy prevention than oral contraceptive pills, but it has bleeding side effects that
      make it unappealing for many women. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)
      used most commonly for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, has previously been shown to
      dramatically reduce bleeding in users of an older levonorgestrel-based contraceptive implant
      (Norplant tm). It has not been studied in newer progestin-based methods such as the ENG
      implant. If tamoxifen could stop bleeding in users of the ENG implant, it would give patients
      and physicians a valuable option for management of progestin-induced irregular bleeding. This
      research project will test the effectiveness of tamoxifen taken on an as-needed basis to
      treat abnormal bleeding in ENG implant users. If tamoxifen can be established as an effective
      treatment for frequent or prolonged bleeding, it will increase the acceptability of the ENG
      implant, increase its use and reduce unintended pregnancies. This is the first project to
      evaluate tamoxifen for treatment of unfavorable bleeding in users of the ENG contraceptive
      implant.
