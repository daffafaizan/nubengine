      family need to agree to participate in the CDU program. The acute phase is biweekly for 8
      weeks followed by weekly sessions for the remaining 12 weeks to allow for continued work on
      the skills and for consolidation of skills to prevent relapse. It is a total of 28 sessions
      in 20 weeks. There also are up to 4 additional emergency sessions that can be used to handle
      crises or have additional parent sessions during those 20 weeks. In addition, the child and
      adolescent psychiatrist will evaluate each study participant in terms of presently prescribed
      medication or for the need to initiate pharmacological treatment which will follow the
      evidence based medicine recommendations for pediatric psychopharmacology (Walkup et al.,
      2009). The child and adolescent psychiatrist will see each study participant weekly for
      monitoring of illness severity and medication management. Over the course of the 20 week
      treatment, the investigators will assess their diagnosis, global functioning, severity of
      depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, and family factors. At each therapy session, the
      adolescents will be assessed for suicidal behavior by their clinician. They also will be seen
      every 4 weeks by an independent evaluator who will track their symptoms and functioning at
      weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 or early termination and week 32 follow-up assessments. The open trial
      will allow us to determine the feasibility of recruiting depressed and suicidal youth. It
      also will allow us to determine the benefits of using IPT-A to treat depressed and suicidal
      youth.
