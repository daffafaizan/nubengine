      and for death associated with opioid overdose in persons who are or have been long-term
      recipients of prescriptions for Schedule II opioids. The study uses coded terms in large
      heath databases maintained by healthcare providers and health insurers, supplemented by
      overdose deaths identified from the National Death Index. The terms for overdose are combined
      following validated rules as developed in companion studies. The study is being conducted in
      parallel with a prospective questionnaire-based cohort study of the same risks.
