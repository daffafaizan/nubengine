      require far higher blood flows than previously suggested. However, the optimal method of CPB
      is still unknown. Recent research by Sakamoto et al., showed that a raised carbon dioxide
      (pCO2) increased brain blood flow in cyanotic patients, suggesting a noticeable decrease in
      aorto-pulmonary blood shunting. However, the mechanism of this action is not understood and
      it is unclear if this observation is an associated or causative one. Whilst the
      vasoconstrictive (narrowing of vessels) effect of hypoxia has been well documented, with and
      without high carbon dioxide, there are no reports indicating that pCO2 alone increases the
      narrowing of blood vessels in the lung. We hypothesize that a rise in pCO2 could cause a
      shift in blood flow from pulmonary to systemic circulation, either through direct
      constricting action on MAPCA vessels, or through a vasoconstriction of blood vessels in the
      lung. Furthermore, we predict the phenomenon could potentially be used to optimize the method
      of treatment, ensuring that vital organs receive the correct amount of blood flow during the
      surgical correction of these rare congenital heart diseases.
