      evidence that asthma prevalence has been increasing in the last decades in some countries,
      including Italy. Analyses of the cost of asthma lead to conclude that the burden of the
      disease depend on the extent to which exacerbations are avoided since emergency treatment is
      more expensive than regular treatment.

      Based on solid evidence, international guidelines recommend regular treatment with low dose
      ICS for mild persistent asthma and treatment with combination therapy [low dose ICS plus
      long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA)] for patients with asthma not controlled by low doses ICS
      alone. Recent studies have undermined the axiom that treatment with ICS must be regular to
      achieve and maintain asthma control, as equivalent control has been obtained either with prn
      use of an inhaled combination of a short acting beta2 agonist (SABA) and an ICS, or with a
      short course of 10 days high dose ICS at the start of exacerbations. In moderate-severe
      asthma regularly treated with inhaled ICS/LABA combination, the symptom-driven use of the
      same inhaled ICS/LABA combination as reliever is superior to the symptom-driven use of SABA
      or LABA alone.
