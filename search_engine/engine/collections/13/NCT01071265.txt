      prolong life, 1 in 20 patients will not survive their hospital stay. Acute heart and kidney
      injuries are important causes of death after heart surgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning
      (RIPC) is a promising and simple therapy that may simultaneously reduce heart and kidney
      damage. RIPC involves the inflation of a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff on a limb to
      briefly stop blood flow to that limb. This period of no blood flow activates the body's own
      protective systems and releases protective chemicals into the blood that also protect the
      heart and kidneys. RIPC is a particularly attractive potential treatment because it may
      protect several organs at once, it has no known adverse effects and costs almost nothing.
      RIPC could therefore very easily be used globally to improve outcomes for all patients
      undergoing heart surgery. Although RIPC appears very promising in several small studies using
      different RIPC regimens there are no studies large enough to definitively evaluate whether
      RIPC improves patient important outcomes (e.g. survival, kidney failure, major heart attack,
      or stroke). Before performing a large trial to determine whether RIPC is effective, we must
      demonstrate that such a trial is feasible. We will determine the recruitment rate and
      adequacy of follow-up in an international group of centres to ensure that an adequately
      powered trial of RIPC compared to a sham procedure is possible. Further, we will ensure that
      our RIPC regimen is consistent with other trials in terms of effects on cardiac and kidney
      injury. This pilot trial will enroll 250 patients and randomize half to RIPC and half to a
      sham procedure. We call this trial the Remote IscheMia Preconditioning in cArdiaC surgery
      Trial (Remote IMPACT).
