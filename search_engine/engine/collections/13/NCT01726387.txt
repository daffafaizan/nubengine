      these conditions remain undiscovered and/or untreated. Managing it is time-consuming and
      communication-intensive. Furthermore, the management is restraint by the high
      contact-frequencies in primary care practices in Germany.

      In order to ease this urgent health care problem in the future, the investigators conduct a
      cluster-randomized controlled trial, implementing a tandem working cooperation between a
      nurse practitioner (Counseling Assistant - CA) and a general practitioner (GP) on-site its
      own practise.

      The CA's task is to enhance the patients abilities to engage in a better self-management of
      their psychological symptoms and complaints, to enhance self-efficacy and empower the
      patients to tackle problems of daily living.
