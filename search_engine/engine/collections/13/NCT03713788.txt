      tolerance to stretch, but the mechanisms underlying this change are still largely unknown.

      The nervous system has an inbuilt ability to modulate the perceived magnitude of afferent
      noxious stimuli via supraspinally mediated endogenous pain inhibition or facilitation and by
      engaging endogenous mechanisms pain tolerance in healthy individuals is known to increase.
      Thus increasing the tolerance to pain could potentially increase range of motion following
      stretching.
