    
      Starting on Day 1, subjects will check-in at the clinical site to complete procedures to
      confirm eligibility. Following basic check-in procedures (e.g., urine pregnancy test, urine
      drug screen, alcohol test and vital signs), subjects will continue with a 7-day confinement.
      Subjects will be randomized to a product sequence (using a Williams design).

      Test sessions will occur every day during the remainder of the study. The active period of
      each test session will last for approximately 4 hours after the start of Investigational
      Product (IP) use. During each test session, a subject will be required to use their
      randomized IP and during the session, PK blood draws and a subjective effects questionnaire
      will be collected.

      The day prior to each test session, subjects will participate in a product familiarization
      period in which they will use one pouch or lozenge of their randomized IP. The product
      familiarization period will occur after the scheduled test session (or after enrollment and
      randomization on Day 1) and before the 12-hour tobacco and nicotine abstinence period.
      Subjects should use the IP pouch for at least 30 minutes or allow the lozenge to dissolve
      slowly.

      Subjects will provide usual brand (UB) cigarettes for use during study confinement and have
      access to their UB cigarettes for ad libitum use with the exception of 1) during the test
      session, 2) during the the minimum 12-hour tobacco and nicotine abstinence period prior to
      each test session and 3) a minimum of one hour after IP use during the product
      familiarization period. Each UB cigarette must be requested from site staff and used butts
      returned to site staff for accountability.
