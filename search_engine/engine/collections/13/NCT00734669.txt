      complications and the quality of life of diabetic patients. In this study the frequency of
      hypoglycemic events in combination with postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic
      patients on oral insulinotropic therapy will be observed. Using more sophisticated technology
      than before the probability of type 2 diabetic patients on glibenclamide to experience
      hypoglycemic episodes will be registered. Hypoglycemia is prone to cardiovascular
      complications in type 2 diabetic patients due to concomitant dysregulation of blood flow.
      With standardized test meals followed by exercise in a clinical setting hormonal
      counterregulation and cardiovascular parameters associated with hypoglycemia will be
      identified. The acute effect of different conditions of exercise and a single dose of either
      glibenclamide or placebo will be followed each day during the total three-day observation
      period. Thus we will evaluate the frequency of and the risk factors associated with
      hypoglycemia and meal-related hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients.
