      countries, however, this number is up to 35% or more in some Asian countries, including
      China. According to the 2016 World Health Organization annual classification, there are 29
      subtypes of peripheral T cell lymphoma, among which the most common types are peripheral T
      cell lymphoma non-specific type (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and
      anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). For r/r PTCL, the prognosis was poor with objective
      response rate range from 8-50% and median progression free survival（PFS）range from 3.2-5
      months for chemotherapy. Thus, the treatment of this patient population remained clinically
      unmet need.

      This clinical trial will be conducted under Simon's optimal two-stage design. The first stage
      needs 15 participants, if ≥5 participants acquire remission, the study will move on to the
      second stage and enroll another 36 patients to achieve a total number of 51 participants
      enrolled. Drop rate is assumed to be 10%, to insure 47 participants involving the efficacy
      evaluation statistically.

      Participants will receive anti-PD-1 antibody plus HDAC inhibitor every three weeks for a
      cycle, until disease progression or severe/ intolerant toxicity, the maximum treatment period
      is 2 years.
