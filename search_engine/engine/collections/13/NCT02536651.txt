      Analogue Scale Foot and Ankle and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale. The English versions
      were translated and trans-culturally adapted into Finnish language according to well accepted
      international translation guidelines. The psychometric properties are assessed by internal
      validity, intraclass correlation coefficient and test-retest reliability.
