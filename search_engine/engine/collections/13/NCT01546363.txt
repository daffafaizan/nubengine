    
      SPECIFIC STUDY AIMS

      Specific Aim 1: To use gene expression analysis of primary cervical cancers to identify a
      gene expression signature that predicts for lymph node metastases in this disease.

      Specific Aim 2: To predict lymph node metastases by performing multiplex measurements of
      cancer-associated proteins and cytokines using proximity ligation assay (PLA) on plasma
      samples.

      Specific Aim 3: To measure circulating human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA in the plasma samples
      of cervical cancer patients using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and
      determine its ability to predict for nodal metastases.

      Specific Aim 4: To use deep sequencing to evaluate gene and sequence differences between
      cervical cancer patients with and without lymph node metastasis.
