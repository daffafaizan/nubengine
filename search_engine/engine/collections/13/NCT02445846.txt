      is critical. To improve the number of women tested and treated, the Centre for Infectious
      Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) and the Ministry of Community Development, Mother and
      Health (MCDMCH) this field study will assess the effectiveness of newly developed dual HIV
      and syphilis rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) manufactured by Chembio and Standard Diagnostics
      in Lusaka District antenatal clinics.

      The specific objectives of this field performance evaluation of the rapid diagnostics are to
      determine the antenatal clinic-based performance of dual HIV/syphilis RDTs compared to that
      of current reference standard assays, and to assess the operational characteristics and
      acceptability of these dual HIV/syphilis RDTs to patients and health care providers This
      cross-sectional study of 3,765 pregnant women will validate the performance of Chembio and
      Standard Diagnostics dual HIV and Syphilis RDTs.
