      periodontitis, which are classified according to their architecture by the number of residual
      walls, defect width as well as topographic extension in relation to the tooth.

      Conventional surgery done for regenerative purpose regarding vertical defects has been known
      to be affected by clot stability, it was reported in the literature that reduced clinical
      outcomes occurred when early wound failure and exposure of the treated area occurred. This
      led to the innovation of different minimally invasive flap techniques that aimed at reducing
      the surgical trauma, allowing blood clot stability, protecting the regenerating site,
      reducing patient discomfort postoperatively as well as minimizing surgical chair time Among
      these techniques are papilla preservation flaps and minimally invasive surgical approaches
      with papilla elevation or without papilla elevation . However, these techniques had in their
      design incisions related to the interdental papilla which would jeopardize and complicate the
      vascular integrity of the interdental tissues Non incised Papilla surgical approach is a new
      surgical technique introduced by Moreno Rodriguez in 2017 to maintain the marginal tissues
      and the papilla intact by placing a horizontal or oblique incision apical to the defect and
      approaching it through an apical access leaving the marginal tissues to act as a "dome "
      protecting the blood clot
