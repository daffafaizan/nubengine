      worsen, and how exercise may impact this process. The investigator would like to see whether
      a progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP©®, Exercise for Cancer Patients) can improve
      symptoms in patients with gastrointestinal cancers with weight loss and cachexia. The
      investigator would also like to find out if this exercise intervention improves physical
      performance, day-to-day function, quality of life, and how exercise may affect different
      markers in the blood over time.
