      commonly used in ocular surface surgeries such as pterygium removal and conjunctival lesions
      excisions.

      MÃ¼ller's muscle-conjunctival resection (MMCR) is the most common surgery for ptosis
      correction and is normally performed under local anaesthesia. In MMCR, a portion of the
      Muller and conjunctiva is resected, and sutures are used to reconnect the remaining edges.
      The suturing process requires several minutes and causes discomfort to the patient. In
      addition, many patients experience post operative discomfort due to the touch of the sutures
      in the superior ocular surface until their removal about 7-14 days post op. Moreover, the
      sutures removal process is commonly unpleasant, and in the pediatric patients requires
      sedation or general anaesthesia.

      The investigators' goal is to explore using fibrin glue instead of sutures in MMCR surgeries
      to shorten the procedure's length and alleviate patients discomfort and pain. This is
      especially important in the management of children suffering ptosis, where sedation and even
      general anaesthesia is required for sutured removal as a secondary procedure.

      Methods:

      A prospective randomized study. Patients will be randomized into traditional MMCR using
      sutures, vs. MMCR using tisseel glue. Follow up will take place 1 day, 7 days, 1 month and 3
      months post op. Main outcome measures included patient reported outcome such as pain grade
      and discomfort, and success of ptosis repair surgery defined by improvement in margin reflex
      distance, symmetry of upper eyelid position, and incidence of complications.
