      would be critical for the identification of novel immunotherapeutic targets which may
      synergize with the T cell-targeted checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, this work promises to
      provide greater insight into tumor-mediated immune evasion mechanisms and primary
      immunotherapy resistance, potentially unveiling predictive markers of clinical response for
      our expanding arsenal of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

      Many patients who exhibit a response to the anti-PD-1 antibodies develop a prolonged course
      of disease stability which resembles the equilibrium phase of the previously proposed process
      of cancer immunoediting. This state of equipoise has been hypothesized to involve genetic
      alterations that promote immune evasion and, in some cases, lead to the development of tumor
      escape. Based on our data, the investigators propose that melanomas that develop a period of
      disease stability in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy exhibit genetic alterations that
      suppress the effectiveness of anti-tumor immunity. Our previous studies indicate that the
      tumor-derived factors that play a role in the paracrine signaling pathways capable of
      regulating nearby stromal cell populations are more likely to be critical immune regulators
      of the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the investigators will focus our studies on those
      differentially expressed genes which encode soluble proteins using an available prediction
      algorithm. Those genes identified by this study to be differentially expressed in the
      melanoma tissues of patients demonstrating a clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitor
      therapy will be further evaluated in transgenic autochthonous melanoma models.
