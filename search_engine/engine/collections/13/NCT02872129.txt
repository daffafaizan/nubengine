    
      A 12-year follow-up of 166 women with fibromyalgia (FM) or chronic widespread pain (CWP).

      The 166 women participated in a Randomised Controlled Trial called GAU 2004-2005 in three
      cities in western Sweden; Göteborg, Alingsås and Uddevalla. The RCT aimed to investigate the
      effect of pool exercise and patient education.

      The primary aim of the present study is to examine the change of symptoms after 11-12 years
      in 166 women with FM or CWP and also investigate predictors of change of symptoms and work
      ability.

      The 166 women will be contacted by mail and telephone, and asked to participate in the
      present follow-up study.

      The follow-up examination comprises a standardised interview of symptoms and demographic
      variables, a battery of self-administered questionnaires and tests of physical function.
