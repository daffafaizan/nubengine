      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of American ginseng, administered at 3 different doses, vs placebo
           in patients with cancer-related fatigue.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects and tolerability of American ginseng in these patients.

        -  Determine the impact of American ginseng on quality of life-related variables (e.g.,
           sleep, vitality, and quality of life domains) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to disease stage (I or II vs III or IV vs unknown), gender (male vs
      female), baseline fatigue score (4-7 vs 8-10), concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), and
      concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.
