      literature, but an emerging research line warns of its capacity to improve the effectiveness
      and reduce the toxicity of cancer treatment (responsible for the appearance of side effects
      and comorbidities), that overload the health care system. To date, there is a lack of
      knowledge in different subjects: the possibility of implementing individualized exercise
      programs in clinical environment to mitigate the side effects of cancer treatment; the best
      moment in natural history of the disease to perform therapeutic exercise; and a tailored dose
      of exercise that maximizes its benefits.

      In this context, the present study will evaluate the effects of a therapeutic exercise
      program conducted previously at the beginning of the cancer treatment, in the treatments'
      toxicity against the same program conducted during cancer treatments in women with breast
      cancer, and its positive effects on both clinical and biological variables and their possible
      impact on disease-free survival.

      This study will be conducted in 3 phases with 110 participants in total: phase 1: a pilot
      study be carried out to check the feasibility of the proposed physical exercise program;
      phase 2: to test the effectiveness of the program ATOPE performed prior to surgical medical
      treatment against the same made during treatment, with a randomized controlled clinical
      trial; and phase 3: in which it will be integrated into the health service and a larger
      project will be requested at the international level.
