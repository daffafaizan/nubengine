      its associated morbidity remains non-negligible with reported mortality and complications
      rates ranging from 2 to 8% and 30 to 70%, respectively (1). Besides the underlying liver
      disease together with the comorbidities of the patients, this high morbidity is also related
      to the type of surgical approach. Since less than 15% of liver resections are currently
      performed using the laparoscopic approach in France, a trial showing the superiority of the
      laparoscopic approach in comparison to the open approach for patients with colorectal liver
      metastases qualifying for both approaches would allow improving management of patients,
      reducing the length of stay, maybe decreasing the global cost and changing current practices
      on a national scale.

      In order to demonstrate the superiority of the laparoscopic approach over the laparotomy
      approach, patients with colorectal hepatic metastasis will be randomly assigned to either the
      laparoscopy or laparotomy groups. Post-operative complications (including mortality) will be
      measured using the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) within 90 days postoperatively or
      at any time during hospitalization. The participation time for each patient in the study is 3
      years, the patient will be followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30 and 36 months.
