    
      This is a single center, operational research study with two components. A formative
      component and randomized intervention trial. The study aims are to inform, promote and
      evaluate strategies aimed at promoting exclusive breast feeding for 6 months followed by
      continued breastfeeding for the next 6 months with introduction of complementary foods among
      HIV infected women in a resource limited settings.

      The primary objective of the qualitative formative research which includes Focus Group
      Discussions (FGD) and Key Informant Interviews (KII) is to explore factors affecting
      decisions on EBF and continued breastfeeding among HIV infected women.

      The primary objective for the Intervention phase is to compare either of two intervention
      strategies against the standard arm using Ministry of Health (MOH) messages aimed at
      promoting EBF for 6 month.
