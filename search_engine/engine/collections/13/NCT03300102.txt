      collection of data using both structured Likert 12 item questionnaires and semi structured
      interviews to assess acceptability. With the development of patient-derived tumouroids the
      investigators would like to overcome the current over-simplified strategies that focus on
      genetic markers as predictors of response. In the future, the investigators hope to establish
      tumouroids as a personalised platform to predict patient response to treatment that is more
      cost-efficient and poses less ethical issues than animal platforms.

      This project will assess if patient-derived tumouroids can be therapeutically challenged and
      if patients would be willing to accept that such platform to guide clinical treatment
      decision making.

      This study is designed to assess primarily patient acceptability. Acceptability will be
      elicited using Likert scale non-validated questionnaires and in a semi-structured interview
      in which the views and preferences relating the acceptability or otherwise of the patient
      derived tumour models and their impact on future decision making will be explored.

      The study will also assess feasibility of building tumouroids and challenging them.
      Feasibility will address the successful transition between the critical phases of generating
      a viable and responsive tumour model. This begins with the extraction of cancer cells from
      the explanted tumour and ends with the determination of a response or otherwise to a
      therapeutic challenge of the viable tumour model at a range of in vitro concentrations.

      The findings of this study will be presented at conference(s) and manuscripts will be
      submitted to appropriate journals for publication.
