      decade, outbreaks of H6 influenza infection have been reported both in the United States and
      South Africa. The prevalence of H6 influenza viruses in a wide range of domestic and wild
      birds, and their propensity for reassortment has raised concerns regarding the pandemic
      potential of these viruses. This vaccine, therefore, is an important priority in the
      development of vaccines against potential pandemic influenza strains.

      This vaccine trial will be conducted in the Center for Immunization Research inpatient unit
      in the Mason F. Lord Building at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (Baltimore, MD).
      The study will be initiated between April 1st and December 20th, 2008, when wild-type
      influenza is unlikely to be circulating in the Baltimore area.

      An individual's participation in the study will last approximately 90 days. All participants
      will receive two vaccinations approximately 4 - 8 weeks apart. After each vaccination,
      participants will remain in isolation at the study site for at least nine days or until
      rRT-PCR assays for influenza are negative for 2 consecutive days. A physical examination and
      nasal wash will occur each day during the isolation period. Blood collection will occur on
      the day of admission, the following day, and day 7 after vaccination. Follow-up outpatient
      visits are scheduled on Days 28 and 56 after the first vaccination and on Day 28 after the
      second vaccination. Follow-up visits will include serum collection, nasal wash, and interim
      medical history.
