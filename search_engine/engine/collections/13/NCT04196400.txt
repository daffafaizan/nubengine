    
      This is a prospective comparative trial : comparing the use of local steroids injection to
      reduce tissue edema after hypospadias and to preserve the final cosmesis after tissue repair.

      The patients will be divided into 2 groups(each group 20 patients): one group will be
      injected steroids just after hypospadias surgery while the other will not.

      The short and long term outcomes between both groups will be compared.
