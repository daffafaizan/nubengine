    
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of
      long-acting cabotegravir (CAB LA) plus the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody,
      VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS), in adults living with HIV-1 with suppressed plasma
      viremia.

      The study will be conducted in three steps. At Step 1 entry, all participants will
      discontinue their current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen except for nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and initiate oral CAB.

      During Step 1, participants tolerating oral CAB plus their current two NRTIs, and displaying
      viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL), will register to Step 2. At entry into Step 2,
      eligible participants will stop their oral CAB and NRTIs and will receive a VRC07-523LS
      infusion plus CAB LA injection. After entry in Step 2, participants will receive CAB LA every
      4 weeks through Week R2+44 plus VRC07-523LS every 8 weeks through Week R2+40.

      At the last visit in Step 2 (Week R2+48), or at premature study treatment discontinuation,
      all participants who received any CAB LA or VRC07-523LS will enter Step 3 and switch to
      standard of care (SOC) oral ART for approximately 48 weeks.

      Participants will attend a number of study visits throughout the study. Study visits may
      include a physical examination, clinical assessment, pregnancy testing, and blood and urine
      collection. Participants will remain in the study for up to 101 weeks, including
      approximately 5 weeks in Step 1, 48 weeks in Step 2, followed by 48 weeks in Step 3.
