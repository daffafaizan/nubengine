      Participants will undergo a complete eye examination to determine eligibility, including
      visual acuity testing, intraocular pressure (IOP) in millimeters of mercury (mmHG), and
      visual field (VF) testing.

      Participants will then be tested with Diopsys NOVAâ„¢ PERG & FERG systems. For both tests, two
      electrodes are placed on the skin underneath each eye below the eyelashes. Participants' skin
      will be cleaned before electrodes are placed. A small amount of gel will be placed on skin
      where electrodes are placed for testing. Electrical responses are recorded with electrodes in
      response to visual stimuli.
