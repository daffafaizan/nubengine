      surgery for adolescents. It was therfore possible to define its feasibility, potential
      complications and specific indications.

      This led to recommandations published by Health Authorities (HAS) in 2016. However, it seems
      imperative to continue monitoring these patients in order to improve their management,
      especially as the use of these surgical techniques becomes increasingly widespread.

      The Angers University Hospital is one of the leading hospitals when it comes bariatric
      surgery for adolescents through its use of gastric bands.

      The aim of this protocol is to update data on how effective this surgery is on weight loss
      and obesity-associated comorbidities, and to monitor medical, psychological and surgical
      complications associated with this treatment.
