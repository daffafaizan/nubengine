      undergoing orthopedic surgery on the upper or lower extremities. Patients are divided into
      two groups depending on the adjuvant to the local anesthetic: 1st group - patients whose
      blockade is performed with a solution of bupivacaine 0.375% together with dexamethasone
      0.02%; Group 2 - patients whose blockade is performed with a solution of bupivacaine 0.375%
      together with dexamethasone 0.02% and epinephrine 0.00018%. The duration of the blockade is
      estimated by puncturing the skin with a needle. The intensity of pain is assessed at 6, 12,
      24 and 36 hours after blockade using Visual analog scale (VAS). The amount of narcotic
      anesthetic used in the postoperative period is also recorded. In addition, patients underwent
      electromyography of the innervation area of the blocked nerve before the surgery and 24 and
      36 hours after surgery.
