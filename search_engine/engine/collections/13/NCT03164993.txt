      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are limited. The host immune response is strongly
      predictive for the effect of chemotherapy in patients with TNBC. In the present trial, we
      combine Atezolizumab, an inhibitory antibody against Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1), with
      chemotherapy. Thereby, we aim to release the brake on the chemo-induced immune response. The
      chemotherapeutic regime is a combination of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide, applied in a
      semi-metronomic fashion (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin every 2nd week and daily
      cyclophosphamide for 2/4 weeks). The investigators hypothesize that the semi-metronomic
      regime will induce immunological cell death and counter T regulatory cells, while maintaining
      the leukocyte counts and the ability of the effector immune cells to respond. The use of
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) minimizes the adverse effects of anthracyclines on
      the heart and allows for continued treatment beyond the otherwise mandatory anthracycline
      limits.
