      system endoscopy before the surgery in our clinical routine. In our research some patients
      who has Helicobacter pylori positive endoscopic biopsy will take Helicobacter pylori
      eradication therapy one month before the surgery and some patients will not take any
      medication about Helicobacter pylori. All of gastric specimens( Helicobacter pylori positive
      or negative ) will examine microscopically in the pathology laboratory. The two groups which
      preoperatively Helicobacter pylori positive detected in endoscopic biopsy will compare with
      Helicobacter pylori negative control group. Control group will include 30 patients. The other
      two groups will include 44 patients for each group . The number of patients of group has been
      determined by power analysis. Gastric specimen will be examined by 3 points ; fundus, corpus,
      antrum. All of microscopic measurements will be done from that points from minor curvatura.
      These 3 points ; fundus( 1 cm from the top of staple line) , corpus (middle of the staple
      line) , antrum ( 1 cm far from the bottom of staple line ). All these points 5 mm far from
      the minor curvatura. These 3 points will examine about wall thickness (mucosa-
      submucosa-muscularis propria -serosa ) and the status of Helicobacter pylori. The end of the
      study it can be determined the effect of Helicobacter pylori to the gastric wall thickness.
