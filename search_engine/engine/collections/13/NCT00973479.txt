      physician nor participants knows the treatment that the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the
      medication has a real effect in a clinical study), multicenter, 2-arm (2 groups) study of
      golimumab in participants with active RA despite concurrent MTX therapy. Approximately 564
      participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio ie, Group
      1(approximately 376 participants will receive golimumab + MTX) and Group 2 (approximately 188
      participants will receive MTX + placebo). Total duration of study for each participant is 112
      weeks. Safety will be evaluated by assessment of adverse events, tuberculosis testing and
      blood testing.
