    
      This is a prospective, observational study. All medical and surgical care provided to the
      patient will be standard of care.

      Once a patient is identified as having a lower extremity ulceration (includes lower extremity
      wound of any cause, a surgical incision, a flap or graft) and consent to participation, their
      lower extremity will be imaged. They will be imaged before, during, and on post-op day 1 if
      they require surgery and for each surgery related to the ulceration. They will also be imaged
      once a month in follow up for up to a total of 12 months or healing of the wound, whichever
      comes first.

      The 3 instruments do not touch the patient and are being evaluated on their ability to
      predict wound healing. They are research only and not standard of care, and are not being
      used to determine care.
