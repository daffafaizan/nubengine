      without fusion, cervical laminectomy) are asked to participate to this prospective study.
      After verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients consenting to enter the
      study are randomly assigned to one of the following subgroups: 1-Pre-incisional wound
      infiltration with 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25%. 2- Pre-incisional wound infiltration with 150
      Î¼g of clonidine with 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25%. Demographic parameters, co-morbidities and
      other pre and per operative medical data are noted. In the post-operative period, patients
      received a standardized post-operative analgesic protocol (NSAI and paracetamol). Patients
      are asked to fill their pain diary using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from day 0 till day 8
      after surgery. Morphine rescue consumption is noted. Finally, the percentage of global
      subjective patient satisfaction regarding the post-operative wound pain is noted from 0 to
      100.
