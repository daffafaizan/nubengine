    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of APX3330 to improve Early Treatment
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score (DRSS) in one hundred
      (100) subjects with moderately severe to severe NPDR or mild PDR.

      Subjects with moderately severe to severe NPDR and mild PDR will be selected for study
      participation and be screened for study eligibility.

      The eligible eye with the highest DRSS, as assessed by the central reading center, will be
      designated as the study eye for the primary efficacy analysis.

      If the subject meets all eligibility criteria, then the subject will be randomized into the
      study and receive study medication. Blood will be drawn for biomarker analysis.

      The total length of subject participation is approximately 26 weeks, with 5 clinic visits, 4
      telephone safety calls, and one telephone call follow-up visit.

      The execution of the entire study (first subject screen through last randomized subject
      completed) is expected to be approximately 12 to 15 months.
