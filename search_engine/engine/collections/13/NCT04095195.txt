    
      Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a dismal prognosis. One of the ways to
      improve survival might be early detection.

      Within years, many predisposing diseases or genetic conditions have been identified, thus
      screening/surveillance have been established worldwide.

      A registry of subjects at risk of pancreatic cancer will has been built up to investigate the
      possibility of diagnosis pancreatic cancer, or one if its predisposing lesions.

      Inclusion criteria will be adopted as "enrollment criteria". According to this, individuals >
      18 years old will be enrolled; their familiar history and/or genetic predisposition will be
      collected, as well as current or previous medical records/medications data. Thereafter,
      according to specific age-based criteria, those individuals initially enrolled will be will
      be considered for a "surveillance protocol" ("interventional follow-up criteria") and they
      will be submitted to Cholangio-Wirsung Magnetic Resonance or Pancreatic Endoultrasonography
      according to the pancreatologist's prescription at each participating center.

      Individuals suffering from the following conditions will be enrolled:

      familial pancreatic cancer; Peutz-Jeghers syndrome; a known BRCA-2, BRCA-1, PALB2, or p16
      mutation with at least one first- or second-degree relative suffering from pancreatic cancer;
      hereditary pancreatitis; FAMMM syndrome; Lynch syndrome with at least one first- or
      second-degree relative suffering from pancreatic cancer.
