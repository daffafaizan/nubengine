      treatment for hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease. Hemostatic effects of desmopressin
      include: 1) an increase in plasma factors through endogenous release of coagulation factor
      VIII, von Willebrand factor and tissue plasminogen activator; 2) an increase in platelet
      adhesiveness; and 3) a reduction in bleeding time. Randomized, double-blind studies have been
      performed on patients undergoing various types of surgical procedures. A study in patients
      undergoing orthognathic surgery showed a significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss
      and a study in patients undergoing lumbar fusion concluded that desmopressin was effective in
      reducing intraoperative blood loss. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect
      of administration of desmopressin on intraoperative blood loss in patients undergoing FESS.
