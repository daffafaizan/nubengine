    
      This was a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study. The aim of the phase Ib part was to
      estimate the MTD and/or to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination
      of INC280 and buparlisib, followed by the phase II part to assess the clinical efficacy of
      INC280 single agent and in combination with buparlisib (BKM120), and to further assess the
      safety of the combination. In addition, a surgical arm should have started concurrently with
      the phase II part, to determine the PK/PD profile of the study drug combination in patients
      undergoing tumor resection for recurrent glioblastoma after 7 to 10-days treatment.

      RP2D was not declared due to a lack of efficacy of the combination in the phase Ib stage, and
      phase II was continued with INC280 monotherapy only.
