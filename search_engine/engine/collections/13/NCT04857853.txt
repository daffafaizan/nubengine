      to a survey of the literature, may include muscle tension, muscle fatigue, paresthesia, pain,
      and/or physical strain in soft tissues and bones. The incidence of musculoskeletal discomfort
      in office workers like computer users is as high as 50%. In various studies on static
      workstation workers, musculoskeletal discomfort has been reported, either separately or in
      aggregate, in the neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, back, legs, buttocks, ankles, feet,
      and chest.

      The current study examines the effects of exercise, ergonomic modifications, and rest breaks
      on fatigue and musculoskeletal discomfort during computer tasks. For the purpose of this
      project, musculoskeletal discomfort is defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms that
      include muscle tension, paresthesia, pain, and/or physical strain in soft tissues and bones.
