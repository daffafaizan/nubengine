      are achieved with a panniculectomy. Patients will be evaluated preoperatively and
      postoperatively with specific interventions aimed at describing their functional status.
      These interventions will include: echocardiogram, pulmonary function testing, arterial blood
      gas, functional capacity evaluation by physical therapy, and a quality of life survey. The
      investigative interventions will be performed postoperatively at 6 months and again at 1 year
      post surgery. Data will also be gathered on complications such as wound infection,
      dehiscence, and cardiopulmonary problems.

      There should be no additional risk to the patient as the surgery and procedures listed are
      already performed routinely on this patient population.

      Study participants will have morbid obesity with significant overhanging pannus that requires
      surgical intervention.

      This study will compare the preoperative values to post operative values taken at 6 months
      and then at 1 year post operative. These values include echocardiograms, pulmonary function
      tests, arterial blood gases and a functional capacity evaluation.
