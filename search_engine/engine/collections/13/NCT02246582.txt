    
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, in-clinic trial that aims to demonstrate the
      performance of the Enlite 3 Sensor over 168 hours (7 days) when inserted in the abdomen and
      used with the Guardian Mobile App and 640G Pump in subjects aged 14-75 years with type 1 or
      type 2 diabetes for at least one year.

      Subjects are randomized into either Group A or Group B. The groups assigned will determine
      when the subject will be participating in the in-clinic YSI frequent sample testing (FST).
      For example on Day 1: Group A begins FST 30 minutes after Enlite 3 Sensor Insertion. Group B
      begins FST 14 hours after Enlite 3 Sensor Insertion.
