      inflammatory myeloid cells correlate with disease severity, cytokine storm, and respiratory
      failure. The mortality rate for hospitalized COVID-19 patients remains unacceptably high,
      particularly in patients who progress to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). This
      randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled pivotal phase 3 trial will evaluate
      the impact of lenzilumab (anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody) on ventilator-free survival
      in hospitalized, hypoxic patients with COVID-19. The study is also designed to evaluate other
      key endpoints, including ventilator-free days, duration of ICU stay, incidence of IMV, ECMO
      and/or death, time to death, all-cause mortality and time to recovery.

      Approximately 516 patients will be randomized to receive lenzilumab + SOC vs. placebo + SOC
      in a 1:1 ratio.
