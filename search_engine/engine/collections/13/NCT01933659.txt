      ulcer scars will be recruited. Before treatment, H. pylori infection status will be examined
      by endoscopy with biopsy or 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT). All patients will receive 13C-UBT
      before treatment, at the end of 2 week's treatment and 4 weeks after termination of
      treatment. A computed generated random numbers sequence will be blocked (2:1; block sizes of
      six) into two groups, say A and B.

      group A - ingesting DSW 200 cc four times a day (one hour before meal and bed time); group B
      - ingesting non-DSW drinking water 200 cc four times a day (one hour before meal and bed
      time).

      To keep the study in double-blind model, the picture of package for DSW and non-DSW drinking
      water will be the same.

      Prokinetics (metoclopramide 5 mg/tab 1 tid) and antacid (strocain tablet (oxethazaine 5 mg
      and polymigel 244 mg/tab) 1 tid) will be permitted for relieving the dyspeptic symptoms.

      All patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire and to record symptoms and water/drug
      consumption daily during the treatment period. Post-treatment, the patients will be seen at
      the Outpatients Clinic to investigate patient adherence and adverse of treatment.
