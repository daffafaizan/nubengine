      legal blindness in individuals between the ages of 20 and 65 years in developed countries.
      Swelling of the central retina, or "macular oedema" is the commonest cause of visual loss in
      diabetic retinopathy.

      Diabetic macular oedema is treated with laser coagulation to the macular area according to
      established guidelines which take into account the extent of the leak and its proximity to
      the centre of the macula, the "fovea". This treatment does not, however, always work and is
      inherently destructive.

      Intravitreal injection of crystalline steroids has been proposed as a new modality to treat
      clinically significant diabetic macular oedema.

      To determine by means of a prospective, double-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trial
      to determine whether an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone three months or more after
      focal or grid laser photocoagulation for clinically significant diabetic macular oedema will
      improve the visual acuity of eligible eyes. OCT will be used in addition to visual acuity
      testing as an objective measurement of macular oedema.
