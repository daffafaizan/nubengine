    
      In this proof-of-concept study, our multidisciplinary team will conduct a pilot randomized
      clinical trial to test the feasibility of the innovative Patient-Reported Outcomes-Informed
      Symptom Management System (PRISMS) to enhance personalized supportive care for cancer
      patients and caregivers during post-treatment care transition. We will randomly assign 21
      cancer patients with newly created ostomies for cancer treatment with curative intent and
      their primary caregivers to the PRISMS or usual care groups (21 patient-caregiver dyads, a
      total of 42 individuals). PRISMS is defined as a personalized psychoeducational website
      including monitoring and personal feedback. We will conduct pre- and post-assessments of QOL
      and PRO (symptoms) at baseline upon enrollment and 2 months later.
