      dramatically over the next two decades, with a concomitant rise in the number of family
      members providing informal care for their loved ones. The stresses associated with this care
      have been well-documented in the scientific literature, and are noted to be associated with
      increased risk for psychological and physical morbidity, particularly cardiovascular disease.
      Indeed, caregiving is associated with elevations in negative affect (e.g., depressive and
      anxiety symptoms), which in turn is associated with biological indicators that are thought to
      predict CVD risk (e.g., markers of coagulation and inflammation). The primary goal of this
      study is to examine the efficacy of a brief Behavioral Activation (BA) Treatment, called the
      Pleasant Events Program (PEP), for reducing biological CVD risk indicators in a sample of
      Alzheimer caregivers. We will enroll 100 dementia caregivers and randomly assign them to
      receive 4-sessions of PEP or 4-sessions of support + information. Our PEP intervention will
      be conducted in caregivers' homes and will emphasize the importance of monitoring and
      increasing activities that help individuals make contact with natural reinforcers in their
      environments, identifying and reducing negative coping responses, and selection and
      achievement of behavioral goals for healthier living. Caregivers will be assessed for our
      biological outcomes at baseline, post-treatment, and 1-year to determine intervention
      efficacy. Given the brief nature of the PEP intervention, the ease with which it can be
      applied in real-world settings (e.g., community agencies providing services to caregivers),
      and lack of difficult skills for interventionists and caregivers to acquire, we believe our
      PEP intervention will be easily transferred to "real-world" settings. If our PEP intervention
      is efficacious, it may have a considerable impact on both the physical and mental health of
      caregivers, and will likely have public health implications.
