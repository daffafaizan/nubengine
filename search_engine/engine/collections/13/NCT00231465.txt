    
      This trial is designed to test the efficacy and tolerability of a standard chemotherapy
      agent, Docetaxel, in combination with an oral agent, Iressa, in elderly patients with
      advanced stage lung cancer. Current practices utilize two chemotherapeutic medications that
      may result in increased toxicities and poor outcomes in the elderly population. Treatment
      consists of an infusion of docetaxel every 21 days for four doses while taking Iressa every
      day. A computed tomography (CT) scan will measure disease response after two cycles. Response
      determines continuation of treatment. Lab work will be collected before every treatment. Side
      effect information will also be collected at every visit. Once the infusion phase of the
      study is completed, a maintenance phase of taking just the Iressa begins and disease
      assessment occurs every two months. This period will last until disease progression is
      demonstrated.
