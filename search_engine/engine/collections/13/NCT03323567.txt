      muscles. The novel treatment option for trigger point therapy and muscle regeneration in TMD
      patients are intramuscular collagen injections. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
      efficacy of intramuscular injections of Collagen MD Muscle(Guna) 2 ml, 2 ml of Lidocainum 2%
      without vasoconstrictor and 2 ml of Saline (0,9 % NaCl). 43 patients were enrolled to the
      study (17 male and 26 female, 40 +/- 3,8 years old). The masseter muscle activity was
      measured with sEMG Neurobit Optima 4 (Neurobit System). Visual Analogue Scale was used to
      determine pain intensity changes between follow-up visits in each group. Trigger points were
      localized with palpation of masseter muscle. Electromyographic activity of masseter muscle
      was measured before injections on each visit: 0, 7,14 days. In our analysis sEMG masseter
      muscle activity was significantly decreased: in collagen group 59,2%, in lidocainum group
      39,3% and in saline group14%. Pain intensity reduction in VAS scale was 53,75% in collagen
      group, in lidocainum group 25% and in saline group 20,1%.
