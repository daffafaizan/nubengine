      multimodal distraction technique to reduce immunization distress (RID) in 4-6 year old
      children receiving pre-kindergarten immunizations. Widespread implementation would require
      fewer steps and a reduction of personnel and the current study addresses the practical time
      and personnel limitations of the method. The current RID trial proposes a randomized design
      to compare our current method, the standard technique, (ST), with its minimally altered
      approach where arm gripping and rubbing adjacent to the injection site are to be performed by
      the medical assistant conducting the injection, substituting for the non-commercially
      available 'arm gripper'. Pressure and rubbing stimuli at injection sites are documented to be
      equally effective. The ST will be compared against the parental participation technique,
      (PPT), whereby the parent participates in the delivery of pain-relieving interventions in
      lieu of the second medical assistant. The primary aim of the present proposal is to compare
      the effectiveness of the more feasible PPT to the ST in reducing the pain and distress of
      childhood immunization. A secondary aim is to evaluate the impact of parental involvement on
      the parent and child satisfaction with the immunization experience.
