      a separate IRB approved protocol, in which pathological specimens were tested to generate a
      test result for comparison to outcomes. Those test results are presented in this study, but
      not the individual patient outcomes. Physicians participating in this current study did not
      provide care for any of the subjects in the previous study. Cases are presented to physicians
      in a randomized order and in a form that prevents the patients from being identified,
      directly or indirectly.

      High risk patient cases were selected to reflect a range of clinicopathological variables and
      were further stratified based on the Decipher predicted probability of developing metastasis
      5 years after RP and 3 years after BCR (as shown in the table below). High (low) Decipher
      (GC) risk was defined as a 5- or 3-year predicted probability of metastasis greater (less)
      than 6% for the adjuvant setting and greater (less) than 18% for the salvage setting.
