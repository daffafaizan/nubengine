      Primary

        -  To estimate the non-comparative efficacy of sulindac and epirubicin hydrochloride in
           patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sulindac 2 hours prior to receiving epirubicin hydrochloride IV over 15
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Previously collected tumor blocks are assessed for cancer resistance markers by IHC.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month, and then every 3
      months thereafter.
