    
      VIG (Human) is a component of plasma from persons vaccinated with vaccinia vaccine. It is the
      only product available for the treatment of vaccinia and other orthopox infections. The only
      lot currently available was released as a licensed product in 1995 but is being treated as an
      investigational new drug because of slight discoloration in the solution. This study makes
      existing stocks of VIG available as a short-term solution for the lack of a licensed immune
      globulin to treat vaccinal infections.

      Before receiving injections and 3 and 6 months after injections, patients are tested for HIV,
      hepatitis B, and hepatitis C with pre- and post-test counseling. Referrals for appropriate
      medical care are provided. Participants have multiple injections (depending on body weight)
      of VIG at 1 or 2 clinic visits. Following administration of VIG, participants are observed
      for 1/2 hour at the clinic. Participants return to the clinic for as many as 10 visits to
      monitor for any adverse reactions and signs and symptoms of vaccinia infections. On Days 7,
      84, and 168 participants return to the clinic for evaluations and have blood drawn to check
      for the response to the VIG injections.
