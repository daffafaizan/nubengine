      burden in personal, societal and fiscal terms. Stroke is an important cause. Memory depends
      on widespread networks in the brain which are bound together by white matter connections,
      which essentially act as the wiring of brain networks. This project uses a technique called
      diffusion tensor MRI to investigate these connections and their relationship to brain
      function and patterns of memory impairment after stroke.

      Previous research showed that a tract called the fornix was most important in the healthy
      brain and in ageing. However, in individuals at an early stage of memory decline alternative
      pathways became disproportionately more important. This led to the idea that individuals with
      early memory decline might be especially vulnerable to injury to these alternative tracts
      from stroke. The purpose of this project is to test this idea.

      The project focuses on patients with recent stroke. Participants undergo MRI, including
      diffusion tensor MRI, and in-depth testing of memory and other cognitive functions. The
      pattern of damage to temporal lobe connections in the brain will be assessed and related to
      the impact of brain infarction on memory. Analysis will determine how undamaged tracts
      contribute to recovery over one year. Finally, cutting edge computational image analysis
      techniques will be applied to try and predict memory profile in more detail and extract
      maximum information about prognosis from brain images.
