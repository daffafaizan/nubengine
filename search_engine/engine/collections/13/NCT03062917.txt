      (Midhurst, West Sussex) we have produced novel nasosorption and bronchosorption kits that
      have CE marking. Both nasosorption and bronchosorption methods use synthetic absorptive
      matrix (SAM) strips: that look and feel like blotting paper, and will be placed onto the
      mucosal surface. These are comfortable to use and can be used at frequent intervals over
      extended periods of time. This non-invasive technique is ideal for infants and children, and
      it is possible to obtain neat mucosal lining fluid (MLF) even from normal healthy noses. The
      eluates contain cytokines and chemokines at high detectable levels on multiplex immunoassay.

      We would like to use these SAMs to take MLF samples from the nasal and bronchial mucosal
      surfaces to see if these novel techniques can overcome the problems with current sampling
      methods. We plan to use these absorption techniques to measure RSV viral load. We also aim to
      look at the immune response in terms of the anti-viral interferon response (IFN-γ, IFN-λ,
      IFN-α2a, IP10, ITAC). In therapeutic studies in the future, it may be possible to document
      levels of drug (pharmacokinetics) in nasal MLF.
