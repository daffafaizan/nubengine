        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative expression of OX-40 and related markers in
           sentinel lymph nodes previously removed from patients with cancer.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative expression of OX-40 and related markers in
           sentinel lymph nodes freshly removed from patients with cancer.

        -  Correlate the expression of OX-40 and related markers in sentinel lymph node tissue with
           expression in nonsentinel tissue from primary tumors and nonsentinel lymph nodes, tumor
           stage, and patient outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Sections of primary tumors, nonsentinel lymph nodes, and sentinel lymph nodes will
      be analyzed for expression of OX-40 by immunohistochemistry. Sections of negative (no tumor
      metastases) lymph nodes will be used as internal controls. Fresh tissue and blood will be
      tested for marker analysis and in vitro assays of immune function.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 specimens from sentinel lymph nodes previously removed from
      cancer patients and 100 specimens from sentinel lymph nodes freshly removed from cancer
      patients will be accrued for this study.
