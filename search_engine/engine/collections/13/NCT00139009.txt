      heart transplant recipients to elucidate the association between the intracellular
      concentration and efficacy (rejection episodes and histology) in transplanted patients on CsA
      based immunosuppressive therapy.

      Secondary objectives are to investigate associations between intralymphocyte concentrations
      and whole-blood concentrations of CsA, renal tissue concentrations and nephrotoxicity, heart
      tissue concentrations and cardiotoxicity with CsA based immunosuppressive therapy in
      transplanted patients. In addition, this study aims to validate the use of quinine as a probe
      for determination of CYP3A4 activity in transplanted patients as well as proteomic-based
      urine analyses as a screening tool for acute rejection episodes in transplanted patients.
