      asked to increase their level of activity by gradually walking further (the exercise group)
      and the other group will carry on with their usual level of activity (the usual activity
      group) .

      Assessments People in both groups will have an assessment on 3 occasions: when they join the
      study, just before surgery and 3 months after surgery.

      This assessment involves:

      Walking for 6 minutes up and down a corridor to see how far they can walk. Asking them for
      some information about their medical history Completing three questionnaires about how they
      are feeling and their quality of life.

      People who are randomised to the exercise group will be advised about how many steps to take
      based on how they did in the initial walking assessment. The number of days or weeks they
      will be asked to take a daily walk will depend on how much time there is between them joining
      the study and the date of their surgery. We think this will be about 2 weeks.
