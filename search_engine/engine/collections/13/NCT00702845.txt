    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, equivalence clinical trial
      investigating the efficacy and safety of a new treatment regimen with Org 36286, a
      recombinant gonadotropin applied to initiate and sustain follicular stimulation in COS for
      Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). For this regimen, patients receive a single injection
      of Org 36286 and one week later, treatment is continued with daily recFSH up to the day of
      triggering final oocyte maturation. In the reference group patients receive daily injections
      of recFSH up to the day of triggering final oocyte maturation. Equivalence between the two
      treatment groups in the number of oocytes retrieved is the primary objective of this trial.
