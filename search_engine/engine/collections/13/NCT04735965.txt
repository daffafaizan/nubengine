      shivering is high in the patients undergo CABG. Previous studies showed that the incidence
      could be up to 50ï¼…. Shivering could make the patients feel distressed. Moreover, shivering
      could also cause a significant increase in oxygen consumption of patients,which might affect
      the balance of oxygen supply and demand of the vital organs, such as heart and brain. There
      are few studies of pharmacological interventions for the prevention of shivering following
      CABG,and the gold standard prophylactic and therapeutic medicine have not been determined.
      Previous studies have shown that both dexmedetomidine and meperidine can reduce the incidence
      of shivering after intrathecal anesthesia and general anesthesia. However, only a few studies
      have indicated that meperidine can reduce the incidence of shivering in patients undergo
      off-pump CABG. But meperidine may increase the incidence of postoperative nausea and
      vomiting. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of
      dexmedetomidine for the prevention of postoperative shivering in the patients undergo
      elective CABG, and to compare the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine and meperidine on the
      incidence of shivering in the patients undergo CABG.
