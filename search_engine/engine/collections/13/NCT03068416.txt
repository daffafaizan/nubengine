    
      Treatment of patients with B cell lymphoma or leukemia with two doses of CD19-targeting
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to evaluate for safety and efficacy. The CAR consists
      of a CD19 targeting antibody scFv with three intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3
      zeta, CD28 and 4-1BB. Autologous T cells will be gene engineered with the CAR gene using a
      retrovirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to
      preconditioning treatment. After the second infusion patients will be subjected to
      immunomodulatory treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24
      months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.

      Primary outcome:

      - Registration of the safety profile such as inflammation, fever, pain, changes in blood
      pressure, pulse and other adverse events.

      Weekly for the first 6 weeks, then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months.

      Secondary outcome:

      Tumor response, CAR T cell persistence and immunological profile

        -  Determination of tumor size and the tumor marker CD19.

        -  Determination of the levels of circulating B cells.

        -  Determination of the level of CAR T cells (mRNA and cells) in blood and biopsies.

        -  Determination of activation markers on CAR T cells such as CD107a.

        -  Determination of the presence of immunological markers in blood and biopsies.

      At 1 and 3 weeks then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months.
