    
      This is a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Eligible
      subjects will be stratified by natural or surgical menopause and randomized (1:1) to receive
      3 single injections, 28-days apart, of either G-CSF or placebo.

      This study will consist of a 14-21 day screening period. Subjects enrolled will be given
      three single 1.0 mL subcutaneous (SC) injections (repeated 28-days apart), in the outer area
      of either upper arm, of either G-CSF or placebo (sterile physiological saline) at Baseline,
      Day 28 and Day 56. Subjects will be followed for 12 weeks and will complete hot flash diary
      entries every day for the duration of treatment. Safety will be assessed by adverse events,
      clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry and complete blood count with differential) and
      vital signs. A follow-up phone call will occur 60 days after the last dose of study drug.

      Eligibility will be assessed via physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, vital
      signs.

      Subjects will receive a diary in which to record daily hot flashes symptoms during the
      duration of the screening period. Subjects must have at least 14 days of hot flash recordings
      to participate in the study. The diary will be reviewed by study site staff on Baseline (Day
      0) to confirm study eligibility.

      During the treatment period, subjects will return to the study site at Days 1, 21, 28, 29,
      49, 56, 57, and 84 for assessments.

      The follow-up phone call will occur approximately 60 days following the last dose of study
      drug.
