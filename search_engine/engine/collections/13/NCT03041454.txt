      evidence suggests that they are used infrequently by health care managers and policy makers
      in decision making. Managers and policy makers have suggested that concise presentation
      positively affects the use of systematic reviews. The purpose of this randomized controlled
      trial is to assess the impact of a traditional systematic review format compared with the
      innovative format on the ability of health care managers and policy makers to understand the
      evidence in the review and apply it to a relevant health care decision making scenario.

      The two end-user groups have different formatting needs and we will therefore run 2 parallel
      studies, randomizing each group separately. Once participants have consented to participate,
      a computer generated randomization process will allocate them to one of 2 arms (1:1 ratio).
      Participants will either receive either a traditional format or a novel format. Unequal block
      randomization will be used and allocation will be concealed through central assignment.
      Outcomes assessors will be blinded and participants will be blinded to the citation of the
      review so that the traditional version will not be easily accessible in its original format
      from the relevant journal.

      This study will be the first study to engage health care managers and policy makers in the
      testing of formats for presentation of research evidence relevant to their needs. The results
      of the project will help increase the uptake of systematic review results in health care
      management policy decision-making, ultimately leading to informed decision making and
      positively impacting the health of Canadians.
