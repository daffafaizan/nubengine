      of anti-botulinum toxin monoclonal antibodies in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be
      hospitalized in the Johns Hopkins Phase 1 unit during the infusion and until after the
      24-hour blood draw. Three escalating dose cohorts of a combination of three anti-botulinum
      monoclonal antibodies will be evaluated. Each cohort will consist of eight volunteers in
      which they will receive a single intravenous infusion of active drug or placebo. Placebo will
      be normal saline. Volunteers will be followed for safety for up to 120 days after infusion
      depending on dose cohort.
