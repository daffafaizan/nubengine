      District, Malaysia. The samples comprised of 478 mother-child-sibling trios (233 families in
      the intervention group, and 245 families in the control group). An oral health package named
      the Family Dental Wellness Programme (FDWP) was designed to provide anticipatory guidance to
      the intervention group at six-month intervals over three years. The control group received
      the standard MOH oral health education activities. The impact of FDWP on net caries
      increment, caries prevented fraction, and mother's oral health literacy was assessed after
      three years of intervention.
