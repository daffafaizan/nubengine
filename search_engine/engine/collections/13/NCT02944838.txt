      involve 132 senior participants, 16 student participants, and 12 decision maker participants
      (N = 160). Three senior centers will be randomized to an advocacy program and three will be
      randomized to a walking program.

      The participants at the advocacy intervention sites will undergo an 8-week advocacy program
      during which they will (1) learn about the connection between the built environment and
      physical activity, (2) conduct a field audit of their physical activity environment using the
      Microscale Audit of Pedestrian Streetscapes (MAPS) Mini tool, (3) select an advocacy issue
      related to a physical activity barrier, and (4) engage in advocacy actions, such as
      communicating with decision makers or public officials. The group sessions will include
      topics such as how the environment affects walking, potential pedestrian hazards and
      solutions, how to conduct an audit of the walking environment, what advocates do, local
      examples of successful advocacy projects, creating an advocacy action plan, creating a fact
      sheet about the advocacy issue, writing letters to representatives, making an advocacy
      presentation. The student participants will work with the senior participants throughout the
      program to help accomplish the advocacy goals. The program will culminate with the
      presentation of the advocacy issue to a "decision maker" (e.g., a city planner, engineer,
      city council member, etc.).

      In the other study condition, the walking groups, participants will undergo an 8-week program
      that provides participants with information about safe physical activity, strategies to
      increase physical activity, and guided walks. The group sessions will address topics such as
      the benefits of walking, fall prevention tips, goal setting, positive thinking, social
      support, sedentary behavior and health, barriers to walking, handling setbacks, and
      overcoming challenges to physical activity. Comparing two beneficial programs helps with
      participant recruitment and retention, and ensures that between-group differences in outcomes
      are not due solely to participation in a group program.
