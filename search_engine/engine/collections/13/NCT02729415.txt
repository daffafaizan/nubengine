    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded, interventional, consecutive series,
      single site study to determine initial safety and feasibility of a single injection of
      autologous adipose-derived SVF cells for the treatment of alopecia.

      Up to 8 subjects who have been diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia will be asked to
      participate. Before the procedure the density (number of hairs per square centimeter) and
      thickness (mm) of the hair will be measured and compared to the same measurements after the
      procedure. All adverse events will be recorded and evaluated for severity.

      Subjects will be asked to come into the office on the following days: pre-procedure visit, 24
      hours post procedure visit, 6 weeks post procedure visit, 3 months post procedure visit and 6
      months post procedure visit.
