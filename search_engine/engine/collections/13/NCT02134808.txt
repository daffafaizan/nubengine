      recruitment on a pilot study of creatine 10g daily vs. placebo as a treatment for female
      adolescents with SSRI-resistant MDD. The purpose of the pilot study is twofold: A) to
      evaluate several aspects of the feasibility of creatine supplementation as a treatment for
      this population; and B) to estimate the effect size of adjunctive creatine, to inform the
      design and implementation of a potential future efficacy trial.
