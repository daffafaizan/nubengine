      level will be determined by the adverse event (AE) evaluations. The VSV-IFNβ-NIS starting
      dose will be 1.7 x 10e10 TCID50 injected intravenously. If this dose level is tolerated (no
      more than 1 out of 6 or 0 out of 3 patients experience DLT), a second dose level may be
      tested (5 × 1010); if this dose is tolerated it will be the dose for parts B and C. If ≥ 2
      DLTs are seen in 6 patients at a given dose level, the level below will be explored using the
      same criteria.
