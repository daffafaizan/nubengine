    
      1.1 Primary Aims 1.1.1 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II
      dose of MLN8237 administered orally once daily for 7 days every 21 days to children with
      refractory solid tumors. 1.1.2 To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      Phase II dose of MLN8237 administered orally twice daily for 7 days every 21 days to children
      with refractory solid tumors. 1.1.3 To define and describe the toxicities of MLN8237
      administered on this schedule.

      1.1.4 To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 in children with refractory cancer.

      1.2 Secondary Aims 1.2.1 To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of MLN8237 within the
      confines of a Phase I study. 1.2.2 To obtain initial Phase II efficacy data on the anti-tumor
      activity of MLN8237 in children with relapsed-refractory neuroblastoma using the once daily
      dosing schedule. 1.2.3 To explore the relationship between polymorphic variations in the
      UDPglucuronyltransferase gene UGT1A1 and exposure to MLN8237.

      1.2.4 To assess two common polymorphic variants in the Aurora A kinase gene (Phe31Ile and
      Val57Ile) thought to potentially influence tumorigenesis. 1.2.5 To preliminarily examine the
      relationsh
