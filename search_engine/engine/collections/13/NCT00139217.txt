      an effective method for reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and decreasing extrapulmonary
      right-to-left shunting at the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale in many patients with PPHN.
      However, in some patients with PPHN, sustained elevations of PVR may occur in the absence of
      or despite improvement in the parenchymal lung disease such that mechanical ventilation is
      not needed for maintaining adequate gas exchange.

      PPN in the absence of pulmonary parenchymal disease or despite improvement in the parenchymal
      lung disease occurs in a significant subset of newborn infants with hypoxemic respiratory
      failure. Inhaled NO can be effectively delivered by non-invasive techniques to newborn
      infants with PPHN, potentially reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation, while safely
      treating the elevation in pulmonary artery pressure and right-to-left.

      A dose of 10-20 ppm measured within the delivery device is sufficient to maintain
      nasopharyngeal concentrations within a range of 1-10 ppm. My co-authors and I have also
      reported a series of eleven infants with pulmonary hypertension treated with low dose iNO
      delivered via nasal cannula after extubation at the 14th Annual CNMC Symposium on ECMO &
      Advanced Therapies for Respiratory Failure, Keystone, CO, 1998.
