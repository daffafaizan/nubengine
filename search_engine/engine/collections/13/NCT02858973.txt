    
      Six (6) cohorts of 8 subjects (6 active and 2 placebo) are planned for evaluation. In each
      cohort, subjects will receive multiple oral doses of Q203 or placebo for 14 days QD with a
      standard meal. Subjects will participate in only one cohort.

      Safety (i.e., physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, and
      adverse events [AEs]) will be assessed throughout the study; serial blood and urine samples
      will be collected for these assessments. Blood samples will also be collected for the PK
      assessment of Q203.

      Escalation to the next dose level (i.e., initiation of the next cohort) will not take place
      until the Principal Investigator (PI), medical monitor, and representatives of the Sponsor
      have reviewed all available safety and tolerability from the previous cohorts and agree to
      the initiation of the next cohort.
