      infection. Complete daily neurological examinations will be routinely conducted in intensive
      care unit patients. Specific biological analyses will also be performed in these patients by
      collecting additional blood samples from an arterial or central catheter, every 2 days. These
      clinical and biological examinations will be continued throughout patient's stay in the
      intensive care unit.
