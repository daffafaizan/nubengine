      hepatocellular carcinoma, and PD-1 antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has compared the efficacy and safety of
      lenvatinib plus PD-1 antibody and lenvatinib alone. Thus, the investigators carried out this
      prospective randomized control study to find out it.
