      This is a multi-center, double blind, randomized control trial designed to assess the safety
      and efficacy of daily NB-UVB light for patients presenting to site hospitals over the age of
      50 with a positive COVID-19 panel and at least one comorbidity.

      This trial provides adjunctive therapy and no in-hospital treatments need to be modified in
      any way. The sponsor and the centers acknowledge standards of care are actively evolving and
      this trial is not intended to interfere in any form.

      Double Blind: Patient and Health care provider will be blinded to the treatment vs. placebo
      by use of a non-NB-UVB light card. All dosing and times for treatment and placebo will be
      calculated the same methods.

      Arm A: Control: Will receive non-NB-UVB light during the Treatment Period.

      Arm B: Treatment: Will receive NB-UVB light during the Treatment Period.

      Treatment Phase (Days 1-8): Treatment Schedule will be identical for arm A and B.

      Follow Up Phase (Days 9-28 or discharge): Follow-up will be identical for arms A and B.

      Blood Draw Schedule: Blood draws are to be performed after enrollment, before the first
      treatment day 1 and on days 3, 5, 8, 14 and day of discharge (if prior to day 14 unless blood
      draw has already occurred within one day of discharge).
