      Gaucher disease and does not involve the CNS. Typical manifestations of type 1 Gaucher
      disease include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia,
      hypermetabolism, skeletal pathology, growth retardation, pulmonary disease, and decreased
      quality of life. Velaglucerase alfa (Gene-Activatedâ„¢ human glucocerebrosidase;GA-GCB) is
      produced in a continuous human cell line using proprietary gene-activation technology and has
      an identical amino acid sequence to the naturally occurring human enzyme. Velaglucerase alfa
      contains terminal mannose residues that target the enzyme to the macrophages-the primary
      target cells in Gaucher disease. This treatment protocol will observe the safety of
      velaglucerase alfa in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who are either treatment naive
      (newly diagnosed) or who are currently being treated with the Enzyme Replacement Therapy
      (ERT) imiglucerase. Patients currently being treated with ERT for their Gaucher disease will
      receive the same number of units of velaglucerase alfa per month as their imiglucerase dose
      for doses between 30-120 U/kg/month. For patients who experienced dose reductions in their
      imiglucerase treatment due to supply constraints the pre-reduction monthly dose may be used
      to determine the monthly dose of velaglucerase alfa.
