    
      Part 1 ("initial part") - 4 weeks of treatment (28 days):

        -  All patients will complete an initial 4 weeks of treatment with HDV-Interferon (HDV-IFN)
           (treatment naïve by oral route and non-responders by SC route respectively) and
           ribavirin.

        -  The Part 1 of the study shall assess whether a 4-week treatment course with
           HDV-Interferon (HDV-IFN), orally or by subcutaneous injection, and ribavirin results
           similar efficacy [Rapid Virologic Response (RVR)] and safety as the reported efficacy
           and safety with pegylated alpha-interferon-2a and ribavirin (historical control) in
           patients with chronic hepatitis C (treatment naïve and non-responders).

      Part 2 ("continuation part") - 44 or 20 weeks of treatment + 24 weeks (follow-up period):

        -  Patients with hepatitis C viral genotype 1, who achieve RVR, will be treated for another
           44 weeks of therapy (to complete 48 weeks of active treatment) followed by 24 weeks of
           treatment-free follow-up period.

        -  Patients with hepatitis C viral genotype 3, who achieve RVR, will be treated for another
           20 weeks of therapy (to complete 24 weeks of active treatment) followed by 24 weeks of
           treatment-free follow-up period.

        -  Follow-up period (24 weeks): Thus, in addition to treatment in Part 1 of study, each
           completed patient with viral genotype 1 will receive 44 weeks of therapy and 24 weeks of
           treatment-free follow-up; and viral genotype 3 patients will have 20 weeks of therapy &
           24 weeks of treatment study drug free follow-up.

        -  Overall study duration (72 or 48 weeks): Patients with viral genotype 1 will have an
           overall study duration of 72 weeks (48 weeks of therapy plus 24 weeks follow-up) and
           patients with viral genotype 3 will have an overall study duration of 48 weeks (24 weeks
           of therapy plus 24 weeks follow-up).
