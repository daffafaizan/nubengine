    
      The LeLeDys study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam on
      levodopa-induced dyskinesias in advanced Parkinson's disease.

      The design is a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase
      IV study design.

      The hypothesis is that levetiracetam is able to reduce duration and severity of
      levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.

      The patients are planned to be treated with levetiracetam (up to 2000 mg per day) or placebo
      for 13 weeks. Efficacy measure is the modified AIMS.

      Main inclusion criteria are:

        -  Advanced Parkinson's disease (Hoehn & Yahr II-IV)

        -  Age of 30 to 80 years

        -  Levodopa-induced dyskinesias of at least 25% of the waking day and with moderate
           disability

        -  Stable dosage of antiparkinson medication and/or stable deep brain stimulation
           parameters for at least 4 week prior inclusion

        -  Written informed consent

      Main exclusion criteria are:

        -  Atypical parkinsonian syndromes

        -  Treatment with antipsychotics

        -  Epilepsia or seizure in the history

        -  Deep brain stimulation other than DBS in STN

        -  Pregnant or lactating women

        -  Severe dementia

      Methods:

        -  Primary outcome measure is the modified AIMS

        -  Secondary outcome measures include UPDRS, safety, patient day record

      Study medication:

        -  Levetiracetam (upt to 2000 mg / day)

        -  Matched Placebo
