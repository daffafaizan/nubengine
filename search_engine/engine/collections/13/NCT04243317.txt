      and adherence to a targeted behavioral sleep intervention for sleep impaired obese patients.

      Secondary objectives are to demonstrate that a targeted behavioral sleep intervention can
      improve treatment outcomes in obese adult outpatients enrolled to a lifestyle and dietary
      modification program; and to demonstrate that a targeted behavioral sleep intervention
      enhances the long-term maintenance of treatment gains in obese adults enrolled in a lifestyle
      and dietary modification program.

      Those with sleep impairment (sleep duration of ≤6.5hours per 24-hours; and/or poor sleep
      quality [<85% efficiency]; and/or misaligned nocturnal sleep timing [>03:00 on weekdays]) who
      are also obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] ≥27.5 kg/m2) will be recruited and randomized to a
      12-week weight loss intervention (based on a previously developed specialist lifestyle
      management program) with/without sleep improvement (based on a cognitive behaviour treatment
      developed to treatment sleep problems in US military). Volunteers will be followed for a
      further six months to assess multiple outcome measures. Other secondary measures to be
      assessed are mood (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS], food intake (24-hour food
      recall), quality of life (IWQOL-LITE & EQ-5D), and sleep (PSQI & RU_SATED), all of which will
      be assessed using validated questionnaires that have been previously assessed for
      reliability.

      It is hypothesised that inclusion of a targeted behavioral sleep improvement intervention
      will be feasible and acceptable and will enhance immediate and long-term treatment outcomes
      of obese adults enrolled to a lifestyle and dietary modification program. The results of the
      study will be used to better inform the design and development of a future Randomized
      Controlled Trial (RCT).

      Sleep improvement may be incorporated into weight management treatments as a cost-effective
      alternative/addition.
