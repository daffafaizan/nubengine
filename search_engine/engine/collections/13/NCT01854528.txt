    
      A randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      antiviral activity of the 3-DAA regimen (ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 [ABT-450/r/ABT-267] and
      ABT-333) plus ribavirin (3-DAA/RBV) compared with the combination of telaprevir (TPV) with
      RBV and pegIFN (TPV/RBV) in noncirrhotic participants with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype
      1 (HCV GT1) infection who were previously treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin
      (pegIFN/RBV).

      Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 3-DAA/RBV (ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and
      ABT-333 plus RBV for 12 weeks) or TPV/RBV (TPV co-administered with pegIFN and RBV for 12
      weeks, followed by followed by pegIFN and RBV for either 12 or 36 weeks, per local
      prescribing information).
