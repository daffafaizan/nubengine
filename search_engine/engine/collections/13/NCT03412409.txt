      receive haplo-HSCT. The elderly patients were defined as older than 55 years. The burden of
      comorbidities in HSCT recipients was assessed based on the hematopoietic cell
      transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), and patients with score â‰¥3 were assigned
      as high burden. The primary end point was transplant-related mortality, and the secondary
      endpoints included overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, engraftment,
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infections. Following time is 1 years.
