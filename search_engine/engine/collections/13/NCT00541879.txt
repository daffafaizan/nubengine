      health explorations directed at type 2 diabetes, obesity and their prevention in three
      elementary schools serving children at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Diabetes knowledge was
      measured in children and parents at the beginning, end and 9 months after the end of the
      intervention using validated questionnaires.
