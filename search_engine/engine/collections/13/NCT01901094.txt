      I. To evaluate whether radiation to the undissected axilla and regional lymph nodes is not
      inferior to axillary lymph node dissection with radiation to the regional lymph nodes but not
      to the dissected axilla in terms of invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval in
      patients with positive sentinel lymph node(s) (SLN[s]) after completion of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether radiation to the undissected axilla and regional lymph nodes is not
      inferior to axillary lymph node dissection with radiation to the regional lymph nodes but not
      to the dissected axilla in terms of the incidence of invasive loco-regional recurrences in
      patients with a positive SLN(s) after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      II. To obtain an estimate of the distribution of residual disease burden scores.

      III. To estimate the distribution of overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo axillary lymph node dissection. Beginning 3-12 weeks following
      surgery, patients undergo nodal radiation therapy comprising 3-dimensional (3D) conformal
      radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or proton radiation
      therapy (PRT) 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo axillary and nodal radiation therapy comprising 3D-CRT, IMRT, or PRT
      5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 6 months for 2
      years and then annually for 3 years.
