      I. To determine whether overall survival of patients with uterus-limited high-grade
      leiomyosarcoma is superior among patients assigned to treatment with adjuvant gemcitabine
      hydrochloride (gemcitabine) plus docetaxel followed by doxorubicin hydrochloride compared to
      patients assigned to observation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether treatment with adjuvant gemcitabine plus docetaxel followed by
      doxorubicin improves recurrence-free survival of patients with uterus-limited high-grade
      leiomyosarcoma compared to observation.

      II. To explore the impact of potential predictors of recurrence or death such as patient age,
      institution reported tumor size, cervix involvement (yes or no), and mitotic rate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 70-90 minutes on days 1
      and 8 and docetaxel IV over 30-60 minutes on day 8. Patients also receive filgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 9-15 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 9 or 10. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then undergo computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      Patients with no evidence of disease receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV every 21 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive
      filgrastim SC on days 2-8 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 2 or 3.

      Arm II: Patients undergo clinical observation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients in both arms are followed up every 4 months for
      3 years and then every 6 months for 2 years.
