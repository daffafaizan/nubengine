      Saxony-Anhalt" (PaReSiS) implements a case management trial, explicitly including all
      providers in the course of illness, treatment and rehabilitation. To achieve this, patients
      in the intervention group have the opportunity to choose, specifically and according to their
      own needs, from the offers of a web portal and a telephone hotline, from individual
      counselling and info sessions as well as from home visits. Patients in the control group
      receive patient-information-notes beyond primary care. There will be qualitative interviews
      with the persons concerned and/or their relatives in both groups in order to validate the
      instruments.
