      weaning in mechanical ventilated patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to undergo a
      spontaneous breathing trial in one of two ways: with a T-piece therapy or with high flow
      oxygen therapy. Primary end-points are rate of weaning failure and rate of reintubation
      within 48 hr of extubation. Weaning failure is defined as failed to spontaneous breathing
      trial or reintubation within 48 hr of extubation. Secondary end-points are ICU mortality,
      in-hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, time to reintubation after extubation. Study
      sample was calculated to detect ability of high flow oxygen therapy to reduce weaning failure
      from 42 to 15 percent, at two-tailed alpha error of 5% and power of 85% and 98 patients are
      needed in each arm.
