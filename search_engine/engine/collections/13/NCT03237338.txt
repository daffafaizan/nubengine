      healthy) will participate in the study. All subjects will undergo a laboratory blood test,
      physical and neurological examination, polysomnography (PSG) and an extensive battery of
      neuropsychological assessments. All subjects meeting eligibility criteria for the study will
      complete a baseline MRS and fMRI to evaluate differences in multi-modality brain GABA and
      fMRI parameters between the patients and healthy. After randomized acupuncture treatment,
      investigators will compare brain metabolic and functional parameters to elucidate the neural
      mechanism of acupuncture therapy on insomnia, provide theoretical evidence from the
      perspective of neurotransmitters and brain network.
