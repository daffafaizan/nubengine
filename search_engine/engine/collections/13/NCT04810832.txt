      of consciousness in DOC (disorder of consciousness) patients. The P3 wave, elicited by
      listening standard and deviant stimuli, corresponds to the activation of a frontoparietal
      network and is considered to reflect a cognitive attention task. Using the own name of the
      patient as deviant stimuli improve the ability to detect the P3 wave because of the
      particularly relevance of this stimulus for the patient.

      In human cognition, to identify the expressivity valence of a voice is essential. Neural
      processing of expressive voices should involves more widespread brain areas than neutral
      voices processing.

      Here the investigators investigate the intracerebral correlates of the P3a responses recorded
      on the scalp to own-name stimuli uttered by neutral and more expressive voices (positive :
      smiling voice or negative : rough voice) in adult pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients.
