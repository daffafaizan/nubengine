    
      Monocentric non-blinded superiority randomized controlled trial: standardized analgesic
      protocol + virtual reality device vs. standardized analgesic protocol alone for abdominal VAC
      dressing change.

      The day of the procedure, each patient will receive a standardized local and systemic
      analgesia 30 minutes before starting the procedure. The referring surgeon will explain at
      this moment every step of the procedure of bedside abdominal VAC dressing change.

      Baseline levels of pain and anxiety will be assessed by use of VAS (0-10) and one additional
      questionnaire (STAI).

      Virtual reality device will be activated 15 minutes before the beginning of the procedure and
      will remain as long as the procedure is going on and for 15minutes after finishing the wound
      dressing.

      15 minutes after removing the VRD and 30minutes after finishing the wound dressing the STAI
      questionnaire and VAS for anxiety, pain and satisfaction (0-10) will be completed by the
      patient.
