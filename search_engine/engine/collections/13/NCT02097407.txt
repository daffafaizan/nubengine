      profoundly inhibits pharyngeal and laryngeal reactivity. A previous report showed that the
      effect-site concentration of propofol for successful classic LMA insertion in 50% of adults
      (EC50) without muscle relaxants in healthy male patients was 8.72 (0.55) Âµg ml-1. The EC50 of
      propofol may be dependent on the type of LMA used. A previous study comparing the EC50 of the
      propofol concentration between classic and proseal LMA insertions demonstrated that the EC50
      of propofol needed for proseal LMA insertion was 35% greater than that needed for classic LMA
      insertion. Unfortunately, no investigation has been performed to determine the EC50 of the
      propofol concentration required for i-gel insertion without muscle relaxants.

      Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective alpha-2 agonist, has sympatholytic, sedative, and
      analgesic properties. Such beneficial characteristics make DEX a useful anaesthetic adjuvant
      for general anaesthesia. Many reports have revealed the beneficial effects of DEX in terms of
      reducing intraoperative anaesthetic requirements, postoperative analgesic demand, and
      increased haemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli such as endotracheal intubation. A
      previous investigation showed that preoperative clonidine, an alpha-2 agonist, decreased the
      EC50 required for LMA insertion.

      We hypothesised that preoperative DEX administration can reduce the propofol concentration
      required for i-gel insertion. In this study, we compared the EC50 of propofol needed for
      successful i-gel insertion without muscle relaxants between DEX and placebo groups
