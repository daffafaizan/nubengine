    
      Schizophrenia is a common and highly disabling psychiatric disorder with population
      prevalence around 1%. The manifestations of schizophrenia fall into three major domains: 1)
      "positive" symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganization of behavior; 2)
      "negative symptoms," including social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and reduced expression
      of affect; and 3) cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive deficits are seen in most patients with
      schizophrenia.

      Eltoprazine has agonist effects on both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, which suggests that this
      drug may be useful for normalizing prefrontal cognitive abilities, reducing aggression and
      impulsivity, and improving cognitive function in schizophrenia.

      This study will compare the effects of Eltoprazine (as an adjunctive treatment to
      anti-psychotics) with Placebo in Adults with a DSM IV/DSM IV TR diagnosis of schizophrenia,
      in potentially improving one or more dimensions of cognitive impairment associated with
      schizophrenia.
