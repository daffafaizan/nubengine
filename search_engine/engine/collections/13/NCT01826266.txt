      given a single dose of edoxaban followed in 3 hours by a single IV dose of PER977. The
      purpose is to show safety and tolerability of PER977 alone and when combined with a NOAC
      (edoxaban). The study will also provide some insight into the doses that may be required to
      reverse a steady state edoxaban.
