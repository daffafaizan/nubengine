    
      RAISE trial will recruit 160 patients, and they will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to four groups
      (radiotherapy group, apatinib group, radiotherapy+apatinib group and control group). Patients
      in radiotherapy group will receive Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) at a dose of
      50Gy/25fraction after randomization. Patients in apatinib group will receive oral apatinib at
      an initial dose of 500mg/qd until recurrence, patient withdrawal or unacceptable toxic
      effects. Patients in radiotherapy+apatinib group will receive Intensity Modulated Radiation
      Therapy (IMRT) at a dose of 50Gy/25fraction after randomization and after radiotherapy they
      will receive oral apatinib at an initial dose of 500mg/qd until recurrence, patient
      withdrawal or unacceptable toxic effects. Patients on the control arm will be actively
      monitored after randomization.
