      become shallow and cannot fully cover the femoral head and the centre of the hip joint moves
      outward, resulting in an increased risk for joint subluxation or dislocation.

      Current diagnosis of acetabular dysplasia mainly depends on the pelvic anteroposterior X-ray
      film to understand whether there is dislocation of the hip joint, whether the concentricity
      of the femoral head and acetabulum is consistent, and whether there is secondary
      osteoarthritis or other hip diseases, such as femoral head ischemic necrosis, hip joint
      tuberculosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The commonly used measurement indicators include
      centre-edge (CE) angle, acetabular angle (Sharp angle), and acetabular head index (AHI).
      Moreover, some differences exist in the measurement results between male and female patients.
      Acetabular dysplasia often accompanies by acetabular bone hyperplasia and necrosis of the
      femoral head, which have a greater impact on radiographic measurements, especially when
      measured with angles. It is difficult to determine the radiological landmark for the lateral
      edge of the acetabular roof due to the existence of bone hyperplasia, which produces a great
      influence on the accuracy of the measurement of the centre-edge angle and Sharp angle.
