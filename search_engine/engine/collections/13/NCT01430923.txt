      drugs at 2-8Ëš C in consumer end and also to avoid risk during transition. This formulation
      has the best solubilizing agent cyclodextrin to increase the solubility and stability of
      latanoprost API. To find out the efficacy and safety due to this additional excipient in this
      formulation rather than the cold storage product the investigators have to perform clinical
      trial.
