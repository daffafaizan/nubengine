      downregulating Th1-type cytokines, making Th1 / Th2 shift to Th2, inducing maternal serum
      IL-6 and sIL6R, PIBF, EGF; inducing the expression of Fas / Fasl on lymphocyte surface;
      increasing the proportion of CD8 + cells, Th2-type cells and CD + CD25 + Treg cells,
      decreasing the activity of CD56 + CD16 + NK cell and so on.The purpose of this study is to
      observe the treatment effects of active immunotherapy on uRM and RIF patients. What's more,we
      will used flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods to characterize
      Th1„ÄÅTh2 and Treg cell populations after immunotherapy,ecpecting to find out the exact
      molecule mechanism of immunotherapy with paternal or third party lymphocytes.
