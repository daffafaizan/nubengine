      a surgery. The most efficient glucose control, in patients with diabetes type II, reduces the
      risk of microvascular complications. Diabectic patients who underwent scheduled cardivacular
      or noncardiovascular surgeries show an increase rate of immediate and long-term
      complications. The most frequent complications are infections, cardiovascular events and
      death.

      Intensive insulinisation during cardiovascular surgery reduces the risk of a new coronary
      event in the immediate post surgery. No studies have been found that show the evaluation of
      Hemoglobin A1c values before the surgery and the immediate post surgery complications.

      A poor glycemic control has been associated to a large number of chronic complications like
      diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy and infection disease. The Hemoglobin A1c is
      used like a marker of the glycemic control in the last 120 days and has a correlation with
      the no enzyme glicosilation. This marker could have a relation with the complication after
      the programmed surgery.

      This study will evaluate the incidence of complications in the immediate post operatory in
      patients with diabetes type II in relation to the hemoglobin A1c before the surgery. If the
      hemoglobin A1c has a correlation with the incidence of cardiovascular complications, this
      could mark a change in the therapeutic measures prior the programmed surgery.
