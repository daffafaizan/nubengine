      and IBD in forgiveness, the existence of a correlation between the rate of cortisol(Hormone
      of the stress) and the level of HRV (Heart Rate Variability) to estimate the inhibitive
      fronto-amygdalien tonus.

      So we make the hypothesis that the persons affected by digestive pathologies of type SII or
      IBD would present an emotional and physiological vulnerability more important than unhurt
      subjects of pathologies.
