      could be kept in much low level. However, until now, the optimal dose-volume parameters for
      limiting heart irradiation, the optimal follow-up interval for cardiac safety after adjuvant
      radiotherapy, the optimal screening examinations and treatments for irradiation-induced
      cardiac toxicity are unclear. We designed this trial to find answer for above questions to
      establish rationalization proposal for prevention, treatment and follow-up for cardiac
      toxicity associated with adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer.
