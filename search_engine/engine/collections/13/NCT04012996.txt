      safe and effective as a similar, currently marketed cervical disc prosthesis to treat
      symptomatic cervical disc disease (SCDD) in subjects at two contiguous levels from C3 to C7
      who are unresponsive to conservative management. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio
      to either the two-level prodisc C SK or prodisc C Vivo device (investigational group) or to
      the two-level Mobi-C device (control group). Subjects will be followed for at least 2 years
      and up to 5 years. Subjects will be required to complete subject questionnaires, have X-rays
      and undergo neurological assessments during the follow up visits as specified in the
      protocol.
