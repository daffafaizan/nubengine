      amoxicillin 1 g and clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day for 10 days). Genotypic
      resistance-guided tailored therapy is the method which is chosen by DPO-PCR test. While the
      patients who have positive result of clarithromycin resistance receive the quadruple
      therapy(PPI standard dose, bismuth 300mg twice daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times daily,
      metronidazole 500mg three times daily for 10 days), clarithromycin susceptible patients
      receive the triple therapy.

      H. pylori is difficult to cultivate, cultivation of H. pylori and minimum inhibitory
      concentration test as a resistance test method are very difficult and take a long time.
      Recently, tailored treatment based on clarithromycin susceptibility has been proposed by
      dual-priming oligonucleotide-based multiplex (DPO)-PCR test. This is a method to confirm the
      mutation of A2142G and A2143G by PCR, which are known to be highly related to the resistance
      of clarithromycin 23S rRNA point mutation. This test is performed only by gastric biopsy. The
      examination time is also short as several hours, and sensitivity and specificity are about
      80-85%.

      Antibiotic resistance of H. pylori, especially clarithromycin resistance, is a cause of major
      failure of its eradication, and Korea 's clarithromycin resistance rate is reported to be
      about 37%. The eradication rate of standard triple therapy reported in Korea is also
      unsatisfactory as antibiotic resistance rate of H. pylori increases. The ideal eradication
      rate for H. pylori is approximately 90%, but in the meta-analysis of the recently reported
      primary eradication, the overall eradication rate was 74.6% in the intention to treat
      analysis.
