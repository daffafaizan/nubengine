      High-Definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) with an intensity of 2 mA
      (HD-tDCS 2 mA); (2) 20-min of HD-tDCS with an intensity of 1.5 mA (HD-tDCS 1.5 mA); and (3)
      20-min of sham HD-tDCS (HD-tDCS sham). The stimulation was administered noninvasively using
      an M x N 9-channel high definition transcranial electrical current stimulator from Soterix
      Medical (New York, NY). The anodal stimulation targeted the right Brodmann area 4 (primary
      motor cortex) based on HD-Targets brain modelling software (Soterix Medical, New York, NY).

      Tests: The non-dominant left arm was tested. The subjects performed a sequential
      point-to-point movement task on the graphics tablet. Initially, the participants were
      required to perform 3 sequences without errors to familiarize themselves with the setup, the
      task and the sequence. Then, they performed the pre-test which consisted of two blocks of 6
      sequences, i.e. 12 sequences, with a 30 s break between blocks. Two min after starting the
      appropriate stimulation, they performed 2 blocks of 6 sequences (identical to the pre-test).
      After finishing the tDCS stimulation, the participants performed a post-test, which was also
      identical to the pre-test. The participants returned after 24 hours to perform a retention
      test, which was equivalent to the pre- and post-tests. Two outcome measures were used:
      movement time (s) and the reaction time (s) of the reaching movements.
