      often associated with rapid muscle fatigue which becomes the limiting factor in its
      applications. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effects on the onset of
      fatigue of conventional synchronous stimulation, as well as asynchronous stimulation that
      mimic voluntary muscle activation targeting different motor units which are activated
      sequentially or randomly via multiple pairs of stimulation electrodes. Three different
      approaches with various electrode configurations will be investigated, as well as different
      patterns of stimulation applied to the gastrocnemius muscle. In addition, the muscle changes
      during different patterns of stimulation will be evaluated in this study.
