      millions of people worldwide and leading to reduced survival, increased progression of latent
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), and even new onset of CKD. More than half of intensive care
      unit (ICU) patients underwent AKI in a recent multinational cross-sectional study, often
      resulting in the need for renal replacement therapy with a high socio-economic impact for the
      patients.The effective precaution and treatment strategy remains limited.

      As the most general and first-line biguanide antihyperglycemic drug, metformin has
      anti-inflammatory characteristics and is related with decreased all-cause mortality compared
      with other antihyperglycemics.. In some clinical trials and experimental studies conducted on
      divergent rodent models representing various types of kidney diseases going from AKI to CKD,
      metformin has been shown beneficial effects on the kidney. Moreover, preadmission metformin
      exposure is associated with a lower rate of 28-day mortality among AKI patients showed in
      several clinical studies.

      However, in critical care patients with type 2 diabetes, the evidence of preadmission
      metformin usage decreasing a risk of AKI incidence is still absented. Therefore we performed
      a retrospective cohort study to validate the association of preadmission metformin exposure
      and AKI incidence in patients with diabetes in the ICU .
