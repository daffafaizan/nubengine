      these patients suffer from neurodevelopmental disabilities. The pathophysiology of brain
      injury in the preterm infant is unclear, although haemodynamic disturbances during the period
      of transitional circulation after birth leading to ischemia-reperfusion events seem to play
      an important role. Up to one third of infants born under 30 weeks of gestation develop low
      systemic flow as measured by Doppler-echocardiography (low superior vena cava flow, SVCF);
      this finding has been associated with poor neurological outcome. Yet, it has not been
      systematically evaluated whether the treatment of this hemodynamic condition is beneficial or
      not. This study aims to evaluate if treating low systemic flow in preterm infants with
      dobutamina, DB, (inotrope-sympathicomimetic drug) has any effect on the cerebral circulation;
      specific interest of our research would be to target DB dose for individual patientÂ´s
      response. Secondly, by means of two non-invasive technologies (cerebral and cardiac
      ultrasonography-Doppler and near infrared spectroscopy, NIRS), the investigators search to
      characterise eventual differences in brain perfusion patterns during the adaptation to the
      transitional circulation that might be associated with the development of brain injury in the
      most vulnerable population.
