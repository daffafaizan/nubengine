      humidification performance of the prototype mask systems in CPAP established patients. The
      performance of the prototype Menai mask systems (full face, nasal, and pillows variants) will
      be subjectively assessed through user questionnaires based on an 11-point Likert scale, and
      will be compared against Comparison masks.

      The prototype masks share the same parts (cushion, frame, headgear), with the difference
      being that the Menai masks feature a novel vent and humidification system.
