      active duty who experience chronic pain as a result of the injury and who receive treatment
      as active duty military personnel at Department of Defense facilities or through the
      Department of Veteran's Affairs. The population will include patients with pain related to
      limb amputation, and patients eligible for care in the Veteran's Administration Polytrauma
      Network program (Polytrauma Veterans) or for management of similar injuries within the
      Department of Defense health care system. Study subjects will have complex problems that are
      difficult to treat with current standard rehabilitative approaches. The circumstances of
      these patients' injuries create a substantial societal interest in determining and providing
      the best achievable rehabilitation, an interest that combines the expectation that medical
      science will advance the quality of medical care, practical benefits to subjects and society
      of returning patients to active duty or employment, and the moral imperative to support
      persons injured while defending our national security.
