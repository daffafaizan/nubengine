      efficacy and safety of RGX-314 gene therapy in participants with nAMD. The study will
      evaluate 2 dose levels of RGX-314 relative to an active comparator. The primary endpoint of
      this study is mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of RGX-314 relative to
      ranibizumab. Approximately 300 participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will
      be enrolled into one of 3 arms.
