    
      Primary outcome:

      1. progression free survival (PFS) evaluated according to RECIST1.1.

      Secondary outcome:

        1. Objective Response Rate (ORR), Overall Survival (OS), Disease Control Rate (DCR),
           Duration of Response (DOR) evaluated according to RECIST1.1, and Quality of Life(QOL).

        2. The overall incidence of adverse events (AE); the incidence of grade 3 or above AE; the
           incidence of serious adverse events (SAE); the incidence of AE leading to the
           termination of the trial drug; the incidence of AE leading to the suspension of the
           trial drug.

        3. Exploratory research: PFS, ORR, DOR, DCR evaluated according to iRECIST.

        4. Exploratory analysis of potential biomarkers related to efficacy. The characteristics of
           tumor tissue PD-L1expression, panel-captured next generation sequencing(NGS), RNA-seq,
           T-Cell Repertoire (TCR), multiple immunofluorescence and other biomarkers, and the
           correlation analysis of biomarkers with efficacy and safety.
