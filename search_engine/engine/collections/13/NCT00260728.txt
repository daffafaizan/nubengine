      the Fusion™ Vascular Access Graft for patients in need of early vascular access for
      hemodialysis. The primary objective is to demonstrate that secondary patency at 6 months for
      the Fusion™ Vascular Access Graft is not less than an objective performance criterion (OPC)
      minus a clinically relevant margin (δ). The OPC represents secondary patency at 6 months for
      the standard of care access grafts.

      The secondary safety endpoint is the occurrence of CEC-adjudicated device or procedure
      related adverse events through 24 months post implant procedure, or through discharge for
      patients with unsuccessful device implantation. Secondary efficacy endpoints include:primary
      patency; primary assisted patency; ability to revise a failed graft; early access capability;
      time to hemostasis.

      Subjects will undergo a thorough medical assessment and physical examination pre-procedure
      and will be assessed peri-procedure. Enrolled subjects with a device implanted will be
      evaluated at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post implant procedure.
