      Zambian National TB Program (NTP) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) will provide near
      point-of-care Xpert testing at a high-volume anti-retroviral treatment (ART) clinic in
      Lusaka, Zambia. A total 892 study participants will be enrolled into two parallel cohorts-an
      "Xpert" and a "standard of care" (SOC) cohort over a 7-month period. The Xpert cohort will
      enrol participants at the health centre implementing Xpert. The SOC cohort will enrol
      participants from one health centre offering the standard of care (sputum smear microscopy
      plus clinical evaluation). A parallel-group prospective cohort study will be conducted by
      following participants in one cohort from each site for 210 days from the time of sputum
      submission, allowing sufficient person-time to observe all outcomes of interest, including
      completion of a standard course of ATT as well as patient drop-out and loss to follow-up.

      A systematic facility assessment survey using an adapted version of the WHO Service
      Availability and Readiness Assessment tool will be conducted. Key informants will be
      interviewed.
