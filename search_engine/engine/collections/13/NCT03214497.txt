      each group. We hypothesize that there will be a difference of 4 cm H2O between the 2 masks,
      because of the different material and slightly different form of the masks. Secondary
      outcomes will be measured after insertion of the LMA as by protocol. Finally postoperative
      airway morbidity will be evaluated 3 hours after removal of the LMA.
