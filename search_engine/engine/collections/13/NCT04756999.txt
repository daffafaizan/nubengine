      circulation in the body by manually stimulating the reflex points in the hands and feet
      corresponding to all parts of the body, organs and systems. In the literature, there are many
      studies conducted in different samples to evaluate the effectiveness of reflexology massage.
      Hemodialysis patients are also included in these samples. Hemodialysis patients are faced
      with many physical and emotional symptoms such as lifestyle changes, psychosocial effects,
      side effects due to treatment, during their treatment process. Nurses play an important role
      in alleviating and eliminating these complaints. Objective: It is aimed to determine the
