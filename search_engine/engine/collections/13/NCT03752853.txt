      Patients will be recruited from an ongoing project providing an internet-based cognitive
      behavioral intervention for patients suffering from mild to moderate depression.

      Protocol:

      In this study, a total of N=42 patients fulfilling criteria for a current major depressive
      episode will undergo a 6-week internet-based cognitive behavioural intervention which
      consists of seven consecutive modules. Diurnal (salivary) and hair cortisol as well as
      diurnal (salivary) alpha-amylase will be assessed immediately before and after treatment, and
      at mid-treatment (i.e., after four of seven modules). Saliva samples (six samples per day)
      will be collected over two consecutive days. One hair sample will be obtained at pre- and
      post-intervention assessments respectively.
