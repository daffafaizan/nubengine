      peripheral blood stem cell support and amifostine cytoprotection in patients with cancer. II.
      Determine the complete response rate, event free survival, overall survival, and nonrelapse
      mortality in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of melphalan. Prior to high dose melphalan and
      amifostine cytoprotection, patients may receive cyclophosphamide IV. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is
      given until cytapheresis is completed. Patients receive high dose melphalan according to an
      escalating dose schedule. High dose melphalan is administered IV on day -1. Amifostine is
      also administered on days -2 and -1. Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is performed
      on day 0. Dose escalation of high dose melphalan continues until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 8 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity. After the MTD of high dose melphalan is determined,
      additional patients are treated at this dose level. Patients are followed at days 30, 100,
      365, and yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: After the determination of MTD, a total of 14-25 patients will be accrued
      for this study.
