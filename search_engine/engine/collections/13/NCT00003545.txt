      I. Determine the complete and partial remission rates, as well as the remission duration, in
      patients with refractory or relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic
      lymphoma receiving 506U78 on an alternate day schedule (days 1, 3, 5).

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of 506U78 administered on this schedule to this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. If residual leukemia/lymphoma is
      present on day 22, then patients receive a second course of 506U78. If day 22 marrow is
      hypocellular, then a repeat bone marrow biopsy should be obtained on day 29 to assess
      response. For day 22 or 29 marrow that is in complete response, patients receive 506U78 for
      two more courses on days 1, 3, and 5, administered every 21 days. Patients are followed every
      3 month for 1 year, then every 6 months for a maximum of 10 years.
