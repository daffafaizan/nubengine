    
      Under study are the PersonaÂ® Revision Knee System (K181947 and K191625) implants and
      instrumentation, and any compatible devices being used in conjunction according to the
      Instructions for Use. This will be accomplished by retrospectively identifying patients who
      underwent primary or revision TKA with this system and inviting them to participate in
      prospective data collection at 1 and 2-years postoperative follow-up. As the device was not
      available for commercial use until late 2019, the retrospective portion will involve those
      activities that occurred per standard of care for participants.

      The primary endpoint for this study will be performance assessed by improvement in the 1989
      Knee Society Clinical Rating System (KS) objective knee score (KS-KS) from baseline to 2
      years (as evaluated using the overall group mean showing at least the Minimal Clinically
      Important Difference (MCID) of 5.4 points).

      A maximum of 20 sites will contribute to this study. There will be a maximum of 380 patients
      enrolled in the study.
