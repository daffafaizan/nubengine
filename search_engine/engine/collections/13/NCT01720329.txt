      care facilities to either probiotics or placebo to assess whether probiotics can reduce
      influenza and other viral laboratory confirmed respiratory infection. The investigators will
      determine whether it is feasible to enroll residents and randomize them to a daily course of
      probiotics or placebo and monitor for influenza and other respiratory tract infections. In
      addition, the investigators will asses the feasibility of obtaining a nasal specimen for
      evaluation of the upper respiratory microbiome, measure antimicrobials, and deterioration in
      functional status. All aspects of the proposed trial will be assessed, including enrollment,
      randomization, respiratory infection surveillance, methods for outcome assessment, and event
      rates. The investigators will test the use of our data collection forms and data management
      strategy and will generate date to derive an appropriate sample size.
