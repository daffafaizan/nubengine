      at outpatient urology clinics associated with New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). The
      intervention is supplementation with oral ergocalciferol 50,000 IU per week for 8 weeks, and
      each participant will serve as his/her own control. The formulation, dose, and duration of
      vitamin D therapy is reflective of that which is given in routine clinical practice to
      patients with vitamin D deficiency. The outcome is the change in urinary calcium excretion.
