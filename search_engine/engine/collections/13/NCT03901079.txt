    
      All subjects who are candidates for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), signed the
      informed consent form and had chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) lesion will be evaluated
      for enrollment in this study.At least 100 subjects will be enrolled. Each site will be
      allowed to enroll up to a maximum of 25 subjects.

      Primary Effectiveness Endpoint:

      Technical Success: the ability of the BridgePoint Medical System to successfully facilitate
      placement of a guidewire beyond a CTO lesion in the true vessel lumen/within the collaterals
      in those cases that were otherwise refractory to treatment with a currently marketed
      guidewire

      Primary Safety Endpoint:

      30-day MACE rate for CTO cases in which the BridgePoint Medical System was used.

      MACE is defined as the composite of cardiac death, Q-wave and non-Q-wave myocardial
      infarction(MI), and any ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization(TLR).
