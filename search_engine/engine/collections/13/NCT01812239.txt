    
      This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of asymptomatic women
      with twin pregnancy and a cervix length 10 mm to 25 mm discovered on a routine screening
      transvaginal sonogram between 20w0d to 24w0d gestational age. Women will be randomized in
      either the in-patient or out-patient setting (1:1) to a daily vaginal application of
      micronized progesterone cream(200 mg)vs. placebo to determine if daily vaginal progesterone
      administration reduces the risk of preterm birth prior to 34w0d of gestation.
