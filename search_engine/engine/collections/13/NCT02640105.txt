      no data exists on the link between CH and other addictions, and impact of these addictions on
      clinical characteristics of the disease. In addition, despite the strong biological link
      between CH and the vascular system, systematic investigations about vascular functions in CH
      patients are lacking.

      This will be a prospective cohort study of 150 patients with CH, conducted in the Headache
      Center in Bordeaux, France.
