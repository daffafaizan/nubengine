      insulin-glucagon-glucose (IGG) interactions in first and second degree relatives of patients
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can provide new information about the pathogenesis, prediction,
      and progression of the early stages of the disease. The project will enroll individuals from
      the "Living Biobank" of the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention (PTP) study who are phenotyped
      with respect to a variety of risk factors, including immunological abnormalities. To the best
      of available knowledge, the IGG relationships in general and the glucagon phenotype in
      particular have not been studied in this population. It is known, however, that in T1D the
      release of glucagon is altered, which is manifested by abnormal postprandial suppression and
      defective response to hypoglycemia. Several reports indicate that glucagon becomes
      dysregulated prior to the development of T1D, but comprehensive studies aiming to understand
      in detail the insulin-glucagon co-dynamics in people at risk for T1D have never been
      performed.

      Thus, the goal now is to expand the investigators' existing methodology and transfer
      expertise in clinical testing and analysis of the IGG system to characterize the IGG
      interactions in individuals at risk for developing T1D.
