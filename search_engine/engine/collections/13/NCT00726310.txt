      at up to ten centers, each of which will enroll approximately 20 patients. A maximum of 200
      patients will be enrolled. This patient sample size will allow statistical comparison to
      historical literature and allow an inter-center comparison of outcome. Enrollment into the
      study may include all patients who have lumbar spinal fusion performed. All spinal fusion
      surgery will be performed using the EBI SpineLinkÂ® system.
