      cardiac biomarkers and coronary artery disease in 43 runners participating in the 2018 Paavo
      Nurmi Marathon. The study participants were recruited according to two age criteria - under
      35 years and over 44 years of age. Comprehensive laboratory samples were collected
      immediately after the run, while the control workup was done in a separate visit with no
      significant physical excercise in the preceding two weeks. In the under 35 years -group, the
      control workup included an echocardiography, ecg and blood samples. In the over 44 years
      group, the control studies included coronary CT, echocardiography, ecg and laboratory tests.
