    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Phase III clinical trial for a
      new indication

      Rationale One of the most affected subgroups during the current pandemic is represented by
      healthcare workers. In Argentina between 14 and 17% of the total COVID-19 cases are
      represented by this subgroup. In this sense, it appears as an adequate strategy testing the
      efficacy of pharmacological PrEP approaches on top of the currently recommended control
      measures.

      The use of placebo is warranted for two main reasons: all healthcare workers will be allowed
      and encouraged to comply with non-pharmacological infection control measures for the
      protection of viral transmission. On the other hand, the use of a blinded placebo is intended
      for avoiding relaxation of the non-pharmacological control measures.

      Tenofovir has been identified by both docking and in vitro studies as an inhibitor of RdRp
      (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) of coronavirus.

      FTC/TAF has the additional advantage that is already being used in a pre-exposure prophylaxis
      setting and its safety is widely known.

      Main objective To evaluate the risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) in healthcare
      workers with high transmission risk in addition to currently recommended control measures.
