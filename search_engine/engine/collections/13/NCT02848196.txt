      dose delivered with VMAT technique in oligometastatic patients with adrenal gland metastases.
      The potential advantages of this approach include the possibility to lead an increased local
      control in irradiated adrenal gland metastases. Other purpose of this study is to assess
      acute and late toxicity in terms of maintenance of endocrine mechanisms of hormonal
      production.
