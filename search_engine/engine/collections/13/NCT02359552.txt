    
      The study consists of two phases: a 24 week double blind placebo controlled treatment period
      and a 4 week follow up period. Patients will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio at baseline to
      receive either Rasagiline or matching placebo

      The study drug will be given as 0.5 mg dose once daily for the 4 weeks, then increases to 1
      mg daily for the next 20 weeks. A total of 50 subjects will be enrolled: 25 will receive
      Rasagiline and 25 will receive matching placebo for the 24-week treatment period.

      Primary objective is to determine if exposure to 1 mg of Rasagiline daily is associated with
      improved regional brain metabolism in the treatment group compared to the placebo group in
      Alzheimer's Disease patients
