    
      To evaluate the effect of blood glucose levels on eating behavior in a population of patients
      with diabetes in a free-living environment; the investigators plan to study lean healthy
      control subjects (BMI <25 kg/m2) and obese non-diabetic subjects (BMI > 30 kg/m2).

      The participants who qualify will be invited to use the CGMS (DEXCOM G4 Platinum) for up to 7
      days. On the visit for placement of the CGMS: 1) the participants will be explained by one of
      the study physicians how to use a glucometer (FreeStyle or Accu-Check), 2) they will have the
      CGMS inserted under the skin, and 3) they will be instructed how to fill up the food log
      (informational brochures are available at the end of the protocol. On the second visit (up to
      7 days after the initial visit) the CGMS will be removed from the skin and the glucose meter
      and food log will be returned to the investigators.

      When this study was initially designed, it incorporated 2 additional arms in the study: T1DM
      and obese T2DM patients. These patients were never recruited for the study.
