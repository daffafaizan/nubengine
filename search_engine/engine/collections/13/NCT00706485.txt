           (dura). The Y-90 applicator and a "dummy" applicator will be brought to the surgery
           table in a protected container. A "dummy" applicator is the same size and shape as the
           Y-90 plaque applicator but does not contain radioactive plaque. The "dummy" applicator
           will be placed on the participants dura to make sure it fits properly, then it will be
           removed. The working Y-90 applicator will be placed on the dura for 10-17 1/2 minutes
           and then be removed.

        -  External beam irradiation is a type of high-energy radiation used to kill cancer cells
           and shrink tumors. This radiation will be given to the participant only if they have not
           had it prior to the study.

        -  After the treatment, participants will be asked to return for a follow-up visit 6 weeks,
           3 months, every 6 months thereafter for 4 years, then annually to year 10. At these
           visits, they will have the following: physical examination; recent medical history; MRI
           or CT scan (twice each year) and; chest x-ray or chest CT (twice each year).
