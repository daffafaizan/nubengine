      methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations is challenging. With the development of artificial
      intelligence, much more potential lies in the preoperative conventional/advanced MR imaging
      (T1 weighted imaging, T2 weighted imaging, FLAIR, contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging,
      diffusion-weighted imaging, and perfusion imaging) could be excavated to aid prediction of
      molecular pathology of gliomas. The creation of a registry for primary glioma with detailed
      molecular pathology, radiological data and with sufficient sample size for deep learning
      (>1000) provide considerable opportunities for personalized prediction of molecular pathology
      with non-invasiveness and precision.
