      respiratory failure will be evaluated. Participants will be divided into two groups as
      patients undergoing lung ultrasonography (Group Ultrasonography ) and those without lung
      ultrasonography (Group Control).

      While performing lung ultrasonography, each hemithorax will be evaluated using anterior
      axillary line and posterior axillary line into anterior, lateral and posterior region, and
      each region will be divided into 6 quadrants, upper and lower. Each hemithorax will be
      scanned by the investigators, scored in 6 regions using a convex ultrasonography probe with
      the Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS score).

      Participants in both groups will be evaluated by comparing arterial blood gas analyzes before
      examination (with/without ultrasonography), at the 2nd and 12th hours. Is there any change in
      arterial blood gas values such as PO2 and PCO2 at 0, 2 and 12 hours so that oxygenation and
      ventilation between Group Ultrasonograpy and Group Control will be evaluated?
