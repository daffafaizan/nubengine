      the introduction of more effective treatment options. Despite these advances, all patients
      eventually relapse and MM is generally considered incurable. LDE225 (Sonidegib) is an oral,
      investigational smoothened (SMO) inhibitor that has shown anti-tumor activity in certain
      cancers. Bortezomib is a highly active drug for the treatment of MM and has produced response
      rates in relapsed and/or refractory patients. This study will investigate the tolerability
      and feasibility of combining LDE225 with bortezomib in patients with bortezomib-sensitive
      relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM.
