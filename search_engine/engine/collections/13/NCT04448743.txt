      coronary artery diseases patients and from healthy volunteers without cardiovascular risk
      factors. Quantification of MPs will be realized by prothrombinase assay. Primary endothelial
      cells (ECs) from porcine coronary artery or porcine pulmonary artery will be isolated and
      cultured. ECs will be exposed to circulating MPs. Phenotypical changes (ACE2 expression,
      cytoadhesins, cytokines, tissue factor expression) of ECs will be examined. Susceptibility of
      ECs to SARS-COV-2 infection will be determined.
