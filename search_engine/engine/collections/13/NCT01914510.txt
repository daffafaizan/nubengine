      days will be called a cycle. While receiving the study drug, participants will be asked to
      visit the clinic for tests and procedures. During Cycle 1, participants will be asked to
      visit the clinic about once a week and during Cycle 2 and future cycles, participants will be
      asked to visit the clinic on days 1 and 15. As a part of the study, tumor tissue (archival
      and fresh tumor biopsy) will be taken for biomarker research. When participants stop the
      study drug, they will be asked to have an end of study drug visit.
