    
      The study aims to investigate immunomodulatory effects of eltrombopag combined with
      dexamethasone in young adult patients with newly diagnosed primary ITP.

        1. Intervention phase:

           Medical history and physical examination including assessment of severe bleeding every
           week until week 4, every second week until week 20. Complete blood count every week
           until week 10. For the adjustment of the Thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) dose -
           every second week until week 20. Immunologic panel at the beginning and at week 3 and
           20.

        2. Follow-up:

      Three clinical visits are scheduled in the follow-up including a complete blood count: at
      week 22, 24 and 30. Immunologic panel will be done at week 30 (end of study).

      High-dose dexamethasone (HD-DXM) will be administered orally (40 mg) from day 1-4, followed
      by Arm 1 or 2 (1:1 randomization) Arm 1: Standard Arm No planed further treatment. = standard
      therapy In case of non-response after 2 courses of HD-DXM (week 4): drop out and alternative
      therapy of ITP In case of relapse: repeat HD-DXM (40 mg day 1-4), up to maximal of 6 courses.
      Time between 2 courses should be minimal 14 days. Arm 2: Study Arm Eltrombopag (RevoladeÂ®),
      50 mg per os, from day 5-140. Tapering over 1 week from day 141-148 with 50 mg every second
      day. In case of non-response at week 4: drop out
