      combined with Axitinib in downsizing tumors in patients with nonmetastatic biopsy-proven
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Toripalimab is new antibody that may help activate the
      immune system by blocking the function of an inhibitory molecule, Programmed cell death-1
      (PD-1). This is a single-institution, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial. Patients will
      receive axitinib 5 mg bid combined with Toripalimab 3mg/KG q3w for up to 12 wk. Patients then
      will receive partial or radical nephrectomy after neoadjuvant therapy.
