      which group represents the most viable approach to behavioral weight loss treatment with
      18-25 year olds. A total of 381 participants,18-25 years of age, with a BMI between 25 and 45
      kg/m2 will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL), 2) BWL +
      Autonomous Motivation (BWL+Aut) or 3) BWL + Extrinsic Motivation (BWL+Ext). All arms will
      receive a 24-week behavioral weight loss intervention, including personalized dietary,
      physical activity, and weight loss prescriptions. In addition, all arms will be followed for
      a 6 month no treatment follow-up period. Assessments of weight and secondary outcomes will
      occur in 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. The investigators will compare treatment effects, across all
      3 arms at 6 months, and compare arms on weight loss maintenance at12 months. The
      investigators will also examine mediators of treatment outcomes consistent with the
      investigators theoretical framework.
