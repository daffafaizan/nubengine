      approximately 5 weeks followed by a high dose for approximately 5 weeks. Dose levels are
      calculated based on body weight cohorts. Heavy weight cohort >=40 kg, middle weight cohort
      >=25 kg to <40 kg. Light weight cohort<25 kg. Participants who complete Period 1 may continue
      taking tadalafil in Period 2 for at least 2 years. Starting dose will not exceed the maximum
      weight range dose established in Period 1 and after the first 3 months of Period 2, the dose
      may be adjusted based on available safety and efficacy information.
