      hypothesis that Tdap vaccinations at week 28 in pregnancy can reduce the incidence of
      preeclampsia by more than 50%. This project will recruit 1600 pregnant women with appropriate
      informed consent in the first trimester of pregnancy, obtain detailed obstetric and health
      history, and then randomize these subjects so 800 women receive Tdap at week 28, and 800
      women receive Tdap at week 36, and all women will be followed during their pregnancies using
      standard of care with special attention to preeclampsia and fetal outcomes. Blood samples
      will be obtained at weeks 12, 20, and 36 in order to test the anti-tetanus toxoid antibody
      levels, anti-diptheria antibody levels, anti-pertussis antibody levels, and also maternal
      cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, IL-17, and IFNg), and placental biomarkers (sFlt-1,
      sEng, and PIGF) for preeclampsia on those patients who develop preeclampsia and compare to
      those who didn't and thereby better understand the biomarkers of preeclampsia and devise a
      better formula for positive prediction for preeclampsia. To make this change in clinical
      practice and save lives, this study is asking for funding from NICHD PA-18-480.
