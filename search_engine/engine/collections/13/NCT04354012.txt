    
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory disease most
      frequently affecting the axilla, groin, and inframammary regions. Symptoms include nodules,
      abscesses, sinus tract formation, malodorous drainage, and scarring. These symptoms interfere
      with everyday activities, which can lead to social embarrassment and isolation. Patients with
      HS suffer psychological effects, such as increased levels of anxiety, depression, and
      loneliness, which impair quality of life.

      Patients suffer with the burden of at home wound care for recurrent, draining nodules.
      Persistent lesions affect patients' lives by limiting their daily activities. Currently,
      patients are instructed to use gauze and tape to cover draining wounds, but this can be
      insufficient and difficult due to the nature and location of lesions associated with HS.
      Patients suffer with caring for their wounds, which can lead to frustration. Providing
      patients with a standard wound care regimen to take home can improve patients' quality of
      life and control of their disease. General recommendations for wound care in HS patients are
      limited. Improvements in the standard of care for wound management in HS are needed to aid
      patients.
