      --- Study procedures

      Participants will be asked to:

        1. Consent: Participants will be asked to confirm their consent to take part by posting the
           enclosed consent form to the Investigators in a prepaid envelope.

        2. Device delivery: The Investigators will send participants the devices, a detailed
           instruction leaflet, and a questionnaire.

        3. Training: The Investigators will explain to participants how to wear and use the devices
           over the telephone, referring to the instruction leaflet.

        4. Wear the devices: Participants will be asked to wear the devices for seven days, going
           about their daily life as normal. The devices are waterproof. If a participant has chest
           hair then they will need to shave a small area for the chest-patch to stick to. The
           Investigators will ask participants to use the watch four times each day to record heart
           activity for 30 seconds. Participants will be asked to plug in a small hub which will
           send information from the devices. The Investigators will telephone participants during
           the study to check for any problems.

        5. Questionnaire: Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on the devices
           after wearing them.

        6. Return devices: At the end, the Investigators will telephone participants and arrange a
           courier to pick up the devices and questionnaire from their home (which the
           Investigators will arrange and pay for).

      Participants will be given an instruction leaflet with further details of each step.
