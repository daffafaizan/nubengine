      to describe the kinetics of the plasmatic viral load of a selection of at least 21 DNA and
      RNA viruses of the blood virome (Herpesviridae Polyomaviridae, Adenoviridae, Parvoviridae,
      Anelloviridae, Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant recipients, over a period of one year after transplantation. These DNA and RNA
      viruses can be responsible of acute infections, chronic infections or reactivations after
      transplantation. Secondary objectives are : 1) to assess the prevalence of DNA and RNA
      viruses plasmatic detections and co-detections at pre-specified time-points, 2) to assess the
      cumulative incidence of DNA and RNA viruses plasmatic detection at pre-specified time-points.
      The population of the study consists in adult patients receiving allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation at the University Hospitals of Geneva and who are enrolled in an already
      existing monocentric cohort named "Cohort of infectious disease in hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant patients" and for which clinical specimens are collected and stored at the time
      and after transplantation. The investigators plan to include 120 patients whose plasma
      samples are collected from March 2017 and to systematically use plasma samples collected at 5
      pre-specified time points (the day of transplantation, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and one
      year after transplantation) to perform qualitative and quantitative real-time r(RT)-PCR
      assays for the screening of DNA and RNA viruses. The definitive analysis of results should be
      done by the end of 2020.
