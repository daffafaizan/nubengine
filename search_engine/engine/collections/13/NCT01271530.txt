      groups should be utilised for exercise in polio survivors and that patients with severe
      atrophic polio or with recent weakness should not exercise, while March of Dimes (2001)
      recommend not exercising muscle groups where new weakness is being experienced. Floor or
      treadmill walking or lower limb cycling may also aggravate pain in those with lower limb
      weakness and altered lower limb biomechanics.

      Training with an upper limb ergometer is likely to be an appropriate form of exercise in
      patients with good, stable upper limb strength. One small, but well designed, trial of upper
      limb ergometry over 16 weeks resulted in a 19% increase in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in
      10 postpolio subjects exercising 3 times per week (Kriz et al 1992). ACSM recommend using a
      Schwinn Air-DyneTM four limb exerciser; however this is an expensive and bulky piece of
      equipment and is unlikely to be feasible for ongoing use by community dwelling polio
      survivors.

      A small upper limb ergometer may be a cost effective, accessible option for exercise for
      community dwelling polio survivors. A closely monitored and carefully prescribed
      cardiovascular fitness programme may enable polio survivors, who have gained control of
      symptoms of fatigue and pain through changes in lifestyle and activity, to increase fitness
      and perhaps subsequently reduce energy cost of walking.
