      intravenous acetaminophen on pain control for 24 hours postoperatively after minimally
      invasive 1 or 2 level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. The advantages of intravenous
      acetaminophen are well known in the literature and its opioid-sparing effects have been
      documented in multiple surgical studies.

      Multimodal regimens are now being advocated in the literature to decrease opioid use (8, 23).
      This is especially significant in spine surgery patients who often have chronic pain
      requiring long-term use of these habit-forming drugs as well as in patients who may not be
      able to tolerate opiods due to health status.

      To our knowledge there are no studies done in the U.S. on the opioid sparing and pain
      reducing effects of intravenous acetaminophen on patients undergoing elective minimally
      invasive 1 or 2 level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Investigating intravenous
      acetaminophen, particularly its pain reducing and opioid sparing effects, may give surgeons
      another medication for use in a multimodal approach to pain.
