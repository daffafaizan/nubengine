      I. To evaluate the effect of rolapitant hydrochloride (rolapitant) on nausea/vomiting in
      patients with sarcoma receiving multi-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) regimen of
      doxorubicin and ifosfamide (AI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of rolapitant in patients receiving AI regimen. II. To evaluate
      the effects of rolapitant on patient reported outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      PART I: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) daily and ondansetron IV on days
      1-5, and rolapitant hydrochloride orally (PO) on day 1.

      PART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive treatment as in part I. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone IV and ondansetron IV on days 1-5, and fosaprepitant
      dimeglumine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 of cycle 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CHEMOTHERAPY: All patients receive doxorubicin IV over 72 hours, mesna IV, and ifosfamide IV
      over 3 hours on days 1-4 or 1-5. Patients with sarcomas of small cell histology receive
      vincristine sulfate IV on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks following blood count and
      patient recovery from any acute toxicities.
