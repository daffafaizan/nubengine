      showed that the choroidal thickness and retinal vascular density were increased during
      pregnancy especially in the 3rd trimester. From the literature review, there is only one
      publication of physiologic ocular changes during pregnancy in high myopia. Chen et al
      demonstrated that the choroidal thickness was increased significantly in the 3rd trimester.
      However, the changes of retinal vascular density in pregnant women with high myopia have
      never been studied before.
