      hemoglobin. A low value glycosylated hemoglobin indicates a good metabolic control, and has
      been shown to be associated with a better prognosis regarding diabetic complications. Type 2
      diabetes is a disease with a profound genetic component. Peroxisome proliferator-activated
      receptor gamma is a transcription factor implicated in adipocyte differentiation, lipid and
      glucose metabolism. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alfa is a transcription factor
      implicated in lipid oxidation and gluconeogenesis and is present in liver, kidney, heart,
      skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.

      Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that targets nuclear peroxisomal proliferator activated
      receptors, members of the super family of ligand activated transcription factors.
      Specifically, thiazolidinediones bind to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
      and affect transcription factors that influence expression of genes responsible for the
      production of proteins important in carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism. These include
      increases in glucose transporters 1 and 4 resulting in enhanced peripheral glucose
      utilization by fat and skeletal muscle.

      This is a pharmacoepidemiological study to evaluate whether the individual genotype of the
      patients have any influence on the efficacy of pioglitazone.
