    
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common complication after bypass surgery. It is a significant
      burden to the healthcare system because it is associated with increased hospital costs and a
      longer hospital length-of-stay. Atrial fibrillation occurring after bypass surgery is
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Atrial fibrillation is also associated
      with an increased risk for strokes, use of potentially harmful drugs, and the need for
      pacemaker therapy.

      This study is for patients who are undergoing elective bypass surgery. Patients who meet
      study criteria and who consent to participate in the study will be randomized to treatment
      with omega-3 fatty acids or matching corn oil placebo, prior to surgery. After surgery,
      treatment will continue until the primary endpoint, atrial fibrillation, is reached, or 14
      days, whichever is first.
