      respiratory tract infection and chronic inflammatory bronchitis. According to the Phase III
      studies conducted in Korea, the safety and efficacy of Synatura速 on antitussive and
      expectorant effects were confirmed in patients with acute upper respiratory infection and
      chronic inflammatory bronchitis. However, no studies have been conducted for the effects of
      Synatura速 in patients with COPD. COPD is divided into emphysema type and chronic bronchitis
      type, while typical clinical symptoms of chronic bronchitis are cough and sputum. Therefore,
      Synatura速, which is effective for chronic bronchitis, is expected to be effective in patients
      with chronic bronchitis accompanied by COPD.
