      framework .The biopsychosocial- spiritual model recognizes the impact of the religious
      factors in modulating the biology of pain.

      The aim of this study is to measure the effect of praying as an intervention on conditioned
      pain modulation and on pain intensity.

      The investigators hypothesize that prayer would increase conditioned pain modulation compared
      to a no prayer control group in a healthy religious population.

      The investigators hypothesize that participants engaging in active prayer will show a higher
      increase in conditioned pain modulation compared to those engaging in passive prayer or no
      prayer.

      The present study is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of two types of
      prayer, the passive and the active prayer and no prayer, on conditioned pain modulation using
      the heat protocol and on pain intensity. Participants are to be randomly assigned to 2
      groups: the prayer group and the control group.

      The control group is of (n=50) participants and the prayer group is (n=150) participants to
      be divided according to the style of praying identified by the prayer function scale into
      active and passive prayer group.

      Appropriate statistical analyses will be performed to evaluate and compare treatment effects.
