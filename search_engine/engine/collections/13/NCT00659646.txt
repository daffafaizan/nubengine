      heal. Diabetic ulcers are responsible for frequent health care visits, and are a major
      predictor of amputation. Diabetic ulcers can be caused by a patient's inability to sense pain
      or warmth as well as peripheral vascular disease, which causes diminished blood flow to the
      foot. Early aggressive treatment is necessary to treat infection and ultimately prevent the
      need for amputation.

      Gentamicin is an antibiotic that is effective in treating certain kinds of infection.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The gentamicin-collagen sponge is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and containing gentamicin. When
      applied to an open ulcer, the collagen breaks down and the gentamicin is released into the
      ulcer, but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of gentamicin in
      the open infected ulcer may help treat the infection.

      In this study, all subjects will be given the necessary supplies and taught how to take care
      their foot ulcer. All subjects will also receive oral an antibiotic (levofloxacin).
      Additionally, subjects who are randomly assigned to receive the gentamicin-collagen sponge
      will place a gentamicin-collagen sponge on their ulcer during daily wound care.
