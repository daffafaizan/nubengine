      assess the tolerability of terazosin (TZ) at 1 and 5 milligrams (MG) daily for patients with
      DLB. The primary goal of this study is to assess the tolerability of TZ in patients with DLB.
      This is a pilot study and is not powered to assess efficacy of this medication. Our hope is
      that this study will guide future studies of this (and similar) medications for the disease
      modification of DLB. This study is also aimed to learn more about how patients with produce
      and use energy and if TZ can help to reverse energy deficits that appear in DLB.
