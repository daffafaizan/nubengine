      NovaDerm® xenograft using continuous sling suture to secure both the graft and the flap (test
      treatment) and 15 with a coronally positioned tunnel technique with AlloDerm® allograft using
      continuous sling suture to secure both the graft and the flap (control treatment). Sutures
      used for the control group will be Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle for both the test and
      control groups. The coronally positioned tunnel technique was previously described by Edwards
      Pat Allen (E.P. Allen, Center for Advanced Dental Education, Dallas, Texas; course manual).
      Each patient will provide at least one Miller Class I or II facial recession defect, ≥ 3 mm.
      Patients will be randomly selected by a coin toss to receive either the test or control
      treatment. Mentor will toss the coin immediately prior to suturing. Patients will be
      evaluated postoperatively for a period of 4 months. The examiner will be blinded and will not
      be aware of the patient treatment at any time during the term of the study. Three exams for
      measurements will be performed per patient on total: preoperative, at week eight and 16 (4
      months) postoperatively.
