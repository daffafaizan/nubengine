      thrombocytopenic purpura in some prospective studies, with reports of platelet numbers
      increasing in these patients after Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment.However, other
      studies have shown a negative result after eradication treatment of Helicobacter pylori
      infection in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura, leading to controversy.
