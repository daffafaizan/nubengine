    
      'Glyde' is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, crossover trial to compare the effects of
      two different starches used in the dietary management of GSD.

      The study will recruit 64 patients from six centres in the UK, USA, France and The
      Netherlands. The planned duration per participant is 2 years.

      Participants will be randomised into two equally sized groups:

      Arm A- Glycosade intake given first, followed by UCCS 1-6 weeks later Arm B- UCCS intake
      given first, followed by Glycosade 1-6 weeks later.

      The objective of this trial is to establish whether Glycosade® improves outcomes for patients
      with GSD compared to UCCS therapy by comparing the duration of normal blood sugars, lactate
      and ketone levels of patients with hepatic GSD (Types I, III, VI and IX) post equivalent
      intakes of UCCS and Glycosade®.

      The first part consists of two (blinded) 12 hour starch load tests administered randomly
      within a maximum 6 week period. Participants will be randomised to receive either UCCS or
      Glycosade® for the initial intervention period crossing over to the other product for the
      second intervention period (part 1).

      The second part (unblinded) is a 24 month open follow up whereby participant's will continue
      on the product considered most suitable by the clinician and patient.
