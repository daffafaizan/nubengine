      panretinal photocoagulation. Therefore this study is designed using both treatments in the
      same patient: intravitreal Bevacizumab plus panretinal photocoagulation in one eye, compared
      to panretinal photocoagulation alone in the contralateral eye. These patients had their
      visual acuity and contrast vision measured and complete ophthalmological examination was
      performed, including macular slit lamp examination, fluorescein angiography and optical
      coherence tomography.

      Patients with similar proliferative diabetic retinopathy without high risk characteristics
      receive laser therapy in both eyes and intravitreal Bevacizumab injections in one eye. For
      the Bevacizumab injections, numbing drops, antibiotic drops, and drops to dilate the pupil,
      and possibly and anesthetic injection, are put in the eye before the medicine is injected
      into the vitreous. Patients return for follow-up visits 1 day, 1 and 4 weeks after the
      injection, and then 3 and 6 months. Patients whose condition does not improve may undergo new
      evaluation.
