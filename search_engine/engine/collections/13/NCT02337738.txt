      2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TVP-1012 as an add-on to levodopa in

      The study period consisted of a 28-week trial period. The participants who fulfilled the
      inclusion criteria and did not meeting any of the exclusion criteria were enrolled, and

      group. In each treatment group, participants received 0.5 mg of TVP-1012, 1 mg of TVP-1012,
