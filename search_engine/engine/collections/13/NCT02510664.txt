    
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a newly developed strengths-based clinical
      intervention delivered by diabetes care providers in the context of routine ambulatory
      diabetes care, designed to promote resilience and support diabetes management among
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their families. The emphasis of the intervention is
      shifting the tone of clinical encounters for diabetes care to emphasize and reinforce youths'
      and families' current diabetes strengths and positive diabetes management behaviors. Youth
      with type 1 diabetes are seen routinely in clinic every 3-4 months, and this intervention
      will occur at two consecutive clinic visits. The intervention consists of (A) assessing youth
      and family diabetes strengths and adherence prior to each visit, and (B) training diabetes
      care providers to tailor their clinical encounters around reinforcing each patient and
      family's unique "diabetes strengths profile" generated from the strengths and adherence
      assessments.

      Outcome assessments are conducted at baseline (prior to the start of the intervention) and
      immediately following the conclusion of the intervention (approximately 6-8 months later).
      The primary outcome is feasibility and acceptability, measured by qualitative feedback from
      participants and providers, as well as quantification of recruitment and enrollment, provider
      adherence to intervention protocol, and time to completion. Secondary (exploratory) outcomes
      include diabetes regimen adherence, glycemic control, family conflict, diabetes burden,
      diabetes strengths, and satisfaction with the diabetes care provider relationship. Strengths
      and adherence assessments are also completed prior to the second clinic visit to generate the
      diabetes strengths profile.
