      stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. tDCS permit the
      application of an extremely weak continuous electrical current to the brain through an anode
      and a cathode applied on the scalp. Anodal stimulation appears to increase brain activity
      whereas cathodal stimulation has the opposite effect.

      Using anodal and cathodal tDCS the investigators aimed to treat negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia. The investigators plan to apply tDCS such that it can simultaneously increased
      activity in the frontal brain areas and reduce activity over temporoparietal cortex, 2 areas
      involved in the physiopathology of the disease. Real active stimulation will be compare to a
      sham condition in 44 patients (22 in each group). 44 patients will be included in Seoul
      National University Hospital
