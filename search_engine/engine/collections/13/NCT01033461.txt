      effect of calcium is due to the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate, which has the
      ability to bind bile acids and other cytotoxic substances in the gut. The precipitation of
      the cytotoxic substances leads to a less aggressive environment in the gut and might be
      stimulate the adhesion of the microbiota.

      Thirty-two healthy men and women participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind and cross
      over human study. The participants were randomly divided into two groups. All probands
      consumed a probiotic drink for four weeks (10e+10 CFU/d). Additionally, one group consumed a
      pentacalcium phosphate-enriched bread (1 g Ca/d) and the other group consumed a bread without
      pentacalcium phosphate. After a two-week wash-out and a two-week placebo period the invention
      changed for another four weeks (cross over). At the end of each intervention and placebo
      period, subjects consumed a defined diet for three days. Furthermore, there was a three-day
      quantitative stool and urine collection and a fasting venous blood sample was taken.
