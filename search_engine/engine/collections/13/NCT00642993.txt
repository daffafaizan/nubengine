      qualify for continuation in the study according to the entry criteria will be randomized to
      one of two treatment groups (SCH 497079 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio) with stratification
      according to gender.

      Baseline measurements for the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as secondary endpoints will
      be evaluated at the Randomization Visit (Visit 3). Following randomization, participants will
      be treated for 12 weeks with double-blind study drug as adjunct to a 500 kcal deficit diet.

      Participants will have scheduled visits after the Randomization Visit at 2 to 4 week
      intervals. Each participant will be encouraged to adhere to medication and dietary
      instructions.
