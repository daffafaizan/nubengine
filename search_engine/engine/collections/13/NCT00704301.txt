    
      Objective: To study whether rivastigmine added to treatment with haloperidol shortens the
      duration of delirium in ICU patients and reduces costs.

      Study design: Multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Study population:
      Consecutive adult ICU patients with delirium according to the CAM-ICU.

      Intervention: Increasing dosage of rivastigmine or placebo as add-on medication.

      Primary study parameters: Duration of delirium. Secondary study parameters: Delirium
      severity, length of ICU and hospital stay, functional status and mortality after 3 months.

      Sample size: 440 patients will be included. Economic evaluation: includes a comparison of
      direct and indirect medical costs.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Burden: questionnaires (duration: 30 minutes). Risk: possible exposure to drug
      not indicated for the disorder. Benefit: possible treatment with according to experts
      possible beneficial drug. Consideration: The investigators of this study believe that the
      burden and risk do not exceed the expected benefit.
