    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and activity of
      trifluridine/tipiracil in combination with capecitabine and bevacizumab in mCRC. The first
      part (Part 1) of the study will consist in a dose-escalation assessment of the safety of the
      treatment in subjects with previously untreated mCRC deemed not fit for irinotecan- and/or
      oxaliplatin- based regimens (i. e. FOLFOX/XELOX/FOLFIRI/FOLFOXIRI with or without targeted
      agents).

      The second part (Part 2) will be an open-label phase 2 study with a Fleming's single-stage
      design to evaluate the ORR of the study treatment at the recommended dose established in the
      first part of the study in the same patients' population.

      Trifluridine/tipiracil, capecitabine and bevacizumab will be administered in 28-days cycles
      until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicities, or patients' refusal.
