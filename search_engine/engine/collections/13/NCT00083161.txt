      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of cisplatin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide in patients with
           extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on circulating endothelial cells in the peripheral
           blood of these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine progression-free survival, tumor response rate, and overall survival in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes-2 hours on day 1,
           etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 OR etoposide IV on day 1 and orally twice daily
           on days 2-3, and oral cyclophosphamide twice daily on days 8-19. Treatment repeats every
           21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide twice daily in the absence
           of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
