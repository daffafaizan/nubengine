      infected individuals have been studied primarily among adult males and in selected small
      populations. Although many of these predictors may be relevant to women, HIV infection does
      manifest itself differently between the sexes. Therefore, it is important to study the
      spectrum of HIV disease in women and to identify unique and common markers, cofactors, and
      predictors of disease progression.

      Part 009: HIV-infected female adults, independent of CD4+ cell count, will provide blood and
      VCS specimens obtained at a single study visit, regardless of ovulatory phase.

      NOTE: Subjects in this study will be patients who are currently enrolled in a multisite
      longitudinal study, Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), which is designed to elucidate the
      natural history of infection with HIV-1 in U.S. women. Participation in DATRI 009 will
      require additional blood at the patient's scheduled WIHS visit.

      Part 009a: Consent will be obtained from 65 women to allow additional evaluations to be
      completed on their reserve VCS specimen and on an additional peripheral blood specimen,
      specifically obtained for DATRI 009a during their 009 visit. An additional 8 ml CPT tube will
      be collected from these patients, bringing their total blood volume to 32 ml at their
      scheduled WIHS visit.
