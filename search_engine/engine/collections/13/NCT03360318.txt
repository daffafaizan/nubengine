      Mason type I or II radial head fractures are planned to be included.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure will be an assessment of functional daily
      activities as measured by the MAYO score at four weeks post injury. Secondary outcomes will
      include an assessment of pain scores using VAS.

      Sample Size and Analysis: Assuming a standard deviation of 10%, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2 and
      10% dropout rate yields a sample size of 150 patients. Secondary analyses will include
      Fisher's Exact test to compare proportions of children with full range of motion of the
      injured ankle at four weeks and with full baseline activity level at four months, and the
      area under the curve of a pain-time profile curve will be compared using a Student's t-test.
