      years or age or more, causes progressive loss of central vision. Photocoagulation has long
      been used to slow the progress of AMD, but new vision-preserving methods are currently under
      investigation. Because destroyed photoreceptors are permanently lost, early management is
      essential for preservation of vision. The aim of this project will be to study AMD using a
      suite of new high-resolution ultrasound imaging techniques that have been developed.
      Specifically, high-resolution ultrasound will be used to generate images of the retina and
      choroid, including perfusion measurements using slow-flow methods developed by our research
      group. Ultrasound studies will be performed in conjunction with optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) imaging in a series of patients and age-matched control subjects with the aim of
      determining if choroidal thickness and/or perfusion might be used as an early indicator of
      AMD and thus aid in patient management.

      We will study 20 subjects diagnosed with AMD. We will attempt to have an approximately equal
      number of subjects with wet and dry forms of AMD. A control group consisting of 20 non-AMD
      age-matched subjects will also be recruited. Ultrasound scan sequences will consist of B-mode
      images of the macula and surrounding tissues.
