      lesions. The device is capable of differentiation as to stages of AMD and early detection of
      changes including choroidal neovascularization (CNV) The Foresee PHPâ„¢ demonstrates a high
      level of sensitivity and specificity as to the different stages of AMD including newly
      diagnosed or early detection of CNV.

      The OCT May be use as well to identify choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Comparison between
      the two methods will allow better understanding of both devices.

      The Foresee PHP can use as an assessment tool for the progression and success of the
      treatment given to AMD lesions. Therefore, evaluation the size and the location of the
      treated lesions may serve as an additional tool.
