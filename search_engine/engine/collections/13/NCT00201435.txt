      who are not usually included into clinical trials because they are not having disease with
      measurable lesions. In breast cancer the bulk of patients with metastatic disease is
      presenting with bone metastases which is difficult to evaluate with respect to response. In
      this study it is one of the main objectives to include this kind of everyday patients that we
      see in the clinic.

      Because of this we will be using TTF as the primary endpoint. Skeletal events requiring
      radiotherapy or major changes in pain medications are defined as treatment failures causing
      stop in treatment even in the absence of radiological findings.

      A: weekly Taxol速 plus Xeloda速 on days 1-14 q 3w B: Taxotere速 q 3w plus Xeloda速 on days 1-14 q
      3w

      Patients are randomized equally between the two arms.

      Concomitant therapy: Simultaneous use of bisphosphonates is allowed, if this treatment has
      been initiated at least four weeks before study entry.
