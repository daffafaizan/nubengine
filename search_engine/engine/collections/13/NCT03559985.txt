    
      This is an interventional, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study
      about the use of paracetamol in therapeutic doses in peripheral neuropathic pain patients.
      The analgesic effect of paracetamol will be assessed by the painful intensity measured by
      numerical pain rating scale over one week after taking paracetamol/placebo.

      The secondary objectives will be:

        -  To determine the number of patients in whom paracetamol is effective in reducing pain by
           at least 30% and 50%,

        -  To evaluate the effect of paracetamol on pain, on the number and intensity of paroxysms,

        -  To evaluate paracetamol consumption,

        -  To evaluate the effect of paracetamol on neuropathic pain patient,

        -  To evaluate the effect of paracetamol on mechanical allodynia,

        -  To monitor routine biological parameters (liver function),

        -  Compare Glutathione (GSH) concentrations before and after taking paracetamol,

        -  To perform a blood test for paracetamol and its metabolites before and after each study
           period,

        -  To perform urine dosage of paracetamol and its metabolites before and after each study
           period,

        -  To study pharmacogenetics parameters,

        -  To evaluate patient feeling and satisfaction after taking paracetamol,

        -  To evaluate the effect of paracetamol on cognition, anxiety, depression and sleep by
           different questionnaires,

        -  To collect adverse events.
