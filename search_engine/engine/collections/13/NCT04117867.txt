      prevention. Maintaining blood pressure near preoperative baseline values may help decrease
      the incidence of stroke, however the related evidence is limited.Therefore, this study is to
      investigate the association between intraoperative hemodynamic variable and the risk of
      perioperative stroke after non-cardiac and non-neurologic surgeries. The secondary aim of
      this study is to establish the potential risk factors of the perioperative stroke.
