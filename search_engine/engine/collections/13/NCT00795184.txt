      order to directly address the low sensitivity and specificity of enhanced macroscopic
      endoscopic imaging devices by determining whether probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy
      (pCLE), as a supplement to Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) can further improve sensitivity and
      specificity to a level that would be acceptable to avoid random biopsy, and better direct
      biopsy of suspicious areas. The study is also addressing pCLE as a supplement to standard
      white light endoscopy and random biopsy alone. In fact, the study is powered to evaluate per
      lesion sensitivity and specificity of confocal imaging as applied to lesions identified by
      white light endoscopy. Therefore, the study addresses the shortcomings of standard white
      light endoscopy (high number of random biopsies, less than ideal directed biopsy of
      suspicious areas) and the primary shortcomings of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) (low specificity
      with resultant high false positives, again resulting in many unnecessary biopsies).
