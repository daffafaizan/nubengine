      Although ketogenic diet is being used for drug resistant epilepsy for almost hundred years,
      its restrictiveness and adverse effects interferes with its compliance. So less restrictive
      alternatives like Low Glycemic Index Therapy diet is gradually becoming more popular and its
      effectiveness is well established. Still the restrictiveness of such monotonous diets is one
      of the most significant issues for long term maintenance of children on dietary therapy. In
      this study, we are planning to compare the efficacy of daily and intermittent Low Glycemic
      Index therapy Diet in children aged 1-15 years with drug resistant epilepsy in a open
      labelled randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. The children in intermittent LGIT arm
      will receive the dietary therapy for five days of each week, alternating with a liberal diet
      on the rest of the two days of the week. With a follow up period of 6 months, we are planning
      to enroll 55 children in each arm. Adverse effect profile in each arm will also be monitored
      during the study. Also the effect of the dietary therapy on behavior and cognition in each
      arm will be assessed.
