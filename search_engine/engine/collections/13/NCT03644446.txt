      medical therapy and the impact of renal function on reaching the maximum tolerated dose has
      never been studied. The investigators will perform an observational study to answer this
      issue.

      In this study, there will be no changes of the doses of bisoprolol, whatever the bisoprolol
      plasma concentration, with the exception of vital threatening concentrations. This study is a
      pilot study.

      Participants will be consecutive ambulatory chronic heart failure patients followed at the
      CHU de Caen, treated with maximum tolerated dose of bisoprolol with mild to reduced ejection
      fraction. Participants can benefit of the other heart failure recommended treatment at the
      exception of ivabradine that would confound the bisoprolol effect on heart rate. Participants
      will be subsequently studied by renal function.

      Patients will be followed at one year with the electronic health record of the CHU de Caen
      for clinical events.
