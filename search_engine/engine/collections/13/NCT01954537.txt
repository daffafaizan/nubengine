      Researchers will meet with the high school volunteers and their parents to discuss the study
      and obtain informed consent prior to participating. Participants will swallow the HQInc
      CorTemp pill at least three hours (or late the night before) before practice. Temperature
      readings will be scanned every 15-30 minutes throughout practice. Pre and post practice
      weights will be recorded as well as urine specific gravity to help assess hydration status.
      Participants will also fill out a short 1 page questionnaire regarding their prior heat
      acclimatization, sleep habits, and baseline knowledge of hydration and heat illness. Protocol
      will be the same at all three age/competition levels.
