    
      -  The main objective is to research an association between polymorphism for the BDNF gene
           and the 3-week and 6-week response to a SSRI treatment (escitalopram) in major
           depression.

        -  A case control pilot study without any direct individual benefit (200 patients).

        -  Study period: 24 months.

        -  Scores from reliable and validated psychometric scales (Montgomery and Asberg Depression
           Scale, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) specifically analysing depression
           dimension at the time of inclusion, after three and six weeks of antidepressant
           treatment.

        -  Genetic analysis researching a polymorphism of the BDNF gene is done by a blood sample
           at the baseline.
