      metastasis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. These patients will then be randomized into
      two 54 patient arms: the control arm of conventional resuscitation only and the experimental
      arm of conventional resuscitation with DPR immediately post operatively. Patient exclusion
      criteria will be: 1) unable to obtain proper consent for enrollment, 2) age less than 18
      years or greater than 75 years, 3) chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, or congestive heart
      failure, 4) patients requiring portal venous embolization prior to resection, or 5) women who
      are pregnant or lactating/breast feeding. A pregnancy test (urine or blood) will be done for
      female subjects of child bearing potential the day prior or the morning of surgery per the
      usual standard of care pre-op labs.
