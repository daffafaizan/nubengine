      ranging from 5 to 130 mg per day in our clinical practice. This study is aimed at providing a
      comprehensive cross-sectional description of factors involved in this variance:

        -  comorbidity with addictive and psychiatric disorders

        -  severity of pre-existing heroin dependence

        -  function of CYP 3A4 enzyme assessed with oral midazolam challenge

        -  genetic polymorphisms of enzymes implicated in methadone pharmacokinetic and
           pharmacodynamic (CYPs, MDR1, OPRM1, COMT)

      The expected result is a predictive equation of oral methadone dosage at steady state.
