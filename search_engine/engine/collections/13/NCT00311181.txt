      annual deaths ranging from 250,000 to 400,000 in the United States. Accordingly, implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD's) have proven to be an important therapeutic option for
      patients susceptible to SCD. Successful therapy and generator longevity are greatly dependent
      on proper defibrillation threshold (DFT) determination.

      All modern ICD's utilize a biphasic waveform for defibrillation. It has been clearly shown
      that biphasic waveforms reduce the energy required for internal defibrillation of the heart.
      However, there is no consensus on which pulse widths are best for defibrillation.

      St. Jude Medical ICD's (implantable cardioverter defibrillators) have programmable pulse
      widths, which allow the physician multiple options in dealing with ICD patients. By
      implanting ICD's with programmable pulse widths, this study utilizes the Tissue RC
      Resistance/Capacitance) model to try to identify the optimal pulse widths.

      To determine the efficacy of an optimal membrane time constant estimate for the "tuned"
      waveform, defibrillation testing must be performed. Upper limit of vulnerability (ULV) has
      been proposed as an alternative means of predicting the DFT and it has been shown that ULV
      guided DFT testing can achieve a defibrillation success rate of 95%.
