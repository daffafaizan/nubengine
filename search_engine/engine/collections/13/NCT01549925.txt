    
      This research study is a prospective, randomized trial. Women who are suspected to have an
      early or late stage ovarian cancer during their preoperative evaluation will be potential
      study participants. Only patients with documented ovarian cancer by histologic examination at
      the time of the cytoreductive or staging surgery, and that are also undergoing omentectomy
      and/or recto-sigmoid colon resection will be eligible for participation. Patients who are
      eligible for participation and who are willing to participate will be randomized during the
      surgical procedure to standard surgical resection using clamps and surgical ligatures versus
      resection using the FDA-approved LIGASURE device during omentectomy and resection of the
      recto-sigmoid portion of the colon. The resection of these tissues will be performed as part
      of the usual surgical protocol for women with ovarian cancer and will not be done so unless
      the tissues are the sites of metastatic disease or if their removal would be performed for
      staging purposes.
