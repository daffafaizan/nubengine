      PURPOSE

      Background:

        -  The rate of eradication of Helicobacter pylori with standard triple therapy (OCA:
           omeprazole + clarithromycin + amoxicillin) in our area is less than the expected
           according to the III Maastricht III consensus. However, the current guidelines recommend
           the use of this therapy.

        -  According to the Maastricht III consensus, in populations with high rates of
           clarithromycin resistance (15-20%) another therapy should be considered, or
           alternatively, testing antimicrobial susceptibility of the H. pylori prior to treatment.

      Objectives:

        -  To clarify the real rate of eradication with OCA therapy with and without antimicrobial
           susceptibility in our area (with high rate of resistance to clarythromycin).

        -  To study which is the diagnostic-therapeutic strategy more cost-effective for the
           treatment of H. pylori.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history.

        -  Participants will aleatory receive OCA therapy empirically, or after antimicrobial
           susceptibility test if there is no resistance to clarythromycin, for ten days.

        -  In all cases the eradication of H. pylori will be checked by 13C urea breath test (UBT)
           in 8 weeks after the therapy have been finished.

        -  All the adverse event of the therapy will be reported.
