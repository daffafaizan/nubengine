      the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-92, ALL-2000 and
      ALL-2008 trials and experienced a relapse or an SMN as the first event after cessation of
      maintenance therapy (368 patients). From medical charts and blood test results it will be
      decided whether the relapse/SMN was diagnosed at a routine visit (including routine blood
      tests) or if the relapse was diagnosed because of symptoms at a non-scheduled visit or blood
      test.

      As the NOPHO database probably is one of the most complete databases globally, it is an
      advantage to perform this study as a NOPHO study.

      Results of this population based relapse study will provide an evidence-based background for
      planning optimal and relevant follow-up programs for children after therapy of ALL treated
      according to contemporary Nordic ALL protocols.

      The study is important and relevant in the light of today's high ALL cure rates and a need
      for optimal follow-up programs after cessation of ALL treatment and possible prediction of
      relapse.

      The timing of the project is an increased focus on the clinical relevance of routine clinical
      follow-up of patients treated for cancer.
