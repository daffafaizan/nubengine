      Sham-TMS (a non-therapeutic TMS coil which sounds and feels similar to normal TMS), or
      standard treatment during the weeks of wait time before surgery for chronic orofacial pain
      (COFP). TMS is a noninvasive, painless magnetic device which, when applied to the head for a
      few minutes, has been shown to reduce pain in people with COFP. The sham TMS is a
      sub-therapeutic level of magnetcic stimulation which makes the same sound as normal TMS and
      causes a similar tingling of the skin.

      Both those who receive this new pain intervention and those who do not will be asked to fill
      out a short online survey about their pain at several points during the study. The survey
      takes about 10 minutes to fill out and each of the 5 TMS sessions last 10 minutes.
