      cause imaging artefacts), interruptions or even abortions of imaging scans, eventually
      requiring to reschedule the examination. Improving these symptoms by creating a VR
      experiences adapted to the physical constraints of the MRI environment, such as "disappearing
      the scanner", not only improves the subjective experience of the participant, but has
      immediate impacts the time spent on the examination, on personnel costs, and resource
      availability (scanner time).

      This study aims at comparing claustrophobic patients in an A|B group design with or without
      VR intervention. Primary outcomes include subjective reports from patients (Acceptability and
      Demand) and practitioners (Implementation, Practicality, Adaptation, Integration, Expansion).
      Secondary outcomes include scanning efficacy based e.g. on the imaging quality, number of
      times a scan is interrupted by the user and the total duration of a scan. Another
      non-claustrophobic patients' group will be tested for for obtaining feedback on the general
      benefit of VR immersion on patients' experience.
