    
      U3-1302 is an antibody drug conjugate comprising a recombinant fully human anti HER3
      monoclonal antibody linked to a linker containing topoisomerase I inhibitor. This study is a
      phase II study of U3-1402 in subjects with MBC who have received no prior anti HER2 therapy.
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part A and Part B). All enrolled subjects in part A
      will undergo pretreatment biopsies to determine if subjects with particular biomarker
      expression (ER/PR/HER2/HER3) show preliminary efficacy after an analysis is performed at 24
      weeks. Part B will enroll subgroups of subjects that will be defined from part A based on
      ER/PR/HER2/HER3 expression and will be evaluated for efficacy analysis.
