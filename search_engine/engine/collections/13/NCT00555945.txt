      and in some cases, mortality. Currently the most common method of surgical treatment includes
      the use of a sliding hip screw over a Gamma intramedullary nail, but there is conflicting
      evidence regarding which device has a lower revision of surgery rate and complication rate.
      The newest generation of Gamma3 nails have strong rationale suggesting significantly
      decreased rates of femoral shaft fractures and improved function. The improvements in implant
      design of the Gamma3 nail provide compelling rationale for the conduct of a large, definitive
      trial, and therefore a pilot study is being conducted to confirm or refute our ability to
      recruit patients and assess the consistency between site estimates and actual recruitment,
      determine the degree to which site investigators can adhere to trial protocol, confirm or
      refute our anticipated ability to achieve close to 100% follow- up, assess our ability to
      maintain 100% data quality, field test our case report forms for clarity and appropriateness,
      and to determine whether we can successfully manage the logistics of coordinating trial
      activities across multiple sites.

      This trial is a pilot, multi-center, concealed randomized controlled trial. Surgeons will use
      one of the two surgical strategies in patients who have sustained a trochanteric fracture;
      the Gamma3 intramedullary nail or the sliding hip screw. Clinical assessments will occur at
      the time of hospital admission, 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery.
