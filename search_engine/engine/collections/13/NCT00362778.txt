      randomized to two treatment arms, administered during the first 48 hours: the intensive group
      (n=13) received intravenous insulin with target glycemia levels of 80-110mg/dL, while the
      conventional group (n=15) received subcutaneous insulin only when glycemia was Â³ 160mg/dL.
      High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) was determined at 48 hours and before discharge
      and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at 1 month.
