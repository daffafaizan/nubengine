      (12 patients to be recruited from each group). These patients will never have been prescribed
      the components present in Seretide (Salmeterol and Flixotide or similar compounds).

      The patients will have spirometry at the beginning of the study to confirm the presence of
      COPD. Healthy smokers will defined as ex or current smokers who match the study population
      but have normal lung function.

      Patients with a history of asthma, bronchiectasis, carcinoma of the bronchus, or other
      significant respiratory disease will be excluded.

      The patients will have a total of four study visits, 2 off treatment and 2 while on
      treatment, over a 56 day study period. At each study visit induced sputum will be performed
      and blood extracted. The cells fom both of these samples will be analysed for cells type and
      activation. Sputum and serum will be stored for cytokine analysis at a later date.

      The Sputum will be induced using standardised protocols using nebulised saline solution.
