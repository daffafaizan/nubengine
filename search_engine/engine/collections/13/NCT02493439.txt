      the process of immigration, such as working, legal, social, and mental and physical health
      problems.

      BPS is a guided imagery exercise that requires participants to envision themselves in the
      future, achieving desired goals in different areas of their lives. This exercise has shown
      efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect compared to a control
      condition, in general population. Taking into account the prior literature, the aim of the
      present study is to carry out a randomized controlled study in order to replicate the
      findings about the effects of BPS on optimism, mood and affect in an immigrant population.
      The design employed in this study is similar to the used in other studies.
