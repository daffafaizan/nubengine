      gynecological surgery to allow better access to the pelvic organs, as gravity pulls the bowel
      out of the pelvic cavity and the rectosigmoid angle straightens, which may also be favorable
      for colonoscopy insertion. However, few published studies have explored the value of
      tilt-down position in the colonoscopy (left lateral horizontal body position are usually
      used) and there is consequently little evidence to support left lateral tilt-down position or
      left lateral horizontal body position. So the investigators perform a randomized controlled
      trial of left lateral tilt-down position versus left lateral horizontal position for
      colonoscopy to investigate the safety and efficacy of lateral tilt-down position.
