      pilot study involving up to 150 self-reported COPD participants. Eligible participants will
      wear the Spire biophysiological health monitors for a period of 9 months while the
      participants report symptoms on a weekly basis via brief surveys. If and when participants
      incur a COPD-related exacerbation which results in a medication change after hospitalization
      or contact with a healthcare provider, participants will report this on the weekly surveys.
      When this survey is read by a study nurse, the nurse will follow up with the participant by
      phone to conduct a post-exacerbation phone screening. This data would provide context to
      inform how to correlate the biosensor-sensed physiological parameters with the exacerbation
      self-reported data. All study participants will be remotely distributed throughout the United
      States.
