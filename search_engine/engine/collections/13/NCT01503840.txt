    
      From the beginning of the surgery to the time of extubation neuromuscular block is monitored
      with accelerographic monitor TOF-Watch SX. Patients are extubated when TOF-ratio is 100%.

      Patients will perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs):

        -  the day ahead of surgery (for elegibility and training)

        -  60 minutes before surgery

        -  10 minutes after extubation

        -  5 minutes after sugammadex or placebo administration

        -  20 minutes after sugammadex or placebo administration.

      The following parameters will be evaluated and compared between the 2 groups:

        -  Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)

        -  Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP)

        -  Forced Expiratory Volume in the first Second (FEV1)

        -  Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)

        -  Ratio of Maximum Expiratory Flow and Maximum Inspiratory Flow rate at 50% of vital
           capacity (MEF50/MIF50)

        -  PaO2, PaCO2, pH

        -  heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate

      Changes of pulmonary tests performed before and after sugammadex or placebo will be compared
      between study groups.
