      the EsoGuard diagnostic assay performed on distal esophageal mucosal cells collected using
      the EsoCheck cell collection device, compared to the gold standard, for the screening of BE
      with and without dysplasia and for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), in patients at high risk
      for BE and for whom a screening EGD is indicated according to ACG-established criteria.
