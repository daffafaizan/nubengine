      affects approximately 10 percent of pregnancies worldwide constituting one of the greatest
      causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. (1) Preeclampsia is
      defined by the new onset of elevated blood pressure after 20 weeks of gestation. It is
      considered severe if blood pressure is increased substantially or symptoms of end-organ
      damage (including fetal growth restriction) occur. There is no single reliable,
      cost-effective screening test for preeclampsia, and there are no well-established measures
      for primary prevention. Management before the onset of labor includes close monitoring of
      maternal and fetal status. Management during delivery includes seizure prophylaxis with
      magnesium sulfate and, if necessary, medical management of hypertension. Delivery remains the
      ultimate treatment.

      Preeclampsia leads to eclampsia. Symptoms of preeclampsia include: weight gain, headaches,
      right upper quadrant pain, swelling of hands and feet, and vision problems Symptoms of
      eclampsia include: muscle aches and pains, seizures, severe agitation, unconsciousness

      Current obstetric treatment in the United States has resulted in a shift of eclampsia toward
      the postpartum period, with most cases being seen as late post partum. During the post partum
      period a patient's blood pressure peaks around 3-6 days post delivery, however most patients
      are discharged home by 48 hours. This results in re-admission to the hospital for some women.
      The investigator's goal is to review and evaluate women who have been readmitted for a
      preeclampsia or eclampsia episode during the post partum period to assess if there are
      preceding signs or symptoms leading to her re admission.
