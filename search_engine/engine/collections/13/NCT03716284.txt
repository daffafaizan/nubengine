      pulmonary nodules suspicious for malignancy will be enrolled in the study. ENB will be
      performed with/without other guided bronchoscopy techniques and/or ROSE. Different biopsy
      methods will be recorded as well. The primary endpoint is the diagnostic yield of ENB. The
      secondary endpoints include factors affecting diagnostic yield, operation time,
      complications, safety and so on.
