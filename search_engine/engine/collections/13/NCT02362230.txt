      patients will receive Icotinib 125 mg BID administered for 8 weeks. Patients with a complete
      response, partial response or stable disease at that time may continue to be treated based on
      physician discretion. Follow up is then required until resolution or stabilization of any
      treatment-related toxicity, and patients with stable disease or objective responses must also
      continue evaluations until survived.
