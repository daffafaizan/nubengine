      include first-line treatment failed advanced patients with bone or soft tissue sarcoma and
      without standard regimen;TCR-T cell therapy has made a breakthrough for tumors in recent
      years. Phase I/II trial of NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T treatment for synovial sarcoma and
      melanoma, conducted by the Rosenberg team at the National Cancer Institute, showed that 61%
      Synovial cell sarcoma patients and 55% melanoma patients benefit from this treatment, without
      severe side effects found in T cell receptor (TCR) transduced T-Cell Immunotherapy.

      This clinical trial is mainly focused on cancer-testis antigen, because it is not expressed
      in normal cells. NY-ESO-1 antigen as one member of cancer-testis antigen, is commonly
      expressed in 10-50% of melanoma, lung, liver, esophageal, breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid
      and ovarian cancer cases, 60% of multiple myeloma cases, and 70-80% of synovial sarcoma.
      NY-ESO-1 expression was also found in 88.2% of myxoid liposarcomas, 61.1% of synovial
      sarcomas, 31.3% of osteosarcomas, 21.4% of pleomorphic liposarcomas, 16.7% of desmoplastic
      small round cell tumors, and 14.3% of chondrosarcomas. The NY-ESO-1 TCR cell therapy for
      synovial sarcoma and melanoma has benefited many patients, but its effect on bone and soft
      tissue sarcoma is still unknown. So the investigators plan to explore its efficacy.

      The patients must meet the two criteria: HLA-A*0201+ and NY-ESO-1 positive cellsâ‰¥25% by
      immunohistochemistry. By this trial, the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerance
      (MTD) will be initially identified.
