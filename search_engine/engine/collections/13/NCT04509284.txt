      diagnosed every year [1]. Fortunately, due to better treatment options, the population of
      long-term survivors is increasing. This poses new demands for knowledge on how to manage late
      effects to the treatment regimen. Persistent pain after treatment for breast cancer is a
      common and underestimated problem as well as it can be a source of considerable physical
      disability and psychological distress [2]. Hence, the development of novel interventions to
      improve pain management is of high clinical relevance. Resistance training (RT) is a
      promising clinical therapeutic tool to improve a variety of adverse effects to breast cancer
      treatment [3] and may provide several pain-relieving benefits [4]. However, the efficacy of
      this modality for managing persistent pain after breast cancer treatment is currently
      unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to investigate if individualized RT can
      modulate persistent pain after breast cancer treatment, thereby improving our understanding
      of how this modality may benefit patients and contribute to clinical guidelines for pain
      management in this clinical population.
