      followed in single rooms. The information about how to apply the labor dance to the pregnant
      women in the experimental group will be explained by the researcher in the latent phase of
      birth and will be shown practically. Pregnant women in the experimental group will be given
      labor dance with music every hour until the cervical opening starts from 3 cm (latent phase)
      and the cervical opening reaches 8 cm. Pregnant women will musically choose one of Acema≈üiran
      Authority, Rehavi Authority and Farid Farjad's Thin Rose of My Idea. The researcher and
      pregnant women will perform a labor dance with the music for 15 minutes per hour. The
      researcher and the pregnant will hold each other's hands (3-4 steps distance), stand opposite
      each other and perform pelvic tilt together. When the pregnant woman desires or has
      contractions, the researcher will massage the waist and sacrum area with a ball massage
      glove.

      Details of the application and birth (such as dance time, birth time, contractions) will be
      recorded by the researcher. Pregnant women will be followed by the doctor, midwife and
      researcher during the tram, birth and first four hours postpartum.

      Ball Massage Glove Used in Mechanical Massage Application It consists of nine metal balls
      with a diameter of 1.5 cm that can rotate 360 degrees. With its glove design and ergonomic
      structure, it can be easily applied to any area. By concentrating directly on the massage
      points, it can be used more effectively on all points of the body. Since it is made of
      silicone material, it does not harm the hand and the area to be massaged while massaging.
