      off-medication condition, whereas euphoria, well-being, impulse control disorders, behavioral
      addictions, mania, and psychosis might occur during the on-medication condition. Early
      diagnosis of NpsyF is crucial for their holistic management. Unfortunately, NpsyF are often
      under-recognized by patients or misdiagnosed by physicians due to the lack of specific
      assessment tools. The NFS is composed of 20 items among which ten measure the "ON
      neuropsychological state" and ten, the "OFF neuropsychological state". It provides two
      sub-scores (one ON and one OFF) with a maximal total score of 30.
