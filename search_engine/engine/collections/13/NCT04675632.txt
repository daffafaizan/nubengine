      common and frequently-occurring disease in middle-aged and elderly people, and also an
      important manifestation of atherosclerosis in lower extremities.ASO is reported to be present
      in approximately 12%-14% of the population, increasing to 20% of the population over the age
      of 75.The current treatment methods of ASO include pharmacotherapy, surgical procedures,
      endovascular treatment, combined surgery, and autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT), etc.Endovascular treatment of ASO for lower limbs has the advantages
      of safety, effectiveness and fewer complications, and has become the preferred treatment for
      ASO.Endovascular treatment mainly includes: percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and
      bare stent implantation. Currently, the most commonly used surgical options include: ordinary
      balloon dilatation + drug-coated balloon (DCB) dilatation + bare stent implantation.A number
      of studies have proved that DCB and bare stent are more effective than common PTA, but
      postoperative restenosis in ASO is always a difficulty.In addition to the chronic total
      occlusion or diffuse lesion of the lower extremity arteries, the inferior genicular artery
      outflow channel, age, diabetes, hemodialysis and critical limb ischemia are all
      related.Matsumi J, et al. found that patency of the inferior genicular artery may be an
      important predictor of adverse events after the SMART stent implantation in patients with
      popliteal artery disease, and the preservation of the distal outflow tract may be beneficial
      to reduce the rate of restenosis Early analysis of the patency rate of inferior genicular
      artery bypass found that poor outflow tract could lead to an increase in bypass thrombosis
      events.Matsumi J,et al. found that patency of the Early analysis of the patency rate of
      inferior genicular artery bypass found that poor outflow tract could lead to an increase in

      implantation in patients with popliteal artery disease, and the preservation of the distal
      outflow tract may be beneficial to reduce the rate of restenosis.Daniel M et al. conducted a
      retrospective analysis of 95 patients with femoral popliteal artery stent implantation and
      found that,for patients with poor subgenual artery outflow tract, the number of additional
      inferior genicular artery during femoral artery stent implantation usually leads to better
      clinical outcomes.the number of inferior genicular artery shown by preoperative angiography
      is an independent predictor of post-stent clinical outcomes.This study demonstrates the
      importance of distal outflow tract clinical outcomes after stent implantation.Yusuke W,et al.
      conducted a retrospective study on 199 patients with chronic popliteal artery occlusion and
      found that additional inferior genicular artery opening during stent implantation was
      beneficial to the patency rate of the stent and clinical results .However, the current
      analysis of the influence of the tibial run off on the femoral popliteal patency is mainly a
      retrospective study.

      The purpose is to evaluate the patency of the tibial run off through a prospective
      multicenter observational real world study, whether it has an impact on the therapeutic
      effect after endovascular treatment in femoral popliteal artery , and whether one-stage
      reconstruction of the tibial run off can improve the postoperative patency rate of
      endovascular treatment.
