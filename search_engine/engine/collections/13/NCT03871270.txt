    
      At the Clinical Center Pain and Palliative Care Service (PPCS) we have developed a
      pscyho-social-spiritual measure, the Healing Experience in all Life Stressors (HEALS), that
      focuses on the healing experience in people with severe and life limiting illness. We have
      validated this tool further in order to be able to identify those individuals who may benefit
      from additional interventions to cope with their illness and even assist them in reaching a
      healing experience that is possible even in the midst of their unfavorable circumstances.
      Identification of vulnerable individuals as well individuals who do have transformative
      experience after being diagnosed with severe and life limiting illness, has far-reaching
      impact on the quality of patient care for the very sick patients.
