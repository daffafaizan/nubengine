    
      A key secondary objective is to determine if CYT107 treatment enables to reduce the incidence
      of severe haematological toxicity (any type of haematological toxicity Grade â‰¥ 3)
      post-chemotherapy.

      Other secondary objectives are to assess the impact of CYT107 treatment on the following
      parameters:

        -  Overall incidence of side effects (any type any grade)

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  Compliance to chemotherapy regimen (dose intensity, number of chemotherapy cycles).

        -  CD4 lymphopenia over the study period

      Exploratory biological markers

      A series of biomarkers analyses will be performed to evaluate if CYT107 treatment will:

        -  selectively stimulate the proliferation and activation of peripheral immune subsets
           (analysis of phenotype and activation status of peripheral immune e sub-populations)

        -  selectively improve the functional response of T cells, DC subsets and NK cells.

        -  is able to revert tolerogenic immune burden to increase specific anti-tumor response
           (measure of antigen specific CD8 response, measure of cytokine plasmatic levels)

        -  enable to increase TCR diversity (analysis of combinatorial diversity).
