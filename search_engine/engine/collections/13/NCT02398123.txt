    
      Children aged 1-7 years undergoing lower abdominal surgeries would be recruited in this
      randomized study.

      Children would be monitored by electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter and non-invasive blood
      pressure.

      After preoxygenation for three minutes, anesthesia would be induced with 8% sevoflurane
      inhalation in 33% oxygen and 66% nitrous oxide; 1ug/kg fentanyl is administered
      intravenously. Then laryngeal mask is inserted when conditions are satisfactory (jaw relaxed,
      lash reflex disappeared, no coughing, gagging, swallowing).

      Anesthesia would be maintained with 2% sevoflurane and nitrous oxide.

      An increase in blood pressure or heart rate by more than 15% from preoperative value was
      defined as insufficient analgesia and was treated with fentanyl 0.5 Âµ/kg. Saline dextrose5%
      (1:1) solution was infused in a dose of 12 ml/ kg /h.

      Children were transferred from PACU to day-surgery unit (DSU) if they achieved Modified
      Aldrete Score of ten.

      Patients received rectal paracetamol 15 mg/ kg every 6 hours. Tramadol 1mg/kg is rescue
      analgesic.
