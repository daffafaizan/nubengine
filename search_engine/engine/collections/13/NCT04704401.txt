      patients initially included in 9 studies conducted by the EFCR Department of the CHUGA
      between 2006 and 2015, presenting a sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) with exploration of their
      arterial stiffness via the measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV).

      The 9 studies were referred as : ADISAS (NCT011968), AGIRSASADOM (NCT010902), BPCO
      (NCT004044), BPCO-SAS (NCT01195064), DIAMETASAS, Aortic Dissection (NCT01068691), INFRASAS
      (NCT010892), VALSAS (NCT004094), NIV-OHS (NCT006030).

      The objective of this meta-analysis on individual data was to understand the relationship
      between the severity of the sleep apnea syndrome (measured by the apnea + hypopnea index) and
      arterial rigidity at the time of diagnosis of SAS.

      Currently, we do not have long-term follow-up data for these patients.

      The first objective of the "PWV Follow-up" project is to collect cardiovascular events in
      these patients through telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire to determine the
      prevalence of these events. The prevalence of metabolic events, incident cancers and deaths
      will be also determined as secondary objectives through the same questionnaire.

      Others secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP, the reference treatment for OSA) on the occurrence of cardiovascular and metabolic
      events and incident cancers, as this is still discussed in the literature.
