      that allow more tape stabilization with sparing the dissection along the whole urethra
      ensuring intact overlying tissues and to create a tunnel in between the 2 incisions to pass
      the tape, making it supported proximally and distally with normal undissected tissues.

      the study aims to assess the success rate of TOT and tape migration using a new surgical
      technique versus the standard procedure using vertical incision.
