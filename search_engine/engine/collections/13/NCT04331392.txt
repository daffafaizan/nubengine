      debilitating to younger and older adults, and can prevent a person's return to work, school
      and social life. The "hippocampus" is a ubiquitously compromised memory brain structure in
      moderate-severe TBI. Unfortunately, not only does the hippocampus sustain the damage at the
      time of injury, but researchers have identified that it shows continued atrophy in the months
      and years following injury. The investigators has developed a promising behavioural
      intervention for arresting this shrinkage, enhancing the integrity of the hippocampus - and
      improving memory function. It entails engagement in novel, continuous and challenging
      allocentric spatial navigation, that is, learning new routes of cities, and making a map in
      one's head of those routes for 1 hour/day, 5 days per week for a period of 16 weeks. N=87
      participants will be randomized to either the intervention group or an active control group
      that will watch 3 TedTalk videos per day, 5 days a week for the same duration. An MRI scan
      and cognitive measures focusing on memory and spatial navigation will be conducted before and
      after participation.
