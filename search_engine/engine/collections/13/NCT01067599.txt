    
      This is a randomized, multi-site trial determining the effects of switching smokeless tobacco
      (ST) users to lower toxicant ST products which vary in nicotine levels on biomarkers of
      exposure and patterns of use. ST users will undergo a two week baseline assessment period and
      then randomly assigned to one of three oral tobacco products (lower NNK plus NNN product with
      three different levels of nicotine) for a period of 8-weeks. Follow-up will occur at 9 and 20
      weeks.
