      sign an informed consent form. An initial eye exam will include visual acuity and stereo
      vision, eye movements and eye movement recording, a full slit lamp eye exam, intra-ocular
      pressure measurement, visual field, OCT and electrophysiology. The subjects will receive a
      single sublingual dose of cannabis (THC:CBD 1:1, THC 5 mg, or THE:CBD 1:40, THC 5 mg), and
      will undergo the above examination again. Subjects will be monitored for 5 hours after the
      administration of cannabis.
