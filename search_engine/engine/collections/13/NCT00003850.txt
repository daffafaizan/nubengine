      I. Determine the effect of thalidomide on survival of patients with recurrent or metastatic
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      II. Determine clinical response rates following this therapy in these patients. III.
      Determine the toxic effects of thalidomide in these patients. IV. Determine the effect of
      thalidomide on tumor angiogenesis in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 4-20 capsules of oral thalidomide once daily. Dose is escalated in
      individual patients on a weekly basis for the first 5 weeks. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or for 12 months past complete
      response.
