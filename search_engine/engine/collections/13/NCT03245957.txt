    
      MRI or CT scan are used to confirm the diagnosis of haemorrhagic, ischemic and mimick stroke.

      Plasma anf HDL-MPO concentrations, as well as potent HDL dysfunction, are compared in the 3
      cases.

      The investigators hypothesis is that MPO concentrations and subsequent HDL dysfunction could
      be higher in ischemic strokes than in haemorrhagic ones. MPO could be a examined as a potent
      marker of early stage of ischemic stroke.

      Plasma MPO levels could also be discriminant regarding the mimick strokes in patient
      exhibiting stroke clinical picture.
