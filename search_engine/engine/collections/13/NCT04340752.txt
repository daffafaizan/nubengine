      solution (IC-Green) for arthroscopic evaluation of rotator cuff vascularity. The primary
      endpoint is surgeon's ability to assess vascularity within the rotator cuff based on a
      5-point likert scale. The likert values from each of the three doses will undergo an ANOVA
      test to compare means of the three doses.
