      incisional negative pressure wound therapy versus standard sterile dressings in high-risk
      ventral hernia repairs. The trial will be enrolling patients undergoing elective or emergent
      ventral hernia repair who have risk factors for surgical wound complications and randomizing
      them to either receive a PREVENA incisional negative pressure wound therapy system dressing
      for 7 days post-operatively or a standard sterile dressing.for 2 days post-operatively. The
      primary outcome will be a composite of a variety of surgical site complications including
      wound infection, dehiscence, seroma / hematoma formation, non-healing wound, early hernia
      recurrence, and fistula formation. These will be evaluated by unblinded clinical judgement of
      treating physicians, and blinded assessment with ultrasonography. Secondary outcomes will
      include perceived difference in Quality of Life and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
