      likely to die from heart-related illnesses than other racial and ethnic groups. A large
      majority of African Americans are descendants of both African and European ancestors who
      mixed five to six generations ago. Because only a few generations have passed since that
      time, it is still possible to identify specific genes, the basic units of heredity, as being
      either African or European in origin. This is a sub study of the Jackson Heart Study, which
      is examining the environmental and genetic factors that influence the development of heart
      disease in African Americans. In this study, researchers will examine genes from participants
      in the Jackson Heart Study to identify specific African and European genes that influence the
      development of heart disease in African American men and women.

      This study will use genetic samples from individuals participating in the Jackson Heart
      Study. There will be no study visits for participants. Study researchers will examine the
      genetic samples and identify specific African and European genes that may influence the
      development of heart disease, high blood pressure, lipid disorders, left ventricular
      hypertrophy, and low birth weight.
