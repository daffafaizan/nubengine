      visit. Additional visits will be made if febrile episodes occur: an acute visit and a
      convalescent visit. Participants or their parents/guardians will be contacted weekly to
      monitor the occurrence of febrile episodes and ensure appropriate assessment and care.

      No vaccine will be provided or administered in this study.
