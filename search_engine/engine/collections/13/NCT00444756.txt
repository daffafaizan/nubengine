      buffered lidocaine to a 30-minute application of 4% ELA-Max for topical anesthesia in
      children 8-15 years old presenting to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department for PIV
      insertion. All subjects recorded self-reported Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for pain at
      time of enrollment and pain of PIV insertion. Jet injection subjects also recorded pain of
      jet injection. Subjects were videotaped during jet injection and PIV insertion. Videotapes
      were reviewed by a single blinded reviewer for observer-reported VAS pain scores for jet
      injection and PIV insertion.
