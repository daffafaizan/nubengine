      poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use must be discontinued. OPV-using countries must decide whether to
      switch to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or stop polio vaccination. Because only
      limited data are available on IPV immunogenicity in tropical developing countries, we
      conducted a randomized controlled trial of IPV in Cuba. The objectives of this study were to
      assess the humoral and mucosal immunogenicity conferred by IPV administered at the WHO-EPI
      schedule (6,10,14 wks of age) vs. placebo. A third arm was added to evaluate the
      immunogenicity of IPV administered at 2 and 4 months of age. Antibody titers were measured
      prior to the first dose as well as 1 month after the last dose in each study arm. Target
      sample size was 100 children in each arm. Mucosal (intestinal immunity) was measured
      indirectly through assessing poliovirus excretion in each group after a "natural challenge"
      of trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV)recieved by study participants through their
      participation in the annual OPV mass campaigns approximately 1 month after their last dose of
      vaccine.
