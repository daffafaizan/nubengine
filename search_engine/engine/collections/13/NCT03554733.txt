      improve resilience to stress for individuals with SCI who are transitioning from inpatient
      rehabilitation to home. The overarching hypothesis is that individuals who participate in an
      intervention that presents positive psychotherapy topics in an interactive, structured,
      cognitive-behaviorally-based group intervention that stresses restructuring maladaptive
      thought processes and provides experiential opportunities to reinforce behavioral change will
      demonstrate increased self-efficacy. There were three aims of this study: AIM 1:
      Self-Efficacy - To examine the ability of a six-week, manualized, cognitive-behaviorally
      based group educational intervention (Re-Inventing Yourself after SCI-Bridge) to improve both
      SCI-specific and general self-efficacy for people who are early in the process of community
      reintegration; AIM 2: Psychosocial Adjustment - To assess the ability of the Re-Inventing
      Yourself after SCI-Bridge intervention to improve psychosocial adjustment of people with SCI
      who are early in the community reintegration process; and, Aim 3: Participation - To
      determine the ability of the Re-Inventing Yourself after SCI-Bridge intervention to improve
      societal participation for people with SCI who are early in the community reintegration
      process.
