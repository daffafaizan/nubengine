      encourage long-term lifestyle modifications in diet and physical activity, improve control of
      type 2 diabetes, reduce risk factors for progression of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease, and improve quality of life, among health plan enrollees with type 2 diabetes and
      obesity. Patients agreeing to participate are randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1)
      lifestyle case management, in which initial 12 month intensive diet and physical activity
      intervention is followed by 30 months of active maintenance directed by dietitians and
      physical trainers (the "lifestyle case management" group); 2) lifestyle intervention, in
      which there is no formal maintenance following the intensive lifestyle intervention (the
      "lifestyle intervention" group). Because the lifestyle case management intervention
      incorporates the content of the lifestyle intervention, we will be able to assess the
      incremental effectiveness of providing post-intervention lifestyle case management on
      glycemic control, cardiovascular risk, body composition, diet and physical activity habits,
      and health care utilization.
