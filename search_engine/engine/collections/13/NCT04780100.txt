      end-stage hip disorders with satisfactory long-term clinical outcomes. However,the incidence
      of postoperative dislocation ranges from 0.3% to 3% in primary THA. The most important risk
      factor is malpositioning of implant components. Generally, excessive anteversion and
      retroversion increase risk of anterior and posterior hip dislocation respectively. Several
      radiological methods have been proposed to measure anteversion of the acetabular cup on plain
      radiographs, but most of these methods cannot accurately distinguish cup retroversion from
      anteversion. In this study, investigators will demonstrate and prove a ellipse method (Liaw's
      version) for measurement and detection of acetabulum cup retroversion.
