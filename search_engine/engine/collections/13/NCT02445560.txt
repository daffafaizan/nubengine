    
      Older women will be randomized to a 18-week crossover study design. During each treatment
      period participants will be provided with a weight maintenance diet providing approximately 2
      g/kg/day of protein.

      Following a two-week baseline and in random order will have the following diets assigned:

      The participants will be provided with a weight maintenance, high protein diet for two weeks,
      then for two-weeks will resume their normal diet;

      The participants will come back into clinic and for the next two weeks to receive a high
      protein diet with a multi-strain probiotic for two weeks, then for two-weeks will resume
      their normal diet;

      The participants will come back into clinic and for the next two weeks will receive a high
      protein diet with a prebiotic, then for two-weeks will resume their normal diet;

      The participants will come back into clinic and for the next two weeks will receive a high
      protein diet with the synbiotic combination. then for two-weeks will resume their normal diet

      Participants and researchers will be blinded for each treatment period (participants will
      receive a probiotic or placebo capsule, and a prebiotic or placebo sachet).

      The following will be performed during the clinic visits: Questionnaires will assess quality
      of life (QoL), wellness, gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel movement frequency, and compliance.
      Hand-grip strength will be measured. Blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline
      and at weeks 2, 6,10 and 14. Stool samples will be collected at baseline and at weeks 2, 4,
      6, 8,10, 12, 14 and 16.
