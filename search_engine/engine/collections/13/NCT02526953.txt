      in squamous-cell anal cancer. This is a prospective multicenter open-label randomized phase
      III clinical trial. Patients will be randomized using an online randomization system to
      receive either standard IMRT with capecitabine and mitomycin or IMRT with capecitabine,
      mitomycin and paclitaxel. A stratification will be performed based on T stage, N stage and
      clinical center. Doses of capecitabine and mitomycin in experimental group were reduced for
      better treatment tolerance. The target accrual is 157 patients in each treatment arm
      (including 10% potential data loss) based on potential benefit of 15% 3-yr disease-free
      survival (70% vs 85%), Î±=0,05, power 80% in the experimental arm. An interim analysis is
      planned after 50% of the patients will reach a 3-year followup. Pelvic Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) is performed in all patients for staging and followup. Pelvic MRI and
      histological diagnosis are subject to central review. Conduction of this study and data
      collection are controlled by a local institutional board.
