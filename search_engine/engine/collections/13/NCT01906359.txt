      (T2DM) will be recruited for this study. A randomized, crossover, double-blind study design
      will be carried out to investigate the acute effects of high fat meals prepared using palm
      olein (PO), chemically interesterified palm olein (IPO) and high oleic sunflower oil (HOS)
      (control) on study subjects with T2DM. Study subjects will have to undergo three postprandial
      challenges, separated by at least one week interval. Fasting blood sample and duplicate
      baseline blood samples will be taken in the morning of postprandial day. After that, subjects
      will be asked to consume a test meal consisting a high fat muffin baked using the
      aforementioned oils and a milkshake within 10 minutes. After meal, venous blood samples will
      be taken at time-points 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h and post-heparin plasma 5
      min and 15 min for analysis. Pulse wave analysis will be conducted to evaluate central blood
      pressure and arterial stiffness. Meal appreciation will be assessed by utilising visual
      analogue scale (VAS) before eating, after eating and at each time-point.
