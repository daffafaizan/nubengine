           investigators first ask subjects to engage in a cognitive assessment set while measuring
           EEG activity. For this study, the assessment set consists of the following tasks: (1)
           sustained attention; (2) response inhibition; (2) visuo-spatial working-memory; (3)
           Flanker interference processing, and (4) emotional interference processing. This battery
           takes about 30 minutes to complete. 24 channel EEG recordings are performed simultaneous
           to the cognitive tasks. Subjects perform the "BrainE" cognitive assessment, then receive
           brain-stimulation, and will then immediately be tested on the BrainE assessment again.

        2. Brain-Stimulation: Each subject will be asked to come in twice for this study, separated
           by 1 week. On week one they will receive one stimulation protocol, and on the subsequent
           week they will receive the other (order determined randomly for each subject). The
           intermittent Theta-Burst-Stimulation protocol (iTBS) consists of a similar burst pattern
           (3 stimulation pulses 20ms apart; each burst applied every 200ms). However, after 10
           bursts (2 seconds of stimulation) there is a pause for 8 seconds. 200 bursts are still
           applied, however due to the inter-burst intervals, this paradigm takes 200 seconds. The
           continuous Theta-Burst-Stimulation protocol (cTBS) consists of a burst of three
           stimulation pulses, applied 20ms apart; with each burst occurring every 200ms. Thus,
           every second participants receive 5 bursts. This continues for 40 seconds, such that
           participants in total receive 200 bursts or 600 pulses.
