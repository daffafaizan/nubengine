    
      EPIC MSC/IBD is made up of autologous marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo
      expanded numerically for approximately 14 days using pooled human Platelet Lysate (phPL),
      harvested on the day of infusion, washed and suspended at a concentration of 4 million
      cells/ml in Plasmalyte A with 0.5% human serum albumin. This is a phase I dose-escalation,
      open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of EPIC MSC2011-001. EPIC EPIC
      MSC/IBD will be infused intravenously and will be administered at one of three dose levels:
      (Tier 1) 2 million cells/kg patient body weight; (Tier 2) 5 million cells/kg, and (Tier 3) 10
      million cells/kg. This Phase I clinical trial will enroll 16-20 subjects with moderate to
      severe Crohn's. The duration of this study for each patient is 12 weeks. The investigators
      anticipate that this study will be completed within 2 years of commencement.

      Primary objective: To describe and compare the safety and tolerability of a single infusion
      of fresh autologous bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells infused to patients with
      moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

      Secondary objective: Efficacy of autologous bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells
      infusion to patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease as assessed through disease
      activity index, and quality of life index.

      Safety variables:Adverse events (AEs),Laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry,
      urinalysis), Vital signs.
