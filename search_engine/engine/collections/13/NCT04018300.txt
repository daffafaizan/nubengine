      prevalent nutrient disorder, today. Inadequate dietary intake of iron results in consequences
      like cognitive decline, fatigue, abnormal growth and adverse pregnancy outcomes. These
      ramifications have associated burdens on economical progression due to decreased market
      productivity. Inorganic iron supplements like ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are most commonly used
      to treat IDA, however known associated side effects occur, decreasing compliancy in
      individuals. Moreover, inorganic iron salts present a large bolus of iron to the intestinal
      lumen, resulting in non-transferrin bound iron which leads to systemic inflammation and
      further exacerbation of chronic diseases. Organic iron compounds have strong potential to be
      utilized for supplementation, however only under circumstances in which contain high
      absorbance. Seventeen subjects were randomized in a three-armed, double-blinded crossover
      design to examine the differences among three treatments (FeSO4, ASP-s and placebo). Outcomes
      will be to assess acute inflammatory proteins, oxidative stress, iron status indicators,
      non-transferrin bound iron and gastrointestinal-related side effects.
