      CD19 chimeric-EBV specific T cells in the laboratory. These cells are grown and frozen for
      the patient. Because the patient will have received cells with a new gene in them they will
      be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene
      transfer.

      The patient will be assigned a dose of CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor-T cells and CD19 chimeric
      receptor-EBV specific T cells. Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to
      be able to proliferate and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there
      are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, if the patient's level of
      circulating T cells is relatively high, they will receive one treatment of cyclophosphamide.
      This drug will decrease the numbers of the patient's own T cells before the infusion the CD19
      chimeric receptor T cells. Although it's not expected to have any effect on the tumor with
      the dose that the subject will receive, this drug is part of many regimens that are used to
      treat lymphoma or CLL. If the subject is already receiving chemotherapy, this may not be
      needed.

      The patient will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the
      assigned dose. The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for up to 3
      hours. If after a 4-6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient seems to be
      experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms),
      they may be able to receive up to three additional doses of the T cells. These additional
      infusions would be at least 4-6 weeks apart and at the same dose level the patient received
      the first time.
