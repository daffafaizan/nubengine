      be recruited for this study because they have different degrees of vasodilatation and
      inflammation, which are factors of potential importance to the effectiveness of plasma volume
      expansion with albumin 20%. Hyperoncotic albumin should logically recruit fluid from the
      interstitial fluid space, but this possibility has recently been questioned in the "revised
      Starling equation".

      The degree of plasma volume expansion and also the half-life will be estimated by population
      volume kinetics which uses serial analyses of the blood hemoglobin concentration and a
      summary measure of the excreted urine during the 5-hour experiment to calculate these outcome
      measures.

      There is a risk that hyperoncotic solutions cause pre-renal anuria due to the rise in plasma
      oncotic pressure. As a safety measure we will assess the plasma oncotic pressure and relevant
      biomarkers of renal function during the experiments. The experiments will be ended with a
      slow infusion of 1 L of RingerÂ´s acetate to dilute any raised oncotic pressure.
