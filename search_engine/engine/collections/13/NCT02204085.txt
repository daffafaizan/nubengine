    
      -  Phase I

             -  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined in the phase I section of the
                trial.

             -  Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to
                GO-203-2c.

             -  After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study. The
                investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs
                that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in
                participants that have acute myeloid leukemia (AML) not everyone who participates
                in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given
                will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study prior
                and how well the dose was tolerated.

             -  A subsequent dose escalation will evaluate the combination of GO-203-2c and
                decitabine.

        -  Phase II

             -  The primary goal is to determine if the combination of the two drugs results in
                clinical response
