      various surgeries. The current literature documents the use of a single-incision or
      single-port access surgery for cholecystectomies, adrenalectomies, splenectomies,
      appendectomies, herniorrhaphies, bariatrics, and colon surgery.

      Total of 100 patients who undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disorders
      will randomly assign to undergo SILS cholecystectomy group (n = 50) or TPCL cholecystectomy
      group (n= 50) according to a computer-generated table of random numbers. Demographics (ie,
      age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score,
      indication for operation, need for conversion to a standard or three port laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy, need for conversion to an open cholecystectomy will be recorded. Outcome
      measures include operative morbidity, operative time, pain score, hospital stay. Morbidity
      will be evaluated by rates of bile leak, wound infection, hospital readmission, and hernia.
