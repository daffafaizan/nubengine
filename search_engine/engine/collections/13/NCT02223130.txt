      improve coping responses to discrimination among HIV positive Black men who have sex with men
      (MSM). We will conduct a small randomized pilot trial to test the feasibility of evaluation
      methods. All participants will attend a baseline, a first follow-up visit, and a final
      follow-up visit (each 3 months apart) at which they will take computer assessments.
      Participants who are assigned to the intervention will attend 9 weekly intervention sessions
      after baseline and before the first follow-up. Using a wait-list control design, control
      group participants from the first two cohorts will be offered the intervention after they
      complete the final follow-up visit. Control group participants from the third cohort will be
      offered the intervention after they complete the first final-up visit and before they
      complete their final follow-up due to timing and budgetary restraints. We will hold three
      consecutive groups for our small randomized control trial. This means that we will be
      recruiting continuously; once we finish recruiting for the first group, we will start
      recruiting for the second group, and so on. Each group has about 12 or 13 intervention and
      7-11 control participants.
