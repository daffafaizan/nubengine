      of a PICC line in the Neuroscience intensive care unit were randomly assigned to either the
      SCD (intervention) group or a non SCD (control) group.

      Standardized vascular access patency protocols was used in all enrolled patients. All
      patients had an indwelling 5 French, double lumen PICC unless additional venous access was
      required by the primary service. Patients randomized to the intervention arm had an SCD
      placed in the arm with the PICC within 24 hours of PICC placement.

      Five to seven days after placement of the PICC, the patients were examined with venous duplex
      ultrasound of the upper extremity to assess for the presence of venous thrombosis. The
      patients also had the ultrasound again 12-14 days post insertion if the PICC was kept for
      more than 10 days. If the PICC line was removed before 5-7 days, an upper extremity
      ultrasound was obtained upon PICC removal. In case of suspected symptomatic venous
      thromboembolism, the investigations were performed according to current practice standards.
      Data collection was be considered complete upon removal of the PICC line.
