    
      Comparative, prospective, observational, two-groups study. group 1 : Middle Hepatic Vein(MHV)
      will reconstructed by fashioning a PTFE graft of suitable size positioned parallel to the cut
      surface of the Modified Right Lobe Graft.This position theoretically make the PTFE graft in a
      position similar to MHV.Any vein >4mm will be connected end to side fashion to the PTFE
      graft.The distal end of the PTFE graft will be closed by hemolock just distal to segment 5
      vein .The proximal end of PTFE graft will be anastomosed to the recipient MHV orifice or
      MHV/lift orifice group 2: The end of segment 5 vein will be anastomosed to the end of
      suitable size PTFE graft which will be anastomosed to Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) directly and
      The end of segment 8 vein will be anastomosed to the end of suitable size PTFE graft which
      will be anastomosed to MHV or MHV/Lift orifice directly.the study will not be randomized .All
      operation will be done by tha same team .Choice of technique at surgeon discretion .Outflow
      adequecy will be assessed by Doppler Ultrasound intraoperatively and daily for 5 day once per
      week for 4 week and ,2,3,6,month.Progressive diminished flow or absent flow both will be
      considered as graft not patent .Markers of venous congestion will be considered as secondary
      outcome measure.
