      build up a research registry of HDV patients all over the world.

      The aims of this project are:

      i. Collect clinical information from hepatitis delta patients from multiple centers
      distributed worldwide in order to build up a large database that will enable and facilitate
      further research on chronic hepatitis delta.

      ii. To better inform patients about their viral infection, present status and evolution of
      liver disease throughout time. To give them the tools needed to inform other peers and
      medical professionals about the significance and consequences of a chronic hepatitis delta
      infection.

      iii. To allow the participating physicians to track course of the disease, therapies, signs
      and symptoms of the hepatitis delta patients included by their center.
