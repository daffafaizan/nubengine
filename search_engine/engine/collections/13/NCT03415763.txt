      recurrence rather than distal metastases in advanced rectal cancer. Moreover, the local
      control was not responsible for survival benefit. Adjuvant chemotherapy is capable of
      eliminating the micrometastasis, rendering better prognosis to rectal cancer. However, the
      application of adjuvant chemotherapy depends largely on the evidence from colon cancer. At
      present, controversy remains on the clinical value of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
      rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Besides that, the pathological
      stage followed by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may have an effect on the evaluation of
      adjuvant chemotherapy. According to the postoperative pathological stage, the present study
      was designed as a non-inferiority trail for patients with pathological complete response or
      yp stage I to compare the long-term outcomes of observational group and those receiving
      5-fluorouracil. For patients with yp stage II or III, the study aims to compare the effect of
      oxaliplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorouracil alone.
