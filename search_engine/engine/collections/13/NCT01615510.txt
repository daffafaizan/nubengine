      (Tapentadol) in two human experimental models of 1) cold and mechanical (pinprick)
      hyperalgesia after topical application of menthol at high-concentration [40%] and 2) of heat
      and mechanical (pinprick) hyperalgesia by topical applied capsaicin [0.6%] in comparison to
      placebo. Therefore, cold, heat and mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia will be determined
      by parameters of the Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). These parameters are cold and heat
      pain thresholds, mechanical pain threshold and sensitivity as well as dynamic mechanical
      allodynia. Further, the areas of dynamic mechanical allodynia and pinprick-hyperalgesia will
      be determined at each timepoint of QST-assessement.
