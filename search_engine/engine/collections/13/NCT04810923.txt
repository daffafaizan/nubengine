      approval by the University Ethics Committee. The patients with TMJ-OA randomly assigned one
      of the two treatment groups: intra-articular injection of i-PRF after arthrocentesis
      procedure as i-PRF group and arthrocentesis procedure alone as control group. All treatment
      procedures were completed by the same experienced surgeon under the local anesthesia. The
      procedure of arthrocentesis was performed using the standard technique and after
      arthrocentesis procedure, the i-PRF injection was performed in the test group.

      The primary outcome variable was pain levels at preoperatively, and postoperatively at 1st,
      2nd, 3rd, 6th and 12th month. The secondary outcome variables included maximum mouth opening
      (MMO), lateral and protrusive movements.
