    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of clostridium butyricum CBM 588 probiotic strain (CBM588) (in
      combination with nivolumab/ipilimumab) on the gut microbiome in patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of CBM588 on the clinical efficacy of the nivolumab/ipilimumab
      combination.

      II. To assess the effect of CBM588 on systemic immunomodulation of the nivolumab/ipilimumab
      combination in patients with mRCC.

      III. To assess the effect of CBM588 on toxicities such as diarrhea and nausea using Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5 criteria with the
      nivolumab/ipilimumab combination in patients with mRCC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over
      30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in cycle 5, patients receive
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive clostridium butyricum CBM 588 probiotic strain orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID), nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in cycle 5, treatment with clostridium butyricum CBM 588
      probiotic strain and nivolumab repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and periodically
      thereafter.
