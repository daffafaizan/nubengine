      I. To determine the ability of 5-azacytidine to cause DNA hypomethylation and re-expression
      of silenced tumor suppressor genes when stratified for high or low expression of mir29a, b,
      and c.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the molecular studies (mir29 expression and tumor suppressor gene methylation)
      between archival tissue, fresh biopsy pre-treatment samples, and post-treatment fresh
      samples.

      II. To determine the overall response rate by CT (RECIST 1.1 criteria) and PET (EORTC PET
      response criteria), PFS, and OS of patients treated with azacytidine in the second- or
      third-line setting.

      III. To correlate the blood microRNA profiles (and changes in microRNA profiles) with
      response to azacytidine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tissue and blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study
      treatment for correlative studies. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed
      up for 12 weeks.
