      for elective intubation. Current airway management guidelines recommend video-assisted
      laryngoscopy as a choice for basic airway management. This is a proposed comparison study of
      a video laryngoscope, use in the daily anesthesia practice, and its likely increased success
      compared to semi-rigid stylet. An national, mono center, prospective randomized comparative
      trial (RCT) is proposed testing the superiority of oral tracheal intubation with the McGrathÂ®
      Series 5 versus SensaScope in adult patients under general anaesthesia.
