      sub-lobectomy surgery is as feasible and effective as lobectomy surgery in patients with
      early-stage peripheral non-small cell lung cancer,by assessing the retainability of lung
      function.and improvement of quality of life in those patients.

      Outline:This is a prospective, matched, controlled, open, multi-center clinical study. Select
      the early-stage peripheral NSCLC 630 patients (diameterâ‰¤2cm), according to age and lesion
      type (GGO component ratio) two matching factor of 1: 2 assigned to sub-lobectomy group and
      lobectomy group.Patients are followed up every 3 months for the first year and then every 6
      months for the other 4 years.
