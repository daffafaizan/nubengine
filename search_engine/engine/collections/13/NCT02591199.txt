    
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, single-dose,
      pharmacokinetic study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination
      product (URG101) compared with its individual components (Heparin Sodium and Lidocaine
      Hydrochloride).

      Eligible subjects exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms of bladder pain associated with
      their diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome who have signed informed
      consent, will be screened and provisionally enrolled for intravesical treatment.

      On the day of study drug administration subjects will be randomized (2:1:2:1;
      URG101:placebo:lidocaine:heparin) and will receive a single administration of one of four
      intravesical treatments in a blinded fashion, based on random assignment:

        1. URG101 (buffered lidocaine-heparin)

        2. Placebo (phosphate buffer)

        3. Lidocaine hydrocholoride buffered alone

        4. Heparin sodium buffered alone

      Efficacy and safety assessments will be completed for 24 hours after study drug
      administration. End of Study Follow-up will be completed by telephone 48 to 72 hours after
      study drug administration.
