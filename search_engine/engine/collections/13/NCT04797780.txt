      blood test will be used to identify participants with RARA-positive MDS. Assessment of the
      RARA biomarker for study eligibility will be done by collection of blood samples from
      potential study participants at the pre-screening visit and testing at a central laboratory.
      Participants who meet eligibility requirements will be randomized 2:1 to receive either
      SY-1425 plus azacitidine or placebo plus azacitidine.
