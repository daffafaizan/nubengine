      States. Fifteen percent of those who survive the initial bleeding die or suffer disabilities
      because of delayed ischemic deficit (stroke) due to vasospasm. Vasospasm is a condition in
      which the arteries in the brain constrict, not allowing sufficient blood flow and
      oxygenation. Research on the pharmacological prevention and treatment of vasospasm has
      resulted in only minimal improvement for this problem.

      Transluminal ballooning is a procedure that opens blood vessels, allowing blood flow and
      oxygen to get to the brain more easily. Researchers believe that this dilation of the blood
      vessels lasts for at least 7 days. This procedure is used to treat severe vasospasm although
      it is not commonly used to prevent vasospasm. The purpose of this trial is to find out if
      this procedure, performed immediately after the aneurysm is secured, prevents spasm in the
      brain and improves patient outcome.

      Eligible SAH patients whose aneurysm has been repaired by neurosurgical or endovascular
      procedure and who are enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive either the
      prophylactic transluminal ballooning procedure or to receive standard care, which includes
      currently existing therapies for the treatment of vasospasm.

      Participants will be asked to return for follow-up examinations at 3 and 6 months to evaluate
      recovery using a standardized outcome scale.
