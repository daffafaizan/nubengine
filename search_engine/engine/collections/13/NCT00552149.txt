    
      The BINGO trial is an open-label randomized phase II study evaluating the efficacy and
      tolerance of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy (GEMOX regimen) alone or in
      combination with cetuximab in patients (pts) with ABC. The BINGO study also comprises
      ancillary translational research and functional imaging studies which aim to identify markers
      predictive for treatment efficacy in ABC.

      All eligible pts will be randomized 1:1 to receive:

        -  Arm A: GEMOX alone every two weeks.

        -  Arm B: GEMOX + cetuximab every two weeks.

      Randomization will be stratified according to:

        1. tumor stage (locally advanced vs metastatic),

        2. primary tumor location (gallbladder vs non-gallbladder),

        3. prior treatments (surgery or radiotherapy or brachytherapy or photodynamic therapy [PDT]
           or adjuvant chemotherapy vs none),

        4. center. EGFR tumor status has to be assessed for every pt by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
           using biopsy or surgical material, at any time prior to inclusion into the study, but it
           is neither an inclusion/exclusion criterion nor a stratification factor.
