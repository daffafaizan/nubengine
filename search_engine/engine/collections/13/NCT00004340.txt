      and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

      Patients in the first group are treated with recombinant human growth hormone subcutaneously
      every day for 8 months.

      Patients in the second group are treated with calcitriol for 8 months, administered as a
      daily oral dose or an intraperitoneal dose three times a week.

      Patients in the third group are treated with growth hormone and calcitriol (same dosages as
      above).

      A control group does not receive any hormonal therapy.
