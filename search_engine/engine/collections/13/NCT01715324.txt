      produced, as a supplement to gonadotrophins in an In Vitro Fertilization cycle has been
      suggested as a way in which In Vitro Fertilization pregnancy rates may be increased.Growth
      hormone has been shown, in animal and human studies, to be important in the recruitment of
      follicles.However, to date, only a limited number of clinical studies have been performed in
      order to assess whether the addition of growth hormone can improve the probability of
      pregnancy in women undergoing ovarian stimulation for In Vitro Fertilization. As the total
      number of patients analysed in these studies was small it has not been possible to determine
      whether if there is any improvement the outcome of an In Vitro Fertilization cycle when a
      woman is given growth hormone therapy as a supplement during her treatment.

      This goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using growth hormone therapy as
      a supplement to the administration of gonadotropins in an antagonist In Vitro Fertilization
      protocol.
