      The children started with 1 drop of undiluted raw egg emulsion (0.05 ml) flavored with
      vanilla and cacao, hidden by the parents in the child's breakfast (cow's milk, soymilk, fruit
      juice or other). The dose was doubled at intervals of about one month in the day hospital.
      The increases in dose were customized for each subject based on the frequency and severity of
      side effects, or when an inter-current illness or asthma worsening intervened during the
      SOTI.

      The investigators limited the SOTI protocol to six months for all patients, irrespective of
      the dose reached, in order to favor the adherence of families to the study.

      When objective symptoms seemed more important (grade 2, 3 and 4 reaction), medical treatment
      was given. Subjects were discontinued from the study in case of severe adverse reactions
      (grade 5 reaction). Parents were advised they could telephone investigators 24 hours a day
