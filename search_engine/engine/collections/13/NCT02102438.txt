      death in women. BC incidence is markedly increased with aging.

      Amplification or overexpression of HER2 oncogene is present in approximately 18 to 20% of
      primary invasive BC. In the absence of HER2 target therapy combined with adjuvant or
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, HER2 overexpression or amplification is associated with high rates
      of disease recurrence and death.

      There is major concern regarding chemotherapy related toxicity in the group of women older
      than 65 years old diagnosed with HER2 positive breast cancer. Nevertheless, these patients
      are at a particularly high risk of breast cancer recurrence and death. Of note, older
      patients may experience higher risk for Trastuzumabe related cardiotoxicity, especially when
      this agent is combined with an anthracycline.

      Recent studies have shown extremely favourable outcomes in early HER2+ BC patients treated
      with a combination of paclitaxel and trastuzumab, omitting anthracyclines from treatment.

      Investigators sought to investigate safety and outcome data on a cohort of elderly patients
      treated with weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin and trastuzumab.
