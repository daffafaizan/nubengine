      practical or feasible. Approximately 18% of the women in the ACTG 076 trial missed their IV
      ZDV infusions, even at experienced ACTG sites. There is an urgent need to establish a more
      practical method of delivering ZDV during labor and delivery that, at minimum, will
      approximate the rate of ZDV administration utilized in ACTG 082. In the future, this would
      enable women to start an intensive ZDV regimen during early labor, even prior to reaching the
      hospital.

      Cohort 1: Women in active labor receive 3 doses of oral ZDV 3 hours apart followed by PK
      sampling. After PK sampling post 3rd oral dose, or at 8 cm dilation (whichever comes first),
      women receive IV ZDV until delivery. The cord blood will be analyzed for serum ZDV PK levels
      and the infant's infection status will be determined. If the dose of ZDV is adequate to
      achieve targeted maternal serum drug levels in Cohort 1 and if oral dosing is tolerated in
      this cohort, Cohort 2 will begin enrollment. [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/03/01: Cohort 1 has been
      completed and only Cohort 2 is open for enrollment.] Cohort 2: [AS PER AMENDMENT 08/03/01:
      Women in active labor receive initial loading dose of oral ZDV, then another dose of oral ZDV
      3 hours later, both doses followed by PK sampling. After PK sampling post second oral dose,
      or at 8 cm dilation (whichever comes first), woman receives IV ZDV until delivery. The cord
      blood will not be analyzed for serum ZDV PK levels and the infant's infection status will be
      determined.]
