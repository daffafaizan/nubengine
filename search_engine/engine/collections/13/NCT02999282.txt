    
      In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, the investigators will evaluate the
      effects of frontal and prefrontal anodal transcranial magnetic stimulation (tDCS) on
      neurophysiological parameters of cortical connectivity, assessed by transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS), in asymptomatic subjects bearing a pathogenic GRN mutation and in
      symptomatic patients with frontotemporal dementia.

      All patients will undergo genetic screening for progranulin mutations, a baseline
      neuropsychological and neurophysiological evaluation, including assessment of short interval
      intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, short interval intracortical
      facilitation and long interval intracortical inhibition. Subjects will then be randomized in
      two groups, one receiving a 10 day (5 days/week for 2 weeks) treatment with anodal frontal
      and prefrontal anodal tDCS and the other receiving sham stimulation with identical
      parameters. After the intervention, patients will be reassessed with a neuropsychological and
      neurophysiological evaluation at 2 weeks, 1 month (only neurophysiological evaluation), 3
      months and 6 month after treatment.
