      Primary

        -  Determine the number of severe adverse events and life-threatening infections in
           patients with T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia or T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia
           treated with induction chemotherapy comprising fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and
           mitoxantrone hydrochloride followed by consolidation therapy comprising alemtuzumab.

        -  Determine the remission rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of remission in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising fludarabine IV and cyclophosphamide IV for
      3 days and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on 1 day. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      4 courses. Patients then receive consolidation therapy comprising alemtuzumab IV 3 times in
      week 1 and then weekly for up to 11 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17 patients will be accrued for this study.
