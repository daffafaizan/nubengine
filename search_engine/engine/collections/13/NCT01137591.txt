      accounts for more overdose and overdose deaths in the United States and United Kingdom than
      any other pharmaceutical agent. If N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is given within 8 to 10 hours of
      APAP ingestion, it has been shown to prevent serious liver failure and death in the setting
      of overdoses. Therefore, it may be beneficial to administer APAP in combination with NAC
      routinely to reduce rates of liver failure and death. Because NAC's main role is to reduce
      the accumulation of APAP's toxic metabolites, the concomitant administration of NAC should
      have no impact on the efficacy of APAP as an antipyretic and analgesic. Thus, we propose a
      single-center, non-inferiority randomized control study comparing the efficacy of the
      APAP-NAC combination as compared to APAP-placebo as an anti-pyretic agent.
