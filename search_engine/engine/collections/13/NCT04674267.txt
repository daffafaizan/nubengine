        -  Phase 1 - Needs assessment and implementation plan

        -  Phase 2 - Pilot Intervention

        -  Phase 3 - Expanded Clinical Trial

             -  Please note Phase 2 - Pilot Intervention and Phase 3 - Expanded Clinical Trial will
                be added to the clinicaltrials.gov record once IRB approved.

      Phase 1 is composed of three aims and will inform the subsequent two phases:.

        -  Aim 1: To evaluate the perceived needs of Older Adults diagnosed with gastrointestinal
           malignancies, caregivers, staff, and faculty to characterize the implementation setting
           for a geriatric consultation.

        -  Aim 2: To refine the proposed REACH program implementation plan based on qualitative
           feedback provided by Older Adult (OA) patients, their identified caregivers, staff, and
           faculty.

        -  Aim 3: Determine the patient, demographic, social determinants, clinical and disease
           characteristics of Older Adults (OA) associated with ED visits/hospitalization following
           initial oncology consultation at DF/BWCC in year 2019.

             -  The research study procedure includes one discussion on the needs of older adult
                patients receiving cancer care, along with the needs of their caretakers and cancer
                care team.

             -  Patients and caregivers will participate in individual interviews, while staff and
                faculty will participate in focus groups.
