      breast conditions surpass cancer as a cause of symptoms related to the breast. However,
      breast symptoms may be associated with significant distress and may impose diagnostic
      difficulties. Moreover, certain pathological entities of benign breast conditions are well
      known to increase the risk of breast cancer.

      Identification of modifiable risk factors associated with symptomatic breast disorders has
      several potential benefits. Modification of such factors may help decrease patients'
      distress, hospital visits and indirectly decrease the risk of cancer.

      the available data point to the possible association of several environmental factors with
      symptomatic BBD. Most of the available information points to an association of BBD with
      anthropometric features, growth pattern, family history of breast conditions and dietary
      consumption. Substantial evidence are however lacking and further studies are strongly
      required to better characterize the risk factors of the condition.

      In this study, the investigators will systematically collect epidemiological, developmental
      and clinical data in young patients presenting with breast complaints. The association with
      disease incidence, pattern and histology will be examined.
