      4. 12-Item MS Walking Scale (Quality of Life assessment). This study will be 24 weeks long.

      minutes in duration. Outcome measures (all or part) will be assessed at the following times:
      initial (T1), week 5 (T2), week 13 (T3), and week 24 (T4). Subjects will be closely monitored
      throughout the 24 week study and will be un-enrolled by self-request or the following medical
      reasons: 1. Acute exacerbation of MS symptoms, 2. New diagnosis with direct consequences
      affecting gait training, 3. Inability to tolerate the AFO.
