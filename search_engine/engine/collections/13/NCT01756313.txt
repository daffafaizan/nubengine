    
      12 healthy male individuals were included.

      On the back, 25 areas measuring 2.8x2.8 cm were marked, plus one control area. We tested 2
      variables.

      1) Density of laser channels. 2) Methylaminolevulinat (MAL) concentration

        1. Laser - Each area was randomized to receiving:

             -  no treatment

             -  1% laser channel density

             -  2% laser channel density

             -  5% laser channel density

             -  10% laser channel density

             -  15% laser channel density

        2. MAL - Each density was assigned to 4 areas. Within each density category, the four areas
           were randomized to receive:

             -  vehicle

             -  4% MAL

             -  8%MAL

             -  16%MAL

      The uptake of MAL was evaluated by fluorescence intensity measured with a florescence camera
      at t=

        -  0min

        -  30min

        -  1h

        -  1.5h 2h 2.5h 3h
