    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, 5-period crossover study in healthy male and female
      subjects, 18 to 35 years of age, to compare the electrophysiological response of hERG
      potassium channel blocking drugs with and without the addition of late sodium or calcium
      channel blocking drugs. The 5 treatment periods are 1) dofetilide alone, 2) mexiletine with
      and without dofetilide, 3) lidocaine with and without dofetilide, 4) moxifloxacin with and
      without diltiazem and 5) placebo. During each treatment period, 12 blood samples for
      pharmacokinetic measurements are obtained with matched 12-lead ECG recordings.
