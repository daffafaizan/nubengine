    
      This single-centre, two-part, open-label study is designed to evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD)
      effects of bevacizumab and pazopanib in subjects with renal cancer who experience disease
      progression following at least one prior therapy of documented clinical benefit. In Part I,
      subjects will receive 3 infusions of 10 mg/kg bevacizumab, administered at 2-week intervals.
      The PD response to bevacizumab will be evaluated over 6 weeks using imaging techniques
      (magnetic resonance imaging; computed tomography [CT]; and positron emission tomography),
      intratumoural VEGF signaling by immunohistochemisty, plasma and serum biomarkers, and
      circulating tumour cells. Subjects may continue into Part II if, in the opinion of the
      investigator, the subject would derive continued clinical benefit from anti-angiogenic
      therapy. In Part II, each subject will receive sequentially escalating doses of oral
      pazopanib in 3-week cycles as follows: 1) 200 mg twice weekly, 2) 200 mg every other day, 3)
      200 mg daily, 4) 400 mg daily, 5) 800 mg daily, and 6) 1200 mg daily. Subjects entering Part
      II will be randomised to receive treatment either throughout each 3-week cycle (Group 1) or
      for the first 2 weeks of each cycle only, followed by a 1 week treatment holiday (Group 2).
      After completion of Part II dose escalation subjects will receive continuous pazopanib at a
      dose of 800 mg daily in repeating 3-week cycles. These subjects will receive pazopanib until
      loss of clinical benefit, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for
      other reasons.
