      scheduled for extraction due to orthodontic requirement will be treated with a regeneration
      protocol. Teeth (n=20/group) will be extracted at 3 months following the regenerative
      protocol or the pulpectomy control. The protocol relies on disinfection of the canal space by
      copious irrigation with common endodontic irrigants and placement of a triple antibiotic
      paste (regenerative group) or calcium hydroxide dressing (control group) to disinfect the
      root for a period of one month. In each patient, both treatment arms will be performed. Thus,
      each treatment sample will have a contralateral matching control (paired designs). At the end
      of one month, the intracanal medicaments (triple antibiotic paste) is irrigated out of the
      canal and a blood clot is stimulated in the canal with the aid of endodontic files that are
      introduced into the periapical tissues; this blood clot will serve as a scaffold for tissue
      proliferation within the canal. The regenerative treatment tooth is then restored to prevent
      bacteria from the oral cavity from re-contaminating the canal space. For the contralateral
      control tooth, the medication will remain in the tooth until the extraction date. The
      subjects in this study will have the treated teeth extracted at 3 months after initial
      treatment. The extracted teeth from each study participant will be placed in storage medium
      until Immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to characterize the tissue/cells within
      the canal.
