      difference between IOP by Goldmann Applanation Tonometry to the IOP by Dynamic Contour
      Tonometry to the biomechanical parameters of the cornea measured by Corvis ST. Therefore the
      investigators gain new findings about the influence of the biomechanical corneal parameters
      on the IOP. In order to do so the investigators want to examine 50 Glaucoma eyes and 50
      non-Glaucoma Eyes with Goldmann Applanation Tonometry, Dynamic Contour Tonometry, and Corvis
      ST.
