      TOF-stimulation is sufficient to avoid unwanted muscular activity. At reappearance of T2, the
      anesthesiologist might decide to either give (another) maintenance dose of rocuronium or
      vecuronium when surgery continues, to await spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular block or to
      reverse the neuromuscular block. Sugammadex has been shown in previous trials to greatly
      reduce the time to full recovery when administered at reappearance of T2, both after
      rocuronium- and vecuronium induced neuromuscular blockade. The current trial P05971 was
      conducted in Europe and set up to establish the dose response relationship of sugammadex
      given during sevoflurane anesthesia at reappearance of T2 after rocuronium or vecuronium in
      Caucasian participants. In addition to recovery time, also pharmacokinetics and safety of
      sugammadex were to be evaluated.
