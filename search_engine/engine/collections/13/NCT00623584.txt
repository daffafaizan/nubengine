      corneal grafts cultured under serum free conditions to corneal grafts cultured in the Minimal
      Essential Medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, based on a parallel comparison of the
      endothelial cell density of paired corneal grafts deriving from single donors at different
      time points before and after the grafting procedure. In addition, the safety of the clinical
      use of corneal grafts cultured in both media will be determined. The graft survival rate
      during the follow-up period will be quantified in regard to immune mediated graft rejection
      and non-immune mediated graft failure, as well as the incidence of corneal edema, corneal
      opacities and corneal neovascularisation.
