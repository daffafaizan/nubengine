      prevalence of obstructive form of sleep apnea. The investigators expect a higher prevalence
      of this serious sleep pathology in normal weight patients with central obesity than in normal
      weight patient without central obesity. In normal weight patients with central obesity also
      endothelial dysfunctions, abnormal exercise response to dynamic load and abnormal circadian
      patterns of blood pressure and heart rate can be expected. There are theoretical assumptions
      for this hypothesis but relevant studies on sufficiently large samples of patients have not
      been done. The investigators will also compare the lipid profile in normal weight patients
      with central obesity with those of normal weight patients without central obesity.
