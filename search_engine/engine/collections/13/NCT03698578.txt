      athletes and G2 consisting of amateur athletes. This division was carried out to guarantee
      homogeneous stratification between participants with level of conditioning and similar
      training. The anonymity of the participants will be guaranteed. There will be masking of the
      participants, investigator and evaluator of the results that were blind to the hypotheses and
      allocation in groups, adopted in the study. All participants regularly attended the same
      training center and no sports injuries that might compromise athletic performance will be
      reported during the survey.
