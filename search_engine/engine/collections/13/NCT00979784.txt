      dietary and exercise interventions for obesity in a 12-week randomized trial. Methods: We
      randomized 49 overweight or obese adult patients either to a better weight (BW) cognitive
      behavioral intervention, or to a combination of the BW intervention and a better sleep
      intervention, better weight-better sleep (BWBS). Results: The BWBS group lost weight faster
      (P=.04), and coping self-efficacy accelerated (P=.01). Conclusions: These preliminary results
      merit replication in a larger primary care-based trial with a longer continuous intervention
      and followup period. Key words: obesity, sleep, weight loss, primary care, health behavior E
