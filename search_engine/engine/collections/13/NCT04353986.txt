    
      In this study, patients in both treatment groups will receive 12 weeks of treatment with a
      fixed-dose combination tablet containing 400 mg of sofosbuvir and 90 mg of
      ledipasvir(SOF/LED) orally, once daily with food, as prescribed by the attending physician.
      Twelve eligible HCV-infected patients with hematological disorder and 12 matching HCV control
      patients without haematological disorder or comorbidities will be enrolled in the study. At
      baseline, careful history of the recruited patients including demographic characteristics
      (age, height, weight, and gender), comorbidities, medication history, familial history,
      social history, blood transfusion history, and baseline laboratory tests will be documented.

      The baseline laboratory tests will include renal function tests (serum creatinine), liver
      function tests (bilirubin, albumin, AST, and ALT), international normalised ratio (INR),
      alpha fetoprotein (AFP), complete blood count (CBC), degree of liver fibrosis by
      Fibroscan,viral load by PCR and HCV genotype Follow-up will be done for all participants at
      baseline, after 10 days of treatment for the evaluation of the steady state PK parameters of
      SOF/LED in those patients, after 12 weeks of treatment, and after 12 weeks from the end of
      treatment. For a total of 4 follow-up visits.
