    
      Secondary outcome evaluations for this clinical study include the following:

        -  To estimate overall survival, disease free survival and event free survival for these
           patients

        -  To estimate the incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GvHD in these patients

        -  To estimate the incidence of chronic GvHD and graft failure in these patients

        -  To estimate the incidence of non-hematologic peri-transplant regimen-related toxicity
           and regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days after transplantation in these
           patients

        -  To estimate the number of patients who require donor lymphocyte infusions and/or stem
           cell boosts after transplantation in this group of patients and evaluate its impact on
           immune reconstitution and engraftment

        -  To estimate the number of patients who develop evidence of EBV reactivation or post
           transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLPD) post transplant in this group of patients

        -  Describe the pharmacokinetics of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) in patients
           receiving allogeneic transplantation and determine the frequency of rATG antibody
           development

        -  Explore dose and patient characteristics as determinants of active rATG pharmacokinetic
           parameters

      Originally this study began as a randomized comparison of two methods of stem cell selection
      utilizing the CliniMACS device. Both arms provided a purified product of CD34+ hematopoietic
      cells that was depleted of T-lymphocytes. One arm utilized a positive selection methodology
      using an anti-CD34 antibody and the other arm utilized negative selection with the anti-CD3
      antibody OKT-3. There were no toxicities noted that would have required the study to be
      interrupted early, however, due to low accrual, it was decided to redesign the study. The new
      design focused on the standard arm utilizing negative selection, and all subsequent
      participants were treated in that manner. The patients who were treated on the positive
      selection arm are continuing to be monitored as specified in the original protocol, but will
      be reported in a descriptive manner only. The primary and secondary objectives of the current
      version of this study will be answered only by those patients receiving a haploidentical stem
      cell transplant utilizing a negative selection methodology.
