      logs. It is hypothesized that 1) Parents and grandparents in the Intervention Arm will
      demonstrate greater behavioral outcomes (intention to enroll, actual enrollment, and
      participation in parenting intervention sessions) than those in the Control Arm. 2) Parents
      and grandparents in the Intervention Arm will show greater improvements from baseline in
      parent determinants (knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, benefits, and barriers) compared to the
      Control Arm. 3) Parents' intention to enroll, actual enrollment, and participation in IY will
      be predicted by the study arm and parent determinants. This study is expected to have an
      important impact on the uptake of evidence-based parenting interventions among hard-to-reach
      populations and holds the promise of eliminating disparities in behavioral health outcomes in
      this understudied and growing minority population.
