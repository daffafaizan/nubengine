    
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate whether fluticasone propionate affects the late
      allergic reaction after a single dose post-allergen challenge administered following
      cessation of the early allergic reaction.

      Six subjects with mild asthma will be asked to volunteer for the study.The diagnosis of
      asthma will be and includes the presence of variable airflow limitation and AHR (PC20
      methacholine < 16 mg/mL). Subjects will be asked to participate if they demonstrate an
      allergen-induced early and late asthmatic response of at least 20% and 15% reduction in FEV1,
      respectively.

      The study will consist of 4 periods, composed of a screening allergen period with 3
      subsequent allergen challenge/treatment periods. Each period will be separated with a washout
      of at least 2 weeks. Subjects who demonstrate a dual asthmatic response in the screening
      period will be selected for randomization to treatment.
