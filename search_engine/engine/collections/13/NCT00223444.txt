      cause them to respond differently to alcohol. Genes are parts of the chromosomes found in the
      cells of our bodies which control our physical characteristics such the color of our hair,
      eyes, and other features. Genes are made up of molecules called "DNA" which carry the genetic
      information we receive from our parents. Just as genes control our physical characteristics,
      differences in genetic information may also explain why some people are more sensitive to
      alcohol or have problems drinking too much.
