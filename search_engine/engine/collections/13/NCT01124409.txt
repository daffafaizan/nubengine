        1. To assess the patient's radiation dose planning for GTV, CTV and PTV for primary and
           nodal regions and derive comparison between IGRT and 3D-CRT.

        2. To assess the dosimetric variation in different phases of adaptive RT due to changes in
           tumor shape and volume during the course of entire treatment in IGRT arm in head and
           neck cancer patients.

        3. To evaluate the optimal setup correction methodology using planar (EPID) and volumetric
           images (CBCT) in HNSCC between 3D-CRT and IGRT treatment delivery respectively.

        4. To compare the early tumour response and acute and chronic radiation morbidities between
           IGRT and 3D-CRT.
