           extent of the rectal tumor will improve the accuracy of tumor localization in patients
           undergoing non-contrast CT simulation.

        2. A 3T-MRI will provide a better localization of the rectal tumor and pelvic nodes
           compared to non-contrast CT simulation for radiotherapy treatment planning.

        3. By comparing these two novel methods to the standard procedure, we would be able to
           define any difference between the three methods and obtain an estimate of the accuracy
           and reliability of each method for the localization of the rectal tumor.
