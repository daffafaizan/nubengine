    
      Principal objective:

      Assess the validity construct of the Tongue and Mouth Imagery Questionnaire (TMIQ) as compare
      to the gold-standard Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ - Malouin et al.,
      2007), both measuring the motor imagery vividness.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Assess the reliability of the TMIQ using a test-retest.

        2. Assess the temporal coupling (i.e., the ratio between imagined and physically practiced
           movement) and compare these ratios for the TMIQ and KVIQ.

        3. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the vividness scores of TMIQ for respectively
           subject with and with no TMD.

        4. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the vividness scores of KVIQ for respectively
           subject with and with no TMD.

        5. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the temporal coupling scores of TMIQ for
           respectively subject with and with no TMD.

        6. Investigate the effect of TMD by comparing the temporal coupling scores of KVIQ for
           respectively subject with and with no TMD.
