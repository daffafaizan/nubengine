      extremely responsive to dopaminergic agents, but a second issue is that iron deficiency
      states may precipitate RLS in as much as 25-30 % of subjects with iron deficiency. RLS
      appears to be related to deficits in brain iron content and metabolism. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) images demonstrate a decrease in substantia nigra and red nucleus iron content.
      The severity of this decrease in brain iron content is correlated with the severity of
      symptoms. A number of patients are quite resistant to dietary iron repletion but do resolve
      symptoms with high doses of intravenous (IV) iron.

      For the individual subject, there will be 4 phases to the study which includes
      teleconferences (TCs) and 2 visits.

      The treatment and treatment evaluation is the main study.
