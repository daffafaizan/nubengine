      severity of knee OA through radiographs. Participants will be tested in the KBR Human
      Performance Lab on the campus of Winston Salem State University (WSSU). Participants will
      complete a demographic form and a survey about their knee pain and function. Participants
      will be evaluated under two conditions: 1) with SAI placed inside the shoe and 2) shoes
      alone. There are three walking tasks: 1) walking 25 feet at their usual pace; 2) walking 25
      feet at a fast pace; 3) walking six minutes for distance; and a 4) biomechanical gait
      analysis. After each of the walks, participants will rate the amount of knee pain they
      experienced. During the biomechanical analysis, participants will walk down a 20 foot walkway
      while wearing reflective markers. Eight cameras and a force plate embedded in the walkway
      will measure the amount of body movement and the forces applied to the leg joints during
      walking.
