      increase endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) after a mixed meal compared to valsartan.
      The primary statistical analysis will be within subject comparison (paired t-test or
      nonparametric equivalent) of area under the curve intact GLP-1 after the meal during
      sacubitril/valsartan compared to valsartan. Neprilysin inhibition may be a new drug target
      for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by increasing intact GLP-1 and may be of particular
      benefit to individuals with increased risk of hypoglycemia and cardiovascular disease.
