      Approximately 25-30% of patients with HF due to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction
      have prolonged QRS. Prolonged QRS duration (>120ms) on ECG in HF patients is associated with
      increased morbidity and mortality.

      Delayed electrical activation of the LV translates to temporal delay in ventricular
      contraction. This is referred to as mechanical dyssynchrony. Patients with advanced HF, low
      ejection fraction (EF) of less than 35% and QRS of more than 120ms are indicated for cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT). While most patients undergoing CRT implantation show
      dramatic improvement in HF symptoms, 30-40% of the HF patients undergoing CRT placement do
      not show a clinical response. The site of placement of the LV lead has been shown to be an
      important determinant of the effects of CRT.

      Measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is performed using non-invasive
      measures such as the MUGA. By using the available information on left ventricular systolic
      function the investigators plan on investigating the effects of MUGA-guided versus
      traditional LV lead placement for CRT.
