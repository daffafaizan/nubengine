    
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled study. Patients admitted to Queen Elizabeth
      Hospital and Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital for colonoscopy are randomly allocated 1:1 to
      receive either colonoscopy equipped with AmplifEYE (AC) or standard colonoscopy (SC). All
      study team members will have a prior run-in phase of performing at least 5 AmplifEYE
      colonoscopies before starting the study. The colonic polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma
      detection rate (ADR), serrated polyp detection rate (SDR), caecal intubation time,
      colonoscope withdrawal time, procedure pain and any adverse events were analyzed in each
      group.
