      vein thromboses and pulmonary embolisms. Actual data show an unexpectedly high incidence of
      partially fatal complications without any prior clinical evidence in some cases. Therefore,
      this prospective, randomized, assessor-blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled,
      interventional trial will investigate whether therapeutic anticoagulation on top of SOC
      compared to prophylactic anticoagulation as part of SOC- can improve objective
      patient-relative endpoints, relevant for prognosis in patients with COVID-19. 172 eligible
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to experimental or control group. Patients enrolled to
      experimental group will receive therapeutic anticoagulation using LMWH body weight-adapted
      during course of hospital stay and oral anticoagulation using Edoxaban according to SmPC
      (60mg once a day) after being discharged from hospital / outpatient course. Patients enrolled
      to control group will receive prophylactic anticoagulation using LMWH as part of SOC whilst
      inpatient course, and placebo after discharge / outpatient course. Patients will be informed
      of their allocation to the placebo group, as it has been shown that the effect of placebo is
      still detectable.
