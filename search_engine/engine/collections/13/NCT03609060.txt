      The principal objective of the study is to determine whether adding dexamethasone to
      induction and post-remission therapy results in significant improvement of event-free
      survival (EFS) as compared with an historical cohort of the FILO LAM-SA 2007 trial.

      Induction therapy: Idarabucin + Cyrarabine + Lomustine (ICL) + Dexamethasone. Idarubicin 8
      mg/m²/day, IV over 15 minutes, D1 to D5; Cytarabine 100 mg/m²/d, IV continuous 24h-infusion
      D1 to D7; Lomustine 200 mg/m²/d, orally at D1; Dexamethasone 10 mg/12h, IV over 30 minutes,
      D1 to D3.

      Post remission therapy: Idarabucin + Cyrarabine (IC) + Dexamethasone

      Idarubicin 8 mg/m², IV over 15 minutes, D1; Cytarabine 50 mg/m²/12h, subcutaneous, D1 to D5;
      Dexamethasone 20 mg/d, IV over 30 minutes, D1.
