      AZT is a drug that is effective in inhibiting the effects of HIV infection. The study will
      show whether toxicity of AZT can be reduced in a more manageable treatment plan, and whether
      AZT therapy will delay the development of opportunistic infections and/or KS lesions.

      Patients are divided into two treatment groups, the first receiving AZT for 5 doses a day,
      and the second receiving AZT for 3 doses per day. A placebo group is divided into two to
      match the two treatment groups. Study patients are stratified according to whether they have
      (a) 10 or fewer cutaneous lesions without oral lesions or (b) more extensive cutaneous
      lesions or oral lesions. Patients are seen on an outpatient basis weekly for the first 2
      months, every other week for the next 2 months, and monthly thereafter.
