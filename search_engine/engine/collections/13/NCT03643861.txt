      after patient undergoes a lumpectomy. The study aims to determine the safety and feasibility
      of delivering only 5 higher dose radiation treatments rather than the longer schedule of
      treatments that is currently considered standard of care for breast cancer patients. Patients
      will be followed for 24 months (2 years) with follow-up appointments at 6, 12, 18, and 24
      months.
