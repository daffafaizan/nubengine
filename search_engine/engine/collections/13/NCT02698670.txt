    
      The TRUE HD Study is aimed at collecting real-world data on the use of the Rhythmia mapping
      system and the IntellaMap Orion mapping catheter in patients indicated for ablation procedure
      with use of a 3D Mapping system.

      The study will collect specific information on management of ablation procedures with the
      commercial system including but not limited to acute procedural success, type and proportion
      of arrhythmias mapped/treated, and how mapping system is used overall. Usage data may be used
      for the planning of future clinical trials.
