    
      Blood and urine samples will be collected in 330 persons to assess BCAAs levels and correlate
      them with HOMA index.

      Persons included will be:

      110 persons with BMI>27 and HOMA >4 with no diabetes 110 persons with BMI>27 and HOMA < 4
      with no diabetes 110 persons with BMI < 27 and HOMA <4 with no diabetes, including at least
      50 men and 50 women, 30 aged 18-35, 30 aged 36-55, 30 aged 56-75.

      Urine BCAAs will be measured by both mass spectrometry and the innovative method based on
      synthetic biology.
