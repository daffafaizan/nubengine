    
      Cohorts 1 and 2 will undergo dose finding and dose expansion. Eligible patients will be
      randomly assigned to an open cohort, either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. Cohort 3 will be conducted
      as a dose expansion, independent of Cohorts 1 and 2.

      Cohort 1 will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TL-895
      administered QD in combination with KRT-232. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review the
      safety data during the dose escalation to decide on dose escalation and/or exploration of
      intermediate doses.

      Cohort 2 will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the MTD/MAD and recommended
      RP2D of TL-895 administered BID in combination with KRT-232. An SRC will review the safety
      data during the dose escalation to decide on dose escalation and/or exploration of
      intermediate doses.

      Cohort 3 will be conducted a 2-stage design. In stage 1, enrollment will continue until 15
      evaluable patients have been enrolled. An SRC will review the data during the study and if
      there are ≥4 responders based on the futility criteria and safety data from Stage 1, Cohort 3
      expansion will commence. If there are ≤3 patients responding to therapy, Cohort 3 will be
      terminated. Once expansion criteria have been met, Cohort 3 will be expanded to a total of 46
      evaluable patients for Stage 2 analyses.
