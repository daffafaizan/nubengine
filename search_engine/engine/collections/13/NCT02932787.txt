      negative consequences of sedentary behaviour upon health, research has began to look at ways
      to reduce and interrupt sedentary behaviour.

      Interventions that have introduced height-adjustable workstations into the workplace have
      been found to reduce sedentary behaviour. Some employees and employers are concerned that
      using height-adjustable workstations and trying to reduce workplace sedentary behaviour can
      lead to a loss of workplace productivity.

      The present study looked at the effects of installing height-adjustable workstations on
      occupational sitting time and workplace productivity in desk-based workers. Workplace
      activity was measured objectively using ActivPal accelerometers and productivity was measured
      via self-report measures. Measurements took place at baseline and four weeks after receiving
      the height-adjustable workstation.
