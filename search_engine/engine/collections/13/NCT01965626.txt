      of 50 newly diagnosed ITP adult patients with high platelet desialylation level from 5
      medical centers in China. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receiver
      HD-DXM (orally at 40 mg daily for 4d) combined with oseltamivir (orally at 75 mg twice for
      10d), the others are selected to receive HD-DXM (orally at 40 mg daily for 4d ) alone. If
      platelet counts remained <30Ã—109/L or there were bleeding symptoms by day 10, another 4-day
      course of HD-DXM was given (days 10-14).For the combination arm, patients with an initial
      response relapsed during the follow-up period, oseltamivir retreatment could be given for
      another 10 days at the discretion of the physician's advice and patients' will.

      Platelet count, bleeding , platelet desialylation level and other symptoms were evaluated
      before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order
      to report the efficacy and safety of oseltamivirphosphate combining with high-dose
      dexamethasone therapy compared to high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with
      newly diagnosed ITP .
