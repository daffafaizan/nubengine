      excretion in urine has shown promising results in one Tanzanian study: The sensitivity for
      detecting TB culture-positive patients was 80.3%. Of 103 healthy volunteers, only one gave a
      false positive result (Boehme, 2005).

      Until now, there are only data concerning this test for diagnosis of adult disease. For
      evaluation of routine use in children in countries like Malawi, we are starting a prospective
      study. Children 0-14 years of age with suspected TB will be investigated using TB culture as
      the gold standard. In sputum samples, microscopy will be done. Simultaneously, LAM Elisa from
      the patientÂ´s urine will be done.
