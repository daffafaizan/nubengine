      modifications of organs and systems that reduce the functional reserve and increase the
      vulnerability to disease and addiction. This framework constitutes the condition of
      "frailty", which is associated to an increased risk of multiple adverse events as falls,
      fractures, disability, institutionalisation and death. To reduce the burden of disability and
      diseases affecting the quality of life of the elderly and, at the same time weighs heavily on
      health costs, a high level of managerial efficiency has to be achieved, planning the
      necessary health and care services and implementing measures to prevent disability in the
      fragile elderly. Indeed a strongly expanding area of gerontological and geriatric research is
      focusing on successful aging, that is characterised by a low probability of diseases and
      related disabilities, by a high level of physical and cognitive functionality and by an
      active social involvement in daily life. For this reason the project is based on the
      implementation of a validated system of comprehensive geriatric assessment able to provide
      detailed measures of the different possible interactions among risk factors. The study aimed
      at the descriptive-epidemiological collection of the health conditions of older in-patients
      at the different INRCA research hospitals (Italy). The data set will include personal data,
      information from the comprehensive geriatric assessment, clinical-care, biological and
      diagnostic data, collected routinely as well as ad hoc during hospitalisation. Moreover, a
      blood sample will be taken to performing biomarkers and genetic analyses.
