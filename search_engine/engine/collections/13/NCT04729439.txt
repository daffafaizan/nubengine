    
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood mental
      health disorders, affecting 7-9% of youth and leading to substantial impairment in
      adolescence. Despite evidence suggesting that behavioral interventions are efficacious,
      41-60% of adolescents receiving behavioral treatment show little to no improvement and skills
      are rarely generalized beyond treatment sessions. Lack of adolescent motivation and
      engagement, between-session skills use, reward saliency, and family involvement are key
      contributors to these limited effects. Mobile digital health strategies and gamification
      techniques offer transformative opportunities for overcoming the barriers of evidence-based
      treatments specific to ADHD by using interactive tools to reinforce in-vivo skill practice,
      providing opportunities for immediate reinforcement, and motivating adolescents with digital
      rewards. The goal of this proposal is to develop and evaluate an online platform tool that
      will support clinician-directed behavioral treatment for adolescents with ADHD by improving
      executive functioning skills acquisition and utilization, providing in-vivo skills
      reinforcement, and monitoring adolescents' skill utilization. This study will use an
      empirically supported intervention specifically designed to address the domains of impairment
      frequently experienced by adolescents with ADHD. This study will use an iterative
      stakeholder-centered design to develop, refine, and preliminarily test a scalable digital
      health tool, applied as an adjunct to behavioral treatment for adolescents with ADHD. This
      includes focus groups with key stakeholders (Define), extended formative usage evaluation
      (Refine), and an open preliminary feasibility trial and usability testing (Pilot). Our goal
      is to develop and preliminary test an online platform that increases engagement, skills
      generalization, and family involvement in an empirically-supported organization skills
      intervention for adolescents with ADHD.
