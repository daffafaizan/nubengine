      supportive model to engage small groups of caregivers over 12 weeks. During each week of the
      intervention, participants (n = 36, 4/ group) will engage in a small facilitator lead,
      support group. Each week, caregivers will be provided with a different culturally relevant
      caregiving or personal health strategy to practice. During the weekly support calls, a
      facilitator will provide an overview of the content covered and each participant will have
      the opportunity to discuss their past week and how they engaged the weekly strategy or found
      barriers to it. The format will be structured enough to ensure that content is covered and
      everyone is able to be equally engaged while flexible enough that caregivers can receive
      support in the areas they need. A battery of assessment measures will be taken prior to the
      start of the intervention, halfway through at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, 30 days following the
      intervention, and then 6 months following the intervention.
