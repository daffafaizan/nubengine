      stage of AD. Patients with MCI have heavy risk to convert to AD, so in this study, the
      investigators focus on the exploration of the characteristics of mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) using technology of Multi-Modality MRI, including structural MRI, functional MRI and
      DTI. Then the investigators further study the patients who convert to AD and explore their
      MRI characteristics on baseline, in order to construct the predictable classifier from MCI to
      AD. The investigators want to achieve the early diagnosis of AD and help clinicians interfere
      with the progress of this disease.
