      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of infused ET190L1 ARTEMISâ„¢ T cells following
      lympho-depleting chemotherapy. Two sequential cohorts of patients will be recruited to
      fulfill this study, those in the dose escalation cohort (for determination of MTD and RP2D)
      and those in the expansion cohort (treated on the RP2D). The study will have concurrent
      phases of screening, pre-treatment, treatment, primary follow-up, safety, and survival
      follow-up. The total duration of the study involvement for the patient is 15 years. Efficacy
      will be assessed until progression and safety will be assessed throughout the full duration
      of the study. Twelve to 24 patients will be treated to determine the MTD. Following
      determination of the MTD, an expansion cohort consisting of 6 patients per disease subtype
      (n= 30) will be recruited.
