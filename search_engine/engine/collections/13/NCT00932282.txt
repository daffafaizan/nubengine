      peanut allergy by lowering the risk of anaphylactic reactions (desensitization), and changing
      the peanut-specific immune response in subjects who have peanut allergy (tolerance). This
      project is designed to study if peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) will desensitize subjects
      with peanut hypersensitivity by regulating their oral and systemic immune reactivity and
      cause long-term tolerance. This study will augment other ongoing studies by looking at
      whether anti-IgE therapy can reduce side effects and allow for an accelerated build up phase.
      Peanut allergic patients greater than 12 years old will undergo omalizumab (anti-IgE)
      treatment for 4 months prior to peanut OIT, and they will continue omalizumab until one month
      after maintenance therapy. Each subject will have an initial desensitization phase over 2
      days to a goal of 950 mg of peanut powder followed by a build up phase over 4 months to goal
      maintenance dose of 8000 mg peanut powder. They will be randomized to continue maintenance
      for 12 or 24 months. They will then have an oral food challenge (OFC) immediately after
      stopping peanut OIT to test for desensitization. Four weeks later, off OIT, another food
      challenge will be done to assess tolerance. Outcome variables of interest include results of
      the OFCs, pre and post skin tests, CAP-FEIA values and basophil studies. These results will
      be compared between the starting point and the patient at the end of the study using
      appropriate statistical analysis.
