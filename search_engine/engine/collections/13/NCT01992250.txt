      To determine the rate of successful tumor ablation in patients treated with cryoablation and
      endocrine therapy in a subset of patients with early stage breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

        1. Core Biopsy (Pre-Registration)

        2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Pre-Registration)

        3. Tumor Cryoablation

        4. Core Biopsy (Post-Cryoablation)

        5. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Post-Cryoablation)

        6. Postoperative Follow-up

        7. Evaluation of outcomes
