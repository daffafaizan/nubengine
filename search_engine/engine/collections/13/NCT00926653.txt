      planning, impulse control, and reasoning. Executive dysfunction in older adults predicts poor
      or delayed response to antidepressant treatment and has been associated with early relapse
      and recurrence of late-life major depression. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is
      a scan that can measure the activity of someone's brain while that person performs tasks. So
      far, no fMRI studies investigating cerebral activation patterns in late-life depression have
      been published. In this study, people will undergo fMRI while they are performing an
      executive function task. Older adults with late-life depression and older adults without
      depression will be tested and compared in order to identify the areas and patterns of brain
      activity underlying executive dysfunction in late-life depression.

      Participation in this study will consist of one study visit, during which participants will
      undergo an fMRI scan that will last 60 to 90 minutes. While being scanned, participants will
      perform cognitive tasks that involve pressing buttons in response to words viewed on a
      screen.
