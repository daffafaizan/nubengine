      in English to determine the level of fear of falling and its interactions with activities of
      daily living. The purpose of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SAFE
      instrument into Turkish and investigate its psychometric properties. One hundred eleven older
      adults (72 females) with a mean age of 69 years (SD=7.22; range=60-87) were included. For
      cross-cultural adaptation, two bi-lingual translators used the back-translation procedure.
      Within a 5-to-7-day period after the first assessment, the participants completed the Turkish
      version of SAFE (SAFE-T) to evaluate test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (Î±) was used
      to assess internal consistency. The correlation with the Turkish version of the Falls
      Efficiency Scale-International (FES-T) was determined to check the validity.
