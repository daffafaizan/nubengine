    
      Main objectives :

        -  Evaluate the workability of ECG uploaded by a caregiver who was trained before

        -  Evaluate the prevalence of ECG anomalies highlighted thanks to the realisation of an
           uploaded ECG (supraventricular and ventricular rhythm disorder and coronary pathology)

      Secondaries objectives :

        -  Evaluate the prevalence of unknown ECG anomalies and thus determine the number of new
           diagnostics highlighted thanks to uploaded ECG

        -  Evaluate the prevalence of ECG iatrogenic anomalies

      The study is observational, multicentre and prospective. It is going to include 3211 elderly
      living in EHPAD in ÃŽle-de-France. 150 EHPAD or involved in the study, they are split in two
      groups : 100 EHPAD will receive ECG and 50 EHPAD will not. This last group will enable to
      lead a comparative analysis, only global data about death will be collected.

      The study will last 36 months with 12 months of participation for each resident.
