      Primary Objectives:

        1. To preliminarily test the efficacy of fluoxetine to improve the quality of life of
           patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving chemotherapy by decreasing
           anxiety, depression and fatigue.

        2. To test the feasibility of conducting a multi-center clinical trial of fluoxetine
           administered by oncologists concurrently with chemotherapy in patients with non-small
           cell lung cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To describe the tumor response rate associated with the administration of
           gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

        2. To describe the overall survival and failure-free survival associated with the
           administration of gemcitabine/cisplatin.

        3. To describe the toxicity associated with the administration of gemcitabine/cisplatin.
