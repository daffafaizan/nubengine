    
      Comparison of two management strategies pleural effusions from diagnosis and during the first
      year of follow up care.

      Patients are randomized into two groups, each group receiving a different management
      strategy.

      Both strategies are compared:

      Strategy A that involves the systematic use of thoracic ultrasound for the treatment of
      pleural effusion, treatment and follow up care. It will be possible to have recourse to other
      tests (such as chest CT) if deemed necessary by the practitioner.

      Strategy B, which consists of the usual care pleurisy and thus without use of ultrasound:
      gestures are guided either by chest radiograph or by CT chest as necessary in the treatment
      and monitoring. A systematic radiographic pleural after each gesture is performed.

      The management is inspired by the English recommendations currently validated and applied in
      Anglo-Saxon countries.
