      are steadily increasing among HIV-infected patients globally. In parallel, the risk of
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increases. Clinically alarming are the data which
      suggest that HIV infected have higher rates of progressive form of NAFLD than non-HIV
      infected age, gender and BMI matched controls.

      As the treatment for HIV is life-long, it is crucial to understand the effects of different
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens on metabolism. Some antiretroviral agents appear to
      promote unfavourable changes in metabolism (e.g. in blood lipids) and predispose to trunk fat
      redistribution and liver fat accumulation.

      Raltegravir has been demonstrated to have beneficial impact on some metabolic parameters
      compared to the protease inhibitor class or efavirenz. In this study, the aim is to
      investigate whether switching a protease inhibitor or efavirenz to raltegravir reduces liver
      fat in patients who are overweight or obese and have at least one metabolic syndrome
      component. For this purpose, the proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be used.

      In addition, the aim is to clarify the change in the body composition in this study group.
      For this purpose, the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)
      volumes will be measured using MRI.

      To acquire more knowledge on metabolic effects in adipose tissue level, subcutaneous adipose
      tissue biopsies will be collected together with blood, saliva and feces samples.
