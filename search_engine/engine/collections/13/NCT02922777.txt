      incidence of 1.6 million cases resulting in 1.4 million deaths in annually. Non-small-cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80-85% of cases, and adenocarcinoma is the most common
      histology.2 The majority of NSCLC patients present with advanced or metastatic disease that
      is not amenable to surgical resection. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy has reached a
      therapeutic plateau with a median overall survival (OS) of 7.4 to 9.9 months.

      BGB324 is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein
      kinase receptor that is over-expressed in many metastatic solid tumors and has been
      identified as a marker of a poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).
