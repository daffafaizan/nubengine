    
      In Group A, the investigators will evaluate the performance of healthy older participants (N
      = 500, age range 60 to 89 years) for three days at enrollment and then at 6-month intervals
      for three years thereafter. The goal is to characterize changes in performance to aging and
      task experience in a group of older subjects. Subjects will also undergo APOE genetic testing
      with saliva samples.

      In Group B, the investigators will compare the performance of normal participants (N = 100,
      age range 18 to 89) on computerized and manually administered cognitive tasks.

      In Group C, the investigators will gather normative data from younger participants (N = 400,
      ages 18 to 59) for three days at enrollment. A subset of these subjects (N=150) will undergo
      longitudinal testing at 6-month intervals for three years thereafter.

      In Group D, the investigators will examine the performance of participants (N=1000, ages 18
      to 89) on a 30-min computerized cognitive screening test.
