      Calgary and Toronto, Canada. The authors aim to recruit 40 participants using purposive
      peer-driven recruitment methods. LBQ women from agencies that serve LBQ women will deliver
      the intervention. A survey will be conducted at pre and post-intervention to evaluate the
      impact of the intervention. Paired-sample t-tests will be used to assess pre- and post-
      intervention differences in sexual risk behaviour outcomes (safer sex practices, safer sex
      self-efficacy), protective factors (resilient coping, HIV/STI knowledge and testing) and
      social-structural determinants (social support, access to health care, internalized sexual
      stigma) directly following the intervention and 3 months post-intervention. Logistic and
      linear generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models will be used to assess
      intervention effects for the follow-up period of 3 months to control for repeated
      within-subject measurements.
