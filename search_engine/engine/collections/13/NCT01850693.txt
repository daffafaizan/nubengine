      mechanisms. CAD is an important cause of death in patients with stroke.

      Currently, coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is very useful non-invasive tool for detection of
      CAD and plaque analysis.

      Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the prevalence, plaque characteristics (plaque
      types, stenosis degree, remodeling) and predictors of CAD in stroke patients through
      follow-up (more than 5 years) using CCTA.
