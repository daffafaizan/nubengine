      estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer was conducted. Primary end point was response by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) after 3 months of sorafenib. Secondary
      end points included safety, time to progression and biomarker modulation. The study closed
      early owing to slow accrual.
