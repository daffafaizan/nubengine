      peculiar chemosensitive nature of this disease and the low investment in drug development in
      Asia, there has been a paucity of new therapies for this disease. While response rates to
      repeated lines of chemotherapy average around 30%, the duration of disease control remains
      dismal and hence there is an unmet need to develop new therapies for this disease. These
      response rates are fairly similar to current monotherapy use of anti-PD1 agents in this
      group. Of specific interest, combined IO strategies have appear to add significantly to
      response rates in selected tumors such as melanoma, small cell lung cancer, and now Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutant lung cancers. It is hypothesized that a combined IO
      strategy would have similar if not better responses in a virally driven cancer like NPC.
      Hence this is a single arm study exploring the activity of a combination of nivolumab and
      ipilimumab in EBV driven nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The primary endpoint is best overall
      response rate. Secondary endpoints will examine clinical benefit rate at 18 weeks, toxicities
      of the combination, and immunological correlates.
