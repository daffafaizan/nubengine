      Aim 1. To compare the real world effectiveness of hysteroscopic sterilization, laparoscopic
      sterilization and intrauterine devices (IUDs) by calculating:

        1. Pregnancy rates at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post-procedure, indicating
           sterilization failure.

        2. Patient's ability to rely on sterilization after hysteroscopic sterilization (blocked
           tubes on hysterosalpingogram) compared to laparoscopic sterilization and IUDs at 3, 6,
           12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post-procedure, indicating concern of sterilization
           failure.

      Aim 2. To compare safety and complications after hysteroscopic sterilization laparoscopic
      sterilization, and IUD placement by:

        1. Evaluating rates of reoperation to achieve sterilization or reinsertion to achieve IUD
           placement at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post-procedure.

        2. Evaluating other outcomes suggested by patient partners, including additional surgeries
           due to complications, chronic pain, and/or depression, by measuring claims for narcotic
           prescriptions, and antidepressants at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 months post-procedure
           (hysteroscopic sterilization, laparoscopic sterilization, or IUD placement).

        3. Identify sociodemographic and pre-sterilization clinical variables which may predict
           complications following hysteroscopic sterilization compared to laparoscopic
           sterilization and to IUDs.
