    
      Approximately 165 participants (55 subjects per arm) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive oral apremilast (30 mg BID or 40 mg BID), or identically appearing placebo BID for up
      to 12 weeks, followed by 40 weeks of blinded treatment with apremilast (30 mg BID or 40 mg
      BID).

      At the end of the Blinded Active-treatment Phase (Week 52), participants who have a Mayo
      endoscopy score â‰¤ 1 will have the opportunity to participate in the Extension Phase.
      Participants enrolled in the Extension Phase will receive apremilast for an additional 52
      weeks (Weeks 52 to 104). With the implementation of Amendment 4, participants entering the
      Extension Phase will receive apremilast 30 mg BID. Subjects currently in the Extension Phase
      who are receiving apremilast 40 mg BID will be switched to 30 mg BID at the next scheduled
      visit.
