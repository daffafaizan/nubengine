      University, University of Minnesota (UMN) and OHR-EKC will assess barriers influencing access
      to emergency pregnancy, obstetrical and neonatal care among patients seeking care at 9 health
      centers on Mfangano Island, as well as the preliminary impact and feasibility/acceptability
      of the HN approach for improving access to MNH services and shortening delays in care.
