    
      Solitary bone plasmacytoma (SBP) is a localised proliferation of malignant plasma cells (PCs)
      in the skeleton. The annual UK incidence is 0.4/100,000 (lower than multiple myeloma (MM))
      with a peak age incidence at 68 years and there are estimated to be about 260 new cases per
      year in the United Kingdom (UK). The majority of patients with SBP ultimately progress to
      myeloma and this is likely due to occult disease not detected by conventional staging
      methods. Standard care for these patients is involved field radiotherapy (IFRT), but despite
      radical doses, two-thirds develop multiple myeloma at a median of 2 years, more so if there
      are high risk features.

      The IDRIS Trial is a phase III study where the investigators hope to demonstrate that
      adjuvant lenalidomide + dexamethasone following IFRT prevents the development of multiple
      myeloma in patients with high risk solitary bone plasmacytoma. Whilst a proportion of
      solitary bone plasmacytoma is cured with IFRT, it is clear that the majority will progress to
      multiple myeloma. The investigators are seeking to prevent this outcome by using adjuvant
      therapy in this study.
