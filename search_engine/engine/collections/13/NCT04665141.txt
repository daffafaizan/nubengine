      information on long term effectiveness and safety is lacking. It is necessary to establish
      strategies to closely monitor the possible occurrence of reactions, adverse effects of
      innovative biological medicines used to treat severe asthma.

      In this study the investigators want to evaluate the comparative effectiveness, utilization
      patterns, long-term safety, and use in special groups in real-life conditions in severe
      asthma.
