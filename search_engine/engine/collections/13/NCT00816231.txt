      First, Study 1 will assess reactivity to alcohol and smoking cues in the same session.
      Second, both studies will include within-subjects design factors to manipulate alcohol and
      nicotine intake, as well as cue types. Third, craving indices will represent three important
      response domains: subjective, physiological, and behavioral (e.g., Niaura et al., 1991).
      Fourth, each study will evaluate a range of drinkers and smokers, which will provide maximal
      information concerning influences on alcohol and smoking cue reactivity across various
      subject populations. The proposed studies are not only important from a theory development
      perspective, but they will provide an excellent foundation for future laboratory-based and
      clinical research.
