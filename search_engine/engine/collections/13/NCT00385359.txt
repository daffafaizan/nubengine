      into blood stream. By controlling aerosol delivery, dose delivered, site of deposition,
      amount of drug absorption can be determined and thus the magnitude of the side effects.
      Delivery and deposition of aerosols are determined by both aerosol characteristics (size and
      timing of delivery) and breathing characteristics (breath size, flow rate and breathholding).
      Data supports the theory that if a high dose of albuterol can be deposited in the larger
      airway generations and prevented from entering the pulmonary circulation from the lung
      periphery, that this will result in the largest magnitude of bronchodilator response with the
      lowest circulatory absorbance.

      This is a pilot study in 10 adults with moderate asthma. there are no investigational drugs
      or devices. It is an investigation of a strategy to maximize response to an approved drug
      while minimizing side effects. The investigational strategies will deposit less than 25% of
      the standard nebulized dose in the airways. This will be accomplished by pairing a Pari eFlow
      nebulizer configured to deliver particle sizes of 3.5 to 6 microns, with an Akita delivery
      system programmed to deliver the drug as either a late or early bolus during inspiration. The
      Akita is programmed with a specific breathing pattern based on participant's lung function
      tests at screening.

      Moderate asthmatics with bronchodilator response >20% improvement in FEV1 will be selected.
      Treatments will be administered on separate days 1-7 days apart. Following baseline
      measurements 1 of 5 randomized aerosol treatments will be administered. Efficacy (FEV1) and
      side effects (tremor and heart rate)will be monitored for 6 hours following drug
      administration.
