      treat or prevent dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). Despite the proven
      efficacy of oral rehydration therapy it remains underused. The main reason for this is that
      an ORS neither reduces the frequency of bowel movements and fluid loss nor shortens the
      duration of illness, which decreases its acceptance. Moreover, unpalatability of regular ORS
      decrease its acceptance, especially in children with lower degrees of dehydration. Refusal to
      drink regular ORS interfere with compliance with the recommended treatment. Parents, but also
      health care professionals, demand safe, effective, inexpensive, but also well tolerated and
      accepted ORS for management of AGE.

      Recently, a new ORS (Hipp ORS 200 Apple) with improved taste has been developed, and is now
      frequently employed for the management of AGE. The proposed study will be the first
      double-blind randomized trial of this ORS. It will evaluate clinically meaningful benefits to
      be derived by children and caregivers from its use. If positive, this new ORS may become a
      routine recommendation for children with AGE.

      The objective of this study is to compare the tolerance, acceptance, efficacy and safety of a
      new ORS (Hipp ORS 200 Apple) with regular ORS recommended by ESPGHAN in children with AGE.
