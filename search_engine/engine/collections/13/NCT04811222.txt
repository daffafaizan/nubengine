      Currently, AAA size is the only metric to determine risk of growth/rupture; we are unable to
      image the underlying disease process. Using size alone is problematic. For small AAAs there
      is no consensus between surgical societies on appropriate surveillance intervals. AAA growth
      is non-linear and thus some small AAAs may rupture between screening intervals.

      Macrophage mediated inflammation leads to weakening of the aortic wall. Our own laboratory
      work indicates macrophages correlate with AAA severity in mice. In humans, activated
      macrophages express SomatoSTatin Receptor 2 (SSTR2). For the first time ever, using a
      radiotracer probe specific for SSTR 2 (gallium-dotatate), we will detect activated
      macrophages in AAAs using Positron Emission Tomography- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET-MRI).
      Patients attending the University Health Network (UHN) Vascular clinic undergoing ultrasound
      surveillance of small AAAs of differing sizes will be imaged with Ga-Dotatate PET-MRI. We
      will correlate aneurysm size and anatomical information with in-vivo imaging of aortic
      macrophages detected with Ga-Dotatate, to determine the risk of aneurysm growth.
