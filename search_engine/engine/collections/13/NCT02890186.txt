      fixation surgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups:closed-loop
      (group A,n=30) and open-loop group(group B,n=30).The procedure during induction of anesthesia
      was same in two groups.In group A,if Narcotrend index(NI) fall down to 46 and keep more than
      30 seconds,propofol and remifentanil were intravenously infused as feedback automatically to
      achieve the target NI of 26-46.However,the NI in group B was controlled manually.
