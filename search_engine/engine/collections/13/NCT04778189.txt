      dexamethasone in recent years, with many reporting enhanced sensory block and/or improved
      postoperative analgesia following either intravenous (i.v.) or perineural dexamethasone.
      Dexamethasone is potent, selective glucocorticoid having minimal mineralocorticoid action.
      Systemic anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties may be responsible for the
      prolongation of analgesia when administered intravenously. Various studies proved the
      efficacy of steroids for the prolongation of the effects of regional nerve blocks. We decided
      to conduct the present study to evaluate the effects of intravenous (IV) dexamethasone on the
      subarachnoid block.
