      validated conditioning and active avoidance paradigm (CAAP). The overarching objective is to
      measure the neural correlates of active avoidance, and how fear extinction learning and
      monetary cost modulate these avoidance responses. Participants will include trauma-exposed
      healthy controls (TEHC), and participants with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      Avoidance is common and often hinders the progression and success of extinction-based
      exposure therapy in PTSD. The data to be gathered in this study will enable us to probe
      neural mechanisms of avoidance, extinction, and decision-making to avoid or not, in addition
      to understanding the impact of cost on avoidance decision-making. These data will provide a
      more integrated platform for the understanding of the mechanisms of avoidance in both
      trauma-exposed healthy controls and PTSD psychopathology, which has important implications
      for treatment.
