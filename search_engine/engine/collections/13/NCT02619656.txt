      to 60% of cases, and while usually benign and self-limited, it can lead to evaluation for
      suspected perforation. This study was designed to determine whether using CO2 compared to
      ambient air for insufflation during PEG reduces post-procedure pneumoperitoneum.

      Patients and Methods: Prospective, double blind, randomized trial of 35 consecutive patients
      undergoing PEG at a single academic medical center. Patients were randomized to insufflation
      with CO2 or ambient air. Primary outcome was pneumoperitoneum determined by left-lateral
      decubitus abdominal x-rays 30 min after PEG placement. Secondary endpoints included abdominal
      distention, pain, and bloating.
