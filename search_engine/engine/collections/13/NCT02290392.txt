      genetic, behavioral and social-environmental determinants. Despite this, the field lacks
      robust

      datasets that integrate these determinants with clinical assessments in minority patient
      cohorts. The Minority Health Genomics and Translational Research Bio-repository Database
      (MHGRID) Network infrastructure facilitated the collection of biospecimens and related
      multidimensional data elements within a consortium of minority-serving clinics. This
      initiative expands the diversity of ancestral groups in national genomic medicine datasets
      and promises to accelerate the translation of personalized medicine into minority
      communities. The MH-GRID project was initiated by Dr. Gibbons (founding PI) prior to becoming
      an NIH investigator. The MH-GRID project has completed its participant recruitment
      activities, closed out its NIH funding and now represents an existing dataset and
      biorepository that is being transferred to NHGRI for ongoing secondary analyses. A variety of
      investigations will be conducted on this existing dataset. The primary outcome variables
      include severe hypertension and hypertension induced kidney damage. Secondary outcome
      variables include obesity, coronary heart disease and metabolic disease syndrome. Intervening
      variables include genetics, behavioral (i.e. sleep quality, health literacy, smoking, diet,
      body mass index), ancestry, social (i.e. socioeconomic status, racial discrimination, stress,
      social depreivation), biological (i.e. insulin resistance, cholesterol, inflammatory
      markers), and environmental (i.e. neighborhood, access to healthy foods, parks).
