      the obstetrics and gynecology service of the Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital Granada
      during the appointment of the first gynecological control visit (weeks 10-12 of pregnancy).
      The woman participating in the study will be assigned to two randomized follow-up groups,
      intervention group that will be supplied with 2.000 IU of vitamin D and control group with
      400 IU of vitamin D, in turn they will be allocated to a risk group and healthy group.
      Participants will take the supplementation from 10-12 weeks of gestation to delivery. The
      frequency of gybecological visits will coincide with their routine prenatal visits: weeks
      10-12, weeks 20-24 and weeks 34-35 of gestation. During the entire duration of the study,
      pregnant women will be in touch with the health professionals through routine hospital
      controls.

      The present study was approved by the Ethics Commitee CEIM/CEI of Granada, Spain.
