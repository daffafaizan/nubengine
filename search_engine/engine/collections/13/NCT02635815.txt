    
      All of the included patients underwent: (1) A complete clinical evaluation; (2) Laboratory
      investigations: CBC, liver profile, viral markers (HBs Ag, HB core Ab, HCV Ab) using the
      ELISA technique; (3) Thrombophilia workup to clarify the underlying etiology of vascular
      liver disease. It was done only for patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome and extrahepatic
      portal vein thrombosis: anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antinuclear
      antibodies, protein C, S, antithrombin III, factor V Leiden G1691A mutation, prothrombin gene
      G20210A mutation, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation by PCR, Janus tyrosine
      kinase-2 (JAK II) V617F mutation by PCR (to exclude myeloproliferative disorders) and flow
      cytometry for CD55 and CD59 (to exclude paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria); (4) Abdominal
      ultrasonography: for liver size, echogenicity, spleen size, portal vein diameter and ascites;
      (5) Color Doppler ultrasonographic study: was done in the morning after an overnight fasting
      using a color Doppler unit with a 3.5 MHz convex probe for confirmation of portal vein (PV)
      patency and diameter, mean PV flow velocity (mean PVV) (cm/sec), PV direction of flow,
      splenic vein patency and diameter, presence of portosystemic collaterals and patency of
      hepatic veins; (6) Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio: calculated as: platelet count/
      maximum spleen bipolar diameter by ultrasound in mm; (7) Ultrasonography guided liver biopsy:
      for diagnosis of NCPH and exclusion of cirrhotic portal hypertension; and (8) Upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy using the Pentax video endoscope EG 3440. Oesophageal varices were
      classified according to their size into small, medium or large [8]. Prophylaxis with band
      ligation was done to patients with large or medium sized risky varices who were eligible for
      starting anticoagulation. The diagnosis of variceal bleeding was confirmed if an actively
      bleeding varix or a varix with adherent clot or white nipple was seen. Red color signs were
      classified into Cherry Red Spots "CRS", Red Wale Markings "RWM" and Hematocystic Spots "HCS".
      Gastric varices were classified into either gastro-esophageal varices (GEV) or isolated
      gastric varices (IGV). Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) was classified into either mild
      or severe.
