      risedronate tablets 17.5 mg administered once daily (one tablet per dose) in patients with
      osseous Paget's disease in daily medical practice.

      The usual dosage for adults is 17.5 mg of sodium risedronate administered orally with a
      sufficient volume (approximately 180 mL) of water once daily after waking for 8 consecutive
      weeks. For at least 30 minutes after administration, participants should avoid lying in a
      supine position and taking food, drink (except for water) or other oral drugs.
