    
      In this study there was a 1-5 week baseline period followed by a 13 week treatment period,
      and a one week follow-up. Eligible subjects entered the study at a screening visit (Visit 1)
      before returning for randomisation (Visit 2, Day 1). At the discretion of the investigator
      (based on individual subjects), Visit 1 could be split into two separate visits (Visits 1A
      and B) to allow a 21-day washout period of prohibited medications prior to blood sampling for
      eligibility. Further outpatient study visits (for assessment purposes) took place at the
      study site at the end of Week 4 of treatment (Visit 3, Day 29), and at the overall end of
      treatment at Week 13 (Visit 5, Day 92). A telephone assessment was also performed at Day 57
      (Visit 4) and at Week 14 (Visit 6, Day 99) for safety follow-up purposes.

      During the 13 week randomised treatment phase, subjects received blinded, oral doses of their
      allocated randomised treatment twice daily. Treatment was self-administered on an outpatient
      basis, once in the morning and once in the evening for 13 weeks. Subjects were instructed to
      time study medication to 30 minutes before breakfast and evening meals.

      Physical and metabolic parameters were assessed before, during and after treatment to
      evaluate clinical response. Diabetic and dyslipidaemic medication usage (where applicable),
      and appetite 0-10 NRS data were collected daily during the treatment period, using the study
      diary.
