    
      PREVAIL 1: In the proposed study, 150 IDUs with chronic HCV (genotype 1) will be recruited
      from methadone clinics and randomized to one of three models of care: DOT; concurrent group
      treatment; or standard on-site care. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine whether either of
      two intensive on-site HCV treatment models (DOT or concurrent group treatment) is more
      efficacious than standard on-site treatment for enhancing adherence and SVR, and decreasing
      drug resistance; (2) To determine the incidence and factors associated with the development
      of drug resistance in IDUs; (3) To perform cost and cost-effectiveness analyses of each
      model; (4) To examine the impact of HIV coinfection on adherence and virologic outcomes among
      HCV-infected IDUs.

      PREVAIL 2: In the proposed study, 60 IDUs with chronic HCV (genotypes 1 2, 3 and 4) will be
      recruited from opiate agonist treatment programs and started on HCV treatment. Subjects will
      be offered the choice of model of care (either standard on-site, DOT, or concurrent group
      treatment). Our specific aims are: (1) to determine rates of adherence and SVR in a cohort of
      opiate agonist treatment patients initiating treatment with sofosbuvir-based regimens and (2)
      to determine adherence rates over time in drug users (genotype 3 and genotype 1 /
      IFN-ineligible) initiating a 24 week IFN-free regimen.

      PREVAIL 3: In the proposed study, 60 IDUs with chronic HCV (genotype 1 and 4) will be
      recruited from opiate agonist treatment programs and started on HCV treatment. Subjects will
      be offered the choice of model of care (either standard on-site, DOT, or concurrent group
      treatment). Our specific aims are: (1) to determine rates of adherence and SVR in a cohort of
      opiate agonist treatment patients initiating treatment with oral DAA combination of
      sofosbuvir and simeprevir or fixed dose of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir and (2) to determine
      adherence rates over time in drug users.
