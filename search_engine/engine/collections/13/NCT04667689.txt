      research and treatment of cognitive sequelae of cancer and chemotherapy. CAMPFIRE provides
      curated digital assessments with content specifically for cognitive and psychosocial function
      assessment, and automates and integrates the data collection, analysis and visualization
      process into clinical workflows. CAMPFIRE is designed to both improve the availability of
      data on cognitive impairments among cancer patients, and to improve the integration of the
      produced data into the care process to efficiently improve outcomes. Key to the overall
      success of CAMPFIRE is the inclusion of well-validated measures to assess function in
      cognitive domains often affected in cancer patients, including attention, executive function,
      working memory, verbal and visuospatial abilities and verbal fluency.

      The subjects will be asked to complete a cognitive assessment survey through a link to
      CAMPFIRE PROMIS in their MyChart account prior to beginning chemotherapy, between 6 - 9 weeks
      and prior to a post-chemotherapy follow up clinic visit. Subjects will also be asked to
      complete a brief cognitive assessment (NIH Toolbox) on an iPad in the JPWCI prior to their
      scheduled clinic visits at the same three study assessment time points.
