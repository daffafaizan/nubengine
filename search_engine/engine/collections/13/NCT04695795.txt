    
      Material and methods: Prospective study. A total of 50 patients will be included. A scale
      from 0 to +3 will be established to quantify the intensity of the different parameters
      measured. A total of 8 symptoms will be studied - itching, tearing, mucous secretions,
      photophobia, foreign body sensation, redness, rubbing, palpebral swelling, and 3 signs -
      palpebral papillae, conjunctival hyperemia, and corneal involvement (dotted keratitis).
      Control at 30 minutes, 1 day, and 1 month after the application of the treatment. At the end
      of the treatment period, the degree of satisfaction with the treatment, the desire to
      continue or abandon it, and the need to associate other complementary treatments due to lack
      of control will also be evaluated. All patients will be treated exclusively with seawater
      isotonic solution in the form of a spray 5 times a day for 1 month. A second similar group of
      patients will be treated with antihistamine eye drops and a third group of patients with both
      antihistamine eye drops and seawater. Tears measurement of immunoglobulin E and matrix
      metalloproteinase 9 levels will be measured before and after treatment.
