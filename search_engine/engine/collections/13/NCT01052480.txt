      influenza H1N1 and H3N2 isolates are highly resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, whereas
      previous seasonal H1N1 isolates were highly resistant to oseltamivir. So there is concern
      that circulating influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus may also acquire oseltamivir resistance.

      This randomized, open-label, multicenter phase 2 trial will assess the safety, efficacy, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of anti-influenza plasma in subjects with influenza. Hospitalized
      subjects with influenza at risk for severe disease (as defined in the inclusion criteria)
      will be eligible for study participation. This study will enroll adults, children and
      pregnant women.

      Up to 40 sites in the United States will participate in this protocol. One hundred eligible
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 2 units (or pediatric
      equivalent) of anti-influenza immune plasma on Study Day 0 in addition to standard care or
      standard care alone (50 subjects receiving standard care alone; 50 subjects receiving
      anti-influenza immune plasma and standard care).

      Subjects will be assessed on Study Day 0 (pre-dose), 30 minutes post-dose (plasma arm only),
      and on Study Days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy,
      safety, and PK (HAI) assessments during the study. Blood samples will be collected at each
      time point (except Day 1). Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs for influenza PCR will be obtained
      on Days 0,1,2,4 and 7.
