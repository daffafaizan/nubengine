      Primary

        -  Determine the utility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using ferumoxtran-10 in
           identifying metastases to the axillary lymph nodes in patients with invasive breast
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the changes in MR T1 and T2 signal intensity in primary breast tumors after
           administration of this drug to these patients.

        -  Determine the potential of delayed imaging, in terms of defining tumor boundaries, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ferumoxtran-10 IV over 25-30 minutes on day 0 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo MRI of the involved breast and ipsilateral axilla on
      day 0 (once before and once after ferumoxtran-10 administration) and then once on day 1.

      Within 3 weeks after the completion of imaging studies, patients undergo sentinel lymph node
      biopsy. If the sentinel node is positive for malignancy on touch prep, an axillary lymph node
      dissection is performed if clinically indicated.

      Patients are followed at approximately 1 month after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 8.3 months.
