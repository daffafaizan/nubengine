      soldiers proceed to a medical disability/discharge. It is felt that with the use of the MIRE
      technology, active duty soldiers with tibial stress reactions and fractures will heal more
      quickly and completely. All soldiers will have a documented bone scintigraph as evidence for
      tibial stress reaction or fracture prior to enrollment. In addition, pain-pressure
      goniometric measures and time to complete the Balke protocol will also be used to assess
      healing with the MIRE technology.

      Comparison: Soldiers with Active MIRE technology, compared to soldiers with Placebo MIRE
      technology.
