      changes, particularly in adaptive immunity, may lead to an impaired vaccine response in the
      elderly. Characterizing the immune determinants and the genetic basis for vaccine response in
      the frail elderly is a practical approach to better our understanding of immunosenescence.
      Data on genetic determinants to immunization are sparse, furthermore, to the best of our
      knowledge, none exist in the elderly. In this pilot study, we propose studying the immune
      response to the herpes zoster vaccine and the underlying genetic determinants of the immune
      response in elderly residents of nursing homes.

      The three specific aims of this study are to generate data in order to 1) assess the T-cell
      response to the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine in the frail elderly; 2) assess whether
      immune (T-cell) phenotypes are associated with a response; 3) test the association between
      immune response genotype sets and T-cell response. We hypothesize that response to the VZV
      vaccine in elderly nonambulatory nursing home residents is a function of characteristic
      T-cell immune phenotypes prior to vaccination and that there are immune genetic polymorphisms
      associated with the response. This study will allow us to generate preliminary data and
      establish feasibility in order to address these questions fully in a larger population in a
      subsequent grant application.
