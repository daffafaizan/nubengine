    
      The study design is a prospective monocenter single-blinded randomized controlled trial in
      patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery.

        -  Patients will be recruited during the surgical consultation, at least 14 days prior to
           surgery. If they choose to enroll, they will undergo randomization on the day of
           enrollment.

        -  Prehabilitation (Day 0): personalized or standard prehabilitation program will be
           proposed to the patients for a period of 2 to 6 weeks. Immunological, nutritional,
           physical, cognitive, anxiety and quality of life status will be quantified at baseline
           by previously trained personnel.

        -  From the beginning (Day 0) to the end of the prehabilitation program (Day 14 to Day 42):
           every 7 days, a compliance questionnaire will be filled by phone, by a trained member of
           the research team blinded to the treatment arm of the study

        -  End of the prehabilitation period (Day 14 to Day 42): Immunological, nutritional,
           physical, cognitive and anxiety status after prehabilitation will be recorded by a
           trained member of the research team blinded to the treatment arm of the study.

        -  Surgery (Day S)

        -  Post operative period

             -  From Day S (2 hours after surgery end) to discharge from the hospital, length of
                stay, pain and adverse clinical events will be measured and recorded.

             -  Immunological status will be assessed at Day S+1 by blood draw.

             -  Cognitive function, neuropathic pain and quality of life will be assessed at Day S
                + 30.
