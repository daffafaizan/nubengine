      uniform clinical entity regardless from which carcinoma they originate. The treatment is
      dependent on number and size of the hepatic lesions but still, none of the therapeutic
      options leads to satisfying results. The growth of tumors and metastases is dependent on
      blood vessels, which supply the tumors and metastases with nutrients. Liver metastases,
      independent from which original tumor they come from, are especially well supplied with
      blood. The aim of the treatment with the investigational medicinal product EndoTAGÂ®-1 is to
      target the blood vessels, which supply the metastases, and destroy them. Consequently, the
      metastases themselves will be damaged.
