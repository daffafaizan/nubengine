    
      All participants will complete sleep, pain, and functional questionnaires. Additionally, all
      participants will undergo one overnight oximetry reading using the wristwatch pulse oximetry.
      Following these baseline assessments and questionnaires, participants will be randomized to
      either the control group or the Sleep Health Program.

      A)Sleep Health Program Group Participants in this group will receive usual care from their
      pain physician. Participants will also receive the Self-Management for Sleep Care videos and
      digital materials. Participants with suspected moderate/severe sleep apnea as determined by
      oximetry, but who have not been diagnosed with sleep apnea prior to the study, will be
      recommended for referral to a sleep clinic as part of standard of care.

      B)Control Group Participants in this group will receive usual care from their pain physician.

      First follow up visit:

      At 8 weeks after the initial visit, all participants will attend their first follow-up visit
      and complete the sleep, pain and functional questionnaires and 7-day sleep diary recording,
      and report any changes in medications.

      Second follow up visit:

      At 6 months after the initial visit, all participants will attend their second follow-up
      visit and complete the sleep, pain and functional questionnaires, 7-day sleep diary recording
      and report any changes in medications. Control participants will receive information provided
      by the Self-Management for Sleep Care program. Control participants with suspected
      undiagnosed moderate/severe sleep apnea will be recommended for referral to a sleep clinic as
      part of standard of care.
