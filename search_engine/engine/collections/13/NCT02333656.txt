      primary care will be developed and implemented. The purpose of the model is to improve
      quality of OA care in primary health care services by increasing the collaboration between
      health care professionals and across health care levels, providing an integrated care and a
      patient pathway, and facilitating an active and healthy lifestyle among individuals with OA.
      This implementation study represents a collaborative study between six municipalities and a
      hospital department aiming to fulfill the intentions of the Norwegian Health Care
      Coordination Reform. The main aim of the present study is to implement and perform process
      and effect evaluations of this new model for integrated OA care. The study design will be a
      cluster randomized controlled trial with a stepped wedge design. Six neighboring
      municipalities will constitute the six clusters, which will switch from control (current OA
      care) to intervention phase (new OA model) in a randomized order. All municipalities start
      the trial simultaneously and act as controls until the point in time they are randomized to
      crossover from control to intervention, and all municipalities have implemented the
      intervention by the end of inclusion. The method consists of two parts; 1) Identification of
      barriers/facilitators + development of the model and interventions, 2) Implementation of the
      new model (interactive workshops) with process and effect evaluations. Participants will be
      general practitioners and physiotherapists in primary care as well as people with hip or knee
      OA.
