      lactation. Increasing studies indicate that bacterial infections and/or dysbacteriosis are
      essential to the mechanisms of the disease. Thus, antibiotics is widely used in clinical
      practice, especially cephalosporin in China. However, mistaking antibiotic will affect the
      physical function, even mothers' breastfeeding. The previous clinical trial that the
      investigators had conducted in the Third affiliated hospital of Beijing University of Chinese
      Medicine, has demonstrated that Chinese herbal medicine can act better than Cefdinir in the
      fever-relief time and breast pain scores. Some studies the investigators searched in the
      databases have showed that Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial
      activity, and it can regulate dysbacteriosis. At the same time, Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci)
      can also promote the secretion of milk and maintain the patency of milk well. The main
      ingredient of Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) Granules is Pugongying herbs (Herba Taraxaci).
      Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) Granules is approved by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA)
      to treat acute mastitis. Although Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) Granules is widely used in
      clinical practice, there is no trial to test the efficacy of Pugongying (Herba Taraxaci) for
      women with acute mastitis. Therefore, the investigators set three groups with Pugongying
      (Herba Taraxaci) Granules alone, Cefdinir alone and combination of Pugongying (Herba
      Taraxaci) Granules and Cefdinir.
