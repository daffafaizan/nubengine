      proceeded at pH 7. Topical cream will be adapted to deliver the conjugated system for maximum
      deposition through breast cancer cells using emulsion technology. The formulated
      nanoparticles and cream will be characterized for size using dynamic light scattering,
      drug-polymer interaction using FTIR, and morphology using SEM. Cellular uptake, permeability
      and cell viability study of the successful system of interest will be studied in cell culture
      models using different breast cell lines. Moreover, the in vivo study will also proceed on
      rats induced breast cancer. Finally, the nanoparticles loaded in a topical cream will be
      applied with clinical trial approvement on the human breast cancer for bioimaging and
      treating breast cancer. This work is to present a novel formulation for treatment and
      bioimaging of breast cancer which can deliver safely to the patients in a high dose to the
      affected tumor cells.
