    
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete 2 questionnaires either at an
      already-scheduled clinic visit or over the phone at the time you join this study and then
      about 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after that. These questionnaires will be
      about your quality of life and experiences with treatment for VTE. It should take less than
      10 minutes to complete the questionnaires each time.

      Information from your medical record may also be collected at these time points.

      Your participation will be over after the last questionnaires are completed at about 12
      months after you enroll in the study.
