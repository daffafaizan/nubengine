      discussed in a weekly prenatal meeting and plans are drawn for management of these abnormal
      fetal findings. Lethal malformations are defined as conditions which will end in death
      regardless of supportive care. Cases are discussed extensively and parents are involved in
      management decisions. When a decision of non- intervention is reached for a lethal
      malformation consent of the family is obtained and a plan of non monitoring for the mother is
      documented together with no resuscitation for the newborn. Families who do not consent to
      such plan are offered full support for the pregnant mother and her newborn. A record of all
      cases is kept available together with the management plan so that the appropriate action is
      taken when the the pregnant lady presents for admission. All babies with lethal malformations
      are recorded whether stillborn or live born and their diagnosis is confirmed. Survival time
      is recorded for each case.
