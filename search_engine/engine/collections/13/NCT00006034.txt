        -  Compare the efficacy of BCI-ImmuneActivatorâ„¢ (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) versus
           doxorubicin in BCG refractory or intolerant patients with carcinoma in situ with or
           without resected superficial papillary bladder cancer.

        -  Compare the toxicity and safety of these treatments in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and prior BCG response (refractory vs intolerant). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a sensitizing dose of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)
           intradermally at week -2 followed by induction KLH IV once weekly at weeks 1-6. Patients
           with partial or no response receive IV KLH reinduction therapy once weekly at weeks
           13-18. Patients with complete response receive IV KLH maintenance therapy monthly at
           weeks 13, 17, and 21, and then at months 6-12.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin IV once weekly at weeks 1-6. Patients with complete
           response receive maintenance therapy comprising doxorubicin IV at weeks 13, 17, and 21
           and months 6-12.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1.5 years, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
      (Patient total participation in this study may last as long as 42 months.)

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
