      for reducing vascular risk in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. The clinical
      study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 150 patients with
      metabolic syndrome. After a 4-week stabilization on a standard fat-reduced diet, participants
      were randomly assigned to receive either phytoestrogen genistein (54 mg/day) or placebo for 6
      months. At baseline and following treatment fasting plasma glucose, insulin, insulin
      resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid concentrations, plasma total homocysteine, leptin, adiponectin
      and visfatin were measured. Bioimpedentiometric and nutritional analysis, as well as a safety
      assessment of the endometrium and vagina were also performed.
