      established therapy for the prevention of death from ventricular arrhythmia. Recently a new
      subcutaneous ICD has been introduced, eliminating the need for transvenous lead placement in
      or on the heart which is mandatory in the transvenous ICD. The new subcutaneous ICD therapy
      already proved to be feasible and safe and is an approved therapy in Europe. It is likely
      that the eliminated need for transvenous lead placement substantially reduces the
      implantation related complications and elongates lead longevity and thus reduces
      inappropriate shocks associated with lead fractures. On the other hand it is unclear whether
      the lack of capability to provide antitachy-pacing (ATP) in the subcutaneous ICD may be a
      limitation for patients with frequent recurrent ventricular tachycardia. This randomized
      controlled trial will outline the advantages and disadvantages of the subcutaneous ICD.

      Objectives of the study: (1) To compare the subcutaneous ICD to the transvenous ICD for major
      adverse events (i.e. inappropriate shocks, acute and chronic implant related complications
      and lead- or device related complications). (2) To determine to which degree the lack of ATP
      function leads to more appropriate shocks in patients with a subcutaneous ICD.

      Study design: Multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial with either treatment
      with the transvenous ICD or subcutaneous ICD (1:1).

      Study population: 2x425 patients with class I or IIa indication for ICD therapy without an
      indication for pacing.
