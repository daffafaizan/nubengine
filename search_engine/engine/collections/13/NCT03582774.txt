      I. Success rate of salvage radiation therapy (SRT) measured as biochemical progression-free
      survival after initiation of SRT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Sub-group analysis of the primary endpoint (success rate of SRT) within the subgroup with
      baseline PSA â‰¥ 0.5 ng/ml II. 5-year biochemical progression-free survival rate (from date of
      randomization).

      III. Metastasis free survival. IV. Initiation of additional salvage therapy after completion
      of SRT. V. Change in initial treatment intent.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive standard of care SRT.

      ARM II: Participants receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and 50-100 minutes later undergo
      whole-body (skull base to mid-thighs) PET/CT. Participants then undergo SRT per the
      discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.

      After conclusion of PET/CT, participants are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
