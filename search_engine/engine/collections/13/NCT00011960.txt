        -  Compare the 2-year disease-free survival in patients with resected stage IB-IIIB gastric
           cancer treated with cisplatin, paclitaxel, and radiotherapy with or without fluorouracil
           vs therapy in the adjuvant arm of the intergroup adjuvant protocol 0116 (RTOG 90-18).
           (Arm I closed to accrual as of 6/18/03.)

        -  Compare the safety and success of these regimens vs therapy in the intergroup adjuvant
           study.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens vs therapy in the adjuvant arm of the
           intergroup study.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor
      stage (T1-2 vs T3 vs T4) and by number of involved lymph nodes (none vs 1-3 vs 4 or more).
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. (Arm I closed to accrual as of
      6/18/03.)

        -  Arm I (closed to accrual as of 6/18/03): Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously
           and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33 and paclitaxel IV continuously on
           days 1 and 29.

      At 3-4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients receive radiotherapy once daily and
      fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33. Patients also
      receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days
           1 and 29.

      At 3-4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients receive radiotherapy once daily and
      paclitaxel IV continuously on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33. Patients also receive
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 94 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
