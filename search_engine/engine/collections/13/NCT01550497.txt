      evaluated the effectiveness of physical therapy exercises for managing low back pain (LBP) in
      this population. Spinal stabilization exercises are of particular importance in adolescents
      with IS due to possible reduced spinal stability from structural deformity. Spinal
      stabilization exercises have been reported to prevent recurrent episodes of LBP in the adult
      population. However, standardized treatment options cannot be recommended for LBP in
      adolescents with IS, because the investigators are not certain if spinal stabilization
      exercises will have the same effect on this patient population. Given the high prevalence of
      LBP in AIS and limited evidence of conservative interventions, researching the effectiveness
      of spinal stabilization exercises is warranted.

      Currently, there are two common practices for managing adolescents with IS who have LBP: 1)
      supervised physical therapy and 2) a one-time treatment with no follow-up. No studies have
      examined which of these two approaches is superior. This study will provide information on
      optimal management of LBP in AIS. If there is no difference in outcomes between these two
      approaches, a one-time visit will be the optimal choice of treatment since it is more
      cost-effective and less burdensome for the family. If the outcomes favor the eight-week
      supervised physical therapy, specifically the spinal stabilization exercises, this treatment
      approach should be recommended for managing LBP in AIS.
