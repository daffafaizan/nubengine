    
      In CF patients the unregulated inflammatory response overwhelms the normal protease
      (elastase)/antiprotease (AAT) balance, leading to the accumulation of elastase in the lung,
      destruction of the lung architecture, severe pulmonary dysfunction, and ultimately death.

      Administration of AAT is to address the elastase/antiprotease imbalance in order to prevent
      destruction of the lung tissue and reduce the inflammatory dysregulation that causes
      pulmonary dysfunction.
