    
      This is a 2-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study comparing the
      anti-inflammatory effects of low, medium, and high dose mometasone furoate/formoterol
      fumarate MDI formulation and medium dose mometasone furoate (MF) DPI and MDI formulations in
      adults and adolescents with persistent allergic asthma. An open-label run in period is to be
      followed by a double-blind treatment period.

      A total of 90 subjects (15 per treatment) will be enrolled to ensure 12 subjects per
      treatment at the Day 14 evaluation, accounting for a 20% drop-out rate. A sample size of 12
      subjects per treatment is required to detect a treatment difference of 28% in percent change
      of eNO at Day 14, assuming a pooled standard deviation of 20% with a power of 90%. These
      estimates are based on examination of eNO levels in asthmatic vs healthy subjects in an
      article written by S.A. Kharitonov et. al, 2003.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of six treatment groups (MF/F MDI 100/10 mcg BID, MF/F MDI
      200/10 mcg BID, MF/F MDI 400/10 mcg BID, MF DPI 200 mcg BID, MF MDI 200 mcg BID, or Placebo
      MDI BID) according to an Schering-Plough Research Institute (SPRI) computer-generated
      randomization schedule. Randomization will be performed in appropriately sized blocks using
      random numbers generated by statistical analysis software (SAS).
