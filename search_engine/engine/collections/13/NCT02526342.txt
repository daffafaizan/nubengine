      Flaps were treated with NPWT or with a conventional dressing (control) for five days
      following tissue transfer. Edema formation is measured by a 3D scan (Artec SpiderTM) during
      the operation, five and fourteen days after surgery. The macrocirculation- and
      microcirculation parameters of the flaps are assessed using an implanted Doppler probe
      (Cook-Swartz®) as well as combined flowmetry and remission spectroscopy (O2C®). These
      measurements are conducted daily at the day of the operation as well as the first five days
      following the operation. Following dressing removal at the fifth postoperative day, skin
      graft take is assessed.
