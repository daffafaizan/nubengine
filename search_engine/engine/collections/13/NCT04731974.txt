    
      To compare the risk of persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) between melatonin and
      standard care after an acute pediatric concussion.

      To determine if melatonin compared to routine care reduces the risk of PPCS for pediatric
      patients.

      This is a prospective randomized control trial of pediatric patients in the emergency
      department (ED) diagnosed with an acute concussion. Patients 12-19 years old with an acute
      concussion diagnosis will be eligible. All participants will receive standard of care per
      treating physician and will receive actigraphy watches to wear on their wrists and measure
      sleep and activity patterns. Participants in the melatonin group will be instructed to take 1
      5-mg melatonin pill 1 hour prior to their habitual fall asleep time daily for 30 days.

      All participants will be given a standardized diary to track their daily concussion and sleep
      symptoms for one month. Research assistants will also arrange follow up in the neurology
      headache clinic within 4 weeks post injury. At the follow-up visit, subjects will complete
      the Post Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI), a neurologic assessment, sleep assessment and
      pediatric Functional Disability Inventory.
