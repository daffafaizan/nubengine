      females almost exclusively. It is caused by mutations, usually sporadic, of the MECP2 gene
      located in the X chromosome. In consequence to the serious cognitive and motor compromise,
      the RS patients have great difficulty in accomplishing day-to-day tasks. The objective of
      this work is to evaluate the functional abilities in RS to help therapists in theirs
      treatments programs.
