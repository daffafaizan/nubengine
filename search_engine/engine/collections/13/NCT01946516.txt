    
      Primary Objective

      Among newly diagnosed cancer patients presenting to SWOG-affiliated community and academic
      oncology clinics, estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
      (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Prevalence estimates will be further stratified: by
      whether infection with the virus(es) is known, as reported by patients and/or their physician
      prior to study testing, vs. unknown; by presenting cancer type, and by self-reported risk
      factors for each virus.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Evaluate known sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors that are significantly
           associated with previously undiagnosed HIV, HBV, and/or HCV infection in a population of
           people with newly diagnosed cancer.

        -  Among patients who are identified as having HIV, HBV, and/or HCV, evaluate the timing
           and type of treatments received, both for the viral infections and the cancers.

        -  Evaluate type and rate of cancer treatment-related adverse events in patients with HIV,
           HBV, and/or HCV infection.

        -  Using simulation modeling that is directly informed by the data obtained from this
           study, determine the cost-effectiveness (expressed as cost per infection detected and
           cost per year of life gained) of (1) routine, universal screening and (2) risk
           factor-directed screening of newly diagnosed cancer patients for HIV, HBV, and/or HCV
           vs. current care.

      Tertiary Objective

      Create a biorepository of stored serum for future translational medicine studies that may
      include identifying genomic and viral factors that increase the risk of serious adverse
      effects among participants infected with HIV, HBV, and/or HCV being treated for invasive
      cancers.
