      In patients with acute stroke, systemic thrombolysis needs to be administered within three
      hours of symptom onset. The aim of the present study was to reduce prehospital delays in a
      population-based intervention.

      Methods:

      We performed a cluster-randomized trial with 48 zip code areas as cluster units in the
      catchment area of three inner-city hospitals in Berlin. The primary endpoint was time between
      symptom onset and hospital admission. The intervention consisted of an educational letter
      indicating stroke symptoms and emphasizing the importance of calling the emergency medical
      services (EMS). We additionally included a bookmark and sticker with the EMS telephone
      number. We fitted a lognormal survival regression model (time-to-admission) with frailty
      terms shared by inhabitants of the same zip code area.
