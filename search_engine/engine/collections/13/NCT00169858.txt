    
      Three doses of Engerix-B vaccine (10 mkg) were administered according to 0, 1, 6 month
      schedule to 1126 9-10 year-old children.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies to Engerix-B
      in all subjects at age 25 and to compare the levels obtained in those given a booster
      injection at age 15 or 20 with those receiving no booster injection.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To determine the antibody levels obtained following primary vaccination and the
           proportion of children who seroconvert

        -  To determine the antibody levels of one third of subjects at age 15, 5 years after
           primary vaccination (Group A)

        -  To determine the effect on antibody levels of a booster injection at age 15 years given
           to one third of the subjects (Group A)

        -  To determine the antibody levels of subjects in groups A and B at age 20, 5 years after
           booster (Group A), 10 years after primary vaccination (Group B)

        -  To determine the effect on antibody levels of a booster injection at age 20 years given
           to one third of the subjects (Group B)

        -  To determine the effect on antibody levels of a booster injection at age 25 years given
           to one third of the subjects (Group C)

        -  To determine the antibody levels of subjects in Group A and Group B one year after their
           5 or 10 year booster

        -  To evaluate safety
