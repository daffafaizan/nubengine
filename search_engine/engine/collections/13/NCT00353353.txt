    
      During a 12 week period subjects will consume

        -  bread fortified with folic acid and vitamin B12 or

        -  placebo bread (not fortified)

      Bread consumption has to be at least 3 slices per day, fortification level is 100mcg folic
      acid and 6mcg vitamin B12 per 3 slices.

      We will study the effect of this fortification strategy on markers of folate and vitamin B12
      status.
