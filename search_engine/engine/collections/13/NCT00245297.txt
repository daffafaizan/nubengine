      injections) followed by a minimum 4 day wash-out. Following this each subject will be
      randomized to a specific treatment order. Each order consists of four identical blocks. In
      each block the following three injections will be given: 1 One prophylactic treatment
      (randomized solution for dissolution) 2 and 3. Two standard on-demand treatments for a
      spontaneous bleeding episode (standard Kogenate FS). Each block will be followed by a four
      day wash-out. In total each subject should receive 3+4x3=15 injections. It is estimated that
      each subject will be in the study for about 4 months. A treatment for a spontaneous bleeding
      episode may require more than one infusion.
