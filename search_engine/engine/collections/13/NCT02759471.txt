      study comparing the clinical performance of the subjects' habitual comfilcon A sphere lens
      (control) following a refit with comfilcon A asphere lens (test). After the dispensing visit,
      subjects will return for follow-up evaluations after 2 weeks, and 1 month.

      Both comfilcon A sphere lens (control) and comfilcon A asphere lens (test) are Coopervison
      lenses.
