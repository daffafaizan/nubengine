      response, freedom from progression, event free survival, and overall survival in patients
      with relapsed or refractory intermediate or high grade lymphoma treated with arsenic
      trioxide. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2-4 hours for a maximum of 25 cumulative
      days followed by a rest period of 3-4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response may
      receive 6 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with minor response (25-50% tumor regression) may also receive further courses of
      treatment. Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-41 patients will be accrued for this study.
