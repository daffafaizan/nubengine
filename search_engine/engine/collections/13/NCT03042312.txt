      therapy (RLT) were performed by repeated intravenous (i.v.) injection of 6.0 gigabecquerel
      (GBq) (+/- 10%) or 7.4 GBq (+/- 10%) 177Lu-PSMA-617 every 8+/- 1 weeks until reaching four
      cycles or threshold maximum dose to the kidneys of 23 Gray (Gy). All doses after labeling
      were presented in buffered solution for i.v. injection.

      In the initial plan for the study design a total of 200 patients with histologically proven
      prostate cancer and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were to be
      enrolled, however due to early stopping of enrollment only 71 patients were enrolled at time
      of data base lock. Each patient underwent a screening visit within 14 days prior to receiving
      study drug. Treatment was continued until either of the following conditions applied:

        -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)/radiographic progression at >= 12 weeks

        -  Completion of four RLT cycles

        -  23 Gy kidney dose would be exceeded by the next cycle as estimated by dosimetry

        -  Patient withdrawal (e.g. appearance of intolerable adverse events).
