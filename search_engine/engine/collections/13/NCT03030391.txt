      Phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) terminates signal transduction of guanine nucleotidebinding
      proteins (G-protein)-coupled receptors by metabolizing the second messenger 3 <=,5 <=- cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 is selective to cAMP over cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate. PDE4 has four isozymes A, B, C, and D and basic studies indicate that type B
      (PDE4B) plays a key role in cognitive function and neuroinflammation. Thus, PDE4B inhibitors
      would be expected to improve cognitive function and have anti-inflammatory effects. Pfizer
      has developed a new PET ligand, 18F-PF-06445974, to selectively image PDE4B; the ligand has
      shown promising results in non-human primates.

      This protocol covers four phases:

        1. Phase 1: whole body imaging of one subject with a low injection activity of 2 mCi to
           confirm that no organ has prominently high uptake of 18F-PF-06445974;

        2. Phase 2: kinetic brain imaging with up to 5 mCi injection to quantify PDE4B in brain
           relative to concurrent measurement of the parent radioligand in arterial plasma;

        3. Phase 3: if 18F-PF-06445974 is successful in Phase 2 in the first couple of subjects, we
           will estimate the radiation-absorbed doses by performing whole body imaging with 5 mCi
           injection;

        4. Phase 4: test-retest analysis of brain binding relative to concurrent measurement of the
           parent radioligand in arterial plasma (5 mCi per scan).

      Study Population:

      Healthy adult female and male volunteers (n=22, ages 18 or older) will undergo brain imaging.
      An additional eight healthy volunteers will undergo whole body dosimetry analysis, for a
      total of 30 healthy volunteers.

      Design:

      For quantification of 18F-PF-06445974, 22 healthy controls will undergo brain PET imaging
      using 18F-PF-06445974 and an arterial line. Some of them will have a test-retest scan. Eight
      additional subjects will have a whole body PET scan for dosimetry. For dosimetry, no arterial
      line will be used.

      Outcome Measures:

      To assess quantitation of PDE4B with 18F-PF-06445974, we will primarily use two outcome
      measures, namely the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume (VT)
      calculated with compartmental modeling. In the test-retest study, we will calculate the
      retest

      variability. We will assess whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of 18F-PF-06445974 by
      calculating doses to organs and effective dose to the body.
