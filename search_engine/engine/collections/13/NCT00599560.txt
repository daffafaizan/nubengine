      to examine plasma vasopressin during remission of vertigo attacks (controls: 30 patients with
      chronic otitis media). Using the real-time PCR method, we examined V2R mRNA expression in the
      endolymphatic sac in 12 patients (controls: 6 patients with acoustic neurinoma). By means of
      cell culture and cyclic AMP assay, we also examined cyclic AMP activity in the endolymphatic
      sac in 3 patients (controls: 3 patients with acoustic neurinoma).
