    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      the combination of alpelisib (BYL719) and enzalutamide in patients with androgen receptor
      (AR)-positive and PTEN-positive metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combination of BYL179 and
      enzalutamide.

      II. To determine the safety profile of BYL179 and enzalutamide used in combination.

      III. Progression-free survival (PFS) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response or
      partial response + prolonged stable disease) after a 16-week treatment of BYL719 and
      enzalutamide per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between aberrant circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating
      tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA), and CBR at 16 weeks.

      II. To determine the association between PIK3CA and PTEN mutations and treatment response to
      the combination of BYL179 and enzalutamide.

      III. To determine the association between PIK3CA mutation status change in ctDNA and
      treatment response.

      IV. To determine the molecular (CTC, ctDNA) profile of tumors that become resistant to
      treatment in comparison with those prior to treatment.

      V. To determine the association between the AR expression level measured by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor and CBR at 16 weeks.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alpelisib.

      Patients receive alpelisib orally (PO) and enzalutamide PO on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
