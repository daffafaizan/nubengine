      of labor and lead to delivery of the fetus. While some early studies suggested a possible
      increased rate of cesarean with induction of labor, more recent meta-analyses have shown that
      induction does not influence this rate. There is data from small randomized studies that
      demonstrates the effectiveness of propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, for induction of
      labor. This literature suggests a decrease in the amount of time to delivery and a possible
      reduction in cesarean section rates when propranolol is used in conjunction with oxytocin for
      induction of labor compared to oxytocin alone.
