      only take part in the dose escalation treatment Periods 1-3, or may choose to also take part
      in the challenge Treatment Period (Period 4). If a subject chooses to participate in the dose
      escalation treatment Periods 1-3 only, or does not (at screening) meet the eligibility
      criteria specific to challenges (treatment Period 4), a new subject will be recruited for
      treatment Period 4 only and will be regarded as a replacement subject. The study will be
      conducted in three Parts. Total duration for participation will be approximately 19 weeks for
      subjects taking part in all three dose escalation treatment Periods and 23 weeks if a subject
      takes part in all four treatment Periods of Part A. For replacement subjects only taking part
      in the challenge treatment Period (Period 4), approximate study duration will be 10 weeks.
      Total duration for participation will be approximately 9 weeks for Part B and 12 weeks for
      Part C. The study will be conducted in up to 80 subjects.
