      patients with profound sensory neural hearing loss to gain near normal hearing.1 The position
      of electrode inside the cochlea affects the outcomes. Full insertion of the CI electrode
      array and insertion in scala tympani usually has optimal results and better words
      recognition.2 Translocation of electrode array from scala tympani to scala vestibule or
      outword migration of electrode array may result in poor response.2 There are many
      intraoperative and post operative techniques to determine the position of electrode array
      inside the cochlea, some are radiological as transorbital view plan x-ray or computed
      tomography or 3D rotational x ray and others are electrophysiological measurements.3 Although
      the accuracy of the radiological techinques they are time and cost consuming1. The
      electrically evoked cochlear action potential (ECAP) threshold is dependent on the distance
      between the electrodes and the spiral ganglion cells. The neural response telemetry-ratio
      (NRT-ratio) is one of the electrophysiological measurments techniques and it is based on each
      individual electrode's ECAP threshold and can identify the intracochlear electrode array
      position 4. According to a study done by Philipp Mittmann in 2015, a NRT-ratio above 1.05
      indicates an electrode translocation from scala tympani to scala vestibuli and a NRT-ratio
      below 1.05 shows correlation to a pure scala tympani placement5, but another study found
      variation of the NRT-ratio in a group of patients with an electrode placement within scala
      tympani.6
