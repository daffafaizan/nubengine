      information desk service (called Informa Salute) located in the hospital. Here,
      sociodemographic and work-related data will be collected with the aim to organize the
      tailored social-health support to facilitate the return to work.

      The social-health care pathway created includes: the local Health Authority of Reggio Emilia
      and the local Order of Physicians, voluntary non-profit associations, vocational and
      educational training bodies, social cooperatives, one labor union and one chartered
      accountant enterprise.
