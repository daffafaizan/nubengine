      effect) of the ODI-H, NPRS, RMDQ-H, SF-12-H, FABQ-H, PCS-H, GROC and BBQ-H in Hausa-speaking
      patients with LBP. Rural and urban participants with LBP will be recruited purposively.
      Copies of the translated Hausa versions of the NPRS, ODI, RMDQ, SF-12, FABQ, PCS, BBQ as well
      as VAS for pain and disability will be self or interviewer-administered. Lumbopelvic mobility
      using finger-floor distance test (FFD) will be also measured. The Hausa versions of the ODI,
      NPRS, RMDQ, SF-12, FABQ, PCS, GROC and BBQ will be administered again a week after.

      Data will be analysed using descriptive, correlation, and factorial analysis on IBM SPSS
      (version 23.0) at alpha level of 0.05.
