        -  To determine if patients with cancer can exercise safely and routinely, under
           supervision, while receiving anthracycline chemotherapy.

        -  To determine the magnitude of the change in the peak ventilatory oxygen uptake (VO2)
           before and after completion of anthracycline chemotherapy with concurrent exercise
           versus without exercise in patients with cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (exercise): Patients undergo supervised aerobic exercise (walk or bicycle) 3 days
           a week concurrently with standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy for approximately
           18-24 weeks.

        -  Arm II (non-exercise): Patients receive standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy for
           approximately 18-24 weeks.

      Patients undergo peak ventilatory oxygen uptake (VO_2) by exercise bike test with gas
      exchange analysis at baseline and at 2 weeks after completion of anthracycline-based
      chemotherapy.
