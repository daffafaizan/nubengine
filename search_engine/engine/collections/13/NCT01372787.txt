      I. To determine the prevalence and severity of patient-reported symptoms in patients with
      platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers at study entry and at
      three and six months post-enrollment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the unmet needs of these women at study entry and at three and six months
      post-enrollment (Exploratory) II. To explore the overall quality-of-life (QOL) of these women
      at study entry and at three and six months post enrollment. (Exploratory) III. To explore the
      relationship between patient-reported symptoms and overall QOL, current cancer therapy
      (yes/no), and treatment responses (if on cancer therapy). (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete the Needs at the End-of-Life Screening Tool (NEST), the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy ? Ovarian (FACT-O), the FACIT-Fatigue Subscale (FACIT-F), the
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) FACT Ovarian Symptom Index-18 (NFOSI-18), the
      FACT/GOG-AD subscale for ovarian cancer-related abdominal discomfort, and the
      FACT/GOG-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-NTX) Scale quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and at
      3 and 6 months during office or clinic visits or via telephone or mail. Patients' demographic
      and therapy information, such as current age, ethnicity, marital status, employment status,
      prior chemotherapy regimens/cancer treatment, disease status (if available), performance
      status, patient care information, and current cancer therapy are also collected.

      After completion of study participation, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
