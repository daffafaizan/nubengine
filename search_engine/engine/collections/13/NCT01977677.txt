      I. To assess the safety of using continuous infusion Plerixafor subsequent to irradiation in
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

      II. To assess the efficacy of Plerixafor as measured by progression free survival at 6 months
      (PFS6) from the start of irradiation.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of plerixafor followed by a phase II study.

      Within 4 weeks of surgery, patients undergo radiation therapy and receive temozolomide orally
      (PO) over 42 days. Beginning 8 days prior to completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients
      receive plerixafor intravenously (IV) continuously for 2-4 weeks. Patients also receive
      temozolomide PO 5 days a month beginning 35 days after completion of radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 5 years.
