    
      Elective surgical patients who require intubation will be randomised to one of 2 groups:

        1. C-MAC Video Stylet

        2. Flexible Bronchoscopy During intubation, fluoroscopy will be recorded for later analysis
           to determine the amount of cervical spine movement during the intubation process.

      The intubation will also be timed to determine the duration of the intubation process.
