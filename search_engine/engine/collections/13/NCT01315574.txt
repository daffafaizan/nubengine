      eye pressure and inflammation of the eye using a microscope. One of the eye drops contains a
      commonly used preservative, benzalkonium chloride (BAK), while the other is free of this
      preservative, instead it utilises a new ionic buffer system called SofZia. Prolonged use of
      BAK may be damaging to the eye surface and thus being investigated at a microscopic level in
      this study.

      Specific aims are to assess the in vivo effect of topical BAK-containing and BAK-free
      prostaglandin analogue anti-glaucoma therapy on intraocular pressure (IOP), as well as on
      density and morphology of corneal immune cells, epithelial cells and sub-basal nerve plexus.
