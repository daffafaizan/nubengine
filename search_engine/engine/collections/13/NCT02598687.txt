    
      Rationale:

      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery remains the standard of care for esophageal
      cancer patients. Both limited local response as well as distant metastases are a common cause
      of treatment failure. Combining TH-302 with chemo-radiotherapy may improve outcome by:

        -  Direct cytotoxic effect of TH-302 on hypoxic cells of the primary tumor without
           enhancing normal tissue toxicity.

        -  Increase the sensitivity of the primary tumor to chemo-radiotherapy by decreasing the
           hypoxic fraction.

        -  A bystander cytotoxic effect of TH-302 on normoxic cells adjacent to hypoxic cells of
           the primary tumor.

        -  A potential cytotoxic effect on micro-metastasis.

      Objective:

      Primary objective

      â€¢ To determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of TH-302 combined with chemoradiotherapy (23 x
      1.8 Gy in combination with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel) in patients with distal esophageal or
      esophago-gastric junction adenocarcinoma, and consequently find the recommended phase II dose
      (RP2D).

      Secondary objective

        -  To explore the prognostic and predictive value on outcome of the repeated hypoxia
           PET/CT-scan at baseline and after administration of TH-302 (before start of RCT).

        -  To determine presence of anti-tumor activity with TH-302 administration.

        -  To explore the relationship between tumor hypoxia detected by the HX4 PET/CT-scans and
           serum biomarker expression: CAIX and Osteopontin expression.

      Study design: Open-label, single-center phase 1 study of an investigational agent TH-302 and
      standard chemoradiotherapy with a 3+3 dose escalation design through 3 dose levels.

      Number of patients: 9 to18. For each of the 3 dose steps, 3 to 6 patients will be included.
