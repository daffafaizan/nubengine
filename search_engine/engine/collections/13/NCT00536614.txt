      increase of incidence. Chemotherapy determined disappointing results. Gemcitabine determined
      a slight advantage in survival and clinical benefit in comparison with gemcitabine with
      cisplatin or oxaliplatin Elevated expression of EGFR or its ligand correlates with worse
      prognosis in a variety of human cancers including pancreatic cancer. Therefore, blockade of
      EGFR activity would provide a novel strategy for the treatment of cancer. Cetuximab (C225) is
      a human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed to the EGFR binding site. In a
      preclinical setting, Cetuximab has demonstrated anticancer activity both in cell culture
      experiments and in "in vivo" tumor xenograft animal model Since the combination of
      gemcitabine and cisplatin seems to be the more effective treatment for advanced pancreatic
      cancer and Cetuximab may improve activity of this combination we designed this phase II
      randomised trial to assess the role of Cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and
      cisplatin in pancreatic cancer.
