      with either cyclosporine A (20 patients; male 200 mg/day, female 150 mg/day) or methotrexate
      (20 patients; initial dose with 10 mg/week, increased up to 15 mg/week). The primary outcome
      was to compare the difference between the conventional subjective Psoriasis Area and Severity
      Index (PASI) and the objective PASI by using Colorimeter at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of
      treatment. The secondary outcome was differences between cyclosporine and methotrexate for
      treatment of psoriasis, evaluating clinical efficacy and side effects.
