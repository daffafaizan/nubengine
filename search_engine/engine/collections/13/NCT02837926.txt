    
      3000 women aged within the age range of 25-45 years old will be recruited; 250-300 women per
      country. These women will be identified by means of screening registry lists or screening
      clinical visits. Eligible women will receive a study questionnaire on the HPV vaccine.
      Additionally, and independently of participating in the study questionnaire, those who accept
      will get 3 HPV vaccine doses. Depending on country preferences, either Cervarix®
      (Glaxosmithkline Biologicals, S.A.) at month 0, 1 and 6 or Gardasil® (Sanofi Pasteur MSD SNC)
      at month 0, 2 and 6, will be administered.

      Safety data and HPV vaccine compliance will be assessed.

      A sub study in Spain will also analyze acceptability of HPV vaccination in a sample of women
      aged 35-40 yrs identified as poor screening attenders.

      Two independent informed consent forms will be provided; one for the study questionnaire
      participation and another for HPV vaccine administration.
