      presence of traumatic brain injury and psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress
      disorder and mood disturbances. Alcohol use disorders are frequently observed among veterans
      and exert a detrimental effect on community reintegration after deployment. Attending to this
      veteran health problem, the VA is devoting extraordinary efforts to develop adequate
      treatment strategies. In this study we will evaluate treatment outcomes and identify specific
      factors that influence alcohol use disorders treatment response in a VA Intensive Outpatient
      Program offering rehabilitation treatment to the growing number of veterans with alcohol use
      disorders. Cooperation between researchers and clinical staff will allow optimizing treatment
      strategies that enhance the recovery of veterans with alcohol use disorders.
