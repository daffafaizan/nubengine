      general operating rooms (OR) exists with the goal of optimizing patient care and reducing
      morbidity and mortality. In the obstetric field, while medical terminology exists for these
      situations to delineate and convey the urgency of a particular peripartum situation, for
      example "stat, emergent, or urgent," it is generally acknowledged that this terminology is
      not universal and is somewhat ambiguous, causing confusion and unnecessary delays in patient
      care.

      Investigators propose a quality improvement project which will delineate terminology for
      obstetrical triaging to the OR and discuss metrics for evaluation of this quality improvement
      intervention. Investigators developed a multidisciplinary stratification system at
      investigators' institution to triage obstetric patients into a four-level system with clear
      guidelines for all OR cases. Investigators' categorization system accounted for maternal and
      fetal stability, indication for surgical intervention, role for obtaining additional studies,
      nil per os (NPO) status, and surgical and anesthetic concerns. Within each of the four
      classifications, investigators defined the expectations for each team member's role,
      including the obstetrician, anesthesiologist, charge nurse, nursing staff, neonatal intensive
      care unit (NICU) team, and the surgical and clinical technicians.

      Several metrics will be collected to evaluate this multidisciplinary quality improvement
      project, including maternal demographics, labor characteristics, and indication for surgical
      intervention. Additional data include level assigned, time of patient arrival in OR, type of
      surgery performed, and anesthetic delivered. Investigators will collect fetal delivery data,
      including Apgar scores and umbilical cord gases, as well as maternal delivery data, including
      estimated blood loss, time to uterine incision and delivery, and surgical complications.
