      to chronic critical illness (CCI). The majority of these patients die within a year, and many
      survivors must cope with long-term physical and cognitive limitations that are often severe.
      Survival with severe physical and cognitive dysfunction is a significant clinical, emotional,
      and economic burden in this population, but little is known about which patients are at
      highest risk for physical and cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, although long-term mortality
      in CCI can be reliably estimated with a validated mortality prediction model, there is
      currently no validated method to predict long-term functional disability for purposes of
      shared decision-making and resource planning. In order to address these gaps in knowledge,
      the investigators will conduct a multi-center prospective cohort study that measures clinical
      and premorbid risk factors for long-term physical and cognitive dysfunction in CCI. Using
      these risk factors, the investigators will construct a multi-outcome prognostic model for
      survival with severe physical or cognitive dysfunction to facilitate shared decision-making
      and resource planning. Additionally, the investigators will identify independent social and
      economic variables that are risk factors for long-term survival and functional disability.
