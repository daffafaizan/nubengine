    
      Thirty subjects who are at least 18 years old with a failing upper front tooth seeking for
      implant treatment will be recruited at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry (LLUSD),
      where the consent will also take place. The subjects will be randomly divided into 3 groups.
      The subjects will receive immediate implant placement and provisionalization (IIPP) in
      conjunction with connective tissue graft (CTG) with (Group I) or without (Group II) bone
      graft in the extraction socket; and with bone graft in extraction socket and at the facial
      aspect of failing tooth (Group III). Clinical, radiographic and model assessments will be
      performed at different time intervals (pre-treatment to 12 months after implant placement)
      and statistically analyzed (Î± = 0.05) to evaluate peri-implant tissue response and facial
      gingival profile of the implants. Complications, if any, will also be recorded and
      appropriately addressed.
