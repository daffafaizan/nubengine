      solution for pediatric surgery care for parents of children undergoing circumcision (ICory-
      Circumcision) and their children; (2) to examine the effectiveness of the ICory- Circumcision
      on outcomes of parents (self-efficacy in child care, perioperative knowledge, and
      satisfaction in perioperative care, need for information and anxiety) and children
      (preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain), as well as no-show/ delayed show up for
      operation cases and health services use; and (3) to explore users' (parents, children, health
      care professionals) perceptions of the intervention and suggestions for improvement.

      Study design: This study will be a two-group pretest and repeated posttest pilot randomised
      controlled trial followed by qualitative process evaluation. A total of 80 dyads of parents
      and their primary school-aged children (7-12 years old) will be randomly assigned into the
      intervention group which will receive the ICory-Circumcision plus routine care, whereby the
      parents will receive the BuddyCare application while the child will receive the Triumf game
      application, and the control group, who will just receive routine care provided by the
      hospital. An interview guide will be developed and used to interview the parents and
      healthcare professionals who used ICory-Circumcision to explore their experiences and
      opinions on strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. The children who have used the
      Triumf game will also be interviewed to explore their experiences about the game application.

      Hypothesis: When compared to the control group, (1) parents in the intervention group who
      receive the ICory-Circumcision will report a significantly (a) higher level of self-efficacy
      in child care; perioperative knowledge and satisfaction (b) lower level of needs for
      information and preoperative anxiety. (2) The children in the intervention group will report
      a significantly lower level of preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain. (3) The
      intervention group will have fewer cases of no-show/ delayed show up for operation, and
      reduced health services use (e.g. reduced A & E department or GP attendance for non-medical
      reasons) within 2 weeks after the surgery.
