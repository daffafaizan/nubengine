      (100 mg) of modafinil will be administered. Both groups will be, before and three hours after
      administration of drug or placebo, tested for neuropsychological performances with the
      Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices II set (APM).

      Resting state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) will be also employed, before and after
      three hours, to study changes in the activity of resting state brain networks. Finally, with
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) we will evaluate the structural connectivity of the two
      groups.
