      patients for whom paclitaxel treatment is indicated. The study contains 3 periods: the
      Screening / Baseline Period, the Treatment Period, and the Follow-up Period. A Final Visit
      will occur within 7 days of the last dose of study treatment. If subjects achieve stable
      disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) at the end of the Treatment
      Period, they may continue Oraxol treatment in a separate extension study.
