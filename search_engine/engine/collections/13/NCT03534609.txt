      subject. Study subjects will receive three neck treatments completed 30 days apart. Subjects
      will be contacted via a phone call 3 days following each treatment to assess for adverse
      events and expected treatment effects. Effectiveness assessments will occur prior to
      Treatments #2 and #3, and a follow-up visit will be completed at 90 days following Treatment
      #3. Each assessment visit will include efficacy, adverse events, and expected treatment
      effects assessments, and post-treatment 2D and 3D digital images will be captured.
