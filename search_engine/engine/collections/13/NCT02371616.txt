    
      A single centre, multi-site, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment, parallel group,
      non-inferiority design clinical study conducted in healthy subjects with self-reported and
      clinically diagnosed dentine hypersensitivity (DH). This study will compare the effectiveness
      of a test dentifrice containing 5% w/w calcium sodium phosphosilicate and fluoride as sodium
      fluoride to a commercially available dentifrice containing 5% w/w calcium sodium
      phosphosilicate and fluoride as sodium monofluorophosphate, in providing relief from DH after
      4 and 8 weeks twice daily treatment.
