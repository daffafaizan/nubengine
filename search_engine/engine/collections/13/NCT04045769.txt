    
      Primary Objective: This is a Phase 1, single-center, blinded (with respect to saroglitazar
      magnesium and placebo administration), randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, 4-period
      crossover study to investigate the effect of single therapeutic and supra-therapeutic (5Ã—)
      doses of saroglitazar magnesium on the corrected QT (QTc) interval in healthy subjects in
      compliance with the current version of the International Council for Harmonisation E14
      Guidelines.

      After confirmation of eligibility, 52 subjects (at least 16 will be females) will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequences using a William's design prior to study treatment
      administration on Day 1 of Period 1. Randomized subjects will receive each of the 4 study
      treatments across the 4 treatment periods separated by at least a 7-day washout period.
