    
      This research study looks to enroll as many people with LFS or TP53 gene variants as possible
      in order to:

        -  Better estimate cancer risks in individuals with TP53 variants or LFS, which is a rare
           condition.

        -  Learn the range of cancer risks linked to TP53 variants to help individuals and families
           to improve our ability to counsel patients and families about cancer risks more
           accurately.

        -  Improve opportunities for cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.

        -  Learn more about the meaning of TP53 variants in the blood that are not inherited (e.g.
           ACE/CHIP and mosaicism).

      Study procedures will include:

        -  Collecting information from the participant's medical record and short questionnaires.

        -  Collecting blood, saliva, eyebrow hair and tumor tissue samples (optional).

        -  Sharing study information with family members (optional).

      It is expected that about 1500 people will take part in this research study. Participants
      will be in this study until it closes or the participant withdraws consent.

      The National Cancer Institute is providing funding for part of this study and is considered a
      study sponsor. They will require that some of the genetic information be made available to
      the research community without personal identifying information.
