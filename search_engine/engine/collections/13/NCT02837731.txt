    
      Multi-center randomized study comparing dynamic assessment of fluid responsiveness utilizing
      Starling SV monitor compared to a control group.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 treatment to control group ratio to increase power for
      sub-analysis by patient population.

      Patients randomized to the Starling SV arm will have treatment guided by a dynamic assessment
      of fluid responsiveness (measured by a change in stroke volume index > 10%) as assessed by
      passive leg raise (PLR).

      Patients randomized to the control group will receive standard of care treatment.
