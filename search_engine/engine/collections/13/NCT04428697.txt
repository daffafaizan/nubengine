      several drawbacks. First, the lower portion of the internal sphincter is nested in the
      lowermost part of the anus. Thus, an incision from the fissure base up to the dentate line
      removes support to the inner sphincter structure on the incision site. In our opinion; this
      is the main cause of different levels of incontinence developing in the postoperative period.
      Second, the internal sphincter muscle is shorter in women than in men. Therefore, women are
      at higher risk of postoperative anal incontinence than men. Third, because the lateral
      internal sphincterotomy is not standardized, the length of the internal sphincter incision
      varies, depending on the surgeon's discretion and competency. Fourth, an incision that is too
      short increases in the risk of recurrence.

      The investigators believe that this observation could be explained by the fact that the
      length of the incision required for a lateral internal sphincterotomy procedure has not been
      standardized
