      conducted at 43 centers in the United States from August 2013 to April 2014. A non-inferior
      design was used because both products contain the same active components, and it was
      considered unethical to include a placebo arm. The study comprised an induction phase of 2
      days and a stabilization phase of 20 days, with study visits scheduled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8,
      15, and 22. Eligible opioid-dependent patients were randomly assigned within 14 days of
      screening to induction with either the BNX sublingual tablets or generic buprenorphine
      tablets for 2 days. On Day 3, patients initially allocated to buprenorphine were switched to
      BNX film, whereas those allocated to BNX sublingual tablets continued on the same treatment.
      On Day 15, patients receiving BNX film were switched to BNX sublingual tablets, and those on
      BNX sublingual tablets were switched to BNX film. At the final study visit on Day 22,
      patients were offered the option of continuing in an open-label follow-up study of BNX
      sublingual tablets.
