      what services are offered if someone indicates being a former or current smoker. Findings
      from this study will help improve a standard of care at this clinic and allow us to
      understand what type of tobacco treatment services are preferred by patients.

        -  Adaption of CEASE will entail exit interviews with patients and individual interviews
           with clinical staff to identify and address facilitators and barriers to the
           implementation process.

        -  Effectiveness of CEASE will be measured through questionnaires & biochemical
           verification of smoking status using a pre-test/post-test study design before (usual
           care)and after implementation (CEASE)
