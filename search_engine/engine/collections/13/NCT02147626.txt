      program to provide information and tools for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction for
      women who are at increased risk of CVD by virtue of their history of preeclampsia, a common
      complication of pregnancy. The American Heart Association has recently issued guidelines that
      physicians should include history of the hypertensive pregnancy disorder, preeclampsia, as a
      risk factor for CVD. Indeed, research demonstrates that roughly 2 out of 3 women with a
      history of preeclampsia will die from CVD. This study will work with patients with prior
      preeclampsia and with the Preeclampsia Foundation, a patient- based organization, to create
      an online lifestyle modification program ( accessible by computer or smart phone) for women
      with recent preeclampsia to reduce CVD risk. The study is a randomized controlled trial to
      test the program's acceptability, use, and impact on diet, postpartum weight retention,
      physical activity, blood pressure, and patient knowledge and self-efficacy to improve health.
