      appropriate for resection were treated with a single fraction of SRS pre-operatively. In a
      retrospective analysis, of 51 lesions with a median tumor size of 3 cm, 1-year LC was 86%.
      This neoadjuvant approach resulted in lower rates of leptomeningeal failure (3 vs. 17%) and
      symptomatic radiation toxicity (1.5 vs. 14.6 %) compared to a comparative cohort of lesions
      treated with post-operative cavity boost SRS (POCBS).

      Based on promising results, we believe that a prospective trial to establish the value of
      neoadjuvant SRS (NaSRS) for the treatment of BM appropriate for resection is warranted.

      This study will be a non-randomized phase II trial for patients with one to six brain
      metastases, at least one of which is appropriate for surgical resection. Upon registration,
      patients will be assigned to receive neo-adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (NASRS).
