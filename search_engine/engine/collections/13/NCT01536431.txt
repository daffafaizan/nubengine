      insulin producing cells (Beta Cells) in the pancreas. Our group is interested in how this
      destruction could be stopped or reversed, as this may lead to development of a new generation
      of diabetes treatments which can prevent or slow down the damage, reducing or possibly even
      removing there need for insulin injections.

      In a previous study we examined the safety of our novel approach to this problem, proinsulin
      (PI) peptide immunotherapy, in longstanding diabetes patients (diagnosed more than 5 years
      before), and found it to be well tolerated and free of major hypersensitivity reactions.
      However, it remains theoretically possible that this form of immunotherapy could make the
      immune reaction to the insulin making cells worse rather than better.

      This cannot be studied directly in longstanding patients as they have no or almost no insulin
      making cells left.

      So,the principle objective of the current study is to address the safety issue of whether, in
      patients with newly-diagnosed diabetes who still make some insulin, proinsulin peptide
      therapy adversely affects the rate of damage to the insulin making cells.
