    
      This is a multicenter, two-arm, parallel unmasked pragmatic randomized controlled trial with
      baseline and post-intervention (4 weeks from baseline) assessments. A convenience sample of
      participants of three population-based cohorts of individuals born very preterm and/or very
      low birth weight will be randomized and allocated 1:1 to either a mobile app intervention
      group or into the control arm (usual data collection methods).

      Secondary aims of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the usability and acceptability of the mobile app among cohort participants.

        2. To investigate the potential Hawthorne effect on the results on physical activity
           behavior and mood status.

        3. To measure the agreement between passively tracked physical activity by the mobile app
           and physical activity measured weekly with a self-reported questionnaire.

        4. To measure the agreement between mood status collected by the mobile app through
           Ecological Momentary Assessment and mood status measured weekly with a self-reported
           questionnaire.

        5. To survey participant's preferences about the different data collection methods.

      Intention-to-treat approach will be applied in the data analysis.
