    
      Open-label, 2-part study. Part 1 is a pilot study to determine the relationship between
      opioid agonism and suppression of carbon dioxide induced increases in minute ventilation
      prior to opioid exposure. Part 2 will be a randomized, 2 period, 2 treatment, crossover study
      to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of intranasal (IN) nalmefene compared to IN naloxone
      to reverse opioid-induced suppression of carbon dioxide induced increases in minute
      ventilation, in healthy volunteers with prior opioid exposure.

      Both Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will consist of an outpatient Screening Visit taking
      place 28 days prior to admission, an in-clinic Treatment Phase consisting of a 6 or 7 day
      inpatient stay, and a Follow-Up Phone Call conducted 3 to 7 days after discharge.
