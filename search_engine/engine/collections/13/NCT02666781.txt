      increased morbidity and mortality. It is an independent risk-factor for post-operative
      cardio-respiratory complications and increased perioperative utilization of health care
      resources. In non-surgical patients, rostral fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck has
      been identified as a pathophysiologic mechanism to explain OSA severity based on gender,
      increasing age, and in fluid-overload states. In this novel study, our objective is to
      examine the contribution of fluid shift from the lower limbs to the neck thereby leading to
      worsening of sleep apnea following surgery.

      Objectives of the study

        -  Measure the change in the leg, neck and total fluid volume from preoperative baseline to
           the second postoperative day.

        -  Assess the impact of the change in neck fluid volume on neck circumference and
           postoperative AHI.

      Similar to the patients with heart failure, renal failure and older men, we hypothesize the
      rostral shift of fluid from the lower limbs to the neck occurs in the postoperative period
      contributing to the postoperative worsening of OSA. In this study, we will perform serial
      measurements of segmental and total body water shifts occurring after surgery, at various
      time-points over two postoperative days. We will monitor indices such as the Apnea Hypopnea
      index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) to examine changes in the severity of OSA.
      Internal validity of our study will be made more robust by use of well-validated methods such
      as BIA for fluid measurements and portable PSG for OSA severity.
