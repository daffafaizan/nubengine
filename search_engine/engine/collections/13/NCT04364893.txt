      SARS-CoV2 infection generate doubts about risks and benefits. Among these situations in which
      the current data indicate a situation of equipoise would be about the maintenance or
      suspension of ACEI / BRA in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Increasing the expression of
      ECA-2 could increase the binding to the virus, however, there are studies that indicate this
      increase in ECA-2 could be protective. So far, there is no clinical evidence to confirm any
      of the theories, and this question can only be clarified through a randomized clinical trial.

      The objective is to evaluate the impact of the suspension of the use of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (BRA) on the
      length of hospital stay and on the mortality of patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.
