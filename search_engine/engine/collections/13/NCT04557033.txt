    
      This project provides an opportunity for patient care staff in an ambulatory oncology setting
      to participate in and evaluate an activity that includes a mindfulness meditation technique
      and an expressive digital arts activity.

      This study will be conducted to evaluate the feasibility of providing a mindfulness
      meditation and digital imagery activity.

        -  The activity will include a guided mindfulness meditation and the creation of a digital
           image on an iPad.

        -  Participants will be asked to complete brief surveys before and after the intervention
           activity.
