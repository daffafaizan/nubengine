      I. To assess the safety of ipilimumab in eligible patients with recurrent or metastatic
      cervical cancer.

      II. To assess the antitumor activity of ipilimumab in eligible patients with recurrent or
      metastatic cervical cancer via assessment of objective response rates (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of ipilimumab through secondary endpoints including of
      disease stabilization and progression free survival (PFS).

      II. Assessment of antitumor activity of ipilimumab using immune-related response criteria
      (irRC) III. Assessment of the predictive value of baseline C-reactive protein. IV. Assess the
      biologic responses of exposure to ipilimumab via correlative studies involving analysis of
      lymphocyte subsets and assessment of cervical cancer-antigen specific T cells anti-tumor
      response.

      V. Evaluation of archival tissue with regard to markers of immune population in correlation
      with clinical stage and response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving objective response or stable disease continue to receive maintenance therapy
      comprising ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 12 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
