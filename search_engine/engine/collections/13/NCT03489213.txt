      I. To determine the feasibility and compliance with a the Dietary Guidelines for
      Americans/American Institute for Cancer Research (DGA/AICR) healthy dietary pattern and a
      beef + DGA/AICR healthy dietary pattern in cancer survivors.

      II. To determine the impact of dietary interventions on body composition, clinical outcomes,
      and physical performance.

      III. To quantify the impact of the two dietary interventions on cardiometabolic biomarkers of
      health.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive DGA/AICR-based dietary intervention for 6 months consisting of 12
      education sessions over 60 minutes every other week, fruit, vegetable, and herb harvesting
      1-2 times per week for 2 hours, wearing a FitBit during physical activity, and remote health
      coaching over 10 minutes for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive DGA/AICR-based dietary intervention as in Arm I and consume 11-18
      ounces of lean beef each week for 6 months.

      Clinical and physical activity assessments will take place at baseline, after the
      intervention and at 12 months.
