      associated with an increased risk, and no major complications have been described so far both
      for the 22 gauge Procore needle and for standard 22 gauge.20, 21 Potential benefits of this
      new needle are the possibility of increasing the chance of retrieving tissue specimens for
      histological examination, with the possibility of increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the
      procedure saving the need and the cost deriving from on-site cytopathology examination. This
      may reduce the need to repeat EUS procedures or other more invasive sampling procedures,
      including surgery.
