      changes in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder. The
      secondary goal is to identify those subjects in the top tertile for the highest risk of IHD
      as defined by TG/HDL ratios (>>3.5) and ischemic EKG changes with and without clinical
      ischemia, e.g. angina and to see if these risk factors can be reduced or reversed by a change
      of antipsychotic medication, dietary counseling, enrollment into available exercise groups,
      etc.
