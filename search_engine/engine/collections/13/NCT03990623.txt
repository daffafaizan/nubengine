      I. To assess whether perfusion changes to the liver following portal vein embolization (PVE)
      correlate with hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess perfusion changes to liver tumors following PVE. II. To assess whether PVE may
      affect tumor growth.

      OUTLINE:

      Prior to PVE, patients undergo CT perfusion scan of the liver and liver biopsy over 15
      minutes. Patients undergo a second CT perfusion scan immediately after PVE and a third CT
      perfusion scan 3-6 weeks post PVE.
