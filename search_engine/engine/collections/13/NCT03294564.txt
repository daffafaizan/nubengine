      function. Animal studies have shown that inflammation appears to alter threat- and
      reward-related brain activity. Accumulating evidence points to inflammatory proteins,
      specifically cytokines, as key players in this relationship. Although cytokines are typically
      too large to pass through the blood brain barrier (BBB), they can influence brain function
      and structure by transmitting signals from peripheral systems to the brain.

      The administration of endotoxin within the polysaccharide form of Salmonella typhi
      vaccination provides an ideal model for studying the causal effects of short-term
      inflammation on thinking patterns (i.e., cognition) and emotions in the brain. Endotoxin is a
      component of the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, which promotes the production of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-α) via toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) activation and nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) signaling.

      To examine the effects of acute inflammation on brain functioning, 24 healthy participants
      will be recruited. The investigators will will randomize participants to placebo or
      inflammatory challenge using polysaccharide typhoid vaccine (i.e., endotoxin) and will use
      validated behavioral tasks and questionnaires to assess threat and reward sensitivity. They
      will assess chronic resting levels of inflammation as well as the inflammatory response to
      Salmonella typhi vaccination.
