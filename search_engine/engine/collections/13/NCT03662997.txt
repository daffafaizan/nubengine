    
      The study will be conducted in an outpatient setting of an academic clinical center over a
      total period of four weeks (28 days, -1/+2).

      The aim of this RCT is to evaluate and compare three different foam dressings in the local
      management of chronic wounds (i.e. venous leg ulcers (VLUs) and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs))
      in an outpatient setting. A bordered, five-layer, flexible foam dressing with soft silicone
      adhesive technology will be evaluated versus a hydropolymer, adhesive foam island dressing
      and a multi-layered, hydrocellular foam dressing with silicone adhesive, within three focus
      areas; efficacy and safety of the dressings, participant-centric outcomes and health economic
      evaluation.
