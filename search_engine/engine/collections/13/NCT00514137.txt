      I. To assess the number of responses in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with
      sunitinib (sunitinib malate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of sunitinib malate in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.

      II. To assess time to progression after initial response to sunitinib malate.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-42. Treatment repeats every 42
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.
