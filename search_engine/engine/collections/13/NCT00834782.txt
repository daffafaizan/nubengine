      (IOP). Each tonometer is based on different technology.

      Post penetrating keratoplasty (PK) eyes are at risk for developing secondary glaucoma
      (9-14%). Elevation of the IOP may cause rejection of the graft or alternately a loss in the
      endothelial cell layer count causing decompensation of the cornea. Therefore, measuring
      accurately the IOP in this population is of great importance.

      Measuring IOP in post PK is not an easy challenge, mainly because of parameters like the
      central corneal thickness (CCT), the curvature of the cornea, the axial length and
      biomechanical properties which diverse from normal eyes.

      The Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) is the gold standard tonometer for measuring IOP and
      is the most popular tonometer clinically used. IOP measurements via the GAT are based on the
      assumption that the CCT is constant. post PK eyes CCT might diverse from normal eyes causing
      GAT IOP measurements to be inaccurate. The Pascal dynamic contour tonometer (DCT) measures
      IOP independently of corneal parameters. The Ocular response analyzer (ORA) is based on a non
      contact technique of measurement. The tonometer is thought to be independent of factors such
      as CCT.

      The aim of the study is to compare intraocular pressure (IOP) measured by the Reichert Ocular
      Response Analyzer (ORA), Pascal dynamic contour tonometer (DCT) and Goldmann applanation
      tonometer (GAT) in eyes after Penetrating Keratoplasty (KPL). In addition its aim is to
      discover the dependence of different parameters, like - CCT, curvature of the cornea, axial
      length and biomechanical properties on IOP measurement to elucidate the appropriate tonometer
      for this population.
