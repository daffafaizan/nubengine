      antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-neoplastic properties, and even potential to improve mental
      illnesses. In western herbalism, Turmeric is primarily used as an anti-inflammatory agent. In
      India, turmeric is used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of acne. It has been used
      both internally and externally.

      Curcumin is a phytochemical derived from turmeric and believed to be one of the key active
      components of turmeric. Curcumin is reported to have activity as an antibacterial and
      anti-inflammatory agent and has been used as a paste for skin eruptions and infections.
      Previous basic science work by Dr. Raja Sivamani's lab has shown that both turmeric and
      curcumin inhibit lipid synthesis in human sebocytes, the cells responsible for the production
      of sebum

      The goal of this study is to evaluate how ingestion of turmeric and tablets that have a
      combination of herbs including turmeric may modulate sebum production.
