      control and without an increase in clinical events may be spared the expense and adverse
      effects of treatment. However, the consequences of treatment discontinuation in patients with
      asymptomatic HIV infections are not well understood. This study will follow the clinical and
      immunologic progression of HIV infection in patients who have low HIV viral load and
      preserved CD4+ cell counts at the time ART is stopped.

      Patients will fast for at least 8 hours prior to the first study visit. At this visit, blood
      will be drawn and body measurements will be taken. Patients will then discontinue their ART.
      Patients taking nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) will stop taking
      NNRTIs 48 hours before withdrawing their other ART drugs. Study visits will occur every 4 to
      8 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks for the second year. Blood will be taken at
      most visits, and patients will be asked to fast for at least 8 hours prior to Week 12 and 24
      visits and again every 6 months. Patients who reinitiate ART for any reason will be
      registered to Step 2 and followed for 24 weeks.
