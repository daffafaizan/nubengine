      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Such factors, as well as the bedridden status and
      critical illness may constitute a prothrombotic milieu, predisposing to venous and arterial
      thrombosis. However, the optimal antithrombotic regimen for patients with COVID-19,
      especially those with severe disease, remains uncertain and is currently an area of active
      clinical interest. Prophylactic-dose anticoagulation is generally recommended for acutely ill
      hospitalized patients. However, given the hemostatic abnormalities of severe COVID-19
      illness, it is unknown whether more intensive anticoagulation is preferred to reduce the risk
      of thrombotic events, potentially mitigating microvascular and macrovascular thrombi and even
      disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Further, the risks of therapeutic dose
      anticoagulation must be weighed against the bleeding risks inherent to this approach. To
      address this critical gap in knowledge in an area of clinical equipoise, the investigators
      plan to conduct a cluster-randomized trial in patients admitted to intensive care units
      (ICUs) in a large volume academic medical center to select the best anticoagulation
      intervention.
