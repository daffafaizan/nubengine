    
      This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of select interbody implant devices in patients who undergo interbody fusion
      surgery. Consecutive patients at a given site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked
      to consent to participate in the study. These patients will present with degenerative
      conditions in the thoracic and/or lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and
      will be screened prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled into the study, subjects will
      undergo interbody fusion surgery using one of the NuVasive interbody implant groups based on
      the surgeon's standard of care. At least 900 subjects (a minimum of 75 patients in each
      implant group) will be enrolled and will be followed for 24 months after the surgery.
