      non-elderly and scarcely investigated in the literature. This prospective observational study
      focuses on individuals between 18 and 59 years old who have incurred a hip fracture and been
      treated at any of the participating orthopaedic departments in Sweden or Denmark. The study
      group is analysed and described at the time of the fracture and are followed during two
      years.

      The patients' treatment follows the departments' standard rationale, there is no intervention
      in the study. Patients are included, after being informed and consent to participate is
      given, at the ward when they are admitted at the time of the fracture. The study comprises
      written enquiries (Patient Reported Outcome Measures, PROM) regarding hip- and global health
      before the fracture as well as interview and medical files and x-ray information regarding
      previous illness and use of medication, information about the injury, fracture type and
      treatment. Blood samples are used to investigate possible comorbidities and evaluate the
      hormonal and nutritional status and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is analysed with
      regards to reduced bone mineral density (osteopenia/-porosis). For patients with a femoral
      neck fracture who are treated with osteosynthesis, MRI with metal reduction is performed
      post-operatively and at 4 and 12 months to assess fracture healing and avascular necrosis of
      the femoral head.

      Patients are followed up at 6 weeks by written PROM-enquiries by mail, and at 4, 12 and 24
      months post-operatively at visits in the outpatient clinic.
