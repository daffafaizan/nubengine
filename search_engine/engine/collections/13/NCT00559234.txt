      diagnosed or undiagnosed genetic conditions who may be eligible and wish to participate in
      other NEI clinical research studies. The primary purpose of this evaluation and treatment
      protocol is to provide a resource of patients for specific new research protocols and for
      staff and fellowship training. A secondary purpose is to provide long-term follow-up and
      treatment for a variety of genetic eye diseases so that the genetic specialists at NEI will
      be better able to identify research hypotheses for these diseases, which may lead to ideas
      for future protocols. Finally, the ability to provide long-term follow-up and care will also
      facilitate referral efforts for new NEI protocols. As a by-product of this research activity,
      the participants will help the investigators to maintain their clinical skills.
