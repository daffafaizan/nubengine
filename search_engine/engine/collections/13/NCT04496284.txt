      in higher sustained implantation rates compared to the conventional use of liquid nitrogen.
      Routine ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval and embryology care will ensue. All blastocyst
      stage embryos will be randomized to either the control (liquid nitrogen) or intervention
      group (slush nitrogen) and vitrified after trophectoderm biopsy has been performed for PGT-A
      (preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy). A single, chromosomally normal embryo will
      be transferred in a subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycle per routine. Implantation rates
      and pregnancy outcomes will be assessed.
