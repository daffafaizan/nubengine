      randomized to one of two study arms. In one arm, patients will have 72 hours of TTM to MIH
      (32-34 degree Celcius). In the second arm, patients will have 72 hours of TTM to Normal
      Temperature (NT)(36-37 degrees Celcius). Subjects in all arms will otherwise receive
      identical therapeutic interventions pre-defined by our local IPH management protocol.

      Primary outcomes are examining the frequency of adverse events (AEs) that will be possibly or
      probably related to treatment. AEs will be assessed up to 15-days after admission or
      discharge if earlier and the frequency of severe adverse events (SAEs) that will be possibly
      and probably related to treatment.

      SAEs will be assessed up to 90-days.

      The secondary outcome measures will be in-hospital neurological deterioration between day 0-7
      (decrease in GCS10 in ≥2 points, or increase in the NIHSS11 ≥4 points), in-hospital
      mortality, modified Rankin Score [mRS]12 at discharge and 90-days.

      To determine whether TTM to MIH can limit HG and cerebral edema, will be examining absolute
      change in hematoma between baseline and 24 hours, new or absolute change in IVH between
      baseline and 24 hours, the proportion of patients with HG, absolute change in hemostatic
      proteins, the absolute change in cerebral edema between baseline and 24, 48,72, and
      168-hours, relative change in cerebral edema.
