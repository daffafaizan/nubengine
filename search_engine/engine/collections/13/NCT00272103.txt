      efficacy of Itopride, a D2 antagonist with acetylcholinesterase effects in patients with
      functional dyspepsia.

      Patients with functional dyspepsia will be randomized to Itopride (50, 100 or 200 mg tid) or
      placebo. After 8 weeks of treatment, three primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed: a)
      change of the severity of functional dyspepsia symptoms (assessed by the Leeds Dyspepsia
      Questionnaire), b) patient's global assessment of efficacy (proportion of patients
      symptom-free or markedly improved)and c) improvement of pain and/or fullness by at least one
      grade on a 5-grade scale.
