      Currently, self-assessment pain scales remain to be the gold standard in labor pain
      evaluation after the administration of epidural analgesia. However, individual patient
      susceptibility to pain perception makes difficulties for the clinicians to assess the
      effectiveness of painless labor precisely. Without a convincing objective tool for obstetric
      pain evaluation during epidural analgesia, the clinicians are hard to adjust adequate
      epidural drug dosage. Establishing an objective pain index would help the clinicians to have
      a better pain management during labor.

      In 2012, M. Le Guen et al. demonstrated a linear relationship between visual analogical pain
      scores(VAS) and Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) values during labor. Their efforts started
      the application of ANI in obstetric pain monitoring. However, the reliability of ANI in
      obstetric pain monitoring under epidural analgesia have not yet been verified. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the validity of ANI in obstetric pain monitoring during epidural
      analgesia.
