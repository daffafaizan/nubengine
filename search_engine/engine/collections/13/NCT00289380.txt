      40%-70% , there was no evidence to elaborate the prevalence of nutritional risk and
      malnutrition on hospitalized patients of Asia. Also in USA no data for nutritional risk. In
      2002, scientists group headed by Kondrup from : European Society for Parenteral and Enteral
      Nutrition demonstrated that randomized controlled clinical trials showed patients may get
      benefit from nutrition support when they with nutrition risk. Based on these evidences, a
      simpler method was established by European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition in
      year 2002 in Munich & it was demonstrated useful to evaluate the appropriate use of nutrition
      support at present time. This method was named as Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS).

      We propose to survey the prevalence of malnutrition & nutrition risk in large cities'
      large/middle size hospitalized patients in China, Europe and USA use NRS tool. As well, we
      also aim to figure out the current nutrition support status in current large/middle size
      hospitals through this survey.

      we also propose to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition
      and non-nutritional support, and to examine the clinical outcomes of nutritional support in
      certain patients at nutritional risk identified by NRS-2002.

      For international cooperation,our partners are Professor Kondrup of Europe and Professor
      Nolan from Johns Hopkins Hospital,there are students from a cooperative project with Johns
      Hopkins Hospital for Doctor of Philosophy students 2005-2011.

      In plan this protocol might be completed around 2016 also.
