      hallucinations versus sham treatment over the temporoparietal cortex.

      FMRI will highlight areas of activation with auditory hallucinations distinct from the area
      identified by Hoffman's scalp based method.

      Cortical inhibition as measured by paired pulse TMS will be increased after true TMS but not
      sham TMS.
