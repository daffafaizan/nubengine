      vary depending on how many participants are needed to obtain at least 3 complete participants
      per cohort.

      IMC-3C5 will initially be administered once every week (Cohorts 1-4) in a dose escalated
      manner. The starting dose will be 5 mg/kg weekly (Cohort 1). Dose escalation will proceed to
      10 mg/kg (Cohort 2), 20 mg/kg (Cohort 3), and 30 mg/kg (Cohort 4). Based on an analysis of
      the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of weekly dosing, participants may be enrolled
      sequentially into 2 every-other-week dose cohorts (Cohorts 5-6, 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg).
      Intermediate doses may also be used.
