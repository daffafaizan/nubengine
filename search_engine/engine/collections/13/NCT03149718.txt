      preliminary studies by manualizing and examining the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical
      effect for the Brief Intervention Medication Therapy Management (BI-MTM) model. BI-MTM is a
      multicomponent community pharmacy-based intervention. BI-MTM is designed to: (1) promote
      opioid medication regimen adherence, (2) reduce opioid medication misuse, (3) connect
      participants with patient navigation (a chronic condition care model) to increase
      self-management of health conditions that increase risk for misuse, and (4) provide naloxone
      rescue training referrals. Patients will be screened across 14 months for opioid medication
      misuse in an urban community pharmacy affiliated with a major medical system. Patients
      positive for misuse will be randomly assigned to BI-MTM (n=23) or Standard Medication
      Counseling (n=23). Standard Medication Counseling is the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare
      Services requirement for pharmacists in the US wherein pharmacy patients filling
      prescriptions receive information and opt-in counseling. This study will demonstrate
      feasibility and acceptability of BI-MTM for community pharmacy patients who misuse their
      opioid medications for future intervention implementation in a fully powered randomized
      trial. This study will also generate preliminary data regarding opioid medication misuse
      elimination and increases in participant self-management activation for comorbid health
      conditions that increase risk for misuse.
