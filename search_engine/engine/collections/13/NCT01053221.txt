      immunosuppressive drugs (calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolic acid) to mycophenolic acid
      monotherapy. Safety will be assessed by monitoring renal function in subjects in the
      withdrawal group compared to those who remain on the standard 2-drug immunosuppression
      protocol. Results of immunological monitors such as DTH regulation in response to donor minor
      antigens and development of anti-donor antibodies will be correlated with successful
      withdrawal.
