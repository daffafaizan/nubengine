      total body irradiation (TBI) containing regimen for children with acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. II. Compare relapse rate
      between a chemotherapy only regimen versus a total body irradiation containing regimen for
      children with ALL. III. Assess and compare the acute and chronic neuropsychological effects
      of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in children undergoing BMT with busulfan or TBI
      conditioning regimens. IV. Assess and compare the cardiac, pulmonary and growth effects of
      BMT in children undergoing this conditioning regimen. V. Assess the relationship between
      plasma busulfan levels and relapse and toxicity. VI. Assess and compare minimal residual
      disease patterns by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients receiving
      busulfan or TBI conditioning regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study comparing a chemotherapy only arm, including
      busulfan, with a TBI containing arm. Arm I patients receive TBI on days -7, -6, and -5 given
      in 2 fractions daily. Arm II patients receive busulfan every 6 hours on days -8, -7, -6, and
      -5. Both regimens are followed by etoposide over 4 hours on day -4 and cyclophosphamide
      intravenously (IV) on days -3 and -2. Marrow infusion begins following a day of rest.
      Starting on day -1, cyclosporine IV is administered every 12 hours or by continuous infusion
      and continues until day 50. Methotrexate IV is administered on days 1, 3, and 6

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients will be entered into this study.
