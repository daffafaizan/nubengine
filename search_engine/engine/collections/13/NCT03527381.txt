      supplementation to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit during cardiac surgery with
      normothermic CPB in adult patients. The prospective randomized study is performed in the
      settings of Federal Cardiology Center. A total of 96 adult patients who underwent cardiac
      surgery with CPB are enrolled in the study. Patients are randomized to two groups: main group
      receive NO treatment; control group undergoes sham procedure. In the main group, NO is
      supplied to the CPB line in a dose of 40 ppm throughout the entire CPB period. The primary
      endpoint is the frequency of acute kidney injury (AKI). The secondary endpoints are urine
      output during CPB; uNGAL level 4 h after surgery; plasma concentration of free hemoglobin
      (Hb); concentrations of NO metabolites (nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-)) and the total
      concentration of metabolites of NO (NOx, μM/mL) in blood plasma in the intraoperative period;
      concentration of proinflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, -6, and -8) and anti-inflammatory mediators
      (IL-1ra, IL-4) in blood plasma in the intraoperative period. Cumulative fluid balance,
      diuresis, and Lasix doses are assessed within the first 48 h of the postoperative period. The
      dynamics of serum creatinine is assessed during the first week following the intervention.
