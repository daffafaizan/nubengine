      transplant to prevent their body from rejecting the new liver or kidney transplant. Prograf
      is taken by the patient twice a day. Advagraf is a similar medication but is taken by the
      patient only once a day. There is some evidence emerging that may show that this once-a-day
      medication may show additional benefits over the twice a day medication, such as, patients
      more likely to remember to take this medication. Also, this once a day medication is slowly
      released in the body through the course of a day which in turn may provide better protection
      against the body rejecting the new transplanted organ over a longer period.

      This study will follow up adult patients who were previously enrolled in an Advagraf trial
      after they have had a liver or kidney transplant. The information collected for this study
      will be information that the patient's doctor will normally collect when he/she sees the
      patient for their regular check-ups. Information will be collected once a year for a period
      of 5 years from when the patient received their new organ transplant. It is hoped that
      patient information collected during the study will provide prescribers with useful
      information in treatment of organ transplant patients.
