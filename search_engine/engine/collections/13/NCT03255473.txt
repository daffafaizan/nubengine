      with spontaneous recovery seen in 32% to 65%. Many different treatments have been
      investigated in attempt to improve hearing outcomes, with oral corticosteroids having some
      success. Steroid regimens are highly variable, however, retrospective data has suggested
      greater improvement in hearing outcomes with the use of high dose oral steroids
      (dexamethasone) in the setting of unilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss compared to
      traditional medical therapy with lower dose oral prednisone. The investigators hypothesize
      that patients with unilateral SSNHL who are randomized to treatment with high doses of oral
      dexamethasone will show better hearing outcomes than patients who are randomized to the more
      common standard clinical practice treatment with lower doses of oral prednisone.
