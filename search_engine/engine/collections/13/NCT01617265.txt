      and morphinics are frequently administered to increase synchrony with the ventilator, control
      agitation and decrease discomfort and pain due to the tracheal tube, bed ridding, painful
      condition and diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.

      However, administration sedatives or morphinics is often excessive and may result in deep and
      prolonged alteration of consciousness, delayed weaning from MV and prolonged MV. and exposes
      the patient to a higher risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, ICU delirium and
      neuromuscular weakness at awakening.

      The present randomized multicenter study will compare the day-90 mortality of a group of
      patients receiving conventional sedation to the mortality of a group of patients receiving
      sedation administered according to an algorithm aimed to prevent oversedation to the
      mortality. The algorithm is built on a graduate therapeutic response to increasingly intense
      symptoms of discomfort, pain, ventilator dyssynchrony and agitation, and includes the use of
      analgesics, non hypnotic benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, repeated intravenous (IV) boluses of
      hypnotics and short duration (6 hours) IV hypnotic infusions.
