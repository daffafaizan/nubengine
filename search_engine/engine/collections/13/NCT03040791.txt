    
      This is a Phase II, two-stage, multi-center, single-arm, and open-label trial of Nivolumab
      (BMS-936558) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who
      have progressed to a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen previously. Eligible patients must
      have ECOG 0-2 and material for biomarker analysis. Prior enzalutamide, abiraterone and
      cabazitaxel are permitted but not necessary to enrollment. The germline and somatic DRD
      (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PTEN, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD51D, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2.) will be
      assessed by T-NGS of metastatic sites or by liquid biopsy. The primary endpoint is PSA 50
      response rate (PSA50, following the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria). The trial will
      meet its endpoint if â‰¥ 3/29 men achieve a PSA50 response. The secondary endpoints will
      include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, radiologic PFS, PSA response rate
      at 6 and 12 months.
