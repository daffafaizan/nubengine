      limb sensation and phantom limb pain. The first hypothesis states that phantom limb sensation
      and phantom limb pain both correlate with the 'phantom limb', while the second one maintains
      that the phantom limb can interact with the patient's body by means of the meridian system.
      With the far infrared ray applied to the 'phantom limbs' in amputees and the corresponding
      normal legs in healthy subjects, the sensation of (phantom) limb will be assessed for each
      subject using the techniques of fMRI and meridian response. By analyzing the data collected
      from both groups, the investigators expect both hypotheses will be supported by the results
      of experiments in this project.
