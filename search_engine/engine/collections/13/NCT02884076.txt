      receiving a standardized ambulatory treatment regime. The questionnaire will be
      self-administered by the subjects. Subjects whom are not able to self-administer the
      questionnaire will be assisted by the investigator or research assistant. The nature and
      severity of the subject's haemorrhoidal symptoms are considered as the pre-treatment
      baseline. A follow up period of 12 months will be carried out post treatment for failure or
      success of treatment. The data collected will be compared to pre-treatment scores and
      analyzed statistically.
