      use minimally invasive devices to image sweat ducts in intact skin, to measure stimulated
      sweat rate, and in a subset of subjects to collect clipped scalp hair samples for RNA
      analysis. This study is descriptive in nature and is intended to assess the ability to use
      innovative approaches to generate data from subjects over a wide age spectrum, with
      particular emphasis on phenotype variability between male siblings (same mutation). To this
      end, priority will be given to families that contain multiple affected siblings (i.e. two
      brothers). Summary data will be generated for the various groups tested, but no power
      calculations are involved.
