      (EC) without prescription ('pharmacist only'). In 2003, a first analysis of requests of EC
      showed that the dispensing of EC through pharmacies could successfully be implemented (Lemke
      et al 2004).

      This study was repeated three years later with the aim to explore whether the user's profile
      has changed after introduction of a low threshold access to EC.
