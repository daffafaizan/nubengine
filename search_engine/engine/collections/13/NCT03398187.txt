    
      Cardiac catheterization is of two types:

      diagnostic and interventional . There has been recent advances in these procedures.There is
      an over 10y experience at the pediatric cardiology unit in assiut University Children
      Hospital ( A.U.C.H ) catheterization department. The procedure usually follows other
      investigations used for evaluation of the pediatric cardiac patients e.g. chest X-ray , ECG
      and echocardiography.

      The role of cardiac catheterization may be in the diagnosis of congenital cardiac anomalies
      as well as in the follow up of repair of some cardiac anomalies . On the other hand, the
      indications for interventional cardiac catheterization may be repair of Atrial septal defect,
      Transposition of great arteries palliation with balloon septostomy ,blood vessel dilatation
      e.g. aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta . In addition Patent ductus arteriosus
      closure and others may be done by the interventional cardiac catheterization.
