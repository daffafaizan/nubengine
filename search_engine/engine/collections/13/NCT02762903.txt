      anterior access to the glenohumeral joint. Postoperative subscapularis dysfunction is being
      recognized more frequently and has been reported in >65% of patients following shoulder
      arthroplasty with a soft-tissue repair. Subscapularis dysfunction has been associated with
      poor functional outcomes including tendon rupture and anterior instability, a major
      indication for revision surgery. Recent studies suggest that a standard subscapularis
      tenotomy with primary tendon repair may lead to failure of the repair and decreased
      functional outcomes as compared to a more novel lesser tuberosity osteotomy technique. The
      investigators study aims to validate the results of the current literature in a prospective
      randomized controlled trial, which to their knowledge has not been reported on this
      topic.Investigators will compare clinical outcomes following these two techniques during
      total shoulder arthroplasty. Participants undergoing total shoulder replacement will be
      randomized to receive either a lesser tuberosity osteotomy or tenotomy with primary
      subscapularis tendon repair. All other procedures conducted in this study are considered
      standard of care except for ultrasounds, which are conducted for research purposes in the
      subscapularis tenotomy group. Postoperative outcomes will be monitored objectively and
      subjectively at routine postoperative office visits using physical exam, imaging (X-rays and
      ultrasounds), and questionnaires. If the hypothesis is proven to be true, the investigators
      will establish gold-standard evidence for the use of the newer osteotomy technique to improve
      patient satisfaction and mobility following shoulder arthroplasty.
