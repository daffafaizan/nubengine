    
      Fatigue is a frequent symptom of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and most common
      adverse event of targeted and immunotherapy.

      In Phase 3 pivotal studies, 56% (9%, grade 3-4), 54% (11%, grade 3), 37% (10%, grade 3-4) and
      20% (2%, grade 3) of patients had fatigue during the therapy of cabozantinib, sunitinib,
      axitinib or pazopanib, respectively. 59% (14%, grade 3) and 31% (5%, grade 3) of patients
      treated with lenvatinib/everolimus and everolimus had fatigue in registrational trials.
      Finally, 33% (2%, grade 3-4) of patients that received nivolumab had fatigue in CheckMate 025
      study.

      Testosterone may help to relieve fatigue associated with the use of tyrosine kinase, mTOR or
      checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, testosterone could impact on poor prognostic factors of
      RCC (anemia, ECOG performance status, serum calcium). This will be first clinical trial which
      evaluates safety and efficacy of Testosterone in RCC patients.
