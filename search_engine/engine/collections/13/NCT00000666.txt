      treatment for toxoplasmic encephalitis is to combine pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.
      Continuous treatment is necessary to prevent recurrence of the disease, but constant use of
      pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine is associated with toxicity. Clindamycin has been shown to be
      effective in treatment of toxoplasmic encephalitis in animal studies. This study evaluates
      pyrimethamine as a preventive treatment against toxoplasmic encephalitis (per 3/26/91
      amendment, clindamycin arm was discontinued).

      Patients are randomized to receive pyrimethamine or placebo three times a week. All patients
      must be on aerosolized pentamidine, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (T/S), or dapsone for
      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis. Patients will be evaluated bi-weekly for the
      first month and every other month thereafter for at least 24 months.
