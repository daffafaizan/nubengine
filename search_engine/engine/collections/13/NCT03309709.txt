      guidelines, given that most premenopausal polyps are not malignant, there is an option for
      expectant approach with no surgical intervention. Studies on the efficacy of medical
      treatments for endometrial polyps are also recommended by gynaecologic societies, with the
      aim of finding cost-saving not invasive strategies to manage this common pathology. Up to
      now, nobody has investigated the effect of progestin administration on polyps, but molecular
      and clinical data suggest that the antiestrogenic effect of this hormone can be exploited to
      increase and speed-up their regression rate. Our preliminary results on the effect of three
      months of progesterone demonstrated a regression rate of 47,5% in women treated vs 12,5% in
      those don't receiving treatment.

      Accordingly, in this prospective randomized study we aim to compare the regression rates of
      women managed with watch-and-wait approach and of those treated with 3 cycles of luteal 25mg
      subcutaneous progesterone from 18 to 25 days of menstrual cycle
