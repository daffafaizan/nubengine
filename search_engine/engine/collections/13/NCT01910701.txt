    
      This is a single group pre-post study designed to evaluate the impact of a home visiting
      intervention in improving parenting self-efficacy and a number of other maternal and child
      health and behavioral outcomes among a sample of young mothers, including maternal substance
      use. The Family Spirit intervention consists of 52 sessions (30-60 minutes in duration)
      delivered during a 39-month intervention phase. All sessions are designed to be taught at the
      participant's home, but they may also occur at another location chosen by the participant
      (e.g. study office, vehicle). Outcome data will be collected at Baseline and at 2 months, 6
      months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months postpartum.
