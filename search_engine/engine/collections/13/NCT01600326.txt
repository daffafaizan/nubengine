      tenotomy with injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Tenotomy is performed by passing a
      needle through the abnormal tendon repeatedly until the needle has passed through all areas
      of the abnormal tendon with softening of the tendon. Tenotomy with PRP injections is
      performed in the same manner but includes an injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the
      tendon. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of tenotomy versus PRP treatment.
