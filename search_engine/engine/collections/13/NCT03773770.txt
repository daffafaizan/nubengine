    
      Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS): Available through
      Intermediate-Size Population Expanded Access.

      The intermediate-size expanded access treatment protocol is intended to provide rapid access
      to triheptanoin for the treatment of seriously ill patients with Glut1 DS.

      Patients will be treated under this protocol for the duration of one year, with consideration
      on a yearly basis for extension of treatment based on the risk-benefit ratio assessed in the
      Treating Physician's quarterly progress reports. Patients may continue to receive
      triheptanoin under this intermediate-size treatment protocol until commercial availability of
      triheptanoin, should the drug receive regulatory approval for the specific disease
      indication.

      Long Chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders (LC-FAOD) and Non-FAOD conditions: Available
      outside of the United States through individual named patient compassionate access requests.

      Expanded access may provide access for treatment prior to approval by the local regulatory
      agency.
