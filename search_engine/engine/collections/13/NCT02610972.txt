      in following women with a clinical diagnosis of preeclampsia and clinically healthy women in
      the postpartum period. Women with preeclampsia (n=100) (cases) and clinically healthy women
      (n=50)(controls) who are hospitalized postpartum will be recruited for the trial. All women
      will be asked to provide a urine sample. Samples will be collected daily during a woman's
      hospitalization. The Congo Red test GV-005 and a standard urine dipstick proteinuria test
      will be performed by a lab technician within 72 hours of sample collection. The purpose of
      this research is to evaluate progression of urine congophilia postpartum by following
      patients diagnosed with preeclampsia and clinically healthy women.
