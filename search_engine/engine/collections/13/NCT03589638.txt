      Intubation procedure during anesthesia application benefits such as airway opening, airway
      and breathing control, aspiration hazard, respiratory effort and dead space reduction,
      surgical comfort and airway control during resuscitation. Laryngoscopy and tracheal
      intubation increases in heart rate, blood pressure and the intraocular pressure. The
      sympathetic-adrenal activity caused by the stimulation of the laryngeal and tracheal tissues
      is responsible for these negative effects. Endotracheal intubation with videolaryngoscopy is
      an alternative method used in airway management. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation under
      general anesthesia and laryngeal mask and airway control techniques cause different
      hemodynamic and catecholamine levels.
