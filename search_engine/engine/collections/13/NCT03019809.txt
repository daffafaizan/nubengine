      compartment is one of major problem in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS),
      especially after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from alternative donor. It
      often leads to the development of severe thrombocytopenia or even transplants rejection. In
      this study the hypothesis is that the use of plerixafor and G-CSF as additional agents in
      conditioning regimen would offers advantages due to lowing risk of mixed chimerism after
      HSCT. This effect is based on the fact that simultaneous use of plerixafor with G-CSF is
      efficient in inducing stem cell release and opening of bone marrow (BM) niches. Moreover,
      stem cell release probably leads to liberation of host stem cells from the anti-apoptotic
      effects of the BM stroma for the more powerful effect of chemotherapy.

      In this study, the investigators use TCR alpha/beta grafts depletion of the grafts as basic
      technology for HSCT from haploidentical and unrelated donors approved in Institution.

      Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of myeloablative
      conditioning with Plerixafor and G-CSF as additional agents for prevention of graft failure
      after transplantation with TCR alpha/beta grafts depletion in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich
      syndrome.
