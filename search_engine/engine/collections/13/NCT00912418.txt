    
      Regimen: A vaccine comprising autologous melanoma cells plus GM-CSF in-adjuvant will be
      administered intradermally at a single dose. Subjects will be vaccinated over at least a 6
      week period (at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6), with responders vaccinated every 4 weeks thereafter
      for a maximum of 9 vaccinations (up to week 18). Systemic low-dose interleukin-2 will also be
      administered daily for 6 weeks following the second vaccination at week 1.

      Concurrent with the first three of these vaccinations, each patient will also receive an
      additional set of 3 vaccinations in a different site, the response to which will be evaluated
      at the draining lymph node. This node will be harvested using lymphatic mapping and sentinel
      node biopsy methods.
