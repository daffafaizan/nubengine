      Alcohol-related risks and problems in older persons may come from the interaction between
      alcohol and diminished health or medication use. The proposed study is a randomized trial of
      the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an integrated patient-provider intervention to
      prevent risky alcohol use among older adults. The intervention will include a tested
      screening and education system that was developed especially for older adults and their
      providers, supplemented by a well-established intervention for physicians. The proposed
      research design involves randomization of 31 primary care physicians in seven clinics and
      their eligible patients aged 60+ to the intervention versus "usual care."
