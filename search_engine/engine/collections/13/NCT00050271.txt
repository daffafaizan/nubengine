      HIV infection and its treatments. NRTIs, particularly dideoxy-NRTIs, represent a significant
      risk factor for developing neuropathy. To date, there are no effective treatments for DSPN.
      Studies of nonneuronal tissues indicate a beneficial effect of ALC in HIV-1 seropositive
      individuals, but the role of ALC levels in patients with DSPN is unclear. Despite conflicting
      data, carnitine and its derivatives are still commonly used.

      Patients will have a screening visit and visits at entry and Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24.
      Patients are required to fast (no food or drink except water) for 4-12 hours for the
      screening visit, entry visit, and at Weeks 12 and 24. Targeted physical examinations, blood
      chemistries, liver function tests, HIV-1 RNA, CD4/CD8 cell counts, hematology, and lactate
      assessments will be done. Patients will also have a small skin biopsy at entry and Week 24.
      Patients will begin with 1 tablet of ALC twice daily and escalate dosage to a target dose of
      3 tablets daily. They will remain on the 3-tablet dose or a maximum tolerated dose for the
      duration of the study (24 weeks).
