      monitored adherence to weighing instructions, and tracked additional behavioral and
      psychosocial indicators over a period of six months. It was hypothesized that there would be
      no differences in mood or adherence between daily versus weekly weighing conditions.
      Knowledge about the benefits of frequent self-weighing may shape public health
      recommendations for regular weighing as a weight reduction or obesity prevention strategy.
