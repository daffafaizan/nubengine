      the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is the most common supraglottic airway device used by the
      anesthesiologists to manage airway during general anesthesia. Use of LMA has some advantages
      when compared to endotracheal intubation, such as quick and ease of placement, a lesser
      requirement for neuromuscular blockade and a lower incidence of postoperative morbidity.
      However, the use of the LMA in laparoscopy is controversial, based on a concern about
      increased risk of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. The ability of these devices to
      provide optimal ventilation during laparoscopic procedures has been also questioned. The most
      important parameter to secure an adequate ventilation and oxygenation for the LMA under
      pneumoperitoneum condition is its seal pressure of airway The BASKA mask is a novel
      supraglottic airway device. It has many of the features of other supraglottic airways, These
      include; A non-inflatable cuff, that it is continuous with the central channel of the device.
      As the pressure increases with positive pressure ventilation, the cuff itself is 'inflated',
      this may improve the seal, reduce leak, and make ventilation more efficient
