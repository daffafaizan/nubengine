      a state of energy, which affects the ability of the embryo to implant in the maternal uterus.
      There is a decrease in the rate of implantation in euploid embryos containing a high number
      of mtDNA copies. It is known that after a certain number of mtDNA copies implantation is
      disrupted even in euploid embryos.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible relationship between the mtDNA
      content contained in developing embryos and the result of implantation in order to evaluate
      the potential of such relationship as a diagnostic tool.

      The number of mtDNA copies present in chromosomally normal embryos will be quantified.
      Subsequently, the transfer of euploid embryos after the randomization will be using either
      routine morphological or MitoScore criteria.

      Study population: women undergoing either IVF or egg donation that go through preimplantation
      genetic screening (PGS) for different indications, either in day 5/6 or day 3.

      This is a triple blinded, randomized, prospective, clinical study where patients with embryos
      analyzed by PGS in blastocyst stage or day 3 and mitochondrial analysis with day 5/6
      transfer, with deferred cycle for those analyzed in day 5/6 and fresh embryo transfer for
      those analyzed in day 3, will be randomized into two groups:

      GROUP A: Embryo selection for transfer will be based initially on chromosomal normality and
      secondly on embryo morphology criteria (specific for IVF lab).

      GROUP B: Embryo selection for transfer will be based initially on chromosomal normality and
      secondly on the MitoScore value, trying to transfer normal embryos containing the lowest
      number of mitochondrial DNA copies.
