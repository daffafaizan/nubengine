    
      This is a single centre randomized, double blind, 2 arm, parallel group pilot study comparing
      all-blood cardioplegia to 4:1 blood cardioplegia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This
      pilot study will support the design of a larger multicentre trial.

      Subjects undergoing cardiac surgery will be randomized to receive either standard of care
      (4:1) or all-blood cardioplegia for myocardial protection. Neither of these cardioplegia
      approaches would be considered investigational. Each is in use at numerous cardiac surgical
      centres around the world. The cardioplegia will be delivered using the Quest medical MPS
      system which is a Health Canada Approved device.

      Clinical endpoints will be evalauted (rate of blood transtransfusion, ICU stay, etcâ€¦). In a
      subset of subjects who meet specific criteria, ventricular function will be evaluated in the
      operating room using the CD Leycom INCA conductance catheter system.
