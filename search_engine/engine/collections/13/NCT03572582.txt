    
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal and prevalent cancers worldwide. The
      prognosis of patients with HCC is dismal and the mortality rates are almost the same as the
      incidence rates.

      The transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used to act locally in the
      intermediate disease stage and is the most common first-line treatment in patients with HCC.
      Early randomized trials and more recent reviews and meta-analyses reported improved survival
      rates of patients with unresectable lesions managed with TACE so that TACE has been accepted
      as the standard treatment for intermediate stage disease. However, outcome of patients
      treated with TACE in real-life cohorts is still very poor with median overall survival (OS)
      of 20 months or less.

      In order to increase the outcome of TACE, several trials have analyzed the combination of
      TACE with sorafenib and other anti-angiogenic agents. However, none of the trials have
      reported an improved overall survival for patients treated with the combination of TACE and
      sorafenib. Early clinical data already support a safe combination of immune checkpoint
      inhibition with TACE. Moreover, preliminary data from the CheckMate-040 trial strongly
      suggest that nivolumab has clinical activity and is tolerable in patients with HCC, including
      those with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TACE in
      combination with nivolumab in patients with intermediate stage HCC.
