      relatedness:

      Regular measurements for patient care will be mainly used as outcome measures. Some of the
      psychological parameters are measured in regular care (e.g. pain score). Other psychological
      parameters will be measured with an additional questionnaire (depression, appetite, delirium,
      sleep quality and sleepiness). A trained research nurse will visit all participating patients
      in their rooms to assist with completing the questionnaires. This way of data collection will
      pose a minimal burden on the patients (maximum 30 minutes on daily basis). The risks of the
      intervention are negligible, because the light level will not exceed outside luminance on a
      cloudy day and meets all CIE safety standards (ref. CIE S009).
