      risk-for-psychosis participants will not be treated by protocol but followed up for two
      years. Those at higher risk will be treated with anti-psychotic, antidepressant and mood
      stabilizing medications by symptom indications, and systematically provided psychoeducational
      multifamily group treatment, supported education and employment, and intensive clinical case
      management, using key elements of Assertive Community Treatment. Both arms of the study will
      be followed for two years and assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months. Outcome measures include
      rates of conversion to psychosis, relapse of psychosis, development of psychotic disorder
      diagnoses, levels of positive, negative and general symptoms, social and vocational
      functioning, family functioning, and neurocognitive functioning.

      The six sites include Sacramento, California; Salem Oregon; and surrounding counties,
      Ypsilanti and Washtenaw County, Michigan; Portland, Maine; Albuquerque, New Mexico and Glen
      Oaks, New York.

      In addition to symptomatic and functional outcomes, impact on incidence of psychotic
      disorders, including schizophrenia, will be assessed, as will cost-benefit effects.
