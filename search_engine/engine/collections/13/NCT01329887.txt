      fulfillment of a strict resuscitation protocol. At the start of the study, a baseline SDF
      measurement is made, when MFI < 2,5 inclusion in the study is permitted and intravenous
      ketanserin administration is started and subsequently increased, guided by the effect on
      sublingual MFI, until a safe maximum dosage is reached. Safety margins for hypotension are
      defined in the study protocol.
