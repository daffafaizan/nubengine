    
      30 babies with Deformational Plagiocephaly due to the congenital muscular torticollis will be
      the participants of the study.

      The subjects will randomly allocate into the two home program groups; first home program
      group was seen once every six weeks (SxW), second home program group was seen once a week
      (OW), by utilizing sealed envelope if babies met the following inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.

      After the initial evaluation, parents will be educate about the same home program which
      consisted of positioning the neck and head, sleep in alternating head positions and in
      side-laying to increase head shape symmetry and place infants, when awake and under
      supervision, regularly in the prone position a day to stimulate normal motor development
      (tummy time), decreasing the time spent in car seat at supine position. Environmental
      settings also will be given to challenge the baby look through from the side no flattening to
      room, place colorful and sonorous toys or mirror on the opposite of the flattening side, and
      stimulate active rotation by communicating with baby from this side. Handling strategies,
      stretching and strengthening exercises will be given CMT. One or two days after the first
      visit the parents will asked to come again and demonstrate how they had implemented the home
      program and what adaptations they had made. The parents will be reinformed if necessary.
      Positioning strategies will spread throughout the day.

      Participants will be allocated to the groups with sealed envelope randomization after parent
      will be given the same home program.
