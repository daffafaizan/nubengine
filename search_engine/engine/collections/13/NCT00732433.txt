      using advanced computer vision techniques and to evaluate the effects of CAD on
      interpretation of digital mammograms (DMs). This system will assist radiologists with the
      four most important areas in mammographic interpretation: (1) detection of masses, (2)
      classification of masses, (3) detection of microcalcifications, (4) classification of
      microcalcifications. The proposed approach is distinctly different from previous approaches
      in that image information from two-view and bilateral mammograms will be fused with that from
      the single-view mammogram to improve lesion detection and characterization.
