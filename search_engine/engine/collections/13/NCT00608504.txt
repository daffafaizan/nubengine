      consequences) than choosing to engage in healthy activities (which have better long-term
      consequences). The present research will be conducted in a controlled laboratory setting with
      heroin abusers who are not seeking treatment to understand what factors guide their choices.

      This research focuses on environmental (i.e. non-medication) factors that affect choosing a
      drug versus money. Findings from this research are likely to be important in developing a
      theoretical and practical basis for behavioral interventions as part of drug abuse treatment.
      HYD is a drug that is currently used as a cough suppressant and to relieve pain.

      Participants in this observational study will take part in multiple trials in which they have
      the opportunity to choose HYD or money. On the first two experimental days, prior to choice
      sessions, participants will receive a sample of the drug doses that can be chosen. During
      test sessions, participants will have 12 opportunities to choose either drug or money.
      Participants will use a computer to earn choices. Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart
      rate, and blood pressure will be monitored throughout choice trials. Self-report
      questionnaires will be completed at different times during the study.

      Participants will be maintained on buprenorphine throughout the study, with a minimum 2-week
      lead before the experiment, and a fixed 3-week detoxification after study completion.
