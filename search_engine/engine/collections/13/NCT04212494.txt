    
      This study is intended to explore the efficacy of thrombus aspiration (TA) in ST-Segment
      Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) patients with high thrombus burden who received
      primary PCI within 12 hours after the onset of symptoms, reducing the incidence of
      cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, target vessel
      revascularization within 180 days or stroke in 30 days.
