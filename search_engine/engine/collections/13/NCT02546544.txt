      reasons for the remarkable single agent efficacy observed in a small subset of patients
      remains unknown, as is the relative lack of efficacy in the majority of patients. There may
      be heterogeneity in response due to partial signal pathway inhibition at the tumour level,
      inherent resistance in ES cells or the presence of alternative pathway activation through
      IR-A receptor signalling.

      Here we aim to establish pharmacodynamic responses in ES tumours using functional imaging
      18FDG-PET-CT and repeat post treatment biopsy for biomarker responses, toxicity and clinical
      outcome to the dual anti-IGF-1R/IR kinase blocking single agent linsitinib.

      This is a single arm phase 2 study utilising adaptive Bayesian analysis. Approximately 40
      patients will be recruited the national bone sarcoma centre in 5 EU countries over 18 months.

      Eligible patients will take 4x 150 mg tablets once a day, days 1-3 of the week followed by 4
      days off - repeated for 3 weeks = one treatment cycle. Patients can remain on treatment for
      as long as they gain clinical benefit.

      The primary objectives are to determine the effect of linsitinib on the patient's tumours in
      terms of changes in biomarker and PET scans and to establish the safety of the trial drug
      (linsitinib) in Ewing sarcoma at the dose and treatment schedule being used in the trial.
