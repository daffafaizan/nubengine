    
      Corona mortis is classically defined as the arterial and/or venous vascular anastomosis
      between the obturator artery and external iliac artery (most commonly the inferior epigastric
      artery) that crosses the posterior aspect of the superior ramus of the symphysis pubis. It
      runs along the posterior aspect of the superior pubic ramus and its laceration can prove life
      threatening in trauma cases or in scheduled operations.

      CMOR is clinically important due to the potential risk of bleeding in pelvic fractures,
      pelvic and acetabular operations, surgery for urinary incontinence, oncologycal pelvic
      dissections and laparoscopic hernia repair. It requires special interests from different
      surgical branches, such as orthopedics, oncologic surgery, urogynecology and general surgery.
      Vascular anatomy of retropubic area, especially CMOR, should be kept in mind by surgeons
      performing laparoscopic surgery for hernia repair. In literature, the anatomical data have
      usually been come from studies performed on cadavers. The aim of this study was to provide in
      vivo knowledge about the presence, type (venous and/or arterial) and size of CMOR in patients
      who underwent TEP repair.

      300 patients will undergo TEP procedure for unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernias. TEP
      procedures will be performed with three ports and one or three skin incisions. The presence
      and type of CMOR will be evaluated, and picture will be made. The size of the CMOR will be
      defined with ruler inserted true the 10 mm port.
