    
      This is a prospective, single arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      fulvestrant as a maintenance hormone therapy after first-line chemotherapy for postmenopausal
      HR positive advanced breast cancer.

      Approximately 58 women who have stable disease or responded to first line chemotherapy with
      at least 4 and less than 8 weeks of treatment for metastatic breast cancer will be enrolled
      to this study and receive fulvestrant 500mg as a maintenance therapy. The treatment will
      continue until the objective disease progression or intolerable AE.

      Efficacy will be determined based on tumor assessments performed by each investigator
      according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ) 1.1. Safety will be
      monitored based on the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade version 4.0.

      Tumor assessments will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) every 12 weeks for all patients until documented evidence of objective disease
      progression.

      Reporting of SAEs (serious adverse events) to regulatory authorities will be done by the
      investigator in accordance with local regulations.
