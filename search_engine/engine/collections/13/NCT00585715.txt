      treatment for skin laxity by increasing dermatofibrosis of the reticular dermis using the
      Candela GentleYAG laser. Treatment areas will be limited to the thighs.

        -  The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the laser for improvement
           in appearance of cellulite.

        -  The secondary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the laser with cooling
           and the laser without cooling for improvement in appearance of cellulite.

      This is an open label trial. Treatment will be conducted on either the left or the right
      thigh, which will be randomly determined. The contra-lateral side will not be treated and
      will serve as a control. A comparison of baseline photographs (prior to treatments) to
      photographs taken 1 and 3 months after the completion of treatments will be conducted.
      Photographic equipment and the protocol for photography will be consistent at each visit.
      Ultrasound may be taken at baseline and at the follow-up visits to evaluate flatness of
      cellulite and dermal fibrosis or enlargement of the reticular dermis. The circumference of
      the area to be treated will be measured with a tape measure, weight/height will be recorded
      and the Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated at baseline and follow-up visits. In
      addition, skin elasticity may be measured at the treatment areas at baseline and follow-up
      visits. The photographs, ultrasound and measurements will be taken using consistent
      procedures at each visit by viewing the baseline photograph and using landmarks such as
      freckles and birthmarks.
