      regular or nicotine-free moist snuff. The metabolic rate is measured measured before the meal
      and then every hour for a total of four hours on each occasion that starts in the morning.
      Participants are also randomized to get red wine or non-alcoholic red wine to the meal. Since
      there are four possible combinations of the wine and the snuff, all participants do the test
      on four occasions. Except for metabolic rate we will also analyze hormone responses regarding
      appetite or hunger.
