      endothelial dysfunction induced by systemic inflammation. At baseline we will measure
      flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and peripheral augmentation index, as well as aortic
      stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV). Volunteers will then receive ~8 mmols of
      dietary nitrate or nitrate free placebo juice once daily for 6 days. After this, depending on
      availability, volunteers will receive a typhoid vaccine Typherix®, GlaxoSmithKline UK or
      Typhim Vi ™, AAH Pharmaceuticals Ltd). This vaccine generates a mild systemic inflammation
      that is associated with vascular dysfunction. All vascular function measures will be repeated
      at 8 hours and 32 hours after vaccine administration.
