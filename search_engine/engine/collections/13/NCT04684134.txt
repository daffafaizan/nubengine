      derivation and validation cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. Demographic and clinicopathological
      characteristics of participants were utilized to develop a prediction model for colorectal
      polyps. In the derivation cohort, the LASSO regression method was applied to filter variables
      and select the most useful high-risk factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was
      used to identify potential predictors and then a prediction model was established. The
      predictive performance of the model was evaluated with respect to its discrimination,
      calibration and clinical usefulness.
