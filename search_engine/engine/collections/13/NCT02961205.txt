      artery disease and valvular heart disease. CVS patients who are malnourished experience
      increased duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, post-operative infections, impaired wound
      healing, muscle wasting, longer lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay,
      higher readmission rates, higher treatment costs and marked increases in mortality. Despite
      the devastating effects of malnutrition in these patients, physicians and health care
      practitioners are poor in respect to identification, monitoring and treatment of
      malnutrition.

      In two large tertiary hospitals in Ontario, this will be a randomized trial of a novel
      nutritional pathway to rapidly identify at-risk CVS patients pre-operatively, and then
      provide oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) during the 30 days prior to surgery, then
      continue supplementation throughout hospitalization until discharge. Meaningful
      patient-centered and economic outcomes will be examined.
