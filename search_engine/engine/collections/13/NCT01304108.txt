      yet it is deployed sub-optimally in many hospitals, including our own. Two prior VTE-P
      improvement projects were completed at Mayo Clinic hospitals, one in the Department of
      Medicine, and the other in selected divisions of the Department of Surgery. Both projects
      resulted in marked improvement in the percentage of patients receiving appropriate VTE-P.
      This project seeks to utilize the lessons learned from these two pilots along with known best
      practices for &quot;spreading&quot; to deploy methods that enhance VTE-P to the entire
      hospitalized population. The investigators seek appropriate VTE-P rates exceeding 95%. This
      began as a quality improvement project. The investigators have taken baseline measures of
      VTE-P rates in our hospitals, intervened with various electronic prompts to use appropriate
      VTE-P, and have and will re-measure VTE-P rates. The investigators intend to present and
      publish our methods and results so that lessons learned may be shared and applied elsewhere.
