      I. To assess the safety and the feasibility of the addition of vorinostat to tacrolimus and
      methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine day 100 grades 2-4 acute GVHD. II. To determine 1-year overall survival and
      relapse-free survival. III. To correlate plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers of
      acute GVHD. IV. To correlate protein acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells before
      and after administration of vorinostat.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -10 to 100. Beginning on
      day -3, patients receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) continuously or PO BID (or
      cyclosporine IV continuously or PO in patients unable to tolerate tacrolimus) with taper on
      days 100-180.Patients also receive methotrexate IV once daily (QD) on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.
