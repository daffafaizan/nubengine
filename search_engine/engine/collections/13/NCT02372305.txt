      expanders and implants in place. There have been few chart review studies comparing outcomes
      between the two materials in breast reconstruction. These studies have determined there is no
      difference in complication rates between the two materials. However, there have never been
      any active studies to date. This study will serve as a randomized controlled trial comparing
      FlexHD and Alloderm. Several outcomes will be measured based off of inclusion and exclusion
      criteria to determine if either product is more suitable for use in breast reconstruction.
      This will be performed by randomly assigning patients to receive either FlexHD or Alloderm.
      Designated outcomes will be followed closely postoperatively. Outcomes will be statistically
      analyzed to determine complication rates between FlexHD and Alloderm and thus which product
      is better to use in breast reconstruction
