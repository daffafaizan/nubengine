      psychological, social and economic impact. The aim of this prospective observational study
      isto investigate the effects of an interdisciplinary multimodal integrated care program in
      patients with chronic migraine and/or tension-type headache.

      158 patients with chronic migraine or tensions-type headache at least five days per month for
      at least 6 months and current intake of triptans (migraine) or analgesic drugs (tension-type
      headache) are eligible. Patients undergo inpatient, outpatient and/or semi-stationary
      treatment including conventional headache diagnostics and therapy as well as traditional
      Chinese medicine, European naturopathy, and mind-body-medicine approaches. Headache frequency
      is defined as the primary outcome; secondary outcomes include pain (visual analog scale, Pain
      Perception Scale), triptans and analgesics use (headache diary), health-related quality of
      life (SF-36), function (Headache Disability Inventory, Patient-specific Functional Scale),
      depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and pain self-efficacy (Pain
      Self-Efficacy Questionnaire). Outcomes are assessed at treatment start, treatment end and 6
      months after treatment end.
