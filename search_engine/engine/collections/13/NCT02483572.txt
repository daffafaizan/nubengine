      for severe destructive behavior. Again, the effectiveness of FCT in treating destructive
      behavior has been demonstrated repeatedly both in the investigators' clinic and in other
      clinics. The investigators are specifically interested in examining the percentage of this
      population that might benefit from FCT, as well as identifying the subject characteristics of
      children for whom FCT is and is not effective.

      Children with an intellectual disability often display severe destructive behaviors (e.g.,
      aggression, self-injury) that pose significant risks to self or others and represent
      overwhelming barriers to community integration. These destructive behaviors are often treated
      with behavioral interventions derived from a functional analysis, which is used to identify
      the environmental antecedents and consequences that occasion and reinforce the destructive
      behavior. One such treatment is called functional communication training (FCT), which
      involves extinction of destructive behavior and reinforcement of an alternative communication
      response with the consequence that previously reinforced destructive behavior. Results from
      epidemiological studies and meta-analyses indicate that treatments based on functional
      analysis, like FCT, typically reduce destructive behavior by 90% or more and are much more
      effective than other treatments. Despite these impressive findings, there have been no
      randomized, controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of FCT. The goal of this study is
      to determine the robustness of FCT in reducing severe destructive behavior as compared to a
      waitlist control group.
