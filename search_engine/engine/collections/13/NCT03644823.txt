      treatment with a PD1-inhibitor is indicated according to national guidelines. Patients will
      be treated with a check-point inhibitor combined with radiotherapy (6 Gy x 3) towards lesions
      (1-2). Atezolizumab is available and reimbursed in the public health system. The radiotherapy
      dosing is significantly lower than standard stereotactic radiotherapy, and is in accordance
      with other studies reported in ClinicalTrials.gov. Such a fractionation will putatively
      induce immunogenic cell death, while being a safe treatment, not likely to induce significant
      side effects.

      Whereas the primary endpoint in our clinical study will be toxicity, the secondary endpoints
      include response rates, overall survival, safety and tolerability, quality of life,
      progression-free survival and duration of response. In addition, exploratory endpoints will
      include immunological response, tumor evolution and dynamics in the tumor microenvironment
      during treatment, imaging, and biomarkers of clinical response.
