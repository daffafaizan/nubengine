      alone or in combination with clobetasol, will produce histological and molecular effects
      distinguishable from vehicle in human skin. Specifically, the study will focus on regulation
      of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid production and degradation in human skin, by
      steroid hormone receptors that are activated by estrogen or clobetasol. The sites to be
      treated will be buttock, hip, forearm, or facial skin. Subjects will receive between one to
      twelve vehicle (matching solution without any active ingredients), estrogen, and/or
      clobetasol topical applications. Skin biopsies of treated areas will be obtained at baseline
      and at subsequent timepoints. The study will last up to two weeks. Endpoints will include
      protein and mRNA levels of collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, and other components of skin
      connective tissue. In addition, we will perform cDNA microanalysis to determine
      estrogen/clobetasol target genes in human skin. The results from our studies will provide new
      knowledge regarding the molecular basis of skin aging. This new knowledge will enable
      development of new ways to improve the function of aged skin.
