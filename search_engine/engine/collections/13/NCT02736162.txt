      secondary monotherapy at approximately 40 centers in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Primary
      monotherapy is defined as the administration of perampanel in the absence of any concomitant
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Secondary (conversion) monotherapy is defined as the conversion
      of perampanel from adjunctive therapy to monotherapy by withdrawing concomitant AEDs.
