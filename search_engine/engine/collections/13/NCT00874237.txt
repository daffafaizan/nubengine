    
      Primary Objective: To assess the maximum effect of Staccato Loxapine on cardiac
      repolarization (QTc interval duration) at the anticipated maximum clinical dose compared to
      placebo in healthy volunteers.

      Secondary Objective: To assess the QTc versus loxapine concentration relationship following
      treatment with Staccato Loxapine in healthy volunteers.
