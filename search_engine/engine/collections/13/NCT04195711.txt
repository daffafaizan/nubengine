      two novel objective devices according to AAPOS Uniform guidelines. Following the refractive,
      alignment and sensory testing, cycloplegic refraction was performed 30 or more minutes after
      cyclopentolate 1% drops. In cooperative patients, sensory tests including Worth 4-dot, Stereo
      Fly and "PDI Check" were performed to characterize binocularity. For younger patients,
      binocular function was estimated by Bruckner Test, 4- base out prism cover and the CR corneal
      reflex component of "2WIN" photoscreener ("Adaptica," Padova Italy).

      Each patient was screened with a recently commercially released blinq screener according to
      manufacturer's recommendations. If an initial interpretation of "pass" or "refer" was not
      achieved, then repeat efforts with "timed out" or "inconclusive" were accomplished and
      results evaluated as if a "refer." An example of blinq birefringent screening is shown in
      [video].

      Patients were screened with the binocular infrared autorefractor "2WIN" according to
      manufacturer guidelines. Refractive referral criteria were not age-stratified.

      The "Rebion blinq" is a unique screening method and therefore we sought to provide
      appropriate validation. In addition to non-age stratified AAPOS 2003 Uniform guidelines, we
      collected all cases characterized by constant or persistent strabismus whether large- or
      small angle employing cover test, 4 base out test, Bruckner Test and "2WIN CR" function. We
      did not employ any method of retinal videographic analysis of fixation instability.
