    
      The goal of our study is to look for a correlation between plasmatic zonulin and increased
      colonic permeability (assessed by the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins by
      western blot) in IBS patients and to look for a role of intestinal low-grade inflammation and
      microbiota.

      Population :

      IBS patients with diarrhoea or IBS with constipation or mixed with worsening of symptoms

      Outcomes measures :

      Plasmatic zonulin (ELISA kit) Occludin expression in colonic biopsies (western blot)
