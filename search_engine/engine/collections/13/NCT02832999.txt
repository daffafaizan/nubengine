      Liraglutide, and inhibitors of Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4i) that prolong the half-life of
      endogenous GLP1 such as Vildagliptin. It remains unclear which of the two strategies
      (exogenous GLP1 or prolonging half-life of endogenous GLP1) have better short term effect on
      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in people living with type 2 diabetes.

      This study aims to investigate the short-term metabolic effects of a GLP-1 analog Liraglutide
      versus a DPP4i Vildagliptin. It is a randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial.
      Study population consists of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (HbA1c≥7%) under
      mono or bi oral anti-diabetic therapy, naïve of any incretinomimetic treatment. Participants
      are randomized in 2 arms. The intervention in arm 1 consists of add-on subcutaneous
      Liraglutide at 0.6mg/day for 1 week increased to 1.2mg the second week. In the second arm, it
      consists of oral Vildagliptine at 100mg daily for two weeks. The primary outcome is the
      variation in euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp-derived insulin sensitivity before
      randomization and the day after intervention, secondary outcomes include 14-day changes in
      insulin secretion during a mixed meal tolarance test, body weight and body composition, and
      an indirect calorimetry measured resting energy expenditure. Changes from baseline to 14 days
      in serum creatinine and alanine amino transferase, C-reactive protein and lipid profile will
      also be recorded.
