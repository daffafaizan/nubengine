      generation maternal pedigree 13 years ago, there has been increasing support for our
      hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the etiology of Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and the overlapping Metabolic Syndrome (MS). With this study we are
      planning an extensive investigation of defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
      (OXPHOS) caused potentially by deleterious sequence variants in the mitochondrial DNA
      (mtDNA). As the primary objective we are trying to further substantiate 2 hypotheses: 1) that
      these diabetogenic mtDNA variants, which are proposed to range from recent, relatively
      severe, mutations will result in substantial OXPHOS defects with familial DM & MS and 2) that
      ancient, relatively mild polymorphisms result in partial OXPHOS defects and an increase in
      the risk to develop DM & MS.
