      fifteen Wound Care Centers and Hospitals across the United States of America. Patients will
      be selected to receive standard wound care or standard wound care plus Natrox Oxygen Wound
      Therapy for their wounds. Patients will be monitored for 12 weeks. The primary comparator
      between the groups will be complete wound healing at 12 weeks, but other parameters will be
      assessed, such as pain, wound size reduction and infection status.
