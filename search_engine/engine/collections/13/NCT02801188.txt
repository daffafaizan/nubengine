      one of the most important causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality when it is
      insufficiently treated pain. Pain induces neuroendocrine stress response causing problems
      like as reduction in vital capacity, pneumonia, tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial
      ischemia and even infarction. These problems can be prevented by successful management of
      postoperative pain.

      In patients with proximal femoral fracture, the use of paravertebral blockade produces
      reliable level of analgesia without need for additional nursing skills or monitoring in the
      postoperative period. Paravertebral blockade by injection local anesthetic solution alongside
      the vertebral column produces ipsilateral analgesia.

      Currently available local anesthetics as bupivacaine may not provide reliable periods of
      analgesia resulting in block resolution before the period of worst postoperative pain. The
      use of a large volume of local anesthetic is one of methods to overcome this problem that may
      lengthen the duration of analgesia but at increased risk of local anesthetic toxicity. Adding
      adjuvants is another potential alternative.

      Dexmedetomidine, a selective Î± 2 agonist, has been used to prolong the duration of analgesia
      of nerve blocks. Dexmedetomidine has also been reported to enhance central and peripheral
      nerve blockade. Alpha adrenoceptors located at the nerve endings have a possible role in the
      analgesic mechanisms by preventing norepinephrine release. The spinal mechanism is the
      principle mechanism for the analgesic action of dexmedetomidine.
