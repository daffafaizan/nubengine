      acute phase (phase I) in which all the participants receive active high-frequency stimulation
      during 4 blocks of five consecutive working days (Monday to Friday) in an open-label design
      and a maintenance phase (phase II) in which responders (> 49% HDRS-17 reduction from
      baseline) at the end of the phase I are randomized in two arms with sham or active
      high-frequency rTMS maintenance treatment for the eleven following months. The rhythm of rTMS
      sessions in this maintenance phase is gradually reduced as follows: 3 sessions per week for 2
      weeks, 2 session per week for the 2 following weeks, 1 session per week the third (M3) and
      fourth month (M4) and then 1 session every fortnight the last eight months (M5 to M12).
