      I. To determine the anti tumour activity of UCN-01 in combination with topotecan in patients
      with SCLC who relapsed or progressed >= 3 months after completing first-line platinum-based
      chemotherapy (patient with sensitive disease) using objective response rates (complete and
      partial).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the anti tumour activity of UCN-01 in combination with topotecan with regards
      to stable disease rate, median and overall survival rates as well as to determine the safety
      and tolerability of this combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)
      receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or PR.

      Patients are followed for survival.
