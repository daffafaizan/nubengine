      Although there is a validated score (the CMTNS) which measures disease severity for CMT, it
      is not always applicable to children due to their limited ability to relay information about
      their symptoms. The CMTPeds scale is being developed and validated in order to measure
      disease severity in children and have outcome measures available for future clinical trials.
      Children (defined as 21 and under) being evaluated will be asked to perform functional tasks
      such as using stairs, walking in a hallway, and performing hand function tests. This
      information will be used to validate the CMTPeds score. It is important to have validated
      instruments to measure disease severity in childhood so these can be used with clinical
      treatment trials are available.
