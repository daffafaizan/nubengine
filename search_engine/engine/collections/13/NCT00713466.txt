      Medical Student Medical Education (COMSEP) and has been very well received by both medical
      students and faculty. The program is a comprehensive Internet-based learning method designed
      for use by third year medical students during their pediatric rotation. More than 80 medical
      schools in the US and Canada have been successfully using the CLIPP cases with an estimated
      3000 to 4000 cases being reviewed by students weekly. All third year medical students will be
      required to complete specific cases, based on gaps identified through review of prior student
      contact logs. Using the students' own patient contact logs, they will also be strongly
      encouraged to complete any cases for which they have not met the clerkship requirement.
      Students will be allowed to complete any other cases they choose. The study proposes that by
      utilizing CLIPP cases in the pediatric rotation, student exposure to essential pediatric
      conditions will increase, thereby increasing retention of knowledge and increasing their
      performance on end of clerkship OSCEs (Observed Structured Clinical Exam) and on NBME
      Pediatric Subject Exam (shelf exam).
