        1. Determine the feasibility of virtual reality training in children with neuromuscular
           disease.

        2. To determine the effect of virtual reality, biofeedback training, and conventional
           rehabilitation on functional levels and balances of children with neuromuscular disease.

        3. To compare the motivation of children with neuromuscular disease to virtual reality,
           biofeedback training, and conventional rehabilitation.
