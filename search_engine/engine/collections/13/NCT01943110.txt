    
      This study is a preliminary device safety and performance evaluation in healthy adult
      volunteers (ages 18-55 years).

      Each participant will receive six injections of 0.1 ml of sterile saline solution into the
      skin:

        -  Upper deltoid with the side-load ID adapter

        -  Upper deltoid with the autodisable (AD) ID adapter

        -  Suprascapular (behind the shoulder) with the side-load ID adapter

        -  Suprascapular with the AD ID adapter

        -  Forearm with the side-load ID adapter

        -  Forearm with the AD ID adapter

      Intradermal administration of each injection will be assessed:

        -  The liquid remaining on the surface of the skin will be blotted with absorbent paper and
           the amount of liquid present will be recorded.

        -  The formation of an intradermal wheal will be observed, and the diameter of the wheal
           measured using a ruler or similar measurement tool.

        -  A photo of the injection site will be taken.

      Injections will be assessed for safety by observation of injection sites for any local
      adverse events.
