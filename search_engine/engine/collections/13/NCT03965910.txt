      stroke who met the study criteria were divided into two groups depending on the duration of
      their stroke at the time of their presentation to our facility. Group 1 consisted of patients
      who underwent rehabilitation program within the first 1-4 weeks after stroke, whereas Group 2
      consisted of patients who underwent rehabilitation program within 5-8 weeks after stroke.
      Both groups were evaluated using the BRS, FMA scale, FAC and BI scales. For cranial imaging,
      DTI was obtained 1 day before and 1 day after treatment. FA and ADC values of corticospinal
      tracts were performed using DTI.

      Intervention: Patients were enrolled in a rehabilitation program, which was designed for a
      total of 4 weeks, with daily sessions lasting a total of 1 h on 5 days of a week.
