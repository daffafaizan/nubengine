      to promote the discharge of mucus from the respiratory passages in patients with chronic
      bronchitis (COPD). Alleviated discharge of mucus should ease breathing, improve subjective
      wellbeing, reduce inflammation in the air passages and improve lung function.

      Determine the magnitude of the effect of Tacholiquine ® compared to saline (0.9%) in chronic
      bronchitis patients. Lung function parameters, biomarker profiles in sputum and serum, and
      clinical symptoms and quality of life by standardized questionnaires [COPD activity index
      (CAT), Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) & Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), St George's respiratory
      Quality of Life Questionnaire] will be evaluated in response to Tacholiquine ® vs. saline at
      day one and at end of treatment.
