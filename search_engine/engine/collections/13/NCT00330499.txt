      choice for patients referred for bladder preservation, the study by the NCI of Canada (Coppin
      CM, Gospodarowicz MK et al.Improved Local Control of Invasive Bladder Cancer by Concurrent
      Cisplatin and Pre-operative or Definitive Radiation.J. of Clinical Oncol. 14(11): 2901-2907,
      1996) is the only randomised trial to show some superiority of concurrent Cisplatin and
      radiation treatment over radiation alone in increasing pelvic tumour control. There was no
      impact on overall survival. However, this study had relatively small subject numbers and
      included two distinct treatment options. In one group the patients were treated with a
      bladder sparing approach and in the other by pre-operative therapy and cystectomy with the
      type of definitive treatment being decided upon by both the treating Specialist and patient.
      At 5 years the pelvic failure rates in the radiation alone and chemo-radiation arms were 59%
      and 40% respectively. With half of the patients in each group having had planned cystectomy
      as part of their treatment regimen, the above rates of local relapse (especially in the
      chemo-radiation arm) are disappointing.

      Given the concerns with the above study, and the continuing paucity of randomised phase III
      studies comparing chemo-radiation with radiation alone, there lies an opportunity for
      Australasian centres to take up the challenge. For this study, the proposed schedule for the
      chemo-radiation arm is to be the same as that being investigated in our previous phase II
      study (six weekly doses of Cisplatin plus radiation to a dose of 64Gy in 32 fractions over
      6.5 weeks). This will be compared with radical radiation alone (64Gy in 32 fractions over 6.5
      weeks).
