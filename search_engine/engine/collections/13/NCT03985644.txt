      cancer-related deaths worldwide. Among all the liver cancer cases, hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) constitutes 75-85%. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for HCC and
      is in high demand in China. The advent of Milan criteria has helped to select the recipients
      reasonably. However, the organ allocation system driven by the Milan criteria seemed to be
      too strict so that many centers worldwide have expanded the criteria in the aspects of
      morphological features, histopathology and biomarkers. Hangzhou criteria introduce the
      covariables of histopathologic grading and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) into the selection of
      recipients for the first time. Based on the multi-center HCC patient cohort undergoing
      transplantation, this study aims to characterize an ideal candidate selecting system beyond
      the Milan criteria.
