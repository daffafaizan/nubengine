      independent of race and ethnicity. A time of particular vulnerability for excess weight gain
      in low-income youth is the summer. Findings from three separate low-income populations show
      that BMI z-scores (BMIz) decrease during the school year and increase during the summer in
      this population. To address this and aid in national obesity prevention efforts, the
      Institute of Medicine and the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity recommend increased
      access to the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), a federally-funded program that provides a
      free, healthy lunch meal to youth during the summer. However, participation in the SFSP is
      low. Based on qualitative work with families from low-income communities, this pilot trial is
      designed to test the acceptability and and preliminary efficacy of the BOKS program, an
      evidence-based physical activity curriculum that engages school-age children in moderate to
      vigorous physical activity for one hour daily, when offered alongside the USDA's Summer Food
      Service Program during the summer. Specifically, 80 children, ages 6-12 years and from
      low-income households, will be randomized to participate in the BOKS + SFSP program or to the
      SFSP alone. To test acceptability of the combined program versus the SFSP alone, we will
      compare SFSP participation (attendance) across groups. Additionally, we will examine physical
      fitness levels in both groups to determine if participation in the BOKS program prevents the
      loss of fitness gains achieved during the school year.
