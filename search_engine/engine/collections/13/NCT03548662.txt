      platelet rich plasma injection followed by rehabilitative exercise. The specific aim of this
      study is to determine the outcomes of treatment of partial thickness rotator cuff tears with
      platelet rich plasma (PRP) and rehabilitative exercise. Subjects with partial thickness
      rotator cuff tears will be designated to receive an injection of PRP or hyaluronic acid,
      followed by rehabilitative exercise. Shoulder function and tendon healing will be evaluated
      using the patient surveys as well as ultrasound. Subjects will be followed for 3 months to
      determine the outcomes of the treatment.

      The hypothesis is that there is no difference in healing rate or functional outcomes in
      patients treated with PRP injections plus rehabilitative exercise compared with hyaluronic
      acid injection plus rehabilitative exercise for the treatment of partial thickness rotator
      cuff tears.
