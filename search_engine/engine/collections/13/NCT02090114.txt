      Eligible patients will continue on androgen ablative therapy with LHRH agonist (i.e. Zoladex,
      Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron) if not surgically castrated to suppress endogenous testosterone
      production. Patients will also receive intramuscular injection with either testosterone
      cypionate or testosterone enanthate at a dose of 400 mg every 28 days. This dosing scheme was
      designed to produce rapidly fluctuating serum testosterone levels from the supraphysiologic
      to the near-castrate range (i.e. Bipolar Androgen Therapy [BAT]). Assessments for response to
      testosterone will be made approximately every 3 months. Upon displaying evidence of
      progression, patients will then go on to receive either abiraterone (Cohort B) or
      enzalutamide (Cohort A), whichever agent they had previously progressed on prior to study
      enrollment. Patients in Cohort C will remain on LHRH agonist therapy and receive no
      additional androgen ablative hormonal therapy while those in the mutation-positive Cohort D
      will receive enzalutamide regardless of prior therapy.
