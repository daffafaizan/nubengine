      exercise program vs. waitlist control on cancer-related outcomes in 200 cancer survivors.
      Participants will undergo baseline testing at Dana-Farber or Yale, including administration
      of questionnaires to assess quality of life and the presence of cancer and treatment-related
      symptoms, fasting blood draw, and evaluation of body composition (using dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA). Participants will then take part in the 12-week LIVESTRONG Program or
      will be assigned to a wait-list control group. All measurements will be repeated at
      Dana-Farber or Yale after the 12-week exercise program or control period.
