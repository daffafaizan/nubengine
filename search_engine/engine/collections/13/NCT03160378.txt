      used to address difficulties with time management and organization of materials in children
      with ADHD, that tend to persist despite medication and behavioral treatments. This randomized
      clinical superiority trial is going to investigate the effect of Organizational Skills
      Training, a group treatment approach for parents and children. The program is also involving
      a computerized program, vTime, that will help the children manage time more effectively. A
      total of 98 children with ADHD aged 6-13 years is expected to be randomized to either
      intervention or control group in a single blind design. Both groups will receive
      treatment-as-usual. The intervention group is going to participate in a group training for
      parents and children for 10 weekly sessions.
