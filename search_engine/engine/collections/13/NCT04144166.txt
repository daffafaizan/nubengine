    
      A new technology, capillary refill index (CRI), to assess peripheral perfusion status
      quantitatively using pulse oximeter waveforms is being developed. The conventional capillary
      refill time (CRT) is widely used in clinical settings as a gold standard to assess peripheral
      perfusion.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the capability of CRI to predict altered
      peripheral perfusion determined with the conventional CRT test. Predictive capability of CRI
      needs to be assessed to achieve a goal to provide clinicians with an alternative method to
      the conventional CRT.
