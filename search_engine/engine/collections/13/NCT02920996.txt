    
      This is an open-label, phase II study of merestinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with a
      MET exon 14 mutation or patients with advanced cancer harboring an NTRK1, 2, or 3
      rearrangement. Twenty patients with a MET mutation will be evaluated in a single-arm design.
      A small separate cohort of 5 NTRK patients will be evaluated for exploratory purposes.

      Merestinib (LY2801653) is a small molecule that has been shown in vitro to be a reversible
      type II ATP-competitive inhibitor of MET. Pre-clinical testing also has shown merestinib to
      inhibit several other receptor tyrosine oncokinases including MST1R, FLT3, AXL, MERTK, TEK,
      ROS1, NTRK1/2/3, and DDR1/2 and the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2.
