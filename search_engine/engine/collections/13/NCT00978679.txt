      to have potential in retarding myopic progression. The central cornea is flattened and
      peripheral optics altered in orthokeratology and it has been suggested that orthokeratology
      slows myopic progression through the alteration of peripheral optics. The aim of the current
      study is to investigate the changes in peripheral refraction and aberration in children
      wearing orthokeratology (study group) and single-vision spectacles (control group).
