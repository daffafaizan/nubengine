      RASM. Furthermore it will permit to detect potential emerging risks related to safety on the
      basis of eventual clinical evidence, through the observation of patients who have undergone
      microsurgical reconstructions using the RASM Surgical System in the usual setting of standard
      surgical practice after the introduction of RASM to the market.
