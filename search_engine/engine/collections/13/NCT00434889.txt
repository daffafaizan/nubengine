      community dwelling older adults with early-stage dementia; determine which potentially
      modifiable physical fall risk factors contribute to falls and near-falls in older adults with
      early-stage dementia; examine the relationship between dementia sub-type, medical and
      neuropsychological factors, balance and gait, and falls and near-falls in community dwelling
      older adults with early-stage dementia.
