    
      This project will recruit 100 rare, undiagnosed pediatric genetic disease families (core
      families: patients, patients' parents, immediate family members such as brothers and sisters,
      all of them can be enrolled whether they have disease or not, so generally 3, for a few cases
      4 or 5) all over the country. The expert team will review the clinical materials, the
      molecular team will review the experimental process, and the bioinformatics team will review
      the chip, the analysis of whole exome sequencing data and screen the samples all over the
      country;

      Whole-genome sequencing of 100 rare, undiagnosed pediatric genetic disease families (Illumina
      NovaSeq High-throughput Sequencer);

      The study will provide preliminarily performance data on the comparison of whole exome data
      and whole genome data. In addition, it will generate the Chinese Consensus on Clinical
      Applications of Whole-genome sequencing in the Diagnosis of Birth Defects and Undiagnosed
      Rare Genetic Diseases in Children based on the statistical analysis of clinical phenotype and
      genotype association, which could guide the clinical application of pediatrics, laboratory
      testing and reporting.
