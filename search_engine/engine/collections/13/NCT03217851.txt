      Plasmodium. Of the five species of Plasmodium that infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum is
      the most deadly and is responsible for the majority of malaria disease and death. Every year,
      falciparum malaria causes disease in hundreds of millions of people living in the tropics and
      subtropics, killing a million or more according to some estimates. The vast majority of these
      deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly among young children and infants. When treated
      with effective antimalarial drugs, malaria can be cured completely.

      Antimalarial drug resistance The emergence in Southeast Asia and the subsequent global spread
      of drug resistant malaria was a major factor contributing to the failure of the first global
      malaria eradication campaign in the mid-20th century (1). The widespread implementation of
      highly effective artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria has contributed to
      significant gains in global control and elimination efforts and has brought malaria
      eradication back on the agenda, 40 years after the first global malaria eradication campaign
      was abandoned (2). However the gains seen in the past decade are now at risk as parasite
      resistance to artemisinin compounds has been confirmed in Southeast Asia and threatens Africa
      once again (3-8). In the absence of effective vaccines, it is critical to prolong the usable
      life of antimalarial drugs by judicious implementation of treatment strategies.

      Primary Objective To measure prevalence of established and candidate molecular markers of
      drug resistant malaria in Greater Mekong Subregion

      Secondary Objective To map the geographical and temporal changes in prevalence of molecular
      markers of antimalarial drug resistance in Greater Mekong Subregion
