      label fashion for eight weeks (± 2 weeks) prior to randomization. Participants will receive
      monthly medical evaluations (every 4 ± 2 weeks) where they will have height and weight
      measurements, medical history, physical examination, and medication adherence assessments.
      During these monthly visits complete blood counts with absolute reticulocyte count will be
      monitored. Hemoglobin electrophoresis, complete serum chemistries, urinalysis, lactate
      dehydrogenase and quality of life measurements will be obtained every 20 (±2) weeks.
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound velocities will be obtained at study entry (in
      participants ≥2 years of age) and study exit. Participants randomized to receive hydroxyurea
      at MTD will have their dose increased by 5 mg/kg/day every 8 weeks, in the absence of
      toxicity, until a goal ANC of 1500-3000 cells/µL is achieved, up to a maximum of 35
      mg/kg/day.

      Both groups will receive their assigned treatment for 48 weeks (± 3 weeks). Participants will
      be in the study for a total of 56 weeks (± 3 weeks) and have 14 clinic visits to the St. Jude
      outpatient Hematology Clinic during that time. After the 56 weeks, participants will be
      followed for an additional 30 days for side effects and will then be taken off study.
