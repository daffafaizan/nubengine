      Primary

        -  To evaluate the effects of glutamate receptor blockade with riluzole on cellular
           pathways important in the genesis and progression of disease in women with stage I-IIIA
           breast cancer by examining components of the mGluR1 signaling pathway in the pre- and
           post-treatment tumor samples to determine if glutamate blockade affects signaling
           through this pathway.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether treatment with riluzole affects the proliferation and apoptosis in
           a manner suggesting a potential for therapeutic effectiveness.

        -  To determine whether treatment with riluzole causes objectively measurable tumor
           shrinkage.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral riluzole twice daily on days -14 to 0. Approximately 12 hours
      after completion of riluzole therapy patients undergo standard surgery (i.e., partial or
      total mastectomy) along with sentinel lymph node biopsy (for patients with node-negative
      disease) or full axillary dissection (for patients with node-positive disease) on day 0.

      Patients undergo 3-dimensional image assessment at pre- and post-treatment by Computerized
      Ultrasound Risk Evaluation (C.U.R.E.).

      Patients undergo core needle biopsy at baseline and during surgery for biomarker analysis
      (e.g., mGluR1) by IHC, western blotting, and RT-PCR. Blood samples are collected for GRM1
      polymorphism analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then
      according to standard-of-care thereafter.
