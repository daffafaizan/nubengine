      illuminate the area of study with light in the near infrared spectrum, then obtains static
      images of tissue structure from interference signals of the back-reflected light.

      Optical Coherence Tomography a non-contact, non-invasive means of documenting both tissue
      structure and blood flow changes in ocular disease and can provide high resolution
      cross-sectional images of tissue structure, direct visualization of blood flow in blood
      vessels of the eye.
