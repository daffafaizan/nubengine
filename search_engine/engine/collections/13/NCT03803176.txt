      periodontally healthy volunteers, Group II (Chronic Periodontitis Group): 20 patients
      suffering severe CP and Group III (Treated Group): 20 patients who were scheduled for OFD.
      Gingival samples were collected from all subjects at baseline and at 3 months after OFD from
      the CP patients. Then, Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides were examined and gene
      expression levels of t-PA and PAI-1 were measured in the gingiva through quantitative reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
