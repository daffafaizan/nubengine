      craniovertebral junction (CVJ) coupled with CSF flow studies. The studies will assess changes
      in CSF flow velocities that are associated with with changing position of the neck at the CVJ
      and aqueduct of Sylvius.

      Eligible patients include those with Chiari 1 malformations and similar malformations to the
      CVJ. This malformation lead to inherent instability in this region and symptoms such as
      headaches, dizziness, neck pain and other neurological problems. This study will determine if
      there is any correlation of these MRI findings to clinical outcome.
