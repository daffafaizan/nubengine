      resection in patients who are medically fit to tolerate an operation. Recent data now
      suggests that stereotactic radiotherapy may be a suitable alternative. This includes the
      results from a pooled analysis of two incomplete phase III studies that reported a 15%
      overall survival advantage with stereotactic radiotherapy at 3 years. While these data are
      promising, the median follow-up period was short, the results underpowered, and the findings
      were in contradiction to multiple retrospective studies that demonstrate the outcomes with
      surgery are likely equal or superior. Therefore, the herein trial aims to evaluate these two
      treatments in a prospective randomized fashion with a goal to compare the overall survival
      beyond 5 years. It has been designed to enroll patients who have a long life-expectancy, and
      are fit enough to tolerate an anatomic pulmonary resection with intraoperative lymph node
      sampling.

      This study is designed to open at Veterans Affairs medical centers with expertise in both
      treatments. The recruitment process includes shared decision making and multi-disciplinary
      evaluations with lung cancer specialists. Mandatory evaluations before randomization include
      tissue confirmation of NSCLC, staging with FDG-PET/CT, and biopsies of all hilar and/or
      mediastinal lymph nodes >10mm that have a SUV >2.5. Pre-randomization elective lymph node
      sampling is strongly encouraged, but not required. Following treatment, patients will be
      followed for a minimum of 5 years.
