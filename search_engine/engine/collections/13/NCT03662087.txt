      leukemia, but relapse is the most common problem affecting long-term survivors of allo-HSCT.
      Therapy options for relapse include stopping immune suppression, re-induction of
      chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) or combination therapy. One method of solving
      relapse is to intervene before hematologic or pathologic relapse occurs based on minimal
      residual disease (MRD) . DLI is an effective post-transplantation therapy based on MRD for
      relapse. Whether combination of hypomethylating agents (HMA) and DLI could improve outcomes
      remains unclear. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and efficacy of
      HMA+DLI and DLI preemptive therapy based on minimal residual disease in acute leukemia
      undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
