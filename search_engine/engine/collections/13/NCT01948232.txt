      cardiac dysfunction. Since ventricular remodeling in other types of heart failure can be
      treated effectively with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), these agents
      would appear a logical therapy in children with anthracycline-induced heart failure. Previous
      experience with ACEi in childhood cancer survivors has shown mixed results, possibly due to
      the fact that treatment is initiated too late in the natural history of the disease.
      Providing treatment in childhood cancer survivors with early signs of cardiac remodeling may
      be more effective than treating children who have global dysfunction. The benefits of early
      intervention are unclear, so it is unclear whether CCS and their parents will be willing to
      receive treatment where the target outcome (prevention of decreased global function or
      congestive heart failure) may not occur for years after the intervention. Assessing the
      feasibility of this pre-emptive approach is the primary aim of the study.
