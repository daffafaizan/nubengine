      impact of radical trachelectomy in comparison to the standard treatment of radical
      hysterectomy in women with early stage cervical cancer over a two year time period. Women
      being considered for radical trachelectomy with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy or
      radical hysterectomy (abdominal, laparoscopic or schauta) will be approached for study
      participation prior to undergoing surgery. After providing informed consent, participants
      will be given a survey questionnaire pre-operatively and asked to complete follow-up surveys
      post-operatively at follow up medical appointments at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18
      months and 24 months. We will assess the following domains in these women; mood, sexual
      functioning, and quality of life in addition to issues of fertility and treatment choice. The
      survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. The findings will be used to provide
      additional information to women considering these procedures and enable future interventions
      to be designed to meet any identified needs. In addition, the findings of this study will
      also be presented for consideration of a multi-center feasibility study.
