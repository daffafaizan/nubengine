      Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) intervention, demonstrated to be effective in reducing
      distress, enhancing coping, and maintaining health among HIV+ non-drug abusers (see
      Schneiderman and Antoni, 2000), can be effectively adapted for our target population of
      culturally diverse, HIV+, low-income "Recovering Drug Abusers" (RDAs). Since the late 1980s,
      members of our research team (i.e., Schneiderman, Antoni, Klimas, Fletcher) have been
      developing, refining and evaluating the effects of CBSM among HIV+ Men who have Sex with Men
      (MSM). In the early/mid 90s, we began to adapt and evaluate the effects of CBSM in other
      non-drug abusing subgroups that were emerging with increasing levels of HIV seroprevalence
      (e.g., pregnant women, African American and Hispanic men and women). After accumulating
      considerable support for the effectiveness of CBSM in these subgroups in the late 90s, our
      research team (i.e., Malow, Schneiderman, Antoni, Klimas, Page) turned its attention to
      developing the CBSM for one of the most neglected and understudied populations affected by
      the HIV/AIDS epidemic in this country: "inner city" minority drug abusers. With supplemental
      funding on two NIH grants to conduct formative stage1 pilot research, our project team has
      been able to develop and document the feasibility and potential promise of the CBSM approach
      adapted/translated for RDAs (CBSM-RDA). This application proposes to take the next logical
      step in continuing this work: conducting a 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12 month follow-up outcome study
      comparing CBSM-RDA with a matched attention, time and interest value Health Promotion
      Comparison (HPC) condition, in 225 male and 225 female HIV+ RDAs with respect to key
      biopsychosocial health endpoints: distress (i.e., depressive symptoms, and mood state),
      quality of life, drug abuse relapse, unsafe sex, Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (CART)
      medication adherence and health status indicators (e.g., Viral Load, CD4 count, physical
      symptoms).
