      Due to underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical trials there is a lack of evidence
      to select the optimal treatment strategy for these patients. Concurrent radiochemotherapy
      (RCHT) has been recognised as the standard treatment of stage III NSCLC patients with a good
      performance status. Evidence for this treatment was gained in clinical trials that mostly
      excluded elderly patients. Furthermore, the survival gain obtained with combined RCHT, comes
      with a significant increase in toxicity. Therefore, information on benefits and harms of
      intensified treatment with concurrent RCHT among a subpopulation of medically fit elderly
      patients is still lacking. Moreover, reliable tools are needed to distinguish the subgroup of
      fit patients from frail patients, i.e. those expected to experience important toxicity.
