      regadenoson (LexiscanÂ®) will be recruited to participate in the study. Following regadenoson
      (administered as part of a stress routine test protocol) participants will receive either
      aminophylline (75 mg - intravenously) or a matching inactive placebo (sterile salt water)
      injection. Participants will be surveyed for gastrointestinal symptoms and other side effects
      related to regadenoson. The frequency and severity of such side effects will be compared
      between the two study groups (aminophylline vs. placebo).
