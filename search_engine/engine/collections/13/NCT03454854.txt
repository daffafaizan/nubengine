      evaluate the intelligent terminal APP, establish a new pattern based on dynamic risk
      evaluation and event-triggered response, settle the conundrum in clinical practice about
      antithrombotic therapy such as poor compliance, lag and unreasonable in drug adjustment.

      1.2.Settle the technical problem that intelligent terminal APP code isn't compatible with
      most tablet PCs and smartphones.

      1.3.Impel the data platform to render and integrate with the daily medical system, enhance
      its accuracy, compatibility, privacy, and quality standard.

      1.4.Promote the new pattern of anti-thrombotic management by large sample's cohort study,
      increase the patients' compliance, reduce the readmission rate and adverse event rate of
