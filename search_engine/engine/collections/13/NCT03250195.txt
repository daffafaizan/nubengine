      semen analysis. In severe cases further workup includes testicular ultrasound, analysis of
      genes and hormones and in a few cases testicular biopsies are necessary.

      Ultrasound is the first choice of imaging, but new MRI and PET techniques can provide
      additional information.

      Research indicates that new MRI techniques can measure the activity of the testicular sperm
      cell production non-invasively and FDG-PET can measure the testicular metabolism with a
      radioactively marked glucose analog (FDG). These imaging modalities are combined in a PET/MRI
      and we wish to perform a PET/MRI in 10 men with normal sperm counts and 10 men with low sperm
      counts in order to evaluate whether a PET/MRI can distinguish testicles with and without
      sperm cell production. We hope that this new non-invasive technique can replace the need for
      invasive biopsies and will be able to target the harvesting of sperm cells in fertility
      treatment.
