      manufactured by Jubilant DraxImage (JDI); specifically using the constant-activity-rate
      intravenous infusion of rubidium-82 from the Ruby-Fillâ„¢ generator for diagnostic imaging of
      myocardial perfusion with PET. The V3 elution system is more highly automated, therefore
      requiring fewer manual performance checks.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Performance: system operation using constant-activity infusion is adequate to achieve:

             1. elution activity (82Rb) bias < 5% (V2 and V3)

             2. elution activity (82Rb) imprecision < 5% (V2 and V3)

             3. elution time interval (30 s) bias < 5% (V2 only)

             4. elution success-rate reliability > 98% (failure-rate < 2%) (V2 and V3)

        2. Daily Quality Assurance: testing procedures are adequate to document:

             1. Automated generator yield (82Rb) imprecision < 10% (V2 only)

             2. Automated generator breakthrough (82Sr, 85Sr) imprecision < 10% (V2 and V3)

             3. Manual generator yield (82Rb) imprecision < 10% (V2 only)

             4. Manual generator breakthrough (82Sr, 85Sr) imprecision < 10% (V2 only)

        3. Monthly Quality Assurance: testing procedures are adequate to document:

             1. Dose calibrator non-linearity < 1% (V2 and V3)

             2. Dose calibrator constancy > 99% (instability < 1%) (V2 only)

             3. Dose calibrator bias < 10% (V2 only)

             4. Peristaltic pump calibration bias < 10% (V2 only) 2.2 Secondary Objectives: To
                evaluate the user documentation and training reliability for:

        4. Installation of the Ruby-Fill generator and Ruby-Set tubing (V2 and V3)

        5. Trouble-shooting and repair of system errors (e.g. high-pressure) (V2 and V3) 2.3
           Tertiary Objective: To evaluate patient demographics or health status effects on system
           performance
