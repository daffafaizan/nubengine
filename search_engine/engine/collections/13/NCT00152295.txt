      tablets) when taken with PremarinÂ® 0.625 mg, by postmenopausal women, for 6 months after an
      initial 12 weeks in Study M00-198. Pharmacodynamic effects to be assessed include uterine
      bleeding pattern, endometrial biopsy results, and endometrial thickness. Safety assessments
      will include clinical laboratory results, physical examination with vital signs, pelvic and
      breast examinations, ultrasound results, and adverse events.
