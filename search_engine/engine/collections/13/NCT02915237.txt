      Clinical complications of GWI typically persist over long-term, cause significant pain and
      suffering, and interfere with the ability of affected Veterans to successfully integrate back
      into civilian society. There is no treatment for GWI and there is an urgent need to develop
      novel interventions either to resolve underlying GWI mechanisms, or to alleviate major GWI
      clinical complications.

      Recent Evidence highlights the potential value of flavonoids, a subclass of organic chemical
      called polyphenols that are abundantly found in some plants and common dietary preparations
      may help alleviate chronic fatigue and preserve cognitive functions. Based on this, the
      overall goal is to test whether the potential efficacy of dietary supplementation with a
      commercially available flavonoid-rich product, alleviates clinical complications in Veterans
      with GWI. In particular, the researchers propose a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled Phase I/IIA study to test the feasibility and potential efficacy of
      Concord grape juice dietary supplementation to treat cognitive deficits and chronic fatigue
      in Veterans with GWI.
