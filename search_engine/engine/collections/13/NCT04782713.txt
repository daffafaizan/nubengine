      Prostate Cancer (PCa), but uncertainty about how to use PSA for screening without causing
      undue overtreatment of indolent cancer, has greatly inhibited implementation, even in
      high-risk communities. This is a single-arm intervention study to test implementation of the
      Smart PSA strategy plus system-level patient navigation/ care coordination in the Mile Square
      Health Center(MSHC), in order to: a) identify barriers and facilitators to inform
      implementation of care, b) evaluate the impact on provider confidence regarding prostate
      cancer screening, and, c) measure its effect on observed PSA levels, biopsy referral rates,
      and biopsy outcomes.

      100 PCPs employed by MSHC who provide care for male adults will be asked to participate in
      surveys at baseline, (prior to an in-service training) and at 3,6, 9 and 12 months. The
      surveys will use 5-point Likert scales to assess the respondent's self-report of their
      knowledge regarding PSA screening, attitudes, behavior; and confidence in presenting the
      issue, discussing it with patients, interpreting results and making recommendations based on
      them; and to elicit comments on how to improve implementation.

      Historical data of 4500 patients covering a one year period prior to the intervention will be
      used to measure the impact of the intervention on measurable outcomes
