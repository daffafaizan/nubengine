      Ferrous sulphate is the most commonly used treatment for iron deficiency anemia.

      Lactoferrin is a new generation oral iron that has long been recognized as a member of the
      transferrin family of proteins and an important regulator of the levels of free iron in the
      body fluids and has the ability to enhance iron binding. Preliminary evidence suggests that
      lactoferrin may represent a promising new strategy for oral iron replacement.
