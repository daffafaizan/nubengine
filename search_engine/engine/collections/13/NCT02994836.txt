    
      A multicentre prospective randomized trial.

      Hypothesis:

      The discontinuation of anti-TNF treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in
      clinical remission is associated with an increased risk of recurrence compared with
      maintaining such treatment.

      Main objective:

      To assess the percentage of patients with IBD who, after stopping anti-TNF treatment, have
      sustained clinical remission at one year compared to those in which the treatment is
      continued at stable doses

      Secondary objectives:

      To compare treatment discontinuation vs. treatment continuation of anti-TNF agents in
      patients with CrohnÂ´s disease or ulcerative colitis in terms of:

        1. remission (relapse-free) time,

        2. phenotype changes with both strategies

        3. mucosal healing,

        4. radiologic healing

        5. impact on quality of life and productivity

        6. safety

        7. to identify relapse predictive factors.

        8. To identify relapse predictive factors after anti-TNF drug discontinuation

        9. Determining the profile of serum cytokines in patients with both strategies, depending
           on drug exposure and if maintained clinical remission or relapse.

      Planned number of subject to be included: 194

      The participation of at 50 hospitals in Spain with an inclusion of about 5 patients per
      hospital is required..
