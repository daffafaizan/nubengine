      with focus on wheat allergy by medical history, medical examination included skin status
      (suspected atopic dermatitis or not). Blood sample was taken for baseline determination of
      immunoglobulin E antibodies to wheat and to omega-5 gliadin. Transepidermal water loss was
      examined in case with atopic dermatitis. The primary outcome was the specific immunoglobulin
      E antibodies to wheat and omega-5 gliadin in case that stop using wheat containing skin care
      product and case that continue using products.
