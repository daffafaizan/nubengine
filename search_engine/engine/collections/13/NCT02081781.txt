      childhood. Most cases may resolve spontaneously, but the remaining children whose blockage
      does not resolve may require primary probing. Controversy remains regarding the optimal
      timing of the probing procedure. Another controversy is related to the setting of surgery.
      Therefore, we try to investigate the factors that affected the outcome of treatment of
      congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction under the same surgical doctor during the past 13
      years in our hospital.
