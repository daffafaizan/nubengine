      granulomatous inflammation. The pathophysiologic features of cardiac sarcoidosis include
      macrophage-induced, T-cell mediated non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, followed by
      myocardial scarring/fibrosis with clinical sequelae including arrhythmias, conduction
      abnormalities, and contractile dysfunction. These lead to high event rates in patients with
      cardiac sarcoidosis, with several studies reporting a prevalence of ventricular tachycardia
      ranging from 23% to 38% and an ~ 20% rate of clinical congestive heart failure.

      FDG-PET/CT with Rb82 myocardial perfusion imaging (FDG-PET with MPI) is becoming the gold
      standard imaging technique for evaluating the degree of inflammation and the response to
      immunosuppressive treatment in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. FDG PET imaging allows for
      evaluation of inflammatory macrophage infiltration, while Rb82 MPI allows for determination
      of myocardial scar burden. Despite emerging data from our center and others on the clinical
      utility of this technique in predicting prognosis, there is little consensus on the
      reproducibility of this technique or optimal imaging acquisition techniques and
      interpretative strategies.

      In this study, patients with a high clinical likelihood of cardiac sarcoidosis will undergo a
      study-directed FDG PET/CT with Rb82 myocardial perfusion imaging study approximately 2 weeks
      following an initial clinically-directed examination.

      The two FDG PET with MPI examinations will be examined for reproducibility of imaging
      findings, including: SUVmax, SUVmean, distribution of FDG uptake, extra cardiac FDG uptake,
      SUVvolume, SUVvolume:intensity, perfusion defect size/severity/location, LV ejection
      fraction, myocardial blood flow.

      Strict attention will be paid to ensure patients undergo the same metabolic preparation prior
      to the two examinations.
