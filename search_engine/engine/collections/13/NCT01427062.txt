      focus of anticipatory and compensatory postural control (EXP) or control (CON) group with
      strength-focused training, with 26 subjects in each group.

      Methods: Subjects in the EXP group were trained the speed and amplitude of anticipatory
      postural adjustment during stepping and walking and postural response to perturbation during
      walking. Subjects In the CON group were trained to improve the strength of lower limb
      muscles. Treatment period in both groups lasted for 12 weeks, which consisted of 4-week
      laboratory-based training (phase 1), 4-week home-based exercise (phase 2) and final 4-week
      laboratory-based training (phase 3). Outcome measures included reaction time(RT), movement
      velocity (MV) and endpoint excursion (EPE) of limit-of-stability test, one-leg-stance (OLS)
      time, gait velocity, stride length (SL), cadence, and fall rate. All tests were conducted for
      6 time intervals including baseline, after each training phase, at 3-month follow-up and at
      12-month follow-up.
