      exercise capacity of children and adolescents with severe asthma therapy-resistant (STRA). A
      randomized, controlled, crossover clinical trial will be conducted. Children and adolescents
      between 6 and 18 years old, with a diagnosis of STRA, will be included in the study. Patients
      wil be recruited in the SÃ£o Lucas Hospital (HSL) Asthma Outpatient Clinic of the Pontifical
      Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul. Patients who accept to participate in the study
      will perform a medical consultation according to routine outpatient asthma clinic,
      anthropometric evaluation and pulmonary function tests. Afterwards, they will be randomized
      into control and intervention groups. Participants in the intervention group will use
      noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in CPAP mode with 10cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure
      (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.21, for a period of 40 minutes. Participants
      in the control group will use NIV (CPAP), with a minimum PEEP of 1cmH20 and a FiO2 of 0.21
      also for 40 minutes. Afterwards, patients from both groups will perform a maximum
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). A sample size of 18 individuals to be included in the
      study was estimated. The variables studied will be maximal oxygen consumption and the
      anaerobic threshold (that measures exercise capacity), distance and time (to measure exercise
      tolerance), peripheral oxygen saturation, peak expiratory flow and the sensation of dyspnea
      at the end of the CPET.
