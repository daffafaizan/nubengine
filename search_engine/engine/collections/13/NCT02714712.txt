           relevant to SR-BI on CHC patients.

        2. Study Design To enroll 400 CHC patients during a 3-year period

        3. Specify objectives of study when collecting extra specimen from participants Collect
           blood samples for genomic DNA to examine the SR-BI gene polymorphisms.

        4. Expected Endpoints of Treatment Sustained virologic response (SVR) means undetectable
