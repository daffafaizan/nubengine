      next wave of personalized feedback interventions (PFIs) to address harmful alcohol use among
      college students. The purpose of this research is to determine optimal configuration of PFIs
      to take advantage of the clarity and initial impact of single-component PFIs and greater
      effect size and duration of personalized multi-component PFIs. The Investigators seek to
      increase and evaluate engagement with the PFI and text-message materials and boost innovation
      of both content and process of the intervention. In addition to PFI content and delivery, the
      investigators will use qualitative and quantitative methods to determine personal relevance
      of the chosen high-risk events among a sample of students who engage in heavy episodic
      drinking to better understand duration of PFI effects impacted by fluctuations in drinking
      associated with high-risk events. Prior interventions have targeted drinking in general or a
      single high-risk drinking event (e.g., Spring Break), but have not targeted both general and
      event-specific drinking together. These enhanced intervention effects, could have a
      significant impact on risks associated with college student drinking, and can be rapidly
      disseminated and implemented on campuses nationwide to address the public health problem
      posed by heavy episodic drinking among college students.
