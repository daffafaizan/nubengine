      ophthalmologic features. These features common to all forms of albinism are foveal
      hypoplasia, misrouting of the optic nerves at the chiasm, retinal hypopigmentation,
      translucent irides and nystagmus. The molecular genetic lab at Bordeaux University Hospital
      is the national reference for the study of this disease. More than 1400 patients have been
      analyzed with a strategy including next-generation sequencing of the 19 known genes of
      albinism and array-CGH. Despite this thorough analysis, 25% of patients remain without
      molecular diagnosis. Our experience tells us that these patients often show an incomplete
      form of albinism with the presence of only few ophthalmologic signs. The molecular diagnosis
      is very challenging as the phenotype often overlaps with other ophthalmologic disorders.
