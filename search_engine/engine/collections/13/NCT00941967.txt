      Primary

        -  Assess progression-free survival (RECIST) in patients with locally advanced,
           unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib tosylate with
           vs without gemcitabine hydrochloride and oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective response rate (RECIST) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib tosylate.

        -  Assess biomarkers (e.g., pERK levels) associated with treatment response.

        -  Assess angiogenic response by functional imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to performance status
      and CLIP score. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate as in arm I. Patients also receive
           gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on day 1 and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours
           on day 2. Treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride and oxaliplatin repeats every 14 days
           for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-14. In both arms,
           courses with sorafenib tosylate repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples and/ or tumor tissue samples may be collected for further analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months thereafter.
