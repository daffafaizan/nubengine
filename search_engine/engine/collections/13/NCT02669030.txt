      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial to study suvorexant augmentation of
      continuing antidepressant therapy against placebo with continuing antidepressant therapy.
      Patient volunteers must be on a stable antidepressant treatment and will remain on this
      treatment for the duration of the study. Patient volunteers that qualify and enroll in the
      clinical trial will either receive suvorexant 10 mg/day and may have it adjusted to a dose of
      either 15 mg or 20 mg/day. Treatment is for a total of six weeks in addition to a clinical
      follow-up visit.
