      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of adjuvant, fixed-dose rate gemcitabine hydrochloride and
           bevacizumab in patients with completely resected pancreatic cancer.

        -  Determine the 1-year disease-free survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates in these patients.

        -  Determine the median disease-free survival rate in these patients.

        -  Determine the median overall survival rate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes followed by bevacizumab* IV
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *The first dose of bevacizumab is not administered until after 6 weeks have passed
      since surgery.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 18 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
