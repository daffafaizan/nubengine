    
      This is an open-label, Phase I, FTIH, multiple-dose, dose-escalation and cohort expansion
      multi-center study conducted in three parts to identify a safe and pharmacologically active
      dose and regimen for VMD-928 monotherapy, which can be implemented in Phase 2 studies (the
      RP2D). The regimen will be identified using an adaptive design, multiple-ascending dose study
      in cancer patients. To conserve patients in the lower dose cohorts, dose escalation will
      begin with an accelerated titration scheme. A second part of the study will assess antitumor
      activity at the RP2D. The third part of the study will collect tumor samples before and after
      treatment to assess biological activity.
