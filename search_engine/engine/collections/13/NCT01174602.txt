      mortality rate among the highest of any psychiatric illness. The rate of relapse is
      disturbingly high, with up to 50% of patients requiring re-hospitalization within a year of
      discharge. Current treatments are inadequate in helping older adolescents and adults achieve
      sustained recovery. Importantly, eating behavior remains disturbed after weight restoration:
      patients demonstrate restrictive eating in their self-selected foods and in standardized
      meals, and caloric intake in standardized meals is inversely related to pre-meal anxiety.
      Emerging data suggest that eating behavior is particularly important in post-hospital course,
      and that significantly altering eating behavior is critical in improving outcome for these
      individuals. Furthermore, caloric intake in standardized meals has been shown to be related
      to pre-meal anxiety. This study evaluates the potential utility of two psychotherapeutic
      interventions in improving eating behavior prior to hospital discharge. Each individual
      receives, in random order, Cognitive Remediation Therapy for 4 weeks and Exposure and
      Response Prevention for AN for 4 weeks. The investigators hypothesize that these
      interventions will lead to improvement in eating behavior, measured by food diaries and
      standardized meals.
