      (SLE). The treatment of membranous (type V) lupus nephritis, a subset that carries a high
      morbidity, remains unsatisfactory. Recent studies suggest that immunosuppressive therapy
      targeted against the calcineurin pathway of T-helper cells, for example, tacrolimus, may be
      effective in the treatment of primary membranous nephropathy. The investigators plan to
      conduct an open-label single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in the
      treatment of membranous nephropathy secondary to SLE. Twenty patients with biopsy-proven
      membranous nephropathy secondary to SLE will be recruited. They will be treated with oral
      prednisolone and tacrolimus for 6 months, followed by 6 months of maintenance steroids alone.
      Proteinuria, renal function, clinical and serologic lupus activity will be monitored.
      Complete remission is defined as 24-hour urinary protein excretion to less than 0.5 gm/day.
      This study will explore the potential role of tacrolimus in the treatment of membranous lupus
      nephritis, which is usually resistant to conventional therapy.
