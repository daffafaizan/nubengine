      2 week screening period, subject will be randomized and enrolled if additional criteria is
      met. In particular, if wound size has decreased by greater than 40%, subject will be
      considered a screen fail and randomization will not take place. If all criteria including
      wound size at Week 3 is met, subject will be randomized and enrolled. Subjects will return
      weekly for a maximum of 12 weeks, or whenever healing occurs and then once more for a
      confirmation of healing. Week 24 will consist of a phone call to the subject to complete QOL
      surveys.
