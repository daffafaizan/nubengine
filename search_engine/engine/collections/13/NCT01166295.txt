      works efficiently with Subjects and Investigators, is tolerated well by Subjects, and is
      statistically reliable between Investigators; (b) that the sensory testing kit can
      distinguish between PHN patients with different sensory qualities to their pain which may be
      caused by different underlying pain mechanisms.

      The subjects will be patients with postherpetic neuralgia who voluntarily participate and
      meet eligibility criteria. The study participants will complete a brief questionnaire and
      undergo three rounds of the BSTK, performed by two study investigators. The items in the BSTK
      correspond to a series of sensory assessments, each of which are aimed to contribute to the
      characterization of individuals' PHN pain.
