    
      This is a 4-week study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of topiramate compared to
      placebo in the treatment of Bipolar I Disorder with an optional 6-month open-label (OL)
      extension for qualified patients following completion of the study. On Days 1-28 patients
      will receive placebo or topiramate 2x/day by mouth except for the 1st and last doses which
      will be a single evening dose and a single morning dose, respectively. Study drug will be
      titrated in 100-mg increments to 400 mg/day and patients maintained on a stable dose through
      Day 28. During the OL extension phase, topiramate will be titrated over 5 days to 200 mg/day.
      After Day 7, topiramate may be tapered down to 100 mg/day or up to 600 mg/day, as clinically
      indicated.
