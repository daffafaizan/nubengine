      performance is scarce. This is of particular interest among candidates for kidney living
      donation. A crucial aspect of living donation is to provide standardized information about
      the risks of the procedure. In Finland, the web portal Health Village contains general
      information about kidney diseases. In 2019 it was launched a personalized digital care path
      for kidney living candidates, which contains information about the donation process and
      facilitates the communication between clinicians, transplant coordinators, and patients,
      enabling telemedicine. The performance of this eHealth service has not yet been studied.

      Objectives. to investigate living donor candidates' experience with the web portal Health
      Village and the digital care path for living donor candidates. The secondary aim is to
      investigate their attitude of living donor candidates to eHealth services.

      Methods. A prospective cross sectional survey study. Participants will be all kidney donor
      candidates who have used the digital care path since its implementation in January 2019 up to
      1.3.2021 (N=122). The surveys will include general data, the type of electronic devices in
      possession and the purpose of use. eHealth literacy will be assessed with the eHeals
      questionnaire. Platform's ease of use will be assessed with the System Usability Scale, and
      participantsÂ´ opinion about the digital path utility with six questions. These items will be
      answered with a Likert-scale. Finally, we added an open question for qualitative analysis.
