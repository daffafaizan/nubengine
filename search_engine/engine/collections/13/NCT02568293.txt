      therapy, SBCV, used with balloon angioplasty as compared to balloon angioplasty plus a
      control agent (saline) when used for the treatment of stenosis within the femoropopliteal
      artery. Effectiveness will be measured by late lumen loss at 24 weeks post treatment as
      evaluated by an independent, blinded core lab.
