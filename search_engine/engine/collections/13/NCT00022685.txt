        -  Determine the safety of epratuzumab in patients with rituximab-refractory low-grade
           follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Confirm the convenient administration of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in terms of objective response rate in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive epratuzumab IV over 15-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 10 months and then every 3 months for up to 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-100 patients will be accrued for this study.
