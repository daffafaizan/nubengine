    
      Main objective: The main objectives are 1) to compare the state of senescence of subcutaneous
      versus visceral adipose tissues and 2) to define the senescent cell populations in
      subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues in morbidly obese patients.

      Secondary objectives: Secondary objectives are 1) to precise whether the state of senescence
      is attributable to microenvironment, 2) to determine the impact of aging on cellular
      function, 3) to establish a link between the state of senescence of subcutaneous and visceral
      adipose tissues and obesity-associated pathologies.
