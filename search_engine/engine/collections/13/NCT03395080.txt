      combination with paclitaxel in patients with recurrent epithelial endometrial cancer (EEC),
      epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), or carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Mullerian tumor [MMMT].
      Thus, 6 distinct patient groups are being independently investigated:

        1. 300mg DKN-01 monotherapy in recurrent EEC (Group 1)

        2. 300mg DKN-01+paclitaxel in recurrent EEC (Group 2)

        3. 300mg DKN-01 monotherapy in recurrent EOC (Group 3)

        4. 300mg DKN-01+paclitaxel in recurrent EOC (Group 4)

        5. 600mg DKN-01 monotherapy in recurrent carcinosarcoma (MMMT) (Group 5)

        6. 600mg DKN-01+paclitaxel in recurrent carcinosarcoma (MMMT) (Group 6)
