      society. Aortic valve disease is also expected to become more prevalent with the aging. Among
      aortic diseases, 'aortic stenosis (AS)', which is a narrowing of the aortic valve, and leads
      to symptoms of heart failure and sometimes death.

      For treatment of AS, the valve in replaced in a surgical to percutaneous method. Regardless
      of the method, valve replacement has its potential costs and complications that is an
      important issue that needs to be solved. Therefore, controlling the progression of AS and
      increasing the efficacy of medical therapy before valvular replacement is needed, is an
      important medico-social problem.

      Regarding the pathophysiology of AS, an elevation of lipoprotein(a) and dyslipidemia have
      been reported to be associated with the progression of cardiovascular calcification.

      PCSK9 inhibitors, which is a medication that can control both lipoprotein(a) and dyslipidemia
      may be a effective medication to control the progression of AS.

      Therefore, investigators will perform a randomized control trial, to compare the effect of
      PCSK9 inhibitors vs. placebo in its influence to AS progression.
