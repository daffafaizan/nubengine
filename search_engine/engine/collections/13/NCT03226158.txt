      collected and stored. Results of NGS will be compared between patients who develop BSI
      immediately (within 72 hours) after sample collection, those who develop other infectious
      syndromes, and those who remain well. Clinical data describing baseline information about the
      patient and malignancy, antibiotic and chemotherapy exposure, microbiology testing,
      hematology results, and infection-related events will be collected prospectively from the
      electronic medical record.

      An initial exploratory phase will examine approximately 50 participants to determine whether
      the effectiveness of predicting infections. The study may then enroll up to 200 participants
      to collection additional data for analysis.
