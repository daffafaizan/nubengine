      subjects with Alzheimer's disease. As a secondary goal, clinical and biomarker indices of
      therapeutic efficacy will also be evaluated. The proposed study will provide the essential
      human data necessary to guide the design of future studies testing the efficacy of GSPE in
      mitigating cognitive deterioration in AD patients.
