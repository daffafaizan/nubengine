      that confirms an open PDA (with no other contraindications for indomethacin treatment). After
      enrollment, neonates will receive intravenous indomethacin at a dose of 0.1mg/kg every 24
      hours for 3 days. Indomethacin levels will be measured at regular intervals. Urine output and
      serum electrolytes will be monitored prior to each dose of indomethacin. An echocardiogram
      will be repeated after completion of indomethacin treatment (between 72-120 hours of age) to
      reassess the status of PDA.
