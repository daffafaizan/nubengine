      herniation surgery. The trigger points are determined by manually palpating quadratus
      lumborum, iliocostalis lumborum, gluteus Maximus, gluteus minimus, gluteus medius, ve
      piriformis muscles before and after surgery. Data will be recorded on the patient assessment
      file and transferred to the computer and analyzed. Data analysis will be performed with
      SPSS.20.
