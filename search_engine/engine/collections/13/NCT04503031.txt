      tube (Unomedical, Kedah, Malaysia) and the patient in tapergaurd group (n=26) was intubated
      with TaperGuard endotracheal tube (Covidien, Athlone, Ireland). The group allocations were
      informed to the attending anesthesiologist prior to anesthesia. Tracheal intubation was
      performed with size of inner diameter 7.0 mm endotracheal tube for male and 6.5 mm
      endotracheal tube for female by the same anesthesiologist. The anesthesiologist measured cuff
      pressure and distance from endotracheal tube tip to carina during study period.This study was
      designed to evaluate the effect of change of head position on the cuff pressure of TaperGaurd
      endotracheal tube, compared to cylindrical endotracheal tube during oral surgery.
