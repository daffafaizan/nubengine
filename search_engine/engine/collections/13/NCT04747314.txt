      affective states such as depression and anxiety. These negative states have all been
      associated with higher pain intensity, lower pain tolerance, greater use of pain medication,
      poor pain treatment responses, and higher levels of psychiatric comorbidity among low back
      pain patients. To improve these outcomes for those who suffer from low back pain, it is
      important to implement multiple methods with a focus in treating negative affect for pain
      management rather than using opioids alone.

      Antidepressant (AD) and fear avoidance-based physical therapy (EFAR) have individually shown
      to be promising methods for pain management. In this study, AD, EFAR, and the combination
      therapy of the two treatments will be explored and implemented to investigate their
      effectiveness in improving pain, function, depression, and anxiety. The key innovation is
      testing a new and effective multimodal treatment that can help manage pain, as well as
      address negative affect.
