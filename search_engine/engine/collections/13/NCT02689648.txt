      largely unknown. The investigators plan to retrospectively analyse a cohort of children who
      during the years 2010-2015 were referred to the Pediatric Clinic of Ume√• University Hospital
      due to abdominal pain. The aims are to explore and descriptively describe the symptoms and
      effects of investigations performed. Furthermore, the investigators plan to contact the cases
      five years after the first contact for a follow up using a validated questionnaire of the
      ROME-III-criteria and analyse the long term prognosis and risk factors for prolonged severe
      symptoms.
