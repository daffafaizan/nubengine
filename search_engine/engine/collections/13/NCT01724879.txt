      standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy for the Philadelphia positive chromosome
      sub-group of ALL patients aged 18 to 55 years.

      The Study hypothesis is, that Dasatinib in combination with standard chemotherapy according
      to GMALL protocol 07/2003 is feasible and induces cytologic and molecular remission rates
      comparable to chemotherapy in combination with imatinib without increased treatment-related
      mortality.
