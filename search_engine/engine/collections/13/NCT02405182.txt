      changes in ALS and related neurological conditions. Results from cognitive and neurological
      tests will be compared to the MRI. It is believed that these techniques will reveal changes
      in the brain that will help us understand normal brain function and the symptoms of
      neurological diseases as seen in ALS, as well to provide an objective measurement of
      degeneration (which is called a biomarker). This could improve not only the process by which
      new drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases are evaluated, but also how health care
      professionals address the needs of patients with these diseases.

      Furthermore, a biomarker may give insight into the biological factors related to the diverse
      and variable clinical features amongst different patients.

      Subjects will be recruited from ALS clinics that are a part of the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging
      Consortium (CALSNIC). Patients will have a diagnosis of ALS, PLS, PMA, or FTD. Healthy
      controls will be age and gender matched to patients. Subjects will visit their respective
      sites to undergo a clinical evaluation and an MRI. Follow up visits will occur at
      approximately 3-6 month intervals. Most subjects will have 2 follow up visits; more visits
      may occur for subjects who are physically able to continue in the protocol.
