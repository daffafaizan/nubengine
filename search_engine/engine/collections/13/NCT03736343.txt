      study. In a simulated bar laboratory, participants will be administered oral alcohol with
      three vodka-based drinks. This procedure will allow collection of several measures, notably a
      widely used, validated measure of self-reported SR and multiple measures capturing facets of
      impulsive behavior prior to and following alcohol administration. Participants will be
      recruited through a number of means. Flyers will be posted and handed out in and around the
      various colleges, universities and technical schools in the Gainesville area as well as in
      other public areas. The study team will utilize the internet by posting brief solicitation
      messages on social media, newspaper sites, and classified advertising sites. These same brief
      messages will also be disseminated to students at the local colleges, universities and
      technical schools in the area via batch emails and list servs. When permitted, brief
      recruitment talks will be given verbally during class meetings at these local institutions.
      Verbal recruitment messages will contain the same material in the appended flyers and other
      advertisements. Copies of flyers will also be provided at the conclusion of these brief
      recruitment talks. Potential participants will complete an initial eligibility questionnaire
      over the phone or online. Participants who appear eligible based on the phone/web screen will
      be invited to attend an in-person screening appointment. If eligible, participants will be
      scheduled for two alcohol drinking sessions separated by a minimum of one and a maximum of
      seven days. After the second drinking session, participants will be scheduled for a follow-up
      appointment.
