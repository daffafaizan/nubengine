      over 12 weeks, in addition to a low-intensity psychosocial intervention program, with 26-week
      and 52-week follow-up observations. The percentages of heavy drinking days and abstinent days
      were the primary outcome measures, and craving; distress and depression levels;
      self-efficacy; social support from family, friends and significant others; and health-related
      quality of life (HRQL) were secondary outcomes. Tolerability was also examined.
