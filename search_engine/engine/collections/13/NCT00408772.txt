      Primary

        -  Evaluate the conversion rate of nonresectable disease to resectable disease in patients
           with nonresectable liver metastases secondary to colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with
           neoadjuvant therapy comprising oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and bevacizumab followed by
           hepatic resection and/or radiofrequency ablation.

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and bevacizumab IV
           over 1 hour on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
           every 3 weeks for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity or until conversion to resectable disease.

        -  Surgery and/or radiofrequency ablation (RFA): Patients undergo hepatic resection (with
           or without RFA) when tumor is deemed resectable. Patients with stable (< 8 lesions) and
           unresectable disease undergo laparoscopic or percutaneous RFA. RFA repeats once 4-6
           weeks later.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 6-8 weeks after surgery and/or RFA, patients may receive
           adjuvant therapy comprising oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and bevacizumab, as in
           neoadjuvant therapy, for up to 4 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
