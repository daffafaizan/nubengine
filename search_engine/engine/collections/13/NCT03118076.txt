      management because it provides equivalent analgesia but with fewer adverse effects than
      either systemic or epidural analgesia.

      The use of clonidine, a partial α2 adrenoceptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the
      duration and analgesia in peripheral nerve blockade. Dexmedetomidine is a more selective and
      shorter-acting α2 adrenergic receptor.However, its use in femoral and common peroneal nerve
      blocks has not been described.

      In this study, we investigated the effect of adding dexmedetomidine as additive in femoral
      and common peroneal nerve blocks for postoperative analgesia.

      Patients, diagnosed as oromaxillofacial tumor and undergoing elective free fibular or
      anterolateral thigh flap reconstruction, were divided into two groups in a randomized,
      double-blind fashion. For patients with free fibular flaps harvested, femoral nerve block and
      common peroneal nerve with ropivacaine were administered. For patients with anterolateral
      thigh flaps harvested, femoral nerve block with ropivacaine was administered.In Group R,
      nerve blocks were administered with 0.3% ropivacaine. In Group RD, nerve blocks were
      administered with 0.3% ropivacaine and 50 μg dexmedetomidine.The primary endpoints were the
      onset time and duration of sensory blocks. The secondary endpoints were heart rate, blood
      pressure, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), sedation level, the duration of motor blocks.
