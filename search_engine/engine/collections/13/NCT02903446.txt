      improving bone erosions among individuals with chronic tophaceous gout, despite improvements
      in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers. However, it is known that increased
      numbers of osteoclasts (cells that absorb bone tissue during growth and healing) in patients
      with tophaceous gout are most likely a result of enhanced osteoclast activity as these
      patients also have higher circulating levels of the protein receptor activator of nuclear
      factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL). RANKL has been identified to affect the immune system and
      control bone regeneration and remodeling.

      Furthermore, peripheral blood cells and synovial fluid cells taken from patients with erosive
      gout preferentially formed osteoclast-like cells in the presence of RANKL. The number of
      osteoclasts formed significantly correlates with the number of tophi in gout patients.

      Denosumab (ProliaÂ®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for RANKL that
      can bind and neutralize the activity of human RANKL. Given the relevance of RANKL in the
      mechanism of gouty erosions,a central hypothesis of this pilot study is that denosumab is
      more likely to precisely target RANKL and the mechanism of gouty erosions than zoledronic
      acid.
