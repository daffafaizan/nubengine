    
      This is a non-randomized, clinical pilot study testing whether 16 weeks of spironolactone
      improves ovulation rates in post-menarcheal girls with androgen excess. The investigators
      will recruit girls ages 13-19 with clinical or biochemical androgen excess (defined as
      hirsutism and/or elevated Tanner stage-specific free testosterone concentrations) who are 4
      to 6 years post-menarche. Girls will keep a menstrual diary and collect twice weekly saliva
      samples for progesterone and estradiol for 16 weeks before and for 16 weeks during
      spironolactone (if â‰¤ 60 kg, 50 mg twice daily; if > 60 kg, 100 mg twice daily [1.7-3.3
      mg/kg/24 hr]) use. Girls will be asked to continue to collect saliva twice weekly for
      progesterone and estradiol testing for an additional 16 weeks after discontinuation of
      spironolactone and to continue menstrual diaries off of study medication for 12 additional
      months to assess persistence of any spironolactone effect. Ovulation events will be counted
      per 100 days based on definitive rises in salivary progesterone. The primary outcome will be
      changes in ovulation rate during spironolactone use compared to baseline. Changes in
      menstrual regularity via inter-menstrual interval will also be assessed as a secondary
      outcome of spironolactone administration. Another secondary outcome will be changes in acne
      and/or hirsutism.
