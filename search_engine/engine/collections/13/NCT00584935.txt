      membranes, and, in a small subset of patients, the eyes. Progressive ocular disease can lead
      to irreversible damage and blindness. Conventional treatments have included high dose
      systemic steroids, dapsone, and immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate,
      cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil. However, there are a subgroup of patients who
      fail to respond to these treatments, develop intolerable side effects, or have
      contraindications to their use. Patients may also develop resistance to these conventional
      treatment modalities. For these reasons, alternative treatment modalities are needed.
      Rituximab has been very effective in the treatment of other autoimmune disorders. It has
      recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of another autoimmune blistering
      disorder known as pemphigus. We thus propose that Rituximab will be effective in the
      treatment of cicatricial pemphigoid.
