        -  Determine the antileukemic effects of tumor-specific Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson
           Murine Leukemia(BCR-ABL) junction specific peptide vaccine, as measured by a decrease in
           circulating BCR-ABL transcripts by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
           (RT-PCR), that persist for at least 3 months, in patients with chronic phase chronic
           myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients treated with this vaccine who become
           RT-PCR-negative for BCR-ABL transcripts.

        -  Compare response in patients with B3A2 junctions vs B2A2 junctions when treated with
           this vaccine.

        -  Determine the immunologic response over 1 year in patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Correlate response with specific HLA types in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this vaccine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive BCR-ABL junction-specific peptide vaccine subcutaneously in weeks 2, 4, 6,
      8, and 11 and then once monthly for 10 months.

      BCR-ABL transcript levels are assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
      reaction at baseline, weeks 2, 4, and 6, every 3 months during treatment, and then 2 weeks
      after completion of study treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
