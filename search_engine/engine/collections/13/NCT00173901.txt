    
      Ceftazidime is a third generation cephalosporins that should be reserved for severe bacterial
      infections. Substitution of the brand ceftazidime with a generic ceftazidime raised some
      concerns.

      The purpose of this study is to understand whether generic ceftazidime causes different
      adverse drug reaction incidence from the brand drug.
