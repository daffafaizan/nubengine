      long periods of circulatory arrest. The significance of this project will be to determine
      which method of brain protection (1) retrograde brain perfusion or (2) perfusion of the right
      subclavian artery with antegrade perfusion of the brain protects against brain injury after
      total arch replacement. Thus reducing the risk of stroke or neurocognitive deficits in
      patients undergoing this critical surgical procedure.
