      participating in lung cancer screening at two VA sites. Primary care providers at these sites
      will be randomized, and half will be offered tools to help integrate proactive smoking
      cessation support into the lung cancer screening process. Key proactive elements include
      proactive telephone outreach to all current smokers by a VA Quitline counselor that follows
      mailed results letters, and providing providers guidance in offering proactive cessation
      medication support as part of the lung cancer screening process.
