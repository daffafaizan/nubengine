      commonly used as a graft for people undergoing a CABG surgery. The vein is removed from the
      leg and reattached to the heart to create a detour around the blocked part of a coronary
      artery. Following this procedure, many people are prescribed aspirin as a way to increase the
      chance that the graft procedure will be successful. However, saphenous vein graft failure may
      still occur in some people, indicating a need to understand why this happens and who might be
      at risk for graft failure. Thrombin, a protein involved in the blood clotting process, is
      somehow related to aspirin resistance, abnormalities in blood flow, and cell disruption
      within the saphenous vein, all factors thought to increase the risk of graft failure. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the likelihood that a burst in thrombin contributes to
      graft failure in people who have recently undergone a CABG procedure using the saphenous
      vein.

      This study will enroll individuals undergoing CABG surgery at the University of Maryland.
      Prior to and immediately following surgery, an incision will be made in the skin and the time
      required for the blood to form a clot will be determined. During surgery, participants' blood
      vessels will be examined using imaging and cell analysis techniques. Blood collection will
      occur before surgery, immediately after surgery, and on Days 1, 3, and 30 following surgery.
      A portion of blood will be frozen for future analysis. An x-ray of the saphenous vein will be
      performed on Day 5 and again at a follow-up visit 6 to 12 months following surgery. Kidney
      function will be measured at both of these visits prior to the x-ray procedure. At the second
      visit, health and mental status questionnaires will be completed.
