      with chemotherapy for children with relapsed ALL. The hypothesis is that the incorporation of
      Marqibo® with combination chemotherapy will be safe and feasible. In the context of this
      pilot study, overall outcomes and efficacy will be a secondary objective. It is hypothesized
      that data from this combination may show improved efficacy including, complete remission
      (CR), minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, and progression free survival (PFS) rates
      and safety (i.e., neurotoxicity) in comparison to outcomes in historical regimens, including
      the UK ALL R3 with standard vincristine.
