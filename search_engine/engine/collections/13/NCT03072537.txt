    
      Pediatricians participating in CrescNet provide pseudononymized data on patients' height,
      weight, and head circumferences to the CrescNet registry. Growth data are evaluated by
      automatized filter algorithms and by a pediatric endocrinologist. CrescNet does not have
      access to patients or personal patient data. Each participating pediatrician receives a
      quarterly screening report with recommendations for the work-up of children with abnormal
      growth or abnormal development of weight or body mass index.

      The data registry is used for scientific purposes.The collection of data from healthy
      children allows the generation of evidence based statements about prevalence rates of growth
      disorders and also about the rates in disorders of weight development. For this, data are
      provided completely anonymized without allowing conclusions on personal patient data.
