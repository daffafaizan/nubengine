      treatment of TRAS (Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis).

      This retrospective, monocentric study included patients with peri-anastomotic stenosis of the
      renal graft from 2000 to 2017. The stenosis is defined by a reduction of at least 50% of the
      arterial diameter during arteriography. Technical success was defined as residual stenosis
      less than 30% of the arterial diameter after the procedure.
