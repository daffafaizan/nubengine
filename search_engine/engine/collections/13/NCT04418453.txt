      areas, call for a rapid expansion of access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder
      (MOUD).There is a need to study effective ways to expand treatment access and improve
      retention on MOUD in rural areas highly impacted by OUD. Telemedicine (TM) for MOUD offers an
      alternative or supplementary approach to delivering MOUD that may be suitable for rural
      clinics and patients with OUD.

      The objectives of the feasibility study are to study ways of incorporating TM into primary
      care clinics and to evaluate the associated outcomes, based on EHRs from the clinics and the
      TM vendor (i.e., patient days on MOUD) and participant surveys (e.g., opioid use). Additional
      outcomes of the feasibility study are feasibility and acceptability assessed from the
      perspectives of providers and participants via focus groups. A patient registry will be
      established in each clinic to track patients with OUD diagnoses, and those in the registry
      will be provided the opportunity to consent for sharing identified EHRs and participating in
      the follow-up surveys.
