      pathological process of atherosclerosis that affects the coronary arteries, often leading to
      obstruction by an atheromatous plaque. Oxidative stress is one of the most potent inducers of
      vascular inflammation in atherogenesis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate through
      nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), transcription factors and genes related to inflammation, thus,
      activation of NF-kB by ROS in the atherosclerosis patient is associated with vascular
      dysfunction and thus with inflammation and atherosclerosis. Recently, researchers have
      discovered a transcription factor identified as nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2
      (Nrf2) transcription factor, which is responsible for the expression of antioxidant response
      element genes that can inhibit this pathway, thus providing cellular protection. Thus,
      several nutritional strategies have been studied, including the use of curcumin, a chemical
      compound of the class of curcumin produced by turmeric root (Curcuma longa). Turmeric is
      capable of promoting the activation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
      transcription factor and inflammasome (NLPR3). These factors, in turn, are involved with the
      activity of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), a transcription factor that increases the
      synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the effects of
      turmeric supplementation on cardiovascular risk markers, inflammation, oxidative stress and
      evaluation of functional capacity. Perspectives: This study aims to improve the inflammatory
      and oxidative stress status of patients with CAD with the use of turmeric, and thus try to
      reduce the risk factors related to the onset and progression of coronary artery disease.
