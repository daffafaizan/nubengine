      which is characterized by left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in early stages

      Type 2 DM is associated with various types of subclinical target organ damage resulting in
      elevated risk of CVD events, moreover there is growing evidence that a prediabetic status,
      such as impaired fasting glucose is also related to subclinical target organ damage when
      compared to a group with normal glucose metabolism

      Diabetes mellitus is a well-studied major risk factor for coronary heart diseases, which is
      one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Another distinct entity of diabetes-related
      cardiac affection is the diabetic cardiomyopathy. This entity of cardic affection by diabetes
      still needs more and more attention, not only because it is common in diabetic patients, but
      also because of its easy detection by the simple, inexpensive and widely available diagnostic
      echocardiography.

      The proposed mechanisms that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy
      include autonomic dysfunction, microvascular disease, interstitial fibrosis and metabolic
      disorders. However, the actual causes and mechanisms remain unclear.
