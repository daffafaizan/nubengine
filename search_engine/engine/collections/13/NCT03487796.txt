      who have sex with men (MSM), especially those of color. Unfortunately, evidenced-based
      intervention programs for non-heterosexual Black adolescent males (nHBAM) do not exist. Drs.
      Brown and Crosby have each designed, tested (in the context of NIH-funded RCTs) behavioral
      interventions targeting young people at-risk of HIV acquisition. Also, their previous work
      demonstrates that parental involvement prevents sexual risk behavior by adolescents. They
      will adapt key elements of STYLE, an efficacious HIV prevention program for adolescents and
      their parents/caregivers, to be relevant for nHBAM. A formative phase will use in-depth
      interviews to assess and identify the needs of nHBAM and their parents/caregivers. Work
      groups, composed of youth, parents/caregivers, stakeholders, and investigators, will tailor
      and refine the content in an iterative process with a sophisticated media company (MEE
      studios). MySTYLE is proposed to be a series of eight online novella episodes designed to
      increase relevant knowledge, attitudes, and sexual protective behaviors of nHBAM. The project
      will take place in Jackson MS, which has the highest prevalence of HIV among urban MSM in the
      U.S. and the third highest rate among Black MSM under the age of 25. Adolescents and parents
      will be recruited from community organizations, medical clinics and schools. The feasibility
      and effect sizes of MySTYLE, compared to a waitlist control group, will be tested with a
      cohort of 72 nHBAM and their parents. Interventions effect sizes will be determined for
      sexual behaviors, HIV testing, and psychosocial mediators (e.g., knowledge, attitudes,
      communication between adolescents and their parents/caregivers relative to sex, safer sex,
      and sexuality).
