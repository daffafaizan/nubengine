      in Sunset Park and the safety-net clinics serving it with the study team's 1) clinical and
      scientific expertise in health disparities, participatory research and early childhood mental
      health and 2) the digital health/health IT expertise of the WonderLab, a digital incubator in
      the NYU Langone Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The goal is to reduce health
      disparities by explicitly designing a digital solution that facilitates connection and
      bidirectional exchange of information across the cultural, contextual, language, and setting
      differences that are key barriers to early childhood mental health knowledge and access to
      care for this immigrant population. The first aim is to iteratively design, build, and test
      OurChild. To do this, the team will 1) collaborate with our family, clinical, and community
      stakeholders to conduct an early childhood mental health context/needs analysis and
      participatory design and discovery activities; 2) use these insights to adapt and user-test
      iterative prototypes; 3) evaluate the usability and acceptability of a beta version of
      OurChild in a mixed-methods pilot with 20 Chinese American parents and their 2- to 6-year-old
      children who receive care at the Sunset Park 7th Avenue Family Health Center; and 5) optimize
      the design, features, and performance to create OurChild 1.0. The second aim it to evaluate
      the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, and Implementation of OurChild 1.0 with a 6-month
      longitudinal implementation cohort study with 200 parent/child dyads. A mixed-methods
      approach using metadata collected with the OurChild app, parent-reported data from the app,
      EHR data, and post-implementation focus groups with providers to determine whether use of
      OurChild increases referrals of young children for a mental health consultation or evaluation
      (Primary Aim) will be used. The secondary aims include examining whether use of OurChild 1)
      increases parent self-efficacy; 2) parent-provider engagement; and 3) linkage with community
      early childhood resources. Both OurChild and digital methodology will be designed to be
      scaled to other Chinese populations and efficiently adapted for other health disparity
      populations.
