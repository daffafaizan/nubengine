      multi-site study involving up to 60 implanted subjects at up to 15 study sites in the United
      States. Procedural and 30 day safety and efficacy results from this study will be compared to
      appropriate historical control data for the Medtronic CoreValve System. Subjects will be
      followed up to 5 years following implantation.
