      standard of care preparation for an electrophysiology procedure (control arm) vs. Virtual
      Reality preparation (VR arm). Participants in control arm will have standard preparation for
      a procedure including discussion of the procedure with the provider the day before the
      procedure with all questions answered at that time. VR arm participants will have access to
      the Virtual Reality tour and gear 1 week prior to the procedure. VR arm participants will be
      instructed to watch the Virtual Reality tour at least three times prior to the procedure but
      will be encouraged to watch as often as the participants would like. The Virtual Reality
      equipment will measure how often participants complete the tour. All participants will
      undergo anxiety measures a total of four times: once at time of recruitment, day of procedure
      and then 1 week and 4 weeks post procedure. Participants will have cortisol salivary swabs
      performed 1 week before procedure (before VR use), pre-op visit, day of procedure, and
      immediately following procedure. Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured on day of
      procedure.
