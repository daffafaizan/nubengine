      extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) is expanded by intravenous sodium-loading; in these
      studies, there was a suppression of ANG II with no change in net renal hemodynamics, pointing
      to a tubular mechanism for reduced NaCl reabsorption secondary to the ANG II suppression. In
      the current randomized and controlled study, investigators aim to test the hypothesis that
      GLP-1's suppression of ANG II and natriuretic action increase medullary perfusion and
      decrease oxygen consumption, leading to higher tissue oxygenation. Thus, contributing to the
      renoprotective action of GLP-1.

      Under fixed sodium intake for 4 days before each study day, 10 healthy male participants will
      be investigated during a 1-hour infusion of GLP-1 (1.5 pmol/kg/min) or vehicle together with
      an intravenous infusion of 0.9% NaCl. Interleaved measurements of RAF, oxygenation (T2*) and
      perfusion by arterial spin labeling in the renal cortex and medulla at fixed time points will
      be conducted, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
