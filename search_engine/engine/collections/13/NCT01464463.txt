      combined with euthymic therapy and CBASP on depression and further psychopathological
      variables (assessed at 5 points).

      Previous findings indicate increased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      depression. A bidirectional relationship between depression and immunological alterations has
      been suggested: On the one hand pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to depression, on
      the other hand depression-linked changes (e.g. a reduction of activity, increased
      stress-sensitivity) may lead to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore,
      this study is also supposed to investigate the influence of above mentioned interventions on
      pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using a waiting group, potential changes in psychometric and
      biological parameters without any intervention are controlled. Assessments take place at
      baseline, after 4 weeks of treatment, after 8 weeks of treatment, after 16 weeks of treatment
      and 6 months follow up.

      200 patients with Major Depression (DSM IV, BDI II at baseline â‰¥18) will be included.
      Patients will be randomized and assigned to one of the 4 groups.
