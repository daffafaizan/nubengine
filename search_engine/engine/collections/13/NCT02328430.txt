      the current method of blowing into a spirometer.

      Spirometry is an essential investigation for diagnosis and assessment of severity in people
      with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and other respiratory conditions, it is
      used in every respiratory unit and across primary care. It requires subjects to blow into a
      tube which measures volume and flow of expired air. It involves specialist equipment and
      training to perform and interpret. Not all patients are capable of performing spirometry, in
      particular children, frail, cognitively impaired and those experiencing a flare or
      exacerbation of symptoms. Remote lung function assessment technology has the potential to
      enable assessment of lung function in these groups of patients. In the future it is also
      hoped that it could be used to improve respiratory disease monitoring outside the healthcare
      environment such as in the patients home.

      This new method uses the latest infra-red depth detection cameras to measure chest wall
      movement. (N.B this does not capture identifiable images). We would like to record
      participants chest wall movements while blowing into the spirometer.
