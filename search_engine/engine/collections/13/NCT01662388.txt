    
      A total of 188 premolar teeth with proximal cavity to be assigned on alternate basis in two
      groups. Intervention group teeth received Automatrix band after cavity preparation followed
      by the separation ring using clamp while the control group received Automatrix band alone.

      All teeth to be restored with P-60 composite restorative material(3M-ESPE Dental, USA).
      Outcome (proximal tightness) is determined by a blinded assessor just after the restoration.
