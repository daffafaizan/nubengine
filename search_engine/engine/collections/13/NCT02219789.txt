      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of alisertib in combination with fulvestrant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of alisertib in combination with fulvestrant.

      II. To examine tumor response in postmenopausal women treated with alisertib in combination
      with fulvestrant.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess aurora A kinase expression in archived breast cancer tissue biospecimens of
      participants, and to describe levels in those who do or do not experience dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) or objective response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 (days 1 and 15 of course 1 only)
      and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
