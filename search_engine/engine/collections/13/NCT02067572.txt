      officinalis (SO) in maintaining good oral health among patients in palliative care. The study
      compares a mouthwash based on salvia tea solution with conventional normal saline mouthwash
      and addresses the following research questions:

        1. Does the SO-based mouthwash provide a better treatment than conventional normal saline
           in maintaining good oral health in terminally ill patients?

        2. Is there a difference in the individual perception of oral comfort in patients receiving
           SO versus patients receiving saline rinsing solution?
