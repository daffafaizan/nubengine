    
      This is a single centre, open-label, single-group study to explore the safety of, and
      response to sparsentan treatment in incident, renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade-na√Øve
      patients with biopsy-proven immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). The purpose is to explore
      sparsentan treatment as a potential first-line treatment in patients newly diagnosed with
      IgAN (ie, incident patients), who have thus not received prior treatment with ACEI or ARB
      therapy for IgAN. Response to treatment will be assessed as changes from baseline rather than
      comparison to another treatment, and will be based on established proteinuria endpoints (UPCR
      and protein excretion), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR); a number of exploratory
      measures will be assessed as well.

      The starting dose of sparsentan will be 200 mg/day, which will be titrated up to the target
      dose of 400 mg/day at Week 2. Patients who do not tolerate the target dose will have their
      dose reduced back to 200 or 100 mg/day; throughout the study, patients will be maintained on
      the maximum allowed dose of sparsentan they can tolerate. All patients will be treated with
      sparsentan for a total of 110 weeks, followed by an off-treatment follow-up period of 4
      weeks.
