      probiotics and calcium supplementation of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 or Lactobacillus
      casei CRL 431 in children aged 1-6 years (n=494) living in urban low socioeconomic
      communities of East Jakarta in 2007-2008. We re-enrolled the subjects to assess the long-term
      effects of probiotics and calcium supplementation on growth, development, and metabolic
      parameters at the age of 11-17 years.

      Healthy children (n = 238) were included in this follow-up study. Each subject previously
      assigned to one intervention group: low-lactose milk with a low calcium content (LC = 53), a
      regular calcium content (RC = 70), regular calcium with L. reuteri DSM 17938 (n = 55), and
      regular calcium with L. casei CRL 431 (n = 60).

      Anthropometric measurements were performed by measuring the weight and height of the
      subjects, and further combining the results to report BMI-for-age z-score. Height was also
      plotted to the chart of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards. Gut
      integrity was assessed with the lactulose-mannitol ratio using high-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) method. Cognitive function, symptoms related to depression, behaviour,
      and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) of the adolescents were evaluated used to
      investigate the effects of supplementation on development. We quantified lipid profile and
      Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) as metabolic parameters using
      the vein blood sample. The metabolic parameters were measured in at least three groups of
      intervention.
