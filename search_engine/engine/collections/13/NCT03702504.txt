      healthcare; each year about one million patients are admitted to intensive care units across
      Europe. The project contributes to European society in the long-term by promoting cooperation
      between member states in the critical care domain, with a view to improving the safety of
      patients admitted to ICUs and to continuously assessing performance through international
      comparison of outcomes and procedures. It also contributes to the exchange of good practice,
      reduce medical errors and promote high quality services in public health.

      Patient safety and quality of care measurement and improvement are among the most important,
      challenging aspects of public health. The intensive and critical care domains need continuous
      monitoring and improvement considering the high mortality rates in and major financial
      investments required by ICUs. However, collection of ICU performance data is not standardized
      and no transnational EU project to improve patient safety and to assess performance and
      quality of care is currently operating for ICUs.

      The project provides long-term benefits to European society by promoting cooperation between
      member states in the critical care domain with a view to improving the safety of patients
      admitted to ICUs and performing continuous performance evaluation through comparison of
      outcomes and procedures at international level.

      The aim of this project is to export the positive results achieved through an Italian
      experience (Margherita system) to other European countries, addressing in particular new
      member states where benchmarking is sparse and uncoordinated and quality assessment and
      comparison is needed.

      Methods and means:

      It is proposed to build an ICU network across EU to collect standardized data on admitted
      patients, to perform statistical analyses based on national and intercountry comparisons and
      to appropriately identify and manage strengths and weaknesses in performance.
