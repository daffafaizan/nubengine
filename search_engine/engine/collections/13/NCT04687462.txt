      undergoing bilateral total knee replacement arthroplasty(TKRA) for both knee osteoarthritis
      will receive written consent from the patient through informed consent before the surgery.
      Among the patients undergoing total arthroplasty for both knee joints, only patients who have
      agreed with written consent will receive the surgery. In one patient who has been decided to
      be erolled for the stedy, we will set one knee joint as the experimental group, and the other
      knee joint as the control group. The experimental group will undergo TKRA using Exult total
      knee system and the control group will get TKRA using Lospa total knee system. The researcher
      performing the surgery can know which instruments are used for each knee joint according to
      the random number table assignment result, but the subjects undergoing surgery will be
      conducted as a single blinded study where it is not possible to know which instruments are
      used for each side.
