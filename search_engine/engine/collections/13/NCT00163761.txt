      majority of patients relapse after first line therapy. A variety of 'salvage chemotherapy'
      treatments are available that are usually inpatient-based treatments associated with
      significant haematological toxicity. Furthermore, all patients are treated in the same manner
      despite the fact that some patients will do well irrespective of the type of salvage therapy
      whereas others will do badly no matter what is done. During 2001-2002 we undertook a pilot
      study in 40 such patients using an outpatient-based salvage therapy with 2 newer chemotherapy
      drugs, vinorelbine and gemcitabine. Over 75% of all treatments were successfully delivered on
      an outpatient basis with response rates similar to historical controls. We now propose to
      expand on these initial findings by modifying the outpatient approach for those patients with
      less favourable prognostic features, that is, patients will be stratified to differing
      therapies but with the majority still receiving the proven vinorelbine-gemcitabine
      combination.
