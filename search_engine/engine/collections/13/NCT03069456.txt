      psychological sequelae. Anesthetic depth monitoring system based on
      electroencephalography(EEG) or evoked potential are broadly used methods. Bispectral index
      (BIS) monitor is most popular anesthetic depth monitoring system. Anesthetic depth monitoring
      for sedation (ADMS) is developed in Korea as an electroencephalographic monitor for measuring
      the depth of anesthesia. The investigators want to compare the performance of ADMS to the
      bispectral index (BIS) as electroencephalographic measures of sevoflurane effect using two
      combined sigmoidal Emax models via population pharmacodynamic approach.
