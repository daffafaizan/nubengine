      dysfunction, a key event in atherosclerosis. Previous observations have suggested that
      smoking-related endothelial dysfunction is dose-related and potentially reversible after
      withdrawal from smoking. To our knowledge, no data are available regarding potential
      improvement of arterial endothelial function in the first weeks of smoking cessation. This
      time frame is especially important because due to smoke-free policies in healthcare
      facilities, all smokers requiring surgery are abstinent from tobacco for at least some period
      of time.

      Varenicline, a partial agonist at α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetyl-choline (nAChR) receptors,
      received FDA approval as a novel medication for helping cigarette smokers to stop smoking.
      Given the anticipated common use of varenicline, it is important to define if the drug alters
      endothelial function and/or autonomic effects. Based on the lesser potency of varenicline
      (compared to nicotine) at nAChR receptors in peripheral ganglia and on endothelial cells of
      blood vessels, it may be hypothesized that varenicline has less or no influence on autonomic
      control of blood pressure and heart rate, and less or no influence on endothelial function.

      Therefore, the aims of this study are 1) to determine the effects of short-term smoking
      cessation on endothelial function and autonomic regulation, and 2) to determine if these
      effects will be altered during treatment with varenicline.
