      ocular surface disorders and the enhancement of corneal wound healing. Umbilical cord serum
      is also proven to be effective in treatment of dry eye and persistent corneal epithelial
      defects. However, there are limited studies comparing the corneal epithelial wound healing
      promoting effects between these two blood derived products. The purpose of this study is to
      test the corneal epithelial wound healing promoting effects between auto serum and human cord
      blood serum. Primary cultured bovine corneal epithelial cells were used as the model to
      investigate wound healing, cell proliferation and migration by means of scratch corneal wound
      healing assay evaluation, MTS assay and Boyden chamber migration assay in response to human
      serum and umbilical cord serum. The concentrations of EGF, TGF-Î²1, and fibronectin were also
      compared between human serum and umbilical cord serum with ELISA kits.
