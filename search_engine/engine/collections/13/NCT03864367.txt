      patients, with the aim of improving overall functional and patient-reported outcomes while
      decreasing complications and readmissions. Almost 50% of the adult population in the United
      States has osteopenia or osteoporosis, with over 2 million fragility fractures per year and a
      projected $25 billion in costs by 2025. These patients are at high risk for readmission due
      to complications, and at increased risk of mortality with these complications. Sarcopenia, a
      generalized loss of skeletal muscle associated with aging, has also been associated with
      increased disability and increased risk of future fracture in these patients. The
      investigator's study aims to assess the value of weight-support therapy for geriatric
      patients with lower extremity trauma in improving their overall risk of future injury and
      disability.
