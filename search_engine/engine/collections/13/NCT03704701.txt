      of cardiovascular disease. This risk is greatest in patients on dialysis and is not explained
      by conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Myocardial fibrosis, so called Cardiomyopathy of
      CKD (CM-CKD), in conjunction with excessive arterial calcification, forms the pathological
      basis for this excess risk. Due to limitations of using myocardial biopsy, combined with the
      inability to use gadolinium-enhanced imaging in patients with advanced CKD, there is an
      urgent need for reliable non-invasive ways of diagnosing and investigating CM-CKD.

      Study participants: Adult patients established on regular hospital-based haemodialysis, with
      evidence of recurrent fluid overload requiring fluid removal by ultrafiltration on dialysis.

      Study design: This is a single centre observational study. We will perform cardiac MRI (CMR),
      contrast CT and blood tests in 30 patients before haemodialysis, with a repeat CMR and blood
      tests post-dialysis.

      Objectives: To assess:

        1. If myocardial native T1 mapping on CMR is affected by fluid status and therefore test
           the validity of T1 mapping as a marker of fibrosis within the dialysis population?

        2. If contrast-enhanced dynamic-equilibrium CT can refine insights into the myocardium in
           CM-CKD?

        3. If novel CMR methods can effectively identify and delineate arterial calcification
           compared to CT?

      Relevance: This project will have immediate clinical relevance by clarifying key questions in
      the diagnosis and investigation of CM-CKD. It will also inform as to the potential role for
      these novel imaging biomarkers as surrogate end-points for use in future clinical trials
      exploring disease specific drug therapies.
