      approximately 60 patients in Part A and approximately 25 patients in Part B.

      Part A enrolls patients with ITP who are refractory or relapsed with no available and
      approved therapeutic options. Eligible patients have a platelet count <30,000/μL on two
      counts no sooner than 7 days apart in the 15 days before treatment begins. The active
      treatment period is 24 weeks and the post-treatment follow-up period is 4 weeks. In the
      dose-finding part of the study, each patient enrolled in the study is allowed to up-titrate
      their dose after 28 days of PRN1008 therapy, if they do not experience a platelet response or
      a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the last dose level. Patients who respond to PRN1008 per
      protocol may enter a long term-extension.

      Part B of the study will include approximately 25 patients with ITP who have relapsed or have
      an insufficient response to prior therapies. Eligible patients will have a platelet count
      <30,000/µL on two occasions no less than 7 days apart, within 15 days before treatment begins
      and a platelet count of ≤35,000/µL on Study Day 1 (SD1). The study consists of a 28-day
      screening period, 24-week active treatment period, and a long-term extension. After the last
      dose of PRN1008 there will be a 4-week safety follow-up period.
