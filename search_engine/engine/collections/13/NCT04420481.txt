      standard heart failure therapy in patients with congestive heart failure due to ischaemic
      heart disease.

      A 12 month study, consisting of a 9 month double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised growth
      hormone treatment phase followed by a 3 month growth hormone treatment-free period.

      STUDY PHASE: III

      COORDINATING CENTRE:

      Endocrine Cardiac Unit (ECU) Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sahlgrenska S-413 45 Göteborg
      Sweden

      STUDY PRODUCT:

      Somatropin, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), Saizen® 8 mg (24 IE).

      CONTROL PRODUCT:

      Placebo for Saizen®

      DOSAGE OF STUDY PRODUCT:

      1,4 mg (4,2 IE) every other day.

      DOSAGE:

      9 month treatment period and a 3 month follow-up period. ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION One
      subcutaneous injection of Saizen® of study product, or corresponding placebo in the thigh or
      abdomen given in the evening given every other day.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Double-blind (regarding treatment), parallel, placebo-controlled, randomised.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Female and male patients 75 years of age or below with congestive heart failure (NYHA class
      II or III) due to ischemic heart disease.

      NUMBER OF PATIENTs:

      54 evaluable patients. MULTICENTRE: Yes. NUMBER OF CENTRES: Four

      ALLOCATION OF TREATMENT:

      Randomisation to treatment if all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To investigate the effect of subcutaneously administered Saizen® compared with placebo on
      left ventricular endsystolic volume by MRI in patients with congestive heart failure due to
      ischaemic heart disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine the effect of Saizen® on enddiastolic volume, left ventricular mass and left
      ventricular ejection fraction

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      To determine the effect of Saizen® on change in NYHA class after 9 months of follow up.

      To determine the effect of Saizen® on circulating levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and to evaluate
      the correlation between changes in IGF-I and the respective changes in left ventricular
      ejection fraction, wall stress and left ventricular mass.

      To evaluate the effect of Saizen® on quality of life by using two different questionnaires
      (Minnesota - Living with Heart Failure and Cardiac Health Profile).

      To determine the effect of Saizen® on neurohormonal activation by measuring NT-proBNP

      SAFETY VARIABLES:

      Hospitalization, morbidity and mortality.

        -  Clinical events, including tendency to fluid retention, glucose intolerance, arrhythmias
           and worsening heart failure.

        -  Electrolytes, haematology, prothrombin complex, parameters for renal and hepatic
           function.

      ADVERSE EVENTS:

      Spontaneously reported from patients and asked for. To be recorded in Case Report Forms
      (CRFs) and on separate Adverse Event form if serious Adverse Event.

      STATISTICS AND DATABASE MANAGEMENT:

      Data management will be performed by Scandinavian Contract Research Institute and when clean
      file is declared data will be made available to the statistician for the analysis. The
      analysis will be performed according to the intention to treat principle.
