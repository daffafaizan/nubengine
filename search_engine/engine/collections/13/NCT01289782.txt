    
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither physician nor participants know the name of the
      assigned drug), placebo-controlled study of TMC435 in participants who are infected with
      genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV), who have never received treatment for HCV infection
      before. Participants in this study will also receive two other drugs for their HCV infection
      called peginterferon alpha-2a (PegIFN alpha-2a) and ribavirin (RBV). The purpose of the study
      is to investigate if TMC435 is superior to placebo in reducing plasma levels of HCV
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) to an undetectable level 12 weeks after the end of treatment. For the
      first 12 weeks, participants will take either TMC435 or placebo, plus PegIFNÎ±-2a and RBV. For
      the next 12 weeks, participants will take PegIFN alpha-2a and RBV only. After that, some
      participants will continue to take PegIFN alpha-2a and RBV for up to 24 additional weeks and
      some will stop taking PegIFN alpha-2a and RBV depending on response-guided treatment
      criteria. The study doctor will inform each participant about how to take their study
      medication and when they should stop taking it. After a participant stops taking study
      medication, they will continue to come to the doctor's office for study visits until a total
      of 72 weeks after they enroll in the study. The total duration of the study is 78 weeks
      (including screening). Participants will be monitored for safety throughout the study.
