      that also elevates prolactin levels. It has been shown to safely increase the milk supply of
      lactating women. To date, researchers have analyzed the effects of domperidone on lactating
      woman with respect to the quantity of their milk production, adverse effects, and drug levels
      in the breast milk. However, the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient composition of
      breast milk has not been studied and current guidelines for fortification of human milk for
      premature infants do not distinguish between those women using or those not using
      domperidone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of domperidone (given to
      lactating mothers of very preterm infants) on the macronutrient composition of human milk.
