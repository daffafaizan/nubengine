      patients with stroke, education regarding the risk factors of recurrent stroke is a crucial
      part of effective care for patients with stroke. The aim of this study was to develop an
      application capable of providing health education for recurrent-stroke prevention. We also
      examined the effectiveness of this app for improving stroke-related knowledge and HRQOL in
      patients with stroke.
