      especially in the initial period.

      Auricular acupoint stimulation is one of the therapeutic methods of traditional Chinese
      medicine. It is widely applied in various diseases. Researches had concluded the use of
      auricular acupoint stimulation on amplifying the anesthesia effect, weight reduction and the
      cessation of substance abuse. This study aimed to investigate the immediate effect of
      non-invasive auricular acupoint stimulation on the performance and the meridian activities of
      archery athletes.

      The investigators will collect the meridian activities and balance index with Ryodoraku
      device, the continuous heart rate record and the scores of the two sections as the
      performance. The participants will rate their attention and fatigue levels through filling
      the self-reported questionnaires.
