      I. To establish the possibility of anti-SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immunity transfer from matched
      related (MRD) or unrelated (MUD) HCT donor to HCT recipient.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore anti-SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immunity transfer in the haploidentical (haplo) HCT
      setting.

      II. To assess the prevalence and change over time of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive donors among all
      consented donors.

      OUTLINE:

      DONORS: Prior to HCT, sibling donors (MRD and haplo) undergo a nasopharyngeal swab per
      standard of care for SARS-Cov-2 testing. For MUD donors, initial testing may consist of a
      questionnaire. All donors undergo collection of blood and saliva at the time of
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Donors' medical charts are also reviewed.

      RECIPIENTS: Patients undergo a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-Cov-2 testing at 30, 60, 90, 120
      days post-HCT, and afterwards as deemed necessary by the treating physician. Patients also
      undergo the collection of blood and saliva specimens at days 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180
      post-HCT. Recipients' medical charts are also reviewed.
