      randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness (including optimal timing and frequency) of
      membrane sweeping to prevent post-term pregnancy. We will also assess the acceptability and
      feasibility of the proposed trial interventions to clinicians and women (through focus group
      interviews).

      Methods/Design

      Multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, pilot randomised controlled trial with an embedded
      factorial design. Pregnant women with a live, singleton fetus ≥ 38 weeks gestation, cephalic
      presentation, longitudinal lie, intact membranes, English speaking and ≥18 years of age will
      be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to:

      • Membrane sweep versus no membrane sweep

      Women allocated randomly to a sweep will then be randomised further (factorial component) to:

        -  early (from 39 weeks) versus late (from 40 weeks) sweep commencement; and

        -  a single verses weekly sweep

      The proposed feasibility study consists of four work packages i.e., (1) a multicentre, pilot
      randomised trial, 2) a health economic analysis and 3) a qualitative study (4) a study within
      the host trial (a SWAT).
