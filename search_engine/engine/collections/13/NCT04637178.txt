      training routines generally leads to improved endurance performance. However, this is not
      always the case, with several individuals failing to respond in the expected manner. This
      inter-individual variation is likely associated with inherent cellular and molecular
      charateristics of skeletal muscle. Indeed, responses to resistance training seem to be
      associated with muscle biological characteristics such as muscle fiber composition and
      ribosomal content (during the early phase of resistance training).

      The study will investigate the association between muscle fibre composition (type I vs type
      II muscle fiber proportions) / ribosomal content in m. vastus lateralis and the effects of 10
      weeks of resistance training on endurance performance in 52 elite cyclists. Half the
      participants will perform resistance training in addition to their habitual endurance
      training routines, the other half will perform endurance training-only. Muscle biopsies will
      be sampled from m. vastus lateralis before and after the first two weeks of the intervention.
      For muscle fiber composition, the hypothesis is that larger proportions of type II fibers
      will be associated with more pronounced benefits of resistance training. For ribosomal
      content, the hypothesis is that higher rRNA content at baseline and larger increases in rRNA
      content during the initial part of the intervention will be associated with more pronounced
      benefits of resistance training. No changes are expected in the non-resistance training
      control group.
