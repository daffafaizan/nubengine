        -  Determine the safety of administering MART-1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells to patients
           with stage IV or relapsed malignant melanoma.

        -  Determine the immunological and clinical responses in this patient population after this
           therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis between days -14 to -8. Mononuclear cells are isolated, used
      to generate dendritic cells (DC), and then pulsed with MART-1 peptide. Patients are
      vaccinated with MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC either IV or intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
