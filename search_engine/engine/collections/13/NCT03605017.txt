      improve higher level attention (switching between tasks and multi-tasking) for persons with a
      traumatic brain injury. 14 individuals with TBI will be recruited. Baseline assessment
      includes neuropsychological evaluation using traditional measures as well as a completion of
      a number of questionnaires designed to measure everyday attention and everyday functioning.
      Participants are random assigned to either the experimental or control groups. Experimental
      and control treatments include two 60 minute sessions, twice per week, for 5 weeks. Follow-up
      assessment includes a neuropsychological evaluation using traditional measures as well as a
      completion of a number of questionnaires designed to measure everyday attention and everyday
      functioning. Protocol efficacy will be determined by improvements between baseline and
      follow-up on several objective and functional measures of divided attention and set-shifting.
