      ages of 21-65 who smoke at least 10 cigarettes a day for at least one year.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of reduced oxidative/ nitrogen species
      (ROS/RNS) cigarettes compared to high ROS/RNS cigarettes.

      Study participation lasts 8 weeks, with 5 study visits at the Hershey Medical Center. All
      eligible participants will be given Spectrum research cigarettes, provided free of charge,
      and will be asked to only smoke those cigarettes for the first four weeks of the study.
      Following that four-week period of time all participants will be given low ROS content
      cigarettes (American Spirit Dark Green or Pall Mall Red). Participants will be asked to smoke
      only these cigarettes for the final four weeks of the study, these cigarettes will also be
      provided to you free of charge.
