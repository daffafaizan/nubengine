    
      Patients with tics will be recruited to participate in an observational study assessing
      extent and variation in non-motor features of Tourette syndrome over time. Each participant
      will complete a battery of validated questionnaires and scales online or in paper format (per
      patient preference), including the Premonitory Urge to Tic Scale (PUTS), the Sensory Gating
      Inventory (SGI), the Sensory Perception Quotient, the World Health Organization ADHD
      Self-Report Screening Scale, and others. These questionnaires will be administered annually
      to patients.
