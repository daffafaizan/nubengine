      reveal tumor mutation status in lung cancer patients and a few researches have shown the
      potential ability of using circulating tumor DNA in surveillance. However, no study focused
      on the value of methylation status of circulating tumor DNA in the surveillance and no strict
      prospective study has been performed in surgical lung cancer patients.

      The investigators plan to analyze the dynamic change of circulating tumor DNA and its
      methylation status longitudinally from preoperation to long term follow-up in surgical lung
      cancer patients, and compare assessment value between circulating tumor DNA detection with
      methylation , traditional imaging examinations and traditional blood tumor markers in the
      monitoring process.
