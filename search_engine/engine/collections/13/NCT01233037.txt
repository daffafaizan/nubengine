    
      This is a non-randomized, feasibility study of endothelial function, exercise capacity, and
      outcome following pre-LVAD patients through LVAD therapy and cardiac transplantation.

      The study period will be 5 years. It is anticipated that 20 patients will be enrolled and 15
      will survive (published survival estimate following LVAD is approximately 75% at one year) to
      complete the one-year follow-up period. 10 patients are anticipated to undergo heart
      transplant within 3 years of initial enrollment and they will be followed until their 2nd
      annual post-transplant invasive evaluation.
