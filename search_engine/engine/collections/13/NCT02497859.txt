      designs with subjects beginning on either an egg breakfast of higher protein quality or
      cereal breakfast of lower protein quality, and reversing to receive the breakfast not
      previously ingested. The subjects will consume breakfasts under supervision at our clinic on
      all days of the study, except for weekends. Subjects will be advised to continue eating their
      breakfast at home on weekends. All subjects will receive weight loss counseling and follow a
      weight loss diet for 2 weeks. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that when on a reduced
      calorie diet, intake of an egg breakfast compared to cereal breakfast increases satiety,
      reduces lunch time energy consumption and reduces dinner time energy consumption in clinical
      and free living condition. Insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY 3-36, ghrelin, plasma
      glucose, baseline and post intervention anthropomorphic measurements, and hunger
      questionnaires completed during the consumption of both breakfasts and subsequent meals will
      be compared. Experiment 2 will compare the effects of the two breakfasts on intake of foods
      considered tempting or highly palatable, and assessment of energy intake pre/post test lunch
      followed by offering brownies. It is hypothesized that consumption of an egg breakfast
      compared to cereal breakfast, will help in reducing intake of foods considered tempting.
