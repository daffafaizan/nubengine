    
      This study is conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed
      by preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.

      Patients with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma receive 2 cycles of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (paclitaxel 175 mg/м2 iv day 1, cisplatin 75 mg/м2 iv day 1, fluorouracil 750
      mg/m2/day continuous infusion, day 1-4 every 3 weeks). Patients who do not progress with
      distant metastases start preoperative chemoradiotherapy (paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 + cisplatin 20
      mg/m2 weekly + radiotherapy 44 Gy for 4 weeks).

      4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiation patients undergo Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy
      irrespectively of objective response.
