      furthermore, it affects activities of daily living and quality of life. Anatomical total
      shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is a well-established treatment for pronounced glenohumeral
      osteoarthritis. Several studies have suggested the need for trials comparing shoulder
      arthroplasty to non-surgical treatments.

      The ProAct trial is a Nordic multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients with
      glenohumeral osteoarthritis, eligible for a TSA will be randomised to either TSA followed by
      usual care or exercise only. The exercise intervention consists of 12 weeks of exercise with
      one weekly physiotherapist-supervised exercise session.

      The primary outcome will be the total the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder
      index score at 12 months follow-up.Outcome assessment will be performed at baseline, and at 3
      and 12 months and 2-, 5- and 10 years after start of surgical/non-surgical treatment.

      Patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria but declining to participate in the randomised
      trial will be offered the option of participating in an observational cohort using the same
      primary end point and patient reported outcomes, but following usual clinical practice.
