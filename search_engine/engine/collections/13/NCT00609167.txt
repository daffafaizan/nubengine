      Primary

      * To evaluate the response rate (complete response [CR], near CR [nCR], and very good partial
      response) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib in
      combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone .

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial response, PR, or better) in these patients
           after 4, 8, and 12 courses of this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the ability to successfully collect peripheral blood stem cells from these
           patients after 4 months of this regimen.

        -  To evaluate the CR or nCR rate in these patients after 8 and 12 courses of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; bortezomib IV on days 1, 4,
      8 , and 11 OR days 1, 8, 15 and 22; and dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 in courses
      1 and 2 and days 1, 18, 15, and 22 in all subsequent courses. Courses repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
