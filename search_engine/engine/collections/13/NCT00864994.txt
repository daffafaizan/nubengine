    
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

        1. Smoking history and behaviour, diet and physical activity level assessed by
           questionnaire

        2. Extensive lung function and CT scanning of the lung, ECG

        3. Candidate genes for muscle dysfunction and CVD risk

        4. Body composition (BIA, waist-hip ratio, DEXA-scan)

        5. Systemic inflammation

        6. Advanced Glycosylated Endproduct (AGE)

        7. Glucose tolerance test

        8. Risk factors of metabolic syndrome

        9. 6 minute walking distance

       10. Handgrip strength

       11. Skeletal muscle function by isokinetic dynamometry

       12. Physical activity level and pattern by accelerometry

       13. Muscle oxidative phenotype, fibre cross-sectional area and molecular signatures obtained
           in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies before and after incremental cycle ergometry

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness (if applicable):

        -  Totally 22 hours will be spend in the hospital during 3 visits

        -  CT-scanning of the lung is associated with a radiation burden of 0.8-1.6 mSv (dependent
           of body weight)

        -  50 ml peripheral blood (v. cubiti)

        -  Muscle biopsy may be associated with temporary pain and haematoma

        -  Drawing of arterial blood from the radial artery rarely leads to bleeding and transitory
           nerve damage (numb feeling in wrist/hand area).
