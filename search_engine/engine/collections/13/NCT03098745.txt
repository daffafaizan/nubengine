      comparing hydrogel and silicone hydrogel lens materials. It is anticipated that this study
      will involve 2 visits for each lens pair, as follows: Visits: V1 (lens dispensing), V2 (1
      hour post lens settling). Each subject will be randomized to wear each pair bilaterally in a
      series of three short fitting comparisons.
