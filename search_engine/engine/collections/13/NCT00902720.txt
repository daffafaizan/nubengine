    
      Women who have not yet undergone this procedure, and who present to the Fertility Consultants
      desiring fertility preservation, will be offered participation in the study.

      Subjects will undergo an initial visit which will include a blood draw, ultrasound, and any
      additional tests or exams that are medically indicated for the subject's diagnosis in
      preparation for surgery. Subjects will then undergo an oophorectomy surgery (removal of one
      or both ovaries). Following removal, subject's ovarian tissue will be cryopreserved (frozen)
      and stored for possible future use. We also plan to collect subjects medical history
      information to enter into a research database. Subjects will be followed until they decide to
      use their tissue for fertility purposes.

      We will also retrospectively enroll women who have already undergone this procedure by
      contacting them by mail and offering participation in our ovarian tissue cryopreservation
      database.
