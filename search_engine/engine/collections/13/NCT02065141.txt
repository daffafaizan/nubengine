      approximately 8 hours. On the study day protein digestion and absorption will be measured
      using a mixture of amino acids that are made slightly heavier than normal, called stable
      isotopes. Subjects will receive feeding by sips to monitor changes in digestion and
      absorption, which can be picked up by stable isotope technology.
