      intervention that aims to remit MetS by promoting the long-term adoption of healthier
      behaviors (diet, physical activity, stress reduction). Participants in 3ELM are randomly
      assigned to one of the study arms ("ELM Groups", "ELM Classes", "ELM Individual"); all of
      which receive some type of intervention in either group, class, or individual formats. The
      primary aim of this project is to pilot test the acceptability of each of the study arms and
      the outcome measures.

      The study also includes outcome assessments at 3 time points: at the start of the study, and
      at 3, and 6 months post baseline. All study participants will receive medical care (including
      metabolic syndrome care) from their regular medical doctors. Study staff will track
      participants' use of health care and wellness services during the study after obtaining
      participant permission to collect this data.
