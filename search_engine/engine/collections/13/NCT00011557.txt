      (FMS) as an assistive device for voiding in patients with SCI.

      Thirty six persons will be recruited and will undergo an 8 week protocol for conditioning of
      the bladder. The investigators propose to: investigate the changes in bladder function in
      response to long-term bladder conditioning by FMS; further optimize the FMS technology and
      parameters for effective bladder emptying in SCI; evaluate the role of the external sphincter
      muscle fatigue by FS in facilitating bladder emptying; critically evaluate the relative
      response of FMS data to existing information using functional electrical stimulation;further
      develop criteria that will be used to predict which SCI patients are optimally suitable for
      FMS; establish a comprehensive stimulation criteria that will reflect the safety and
      effectiveness of structures associated with the bladder that are exposed to the
      electro-myographic field.
