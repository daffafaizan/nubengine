      flavonoids, have been proposed, but associations between these compounds and FV intake are
      relatively weak. The investigators propose that, given the complexity of FV, production of an
      algorithm based on a wide variety of bioactive compounds found in FV might better predict FV
      consumption. A controlled feeding study (30 volunteers randomised to 2, 5 or 8 portions of FV
      day for 4 weeks) will allow development of such an algorithm. Volunteers will be recruited by
      advertisement from QUB and the general public, and will have all their food provided for the
      4 week period (two meals per day during the week to be consumed under supervision at the
      University).
