    
      This is a Phase 4, single-center, randomized clinical trial of the immune responses of
      children given one of two licensed influenza vaccines (either inactivated vaccine given IM or
      live, attenuated vaccine given intranasally). This study will enroll 40 healthy children 5-9
      years of age. Subjects will be randomized to receive either FluMist or Fluzone. FluMist is
      approved for children older than 5 years and Fluzone is also approved for a broader age
      indication starting at 6 months of age. Subjects who receive FluMist will have the vaccine
      administered intranasally by large particle aerosol, 0.25 mL per nostril. Subjects receiving
      Fluzone will receive 0.5 mL given intramuscularly into the non-dominant deltoid muscle.
      Children who have not previously been immunized against influenza will receive a second dose
      of vaccine 4 weeks after the first dose. Children who receive two doses of vaccine will
      remain on the study for 8-10 weeks. The primary objective of this study is to compare the
      effector B cell responses at Day7-9 and the CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, memory B-cell and
      the serology responses at Day 28 post-immunization following administration of one of two
      different influenza vaccines. Researchers will evaluate any increases in the immune response
      (CD4, CD8, B cell and serology responses) Day 0 to Day 7-9 for T-cells and ASCs, and from Day
      0-28 for memory B-cell and serology responses. NK-cell and homing studies will also be
      compared between the groups.
