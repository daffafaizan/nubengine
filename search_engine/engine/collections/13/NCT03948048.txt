      indicators and truncation values suitable for starting ECMO, and to construct a comprehensive
      prediction model, so as to determine the basis for the optimal timing of ECMO treatment in
      the future. The efficacy of ScVO2, lactic acid, and vasoactive inotrope score (VIS) on the
      ECMO treatment timing will also be evaluated. This study aims to evaluate and improve the
      clinical application of ECMO in the treatment of sepsis in children
