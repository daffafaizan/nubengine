    
      Compression therapy is widely used in the treatment of chronic venous leg ulcers (VLUs). The
      clinical performance of a compression system depends on the apply pressure and the stiffness.

      The static stiffness index (SSI) is defined by the difference in interface pressure measured
      when the subject is standing (working pressure) and the interface pressure measured when the
      subject is in the lying position (resting pressure).
