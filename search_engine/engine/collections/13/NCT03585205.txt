      their relationship is not simply linear. On one hand, stress disrupts the processes of
      attention, memory and complicated decision making. While on the other hand, stress response
      allows the individual to recognize threats quickly, react accordingly, return the body to
      homeostasis, and prepare the organism to future challenges. However, it is still unclear why
      different individuals deal with cognitive workload under stress differently, and which brain
      mechanisms are underlying these processes.

      In this current research the use of non invasive imaging techniques, such as EEG and fMRI, in
      addition to physiological measurements, such as heart rate, skin conductance, and eye
      movements, will allow an objective characterization of the individual's response to cognitive
      workload under stress.
