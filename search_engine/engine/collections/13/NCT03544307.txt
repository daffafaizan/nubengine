    
      Using a parallel experimental design, participants were randomly assigned to either a
      Taekwondo exercise training group (n=10) or non-exercising control group (n=10) for 12 weeks.

      Participant in the Taekwondo training group trained 3 days/week for 60 minutes per session,
      and the intensity progressed weekly. Participants in the control group performed no exercise
      intervention.
