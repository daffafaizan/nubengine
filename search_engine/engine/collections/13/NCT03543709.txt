      with disease activity and clinical findings in Behçet's disease. In the literature, the
      relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity has been assessed without
      discrimination between women and men. Behçet's disease is more active in men and fibromyalgia
      is more frequent in women. Evaluating the relationship between fibromyalgia and disease
      activity in Behçet's disease without gender discrimination may not be objective.There is not
      any study in literature evaluating relationship between fibromyalgia and disease activity in
      women with Behçet's disease.In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between
      fibromyalgia and disease activity in women with Behçet's disease.
