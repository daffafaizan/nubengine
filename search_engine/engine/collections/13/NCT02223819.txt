    
      Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, and arises from
      melanocytes within the choroid plexus of the eye. Melanomas of the ocular and adnexal
      structures comprise approximately 5% of all melanomas and are biologically and prognostically
      distinct from cutaneous melanoma. In the United States, an estimated 2000 patients are
      diagnosed with this disease each year.

      The development of metastasis in this disease is common and occurs in approximately 50% of
      patients with posterior uveal melanoma within 15 years after the initial diagnosis and
      treatment. Uveal melanoma is thought to be particularly resistant to systemic treatment, and
      no systemic therapy has yet been demonstrated to improve survival. Drugs commonly used to
      treat advanced cutaneous melanoma rarely achieve durable responses in patients with uveal
      melanoma.
