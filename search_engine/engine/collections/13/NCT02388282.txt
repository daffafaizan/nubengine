      pathophysiology role in many acute respiratory pathologies.

      The most accurate method to quantify PEEPi dyn is to measure the rise in transdiaphragmatic
      pressure (Pdi) at end expiration at the point of the contraction of the inspiratory muscles
      until inspiratory flow starts.

      Such method, however, is invasive, poor comfortable and require patient active collaboration.

      The purpose of this study is describe a new non-invasive method for estimate PEEPi dyn and
      validate this method with gold-standard-one.
