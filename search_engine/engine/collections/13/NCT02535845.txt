      vaccine coverage among adolescents age 13-17 is poor (60% for girls, 41.7% for boys).
      HPV-related cancers are a significant burden on the US healthcare system and could be
      prevented through adolescent vaccination. Rates of vaccination are suboptimal among
      underserved populations (uninsured, low-income, racial and ethnic minorities) often seen in
      safety-net clinics. Few interventions have been designed that target decision-making among
      parents of unvaccinated adolescents. Self-persuasion, generating of one's own arguments for a
      health behavior, may be an effective means of influencing HPV vaccination behaviors among
      undecided or ambivalent parents. Through three stages, investigators will identify and
      develop a self-persuasion intervention strategy to promote adolescent HPV vaccination in
      safety-net clinics. In Stage 3, reported here, investigators will conduct a two-arm pilot
      randomized control trial in the safety-net clinics to assess feasibility of testing the
      self-persuasion intervention condition against standard of care (control group).
      Investigators will also examine the impact of the intervention on parent-provider discussions
      about HPV vaccination.
