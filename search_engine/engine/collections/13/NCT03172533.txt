      deficits in AN patients, the impact of cortisol on neurocognitive performances in patients
      with AN and the effects of estrogen on neurocognitive features in healthy subjects, up to
      now, no study has implemented estrogen replacement in AN patients, in order to examine ist
      effects upon AN-associated psychopathology, neurocognition and peptides regulating appetite.
      Thus, this is the first study of its kind.

      Primary target: Assessment of the impact of sexual hormone replacement using an
      estrogen-progestin-combination as add-on to psychotherapy upon neurocognitive performance in
      patients suffering from anorexia nervosa by means of a neuropsychological test battery
      consisting of a test of verbal intelligence, the Trail making test A and B, a Go/No-go
      paradigm and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.

      Secondary targets:

        -  Examination of safety and tolerability of sexual hormone replacement using an
           estrogen-progestin-combination in patients with anorexia nervosa.

        -  Assessment of the impact of the sexual hormone replacement upon psychopathology in
           patients with anorexia nervosa by means of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire
           (EDE-Q) and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2).

        -  Assessment of the impact of substitution upon anxiety (STAI)

        -  Assessment of the impact on cortisol levels

        -  Assessment of the impact on appetite-regulating plasma peptides

        -  Assessment of the impact on the prescription of antidepressants
