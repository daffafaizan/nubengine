      intervention which we have demonstrated to be effective in the past. The 16-session,
      goal-driven behavioral weight control program offers weekly interactive modules that provide
      evidence-based health education on caloric balance and physical activity increases, with a
      goal of fostering changes in diet and exercise habits and producing weight losses of 5-10%.
      The intervention is based on social cognitive theory and uses a self-regulation approach to
      learning new lifestyle habits that can produce and maintain weight loss. Participants in all
      study arms will be provided with the same calorie and physical activity goals, and all
      participants will be asked to self-monitor their dietary intake and physical activity daily
      using an app on their smart phone. They will also be asked to weigh themselves daily,
      consistent with research indicating that daily weighing is associated with greater weight
      loss and participants will be provided with a Bluetooth-enabled "smart scale" that will
      communicate weight to the password-protected study website (visible to only the participant
      and study staff). The study website also provides the dynamic programmatic content, real time
      graphic feedback from self-monitoring (for each individual participant) and a study group
      discussion board for asynchronous group interactions and social support. The website includes
      the core aspects of the behavioral program and is to be provided to all participants.
