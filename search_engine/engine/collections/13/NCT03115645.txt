      diabetes, heart disease and premature death. Especially, in office workers sitting time per
      day can accumulate to over 10 hours a day. To reduce sitting time for office workers in a
      Dutch insurance company, an intervention will be implemented. The intervention contains the
      introduction of alternative workstations, intervention sessions with an occupational
      physiotherapist and an activity tracker with a self-help program booklet. The goal of this
      study is to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of this intervention on the short term (3
      months) and long-term (12 months). The primary outcome is objectively assessed sitting time.

      In a cluster randomized controlled trial 250 employees of an insurance company will
      participate in the study. After baseline measurements, matched departments will be randomly
      assigned to the control or intervention group. The evaluation includes an economic and
      process evaluation.
