      we investigate the influence of different anesthetics to alertness and nociception. In
      addition to auditory stimuli (AEP as a measure of sedation), Contact Heat Evoked Potential
      Stimuli (CHEPS), and esophageal evoked potentials from the lower 1/3 of the esophagus are
      measured to quantify the effects of anesthetics. 60 Volunteers are enrolled into this study.
      For each drug, three different levels are measured:

        -  level 1 no medication

        -  level 2 low dose of medication

        -  level 3 light sedation dose (volunteer responds to command)

      Four drugs are measured in the study:

      propofol, sevoflurane, S-ketamine and remifentanil.
