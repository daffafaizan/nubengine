      resting pain greater than 2 weeks with ulcers or gangrene in 1 or both extremities. Pain
      relief is a therapeutic challenge due to its severity, which significantly affects the
      quality of life, and the comorbidities that occur frequently in these patients, which limits
      the use of analgesics medications. Regional techniques can play an important role as they are
      safe and effective in analgesic management . Within these we find the ultrasound guided
      continuous sciatic block as a strategy to consider in the periods of exacerbation of pain, as
      a bridge to a palliative or resolutive management.

      Prospective descriptive exploratory cohort study.

      Patients with a diagnosis of critical ischemia of the lower limb with severe pain and side
      effects of opioids will be included. A continuous ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block with
      longitudinal approach will be performed, with no anti-aggregation or anticoagulation
      suspension, continuing with an infusion of Bupivacaine 0.1%

      The primary outcome will be numerical pain rating scale (NPrs) and secondary outcome Pinprick
      test, catheter duration, opioid consumption reduction and side effects to it.
