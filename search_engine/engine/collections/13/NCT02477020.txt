      people who have schizophrenia. This study will look at the different symptoms associated with
      schizophrenia including cognitive symptoms, personal and social functioning and functional
      capacity (ability to perform tasks associated with real, everyday life such as household
      chores, communication, finance, transportation, and planning recreational activities) in
      people who take TAK-063.

      The study enrolled 164 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-063 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take the tablets once daily at nighttime. All participants
      will initially receive TAK-063, 20 mg/day. The dose may be titrated down to 10 mg/day, if
      intolerable.

      The multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 6 weeks. Participants will be hospitalized until the Week 3
      visit. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic during the treatment and 1 visit during
      the follow-up.
