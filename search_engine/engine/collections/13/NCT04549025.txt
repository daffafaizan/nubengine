    
      JTX-4014 is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to PD-1 and
      block its interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to augment anti-tumor T cell
      activity. Vopratelimab is an agonist monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the
      Inducible CO-Stimulator of T cells (ICOS) to generate an anti-tumor immune response. This is
      a Phase 2, open label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability of JTX-4014 alone
      and in combination with vopratelimab in biomarker-selected adult subjects with metastatic
      NSCLC who are PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor na√Øve and have progressed on a platinum based chemotherapy
      regimen
