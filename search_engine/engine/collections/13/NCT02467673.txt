    
      In this open label study, 27 postmenopausal women, with no clinical evidence of
      cardiovascular disease, were randomly divided in two groups.

      During 12 weeks,

      15 patients received on the left forearm micronized (MIC) THT (micronized 17β-estradiol 2.5
      mg/day + progesterone 100 mg/day).

      and

      14 patients received a nanoparticulate (NANO) THT (nanoparticulate 17β-estradiol 2.5 mg/day +
      progesterone 100mg/day).

      After 12 weeks of treatment patients were evaluated.

      Baseline and Post-THT measures were determined: Insulin, body mass index, waist
      circumference, blood pressure, CRP-stratified levels, total testosterone, TSH and FSH levels.
