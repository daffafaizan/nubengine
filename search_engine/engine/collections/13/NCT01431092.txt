      despite lack of evidence of its use. It is often difficult to discontinue use of
      benzodiazepines because of development of dependence.

      After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (CircadinÂ®) 2 mg daily versus matching
      placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their benzodiazepine dose towards no
      intake. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up regarding medical treatment,
      cognition, psychophysiology, sleep, laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social
      function, and quality of life. Data on medical treatment, cognition, adverse events, social
      function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months follow-up.

      The results from this trial will assess if melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term
      benzodiazepine administration in schizophrenia patients. This group of patients is difficult
      to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced
      life expectancy compared to the background population. In addition, the data of the trial are
      also analyzed as an observational cohort design to investigate the association of
      benzodiazepine dose reduction/discontinuation with psychophysiology, cognition, sleep,
      quality of life, and other selected variables (not further described below, see trial
      protocol). Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of
      patients.
