    
      This is a prospective, multi-center study that will examine subjects with documented mild to
      advanced primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), who may or may not have a cataract requiring
      removal and placement of an intraocular lens.

      Study subjects will be grouped by the severity of their disease (either mild/moderate or
      advanced). If all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met subjects in all four groups will
      be implanted with the Hydrus Aqueous Implant. Subjects in whom a cataract is present will
      undergo standard cataract removal and IOL implantation concurrent with implantation of the
      Hydrus.

      Postoperatively, subjects will undergo a complete ophthalmic evaluation at regularly
      scheduled intervals.
