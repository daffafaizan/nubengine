    
      This study has been designed as a Phase I, open-label, dose finding study with a dose
      escalation part and a dose expansion part in adult patients with selected advanced solid
      tumors. The study treatment, TNO155 alone or in combination with EGF816 (nazartinib), will be
      taken until the patient experiences unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease and/or
      treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or the patient or due to
      withdrawal of consent. Some patients will be participating in a food effect investigation as
      an exploratory objective.
