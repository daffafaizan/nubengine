      visits (84% women) in the United States in 2007. Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs)
      are UTIs diagnosed on at least 2 urine cultures in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year. The
      incidence of rUTIs increases in menopause with an estimated 10-15% of women > 60 years old
      having rUTIs. rUTIs contribute to a constellation of bothersome genitourinary symptoms in
      some postmenopausal women called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Thus, menopause,
      rUTIs, and GSM are intimately linked.

      Prasterone (IntrarosaÂ®) is a synthetic version of the steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016 for the treatment of moderate to
      severe dyspareunia due to GSM. Large, prospective studies have shown prasterone to safely
      decrease vaginal pH, decrease parabasal cells, increase superficial cells, and decrease
      symptoms related to atrophy like dyspareunia in women with GSM. Given prasterone's favorable
      treatment effects on some GSM symptoms, investigation of prasterone as a possible treatment
      option for rUTIs in the setting of GSM is warranted.

      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing the
      efficacy of nightly intravaginal prasterone for 24 weeks to intravaginal placebo in
      decreasing rUTIs in women with GSM. The study hypothesis is that intravaginal prasterone
      decreases UTI incidence in women with GSM compared to placebo.
