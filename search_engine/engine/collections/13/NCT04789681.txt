      I. To determine whether canakinumab increases regression rate of high-risk pulmonary nodules.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether canakinumab prolongs lung cancer-free survival. II. To determine
      whether canakinumab decreases the incidence of lung cancers. III. To assess the safety and
      tolerability of canakinumab in patients with high-risk indeterminate pulmonary nodules
      (IPNs).

      IV. To assess quality of life by patient reported outcomes in patients treated with
      canakinumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the radiographic (including radiomic features) evolution of high-risk IPNs with
      treatment of canakinumab and to assess their association with risks of lung cancer as well as
      their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with canakinumab.

      II. To explore the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire evolution of patients with high-risk IPNs
      and assess their association with risks of lung cancer as well as their association with
      clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with canakinumab.

      III. To explore the evolution of serum soluble factors, such as IFN-gamma and interferon
      inducible factors (such as CXCL9 and CXCL10), IL-12, TNFalpha, IL-10, TGF-beta, VEGF, IL-6,
      IL-8, IL-17, IL-18, C-reactive protein etc.) and assess their association with risks of lung
      cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with
      canakinumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive canakinumab subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.
