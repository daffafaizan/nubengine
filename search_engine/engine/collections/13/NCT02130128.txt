      in the lungs. This feasibility study is being conducted to assess the safety and yield of the
      LungPoint ATV System in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose
      highly suspicious lung cancer. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor
      is conducted.
