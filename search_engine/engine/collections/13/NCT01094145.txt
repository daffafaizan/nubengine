      enrolled and implanted with bilateral electrodes in the nucleus basalis Meynert. The
      stereotactic implantation of the electrodes will be guided by computerized tomography (CT)
      and magnetic resonance tomography (MRT).

      Basically, even though deep brain stimulation is an invasive method, there are only few side
      effects. Surgical risks correspond with the risk of DBS in morbus Parkinson or other movement
      disorders (0,4-6%).

      After the baseline examination, the patients will be implanted with the electrodes;
      accordingly all follow-ups are accomplished postoperative. From the second week after the
      operation, the conventional stimulation takes place as a doubleblind, randomized change
      between ON and OFF periods. Modifications of the stimulation parameter to obtain the best
      possible result are possible.

      Throughout the one-year observation-period, the patients will be followed closely to monitor
      the effects of DBS on their cognitive abilities, psychopathological well being, the quality
      of life, praxie and nutritional condition using standardized neurological and psychiatric
      rating scales.
