      complete wound closure (defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing
      requirement) or 24 weeks, whichever occurs first.

      If a patient has multiple ulcers on one foot, all may be treated, within the maximum of 24
      weeks. If the ulcer does not heal, after a wash out period of 1 week, a new treatment period
      of up to 24 weeks may be initiated. Ulcer may be retreated if it recurs or if a new ulcer
      develops that meets study criteria.

      For the entire duration of each treatment period the standard of care for DFU will be
      maintained.
