      Training (EMC) and a control group will receive a journal workshop.

      The evaluator will be blind to the group that owns the patients included. The total simple
      will be of 122 people with a psychotic disorder, less than 5 years of evolution and a score
      at or above 3 on the PANSS during the last year. Patients should be attended in one of the
      next services: Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, Corporació Sanitària Parc Taulí, Hospital de
      la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Hospital Clínic de Valencia, Centre d´Higiene Mental de les Corts,
      Institut d´Assitència Sanitària Girona, Servicio Andaluz de Granada, Málaga y Jaén. The
      assessment was performed at baseline, at the end of treatment and six month follow-up.

      The assessment includes: psychopathology and insight ( PANSS, PSYRATS, PDI, GAF, BDI, BCIS,
      Sumd), meta-cognition (jumping to conclusions, IPSAQ, TCI), neuropsychology (WCST, TMT,
      CPT-II, TAVEC, WAIS) and social functioning and quality of life (EFS, DAS-SV, SLDS). The
      insight will be assessed at the final of each session (BCIS). The treatment and control group
      consist of 8 weekly sessions of 45-60 minutes with a total of 4 to 8 patients per group. The
      EMC group material is translated and validated in Spanish by investigators of the team.

      The primary analysis variable is the difference between the scores of experimental and
      control group in the symptoms scales (especially positive). Secondary outcomes will change in
      other assessments of social functioning, metacognition (cognitive distortions and theory of
      mind) and neuropsychological variables. Were analyzed using regression and ANCOVA methods
      with SPSS 19.
