      enrolling up to 12 subjects. Each patient will be followed for 2 years. The last patient's
      follow-up will end in February 2016. It is planned that the study will end in June 2016.
      Study endpoints are defined in accordance with the "Standardized endpoint definitions for
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation clinical trials: a consensus report from the Valve
      Academic Research Consortium (VARC-2)". These endpoint definitions combine the expertise of
      surgeons, interventionalists, medical cardiologists, clinical trial and other specialists and
      allow for comparison of different trials concerning effectiveness and safety in TAVI.
