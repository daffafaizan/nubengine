    
      The study will be a double-blinded cross-over study. Thirty subjects will be screened for
      eligibility initially, and the first 12 eligible subjects will be enrolled. Six subjects will
      be randomized to receive the low GH dose (0.1 mg/day) treatment and 6 subjects to receive
      Placebo treatment for 12 weeks, exchanging their treatment for a further 12 weeks after a
      4-week washout period. The study drugs will be stored at the Oregon Health and Science
      University (OHSU) Research Pharmacy and following randomization, the subjects will be taught
      by our Endocrine Nurses to self-administer the subcutaneous GH and Placebo injections using
      Nutropin/Placebo vials and insulin syringes into the abdomen at 2200h. Randomization for
      treatment assignment will be performed by an investigator not directly involved in the
      patients' recruitment, treatment and follow-up care. The randomization process will be
      performed by computerized pre-assigned random codes by blocks, stratified by age and examined
      for possible differences in body mass index. During their in-patient stay at the Oregon
      Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) at OHSU, subjects will only be allowed
      to eat the food provided to them by the OCTRI.

             -  Because of the potentially long duration of Visits 1, 2 and 4, the studies can
                either be divided into two separate admissions upon prior arrangement or can be
                done all at once with one admission, depending on the subject's wishes and
                schedule.
