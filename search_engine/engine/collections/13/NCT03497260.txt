      patients. Traditional treatment guidelines for exercise emphasizing the reduction of insulin
      doses and/or ingestion of additional carbohydrates are of limited applicability for patients
      treated with ultra-long acting basal insulin analogues. Dose reductions may require two to
      three days for modern basal insulin analogues in order to achieve an adapted steady state,
      hereby increasing the risk of inadequate insulin-following exercise. If T1D patients engage
      in recreational exercise - as recommended by every international treatment guideline -
      current treatment strategies may simply not be sufficient.

      As a consequence for patients treated with modern basal insulin analogues, it seems more
      adequate not to modify insulin doses but to apply alternative strategies for recreational
      exercise. The ingestion of fructose, an insulin-independent carbohydrate, which increases
      lipid oxidation but attenuates the dependency on carbohydrates may offer a novel strategy. Up
      to date, only preliminary data for fructose have been produced regarding clinical
      effectiveness and underlying mechanisms in the prevention of hypoglycaemia. The present
      comprehensive study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy, feasibility, and safety of a
      pre-exercise oral fructose load without modification of insulin degludec in T1D patients.
