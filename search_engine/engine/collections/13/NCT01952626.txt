      However, pruritus is one of the most common side effects associated with intrathecal
      morphine. Specific serotonin receptor antagonists such as ondansetron could be an effective
      prophylactic treatment of neuraxial opioid-induced pruritus. It was reported that
      palonosetron is more effective than ondansetron for prevention of postoperative nausea and
      vomiting. Therefore, the investigators evaluated the efficacy of prophylactic administration
      of ondansetron and palonosetron for the prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus.
