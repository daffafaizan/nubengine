      include intensive medical therapy, surgical revascularization, ventricular remodeling, and
      heart transplantation. Medical treatment alone is problematic because of limited long-term
      survival. Heart transplantation offers excellent results with a 65.6 % 5-year survival rate;
      however, the scarcity of donor organs, the need for lifelong immunosuppression and the fact
      that heart transplantation has been restricted to those without co-morbid medical conditions
      and relatively restricted to those younger than 65 years of age makes this option impractical
      for a majority of patients. As a result, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is the
      optimal therapeutic approach and remains superior to medical therapy. Numerous controlled
      trials of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with low left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF), have shown that these are the patients that benefit most from
      revascularization, especially if symptoms of angina or ischemia are present. This benefit is
      not only for symptoms, but also on longevity. It is believed that the most important factor
      for successful surgical recovery may be the viability of revascularized myocardium.
