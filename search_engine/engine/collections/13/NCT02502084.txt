      the nasal anatomy and paranasal sinuses (Maxillary, Frontal and Sphenoid sinuses) in patients
      suffering from symptoms attributable to sinusitis is feasible; This is an essential step in
      the development of a system that will later allow visualization, sampling, and treatment of
      the sinuses via the natural sinus ostium during the patient's first office visit in a
      minimally invasive manner while enabling treatment by lavage, and minimizing radiation
      exposure, antibiotic use, multiple office visits, and cost.
