    
      The initial trial design randomized subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive a Rheos system plus
      medical management (Device Arm) or to receive medical management alone (Medical Management
      Arm). On March 24, 2011, the study closed to enrollment before adequate endpoint data was
      collected and before enrollment was completed; 19 subjects had been randomized, 10 device and
      9 medical management. Medical management subjects were withdrawn from the study and subjects
      who had been implanted with the device were given the opportunity to continue in the study
      under long-term follow-up; 8 of the 10 device subjects continued in the study. Long-term
      follow-up visits occurred at 15 and 18 months post-randomization; visits occur semi-annually
      until study closure.

      The study was not stopped for safety or futility, but for business/strategic reasons due to
      production of a new generation of the device.
