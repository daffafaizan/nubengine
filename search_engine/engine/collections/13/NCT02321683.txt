      either femoral stems with plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coating or stems with
      electrochemically deposited hydroxyapatite. This patients will be followed for at least 5
      years. The outcome is evaluated by comparing stability measured by RSA and periprosthetic
      bone remodeling measured by bone densitometry.
