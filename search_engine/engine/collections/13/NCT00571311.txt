      parents understood the study information presented, made decisions about enrolling,
      experienced the process of assent and consent, and perceive the experience of participating
      in research. Interviews will be conducted with adolescents participating in clinical research
      and with one of their parents. Adolescents with a number of disorders including cancer,
      chronic diseases, bipolar disorder, obesity, and HIV, as well as healthy controls who are
      enrolled in NIH intramural protocols will be interviewed.
