      heterogeneous histopathologic subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for 5%~10%.
      The frequency of ENKTL among NHL patients is significantly higher in Asia than in Western
      countries. Despite radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for ENKTL patients is poor,
      with 5-year median survival time for primary nasal site was 5 years, for non-nasal extranodal
      sites 6 months. ENKTL is so aggressive and has high mortality rate and till now there is no
      standard therapy. In recent years SMILE chemotherapy has clinical efficacy and is one of
      first line therapy for ENKTL. However it is apparent that this regimen is extremely toxic
      with grade 4 neutropenia especially for Asian patients. On these grounds, new therapy MESA is
      used for Asian patients with ENKTL in order to achieve good efficacy and safety.
