      eligible for inclusion. 15 patients in each group will be recruited. One group receives a
      unipolar hemiarthroplasty and 15 receives a bipolar arthroplasty. Tantalum markers are placed
      around the acetabulum during surgery. Follow-up intervals are at 3, 12 and 24 months with
      radiostereometric evaluation (radiographs) and clinical evaluation.
