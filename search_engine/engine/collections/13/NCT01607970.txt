      that of negative ones, although it is unclear whether the latter causes blunted emotional
      responses. After OXT or placebo application participants are exposed to acoustic startle
      probes presented alone and during viewing of 60 color pictures mostly selected from the
      'International Affective Picture System'. The paradigm featured 20 negative (mostly
      threatening), 20 neutral, and 20 positive pictures, presented for 5 s each. In the other part
      of the experiment, after intranasal OXT or placebo application participants respond to 60
      moral dilemmas.
