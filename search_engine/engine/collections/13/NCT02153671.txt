      (IIV) in healthy adult subjects who received A(H5N2) live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)
      1.5 years earlier (September/October 2012) and compared this with a group of naive subjects
      that did not participate in the previous study. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the
      additional group of naive volunteers mirrored those utilized in the initial study.
