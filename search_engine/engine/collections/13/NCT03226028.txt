      also unavoidable in the perioperative period. Acute post-operative pain and anxiety have been
      managed via pharmacological interventions such as opioid-based analgesia for over a century.
      However, non-pharmacological interventions - such as music - have also been shown to safe and
      cost-effective, to improve the overall patient experience, and improve outcomes across a
      variety of surgical settings. Music has been shown to decrease pain in the perioperative
      period, to reduce plasma, urine, and salivary cortisol levels, modulate the inflammatory
      response (natural killer lymphocytes), blood pressure, and heart rate.Additionally, anxiety
      scores and pain scores (measured using the visual analog scale (VAS)) have shown
      statistically significant reductions in the perioperative period, when music therapy was
      available.

      From 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, there were 31,871 surgeries done in KK Women's and
      Children's Hospital (KKH). While music therapy in the hospital has been offered as a part of
      cognitive rehabilitation services or end of life care, there is little investigation found on
      its effect if used perioperatively in adult patients who undergo surgeries, especially in
      local setting. Based on the above rationale, the investigators shall therefore investigate
      the feasibility and practicability of deploying music listening in pain management in KKH,
      and further determine the nature of the music (duration, genre) by fitting the local context
      in order to improve the patient outcome in perioperative settings.
