      in adults with acute myeloid leukemia with chemotherapy treatment. We will assess cognitive
      function using a battery of neuropsychological assessments, patient-reported questionnaire,
      and semi-structured interviews among participants in both control and intervention groups.
      The group assignment will be conducted through parent study (NCT04570709). Participating in
      this study will not affect participants' group assignment.
