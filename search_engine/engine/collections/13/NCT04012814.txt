    
      Open-label, baseline-controlled, multi-center study evaluating a 1060 nm diode laser, pulsed
      electromagnetic fields and vacuum assisted radio frequency for non-invasive fat reduction of
      the abdomen and flanks. The study will enroll up to 200 subjects requesting non-invasive
      lipolysis of the abdomen and flanks. Each subject will receive up to 4 study treatments of
      the diode laser and up to 8 treatments of the pulsed electromagnetic fields and vaccum
      assisted radio frequency study treatments. Subjects will be followed at twelve weeks post
      final diode treatment. Twelve week post treatment outcome will be compared to baseline.
