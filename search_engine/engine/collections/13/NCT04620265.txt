      complications. So taking active intervention to reduce the risk of falls, improve gait
      performance and improve the quality of life in elderly with DPN is very important. Lower
      extremity aerobic exercise training via treadmill aiming for improving patients' physical
      activity levels is an important part in the rehabilitation program to enhance balance and
      walking functions and reducing the fall risk, .Treadmill training using s low-load walking
      provided by an emerging technology called lower body positive pressure (LBPP) that
      effectively reduces body weight could be preferable than other methods of unweighting
      treadmill because the air pressure is applied uniformly over the lower body. This kind of
      anti-gravity treadmill is ideal in reducing the formation of pain and pressure points that
      are common with harness-based unweighting systems. Many other advantages are also associated
      with this unique type of antigravity technology that could give it the superiority than the
      other types of unweighting treadmills in enhancing walking performance, reducing the risk of
      fall and improving quality of life in Saudi elderly people with DPN.
