      estimate the cerebral collateral circulation in ischemic regions and final infarct volume,
      comparing with traditional therapy such as Shuxuening injection, which will provide new
      evidence for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Perfusion Weighted Imaging(PWI) could be a
      method to reflect the infarction center and low perfusion of tissue.
