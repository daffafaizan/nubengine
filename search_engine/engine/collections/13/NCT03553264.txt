      head-mounted devices has been proposed in addition to conventional vestibular rehabilitation
      therapy in unilateral vestibular hypofunction patients. This approach has been proved to be
      useful in maximizing vestibular rehabilitation outcomes, with minimum simulator-related side
      effects. Virtual reality-based devices have been tested in vestibular rehabilitation by many
      clinicians, due to the possibility of achieving habituation, substitution and adaptation, the
      effectiveness in people presenting visual vertigo, and the positive effects on anxiety.

      Thus, due to the undeniable relevance of testing outcomes of vestibular rehabilitation, and
      the promising results of head-mounted device-based home exercises in ameliorating its
      effects, the aim of this study will be to compare - in terms of short- (one week) and
      long-term (one year) effects - the subjective and objective indicators of vestibular function
      in a population of patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction after completing
      conventional vestibular rehabilitation therapy with a randomized group who underwent a
      mixed-methods protocol including vestibular rehabilitation and head-mounted device treatment
      over the same period of time.
