      cirrhotic patients when studied with gadoxetic acid magnetic resonance imaging including the
      dynamic phase and the hepatobiliary phase at 10 and 20 minutes after contrast injection and
      to evaluate the usefulness of liver magnetic resonance imaging with gadoxetic acid in the
      differentiation between benign and malignant nodules in the cirrhotic liver. To determine the
      diagnosis and clinical significance of the infracentimetric additional nodules detected in
      the hepatobiliary phase
