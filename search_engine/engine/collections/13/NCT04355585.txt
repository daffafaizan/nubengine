    
      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study evaluating the
      effect of a single FDA-approved dose of colchicine in healthy adults on plasma GDF15 levels.
      Randomization will be stratified by sex as this may be a factor influencing GDF15 levels.

      On Day 1, subjects will be admitted on the CCI 9A unit early in the morning, 30 minutes
      before the study drug administration. They will be asked to fast from midnight before the
      dose until 2 hours after. Water is allowed during the fasting period. Baseline blood tests
      will be drawn and a peripheral line will be left in place for further blood draws. A dose of
      either colchicine or placebo will be administered. Blood samples will be drawn at 2, 4, 6, 8,
      10 and 12 hours. The patient will be discharged home after the last blood draw and the
      removal of the peripheral line. Two other blood draws will be performed using standard
      procedures at 24 and 48 hours post study drug administration at the research clinic
