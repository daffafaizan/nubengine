    
      Single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of four multiple-rising
      doses in four sequential groups of 10 healthy volunteers each. Eligible subjects were
      admitted to the UFH on the day (Day 0) prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.
      On the morning of the next day (Day 1), subjects started receiving BIA 6-512/Placebo at 4 h
      intervals (6 times/day) for 48 h (13 investigational product administrations, in total).
      Subjects remained confined in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last
      dose (Day 4); then, they were discharged and were requested to return for the follow-up
      visit. At given time-points, subjects were submitted to vital signs recording, brief
      neurological examination, and 12-lead ECG. Blood samples for plasma drug assays were taken at
      the following times: Dose 1: pre-dose and ¼, ½, ¾, 1, 1½, 2, and 3 hours post-dose; Doses 2,
      3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11: pre-dose; Dose 13: pre-dose and ¼, ½, ¾, 1, 1½, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
      16 and 24 hours post-dose.
