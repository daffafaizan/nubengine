      ovarian cancer patients undergoing surgical debulking. A core biopsy of tumor will be taken
      at the first opportune time during surgery. Dexamethasone 20 mg IV will then be administered,
      and a second biopsy taken 30 minutes later. Samples at two and four hours later will also be
      obtained if surgery is still in progress and biopsiable tumor remains. Tissue will be
      snap-frozen. Subsequently tumor will be microdissected out from stroma, and tumor RNA will be
      extracted for gene expression profiling. Sixteen patients with epithelial ovarian cancer
      receiving dexamethasone will be studied, and an additional eight patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer will receive a small saline (placebo) injection and serve as controls.
      Enrollment is limited to those patients with a serum albumin of at least 3.0 g/dL to minimize
      any theoretical adverse effect of a single dose of dexamethasone on wound healing.
