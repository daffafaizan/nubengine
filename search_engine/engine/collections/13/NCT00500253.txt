    
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic disease worldwide, imposing a substantial social
      burden on both children and adults.

      What needs to be kept in mind, especially in assessing treatment effect of allergic
      inflammation in children with asthma, is that symptom score and spirometry measures have
      limitations, mainly their subjectivity (symptom scores), wide variability, and lack of
      stability in short time period (symptom scores and spirometry measures).

      Monitoring allergic inflammation in the course of asthma in children with exhaled nitric
      oxide measurement (FeNO) may allow to titrate the dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids more
      precisely, depending on individual patients requirements.

      The aim of this study is to assess the utility of FeNO in treatment monitoring in children
      with asthma.

      According to the aim of the study following assumptions are formulated:

        1. Comparison of annual cumulative steroid dose, number of bronchodilator doses taken,
           number of asthma exacerbation, number of hospitalisation due to asthma, between group of
           children with asthma with FeNO monitored treatment (study group), and group of children
           with treatment monitored by GINA's grade of disease clinical control (control group)

        2. Assessment of corelation of FeNO (ppb) with symptom score (points)and lung function
           (FEV1)

        3. Comparison of values of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness with methacholine
           (PC20M)between both study groups after 12. months of treatment.
