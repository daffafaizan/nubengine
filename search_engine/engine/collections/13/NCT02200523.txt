      multiple steps that burden conventional EEG procedures into one. This proposed single-use
      electrode will consist of a Snap Top, Ag/AgCl Snap Conductor, Conductive Adhesive, and
      Abrader Tines in a custom molded housing and packed on a backing sheet. After removing the
      backing, the technician simply parts the hair with one hand and with the other hand rubs the
      electrode back and forth and then presses the electrode into position on the scalp. The
      proposed system combines the cumbersome and time-consuming skin preparation, electrode
      preparation and electrode fixation into one easy step. The investigators believe that the
      proposed system will reduce patient hookup time by more than 50% (from 40 to 20 minutes) with
      additional time savings on cleanup. Reducing the hookup time required for the EEG recording
      will make EEG more feasible in time critical situations and will improve patient care and
      service.
