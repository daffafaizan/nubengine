      of two treatment sequences. Each treatment sequence consists of two cycles of treatment - one
      with tampon use and one without tampon use. Tampon use will occur on Days 2 to 5 of
      contraceptive vaginal system (CVS) use and a new CVS will be used for each treatment cycle.
      Before starting Annovera use, each subject will use a combined oral contraceptive (COC) for
      one cycle.
