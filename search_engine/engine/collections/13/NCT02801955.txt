      dissemination of gastric adenocarcinoma is a controversial issue. It has been thought that
      there is a positive correlation between serum and peritoneal levels of carcinoembryonic
      antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 and pathologic features of gastric tumors and peritoneal
      dissemination.

      In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of serum and peritoneal CEA and CA 19-9 to
      predict TNM stages and peritoneal washing cytology in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma
      after curative gastrectomy, and to determine predictive value of these measurements to the
      development of recurrence and death.
