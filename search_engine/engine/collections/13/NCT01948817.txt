      weeks. After the baseline visit, patient visits will occur weekly during the first month
      because key safety parameters need to be performed weekly in the first month of treatment and
      then every 4 weeks thereafter until week 24 End of Treatment (EOT).

      Patients will have their first dose of study treatment at Visit 3. Safety assessments are
      routinely performed including collection of AEs (Adverse Events), SAEs (Serious ADverse
      Events<, vital signs, physical examination, ECG (Electrocardiograph), hematological and
      biochemistry assessments.

      Patients will continue therapy until intolerable toxicity, patient decision or after 24 weeks
      treatment duration at which point and End of Treatment (EOT) visit will be performed and the
      End of Treatment CRF( Case Report Form) will be completed.

      30 day Safety follow-up Patients who discontinue study drug before completing the study
      should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments
      listed for the final visit will be performed. At a minimum, all patients who discontinue
      study treatment, including those who refuse to return for a final visit, will be contacted
      for safety evaluations during the 30 days following the last dose of study drug.

      All patients must be followed for AEs and SAEs that may have occurred after discontinuation
      from the study treatment. The safety follow-up visit will take place 30 days after the last
      dose of study drug.
