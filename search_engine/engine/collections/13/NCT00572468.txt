      treatment option will be recruited to this trial. Forty-four subjects will be randomized to
      either placebo or simvastatin (40 mg po/day) for 4 weeks prior to surgery. Serum samples will
      be obtained at baseline and immediately prior to prostatectomy. At prostatectomy, cancerous
      and benign prostate tissue will be microdissected and cryopreserved. Archival prostatectomy
      tissues will be used to construct tissue microarrays containing matched benign and malignant
      sections. The effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition on lipid raft cholesterol content and
      targets of prenylation will be determined. The incidence of apoptosis will be determined
      along with protein levels of mediators of apoptosis. Lastly the effect of statin therapy on
      cellular markers of proliferation will be determined.

      Previously, we studied the effect of statin use on the risk of prostate cancer detection in a
      case-control study at the Portland VA Medical Center. Statin use was associated with a 62%
      reduction in cancer odds-risk (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.21-0.69). Although these epidemiologic and
      laboratory findings have generated enthusiasm for the study of statins in prostate cancer, no
      studies have examined the biologic effects of statins on prostate cancer in humans.

      Hypothesis: Statin therapy prior to prostatectomy will successfully target the mevalonate
      pathway in the human prostate and this intervention will favorably alter tumor biomarker
      status.
