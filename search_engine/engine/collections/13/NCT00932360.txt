      TENS, (2) placebo TENS or (3) no treatment control randomly assigned. Subjects will draw the
      order for treatments (A, B, and C) out of a bowl at the initial testing session. This will
      determine the order of the testing. Each subject will receive all 3 treatments in random
      order.

      The following tools will be used to measure subject characteristics (Fibromyalgia Impact
      Questionnaire, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia), pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire and Visual
      Analogue Scale), central excitability (pressure pain thresholds, temporal summation and DNIC)
      and function (6 minute walk test, range of motion, sit to stand test).
