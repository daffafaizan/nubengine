      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Current neuroprotective therapies show limited benefit in
      ameliorating this complication of radiotherapy. This study is a randomized, single blind
      clinical study. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether treatment of
      bevacizumab followed by steroid can alleviate radiation-induced brain injury in patients with
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to compare the treating effect between combination of
      bevacizumab and steroid and bevacizumab alone.
