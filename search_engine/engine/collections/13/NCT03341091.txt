      convenience sampling. Each was viewed as one cluster and was randomized to either the Tai-chi
      or the control group, based on computer-generated random numbers prepared by an independent
      statistician.

      Participants allocated to the Tai-chi group took part in the 16-week 10-step simplified
      Tai-chi programme, which was derived from the traditional Yang style and has been proven to
      be effective in enhancing older people's balance and mobility. Each week, the dyads attended
      two 1-hour sessions of centre-based Tai-chi training and practised at least three 30-minute
      Tai-chi sessions at home. Additional measures targeted cognitively impaired people were
      implemented to promote engagement, including the adoption of multiple sensory cues, slow and
      relaxed practice, a dyadic approach, and positive emotional motivation techniques.

      Participants allocated to the control group took part in group recreational activities such
      as watching movies or listening to music, which was organized by the community centres with
      similar frequency and duration of the Tai-chi sessions that were organized for the Tai-chi
      group. The control group participants were instructed to continue their usual lifestyles and
      levels of physical activity.
