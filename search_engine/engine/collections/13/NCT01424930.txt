    
      This is a multicenter, open-label study of 24 (up to a total of 28) men to assess the
      short-term safety of oral abiraterone acetate 1 g and oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily
      administered in the modified fasted state and after meals of various fat contents. All
      patients will take daily abiraterone acetate for the first 7 days in the modified fasted
      state (no food for 2 hours before and 1 hour after the dose). In Cohort 1, up to 6 evaluable
      patients will take abiraterone acetate daily for 7 days after a standardized low-fat meal
      from Cycle 1 Day 8 to Cycle 1 Day 14; or, in Cohort 2, up to 6 evaluable patients will take
      abiraterone acetate daily for 7 days after a standardized high-fat meal from Cycle 1 Day 8 to
      Cycle 1 Day 14. All patients will then continue to take abiraterone acetate daily in the
      modified fasted state starting on Cycle 1 Day 15 until disease progression. Toxicity related
      to dosing after the low-fat or high-fat meals is defined as Grade 3 or higher AEs of special
      interest; or Grade 3 or higher serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur during the food
      safety evaluation period. Cohort 2 may be expanded to a total of 18 evaluable patients if
      deemed to be safe. Decisions regarding the escalation of cohort or expansion of cohorts will
      be made by a study evaluation team. Pharmacokinetic evaluation for each cohort will be
      performed on Cycle 1 Days 7 and 14 at predose and multiple timepoints postdose over 24 hours;
      Cycle 1 Days 8 and 11 at 2 hours following abiraterone acetate dose administration.
      Abiraterone acetate, 1 g (four 250-mg tablets) orally (taken by mouth) once daily. Patients
      may take abiraterone acetate until progression of clinical disease. Prednisone, 5 mg, orally,
      twice a day.
