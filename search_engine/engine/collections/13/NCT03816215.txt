      for treating depression among adolescents (alongside existing therapy) using community
      volunteerism. In addition, this study will test a potential mechanism by which volunteering
      might decrease depressive symptoms: increasing psychosocial assets, specifically decreasing
      self-orientation and increasing an orientation toward others. This will be measured through
      self-report as well as using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study will be
      the first study to explore how neural response patterns are potentially altered by intense
      experiences with volunteerism among depressed adolescents.
