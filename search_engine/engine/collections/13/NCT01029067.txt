      that can be obtained cost-free online. MCT seeks to sharpen the awareness of schizophrenia
      spectrum patients on cognitive biases (e.g. jumping to conclusions) contributing to delusion
      formation and maintenance and conveys cognitive strategies to counter these. The present
      trial combines group MCT with an individualized cognitive-behavioral oriented approach
      entitled MCT+. Patients with schizophrenia are randomly allocated to either metacognitive
      treatment (MCT) or cognitive remediation (CogPack training). Blind to treatment assignment,
      both groups are assessed prior to intervention and four weeks later with the Positive and
      Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), the Psychosis Rating Scales (PSYRATS) and cognitive tasks.
      Delusion scores derived from the PANSS and PSYRATS serve as main outcome parameters. We also
      explore if MCT improves jumping to conclusions with a probabilistic reasoning task. To make
      results as generalizable as possible to a typical inpatient population, broad inclusion
      criteria are chosen. Patients are only excluded if age is < 18 and > 65 years and diagnoses
      do not meet criteria of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder.
