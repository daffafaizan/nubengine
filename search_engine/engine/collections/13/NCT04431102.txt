      injuries.

      Our main objective was to determine the effectiveness of a PM program to reduce the incidence
      and degree of intrapartum perineal injuries as a way to reduce the incidence of female PFD.

      Secondary objectives were:

      Assess the role of a MP program on the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Determine the
      effect of a MP program on body weight (BMI).

      It is a parallel group clinical trial with an allocation ratio of 1:2.

      All pregnant women will be informed about the nature of the clinical trial. There will be no
      differences in the pregnantÂ´s follow-up because it will be performed by two same Pilates
      monitor with the same formation.

      Once the pregnant women is assigned to an arm of the study, those assigned to the
      intervention group will be sent to the Pilates monitor to explain and initiate the exercise
      of MP program while the control group will be informed to maintain their usual monitoring of
      pregnancy.

      In the initial visit, the type of physical activity will be evaluated by filling in the
      international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ).
