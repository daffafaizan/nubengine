    
      Phase II, comparative, non-randomized trial assessing the immunogenicity and safety of
      vaccine candidate Moderna-1273 against SARS-CoV-2. A total of 180 volunteers will be included
      and vaccinated (2 doses, at day 1 and day 29), divided in 3 groups (60 volunteers 18 - 45
      years old, 60 volunteers 65 - 74 years old, 60 volunteers at least 75 years old). Vaccinated
      volunteers of the three arms will be immune-monitored during 24 months via a battery of in
      vitro and ex vivo tests to comprehensively assess the course of humoral, cellular and mucosal
      immunity over time.
