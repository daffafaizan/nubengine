      with ability to predict development of multi-organ failure. Currently, no tools could be used
      to evaluate the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis. All the human studies
      discussing mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis use tissue biopsies as study materials.
      Repeated tissue biopsy is invasive and not applicable. EBC could be collected non-invasively
      and conveniently. A study has demonstrated the use of metabolomic technologies in
      mitochondrial diseases. We believe that the metabolomic biomarkers of EBC could be used to
      demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction in lungs and respiratory tracts of septic patients.
      Such metabolomic biomarkers may also reflect similar on-going mitochondrial dysfunction in
      other organ systems, and could potentially become a novel diagnostic tool and a therapeutic
      target in future sepsis therapy.
