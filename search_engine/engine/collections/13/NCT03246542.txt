      diagnoses such as severe preeclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets
      (HELLP) syndrome; acute fatty liver of pregnancy; eclampsia, and antiphospholipid antibody
      syndrome. This might be related to the fact that the disease entity is rare and often is
      unexpected. Nevertheless, a delay in diagnosis of TTP/HUS may result in life-threatening
      maternal and fetal consequences. Aim of the current study was to compare the quantitative
      assessment of schistocytes in peripheral blood smear between women initially diagnosed as
      HELLP syndrome who showed no spontaneous resolution within 48 hrs after delivery and those
      who showed spontaneous resolution within 48 hrs after delivery which may help in decreasing
      the maternal mortality rate .
