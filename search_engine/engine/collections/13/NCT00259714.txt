      the dialysate to match the patient's own serum sodium results in less thirst, less
      interdialytic weight gain, less HD-related symptoms, and better blood pressure control in
      hypertensive subjects. In this project we will evaluate the effect of dialysate sodium
      individualization on systemic hemodynamics, body volume compartments and biochemical markers
      of volume control in hypertensive hemodialysis patients. We will use a single-blind
      cross-over design with randomized blocks. After a 3-week baseline period where pre-HD serum
      sodium will be measured weekly to establish each patient's average serum sodium, subjects
      will be randomized to 3 weeks on standard dialysate sodium (140 mmol/L) or individualized
      dialysate sodium (same concentration as the average pre-HD serum sodium during the baseline
      period), then crossed over to the other for another 3 weeks after a 1-week washout period
      (dialysate Na 140 mmol/L). The remainder of the dialysis prescription, prescribed dry weight
      and vasoactive drugs will remain unchanged throughout the study. Clinical information,
      pre/intra/post-HD blood pressure and thirst scores will be measured weekly at the mid-week
      dialysis session. In addition, we will measure systemic hemodynamics (cardiac output and
      systemic vascular resistance), bioimpedance measurements of intracellular and extracellular
      volume, arterial stiffness (aortic augmentation index, aortic pulse wave velocity),
      interdialytic (44h) ambulatory BP monitoring, and plasma BNP, renin, aldosterone and
      norepinephrine at baseline and at the end of each block.
