      great importance since it has significant influence on the further treatment of the patient.
      At Bispebjerg Hospital temporal artery thermometers are being implemented as they provide a
      fast and comfortable temperature measurement compared to rectal thermometers, who are
      considered to be the gold standard, defined by the Danish Center for Clinical Guidelines. The
      scientific proof for their accuracy compared to rectal thermometers in adult patients is
      insufficient though. The purpose of this study is to determine the difference between
      temperatures measured by a temporal artery thermometer (Exergen TAT-5000) and a rectal
      thermometer (OMRON MC-341-E) in patients presenting to the Emergency Department at Copenhagen
      University Hospital: Bispebjerg. The investigators hypothesize that there will be an average
      difference of at least 0,3 degrees centigrade between those two types of measurements
      (Bland-Altman). Based on a significance of 5% and a power of 80% the number of patients was
      calculated to 385, including an estimated 10% dropout.
