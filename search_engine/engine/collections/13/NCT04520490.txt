      brain factors which could undermine treatment responses and long-term obesity intervention
      outcomes. Specific Aim 1 will test the effect of adding ExQW to FBT on change in BMI z-score
      over a total GLP-1RA treatment duration of 24 weeks and a subsequent 1-year observational
      follow-up period after treatment cessation. To provide mechanistic insight, Specific Aim 2
      will test whether adding GLP-1RA intervention to FBT impacts neural activation by food cues.
      Finally, the proposed research will investigate the role of a cellular inflammatory process
      in the mediobasal hypothalamus-called gliosis-which might contribute to impaired hypothalamic
      function, attenuated satiety responsiveness, and potentially to worse weight management
      outcomes. Specific Aim 3 will test if hypothalamic gliosis is modified by FBT and/or FBT plus
      GLP-1RA in children and if its extent is related to immediate and/or long-term intervention
      outcomes.

      Study Design: This double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled research study uses fMRI to
      characterize neural responses to a test meal before and at the end of FBT intervention, with
      vs. without additional GLP-1RA intervention. In addition, it uses structural MRI (sMRI) to
      test if MBH gliosis is reversible and/or associated with intervention outcomes.
