      venous origin. Because of the high prevalence of up to 2% the treatment of Ulcus cruris is of
      special economical importance. Depending on the size, depth and possible infections, the
      conventional treatment of these wounds consists of an adequate compression, preparation of
      the lesion, cover and of appropriate control of infections. All tasks are undertaken in order
      to faciliate the healing of these chronic wounds.

      Plasma consists of free ions or electrons and can be created by various techniques. Commonly,
      it is use in the sterilization of medicinal equipment, the cauterization of tissue and in the
      field of coagulation. Because of its bactericidal characteristics, the direct interaction of
      plasma created by temperatures below 40Â°C on tissue is intensively studied. Both in vitro and
      in vivo studies proved a significant reduction of bacterial contamination in different test
      systems. As bacterial contamination might slow down wound healing, plasma treatment might be
      a useful tool to complement conventional methods in the treatment of chronical wounds.
