      collected in Qatar under JIRB 14-00055. All subjects will be undergoing a clinical
      bronchoscopy as part of their disease evaluation and will be asked to give additional samples
      for research. All "in vivo" processing of specimens from subjects with TB will be performed
      in Qatar. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Mtb) continues to have a detrimental impact
      of public health worldwide. Based on the epidemiological evidence linking smoking, COPD and
      Mtb, and our preliminary data we hypothesize that smoking reprograms Alveolar Macrophages
      (AM) polarization towards a distinct phenotype associated with impaired host defense function
      against Myobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and that normalization of that phenotype via
      therapeutic modulation of the Alveolar Macrophages (AM) polarization or smoking cessation can
      restore the anti-Mtb host defense function of AM.
