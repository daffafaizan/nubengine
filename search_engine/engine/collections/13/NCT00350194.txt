      We will enroll one hundred subjects who meet at least 3 of the 5 criteria for metabolic
      syndrome as per NCEP guidelines/WHO guidelines and who do not have known cardiovascular
      disease or diabetes. They will receive either placebo or omega-3 fatty acids in the form of
      fish oil capsules for a two-year period. Assessment of, C-IMT, serum lipoprotein profile,
      LDL- buoyancy, adiponectin, CRP, SAA, apolipoprotein B and A-1, fasting glucose, fasting
      insulin levels, and plasma fatty acids will be measured at baseline, one year, and two years.
