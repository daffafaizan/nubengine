      I. To estimate the specificity of rapid on site evaluation (ROSE) of touch preparations
      (preps) for predicting malignancy on final pathology in pleuroscopy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the sensitivity of rapid on site evaluation (ROSE) of touch preparations
      (preps) for predicting malignancy on final pathology in pleuroscopy.

      II. To estimate the specificity and sensitivity of visual assessment of pleura for predicting
      malignancy on final pathology in pleuroscopy.

      III. To compare the specificity and sensitivity of ROSE of touch preps between centers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo biopsy of the lining of the lung using pleuroscopy. Medical chart of
      patients is also reviewed.
