      detection of ventricular arrhythmia (i.e. lead rupture, atrial arrhythmia, oversensing….) and
      be responsible for inappropriate therapies. In such cases, it may be assumed that physicians
      can react earlier and take preventive actions, in order to reduce the risk or burden of
      inappropriate therapies.

      The THORN registry has two purposes:

        -  To determine retrospectively the relative proportion of patients experiencing at least
           one inappropriate therapy during 15-months of follow-up, in ICD patients equipped with
           Home Monitoring®. This part concern 1240 patients.

        -  To evaluate prospectively the relationship between the detection of inappropriate
           diagnosis (with or without subsequent inappropriate therapy), the corrective action
           taken, and the recurrences of inappropriate diagnosis of the same origin/mechanism. This
           part concerns 510 patients.

      BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring® by iEGM-Online® with Biotronik ICD devices (LUMAX) systematically
      stores any episode classified as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation
      (VF) which is transmitted to the physician.

      In the THORN study, in addition to the physicians' analysis, all electromyograms will be
      reviewed by an adjudication committee in order to classify them as appropriate or
      inappropriate diagnosis.
