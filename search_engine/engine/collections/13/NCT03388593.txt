      RhNRG-1(recombinant human neuregulin-1)directly work on the cardiomyocyte and restored the
      normal structure and function of it. Both the preclinical trials, phase II clinical trials
      and already completed phase III clinical trails have confirmed that rhNRG-1 effectively
      enhance the heart function, reverse the remodeling of left ventricular, and reduce all-cause
      mortality in heart failure animals and humans. More importantly, rhNRG-1 can significantly
      reduce the mortality of heart failure subjects with baseline NT-proBNP level â‰¤1600 fmol/mL
      and NYHA class II to III. In this phase III study, the investigators will further confirm the
      efficacy of rhNRG-1 in reducing the death rate of heart failure subjects with baseline
      NT-proBNP level between 600 pg/ml and 1700 pg/mL and NYHA class II to III.
