      5% have metastatic disease at presentation. Because metastatic breast cancer is considered to
      be an incurable disease, it is only treated with a palliative intent. Recent retrospective
      studies have demonstrated that (complete) resection of the primary tumor significantly
      improves the outcome of patients with primary metastatic breast cancer. However, other
      studies showed that the survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery is caused by
      selection bias.

      SUBMIT is a clinical trial that intends to answer the question whether up front breast
      surgery in patients with primary distant metastatic breast cancer will result in an
      improvement of the 2-year survival compared to the survival achieved with systemic therapy
      and delayed local treatment or systemic therapy alone.

      Patients to submit in this study are patients with primary distant metastatic breast cancer,
      with no prior treatment of the breast cancer, who are 18 years or older and fit enough to
      undergo surgery and systemic therapy. Exclusion criteria are: history of breast cancer, other
      malignancy within the last 10 years, surgical treatment or radiotherapy of this breast tumor
      before randomization, irresectable T4 tumor or synchronous bilateral breastcancer.

      Randomization will take place immediately after the diagnosis of primary distant metastatic
      breast cancer. Patients either randomize for up front surgery of the breast tumor (UFS)
      followed by systemic therapy or for systemic therapy (ST) potentially followed by delayed
      local treatment of the breast tumor.

      The primary endpoint of this trial is the 2-years survival. Quality of life is one of the
      most important secondary endpoints.
