    
      This study is designed to collect efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QOL) data from
      subjects who receive Absorica® without food. The study will investigate the treatment
      efficacy, frequency of relapse once the treatment has been discontinued, quality of life
      during the active treatment and during a 2-year post treatment period and the overall safety
      of treatment with Absorica®.

      This is a single-arm, open-label study consisting of 2 phases: a 20-week (5-month) open-label
      Active Treatment Period (ATP) and a 104-week (2-year) post treatment period (PTP). The total
      study duration is to be 124 weeks, excluding a screening period. During the ATP, after week 2
      visit, visits will be scheduled at 4-week intervals for a total of 8 visits (1 screening
      visit, 1 baseline visit, and 6 on-study visits). During the PTP, the first visit will be 4
      weeks after End of Treatment (EOT), the second visit will be 12 weeks after EOT, and
      subsequent visits will be scheduled at 26-week (± 2 weeks) intervals for a total of 6 visits.
