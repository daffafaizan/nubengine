      not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, and is approved for use only in a clinical
      study. However, the FDA has allowed the use of this device for compassionate use.

      The devices used are tubular grafts made of polyester fabric sewn to metal stents. The upper
      part of the grafts includes fenestrations (holes) that allow the grafts to be located above
      or near major arteries that branch off of the aorta (celiac artery, superior mesenteric
      artery (SMA), and renal arteries) without blocking blood flow to them. The celiac artery
      supplies blood to internal organs including the liver and stomach. The SMA supplies blood to
      internal organs as well, including parts of the large and small intestines. The renal
      arteries supply blood to the kidneys. Grafts with branches and/or fenestrations are needed
      when the aneurysm is located near these major arteries. The major arteries that branch off of
      the aorta (celiac artery, SMA, and renal arteries) may also be treated using stents (small
      tubular metal structures) to help keep the arteries open and aligned with the graft
      fenestrations (holes).
