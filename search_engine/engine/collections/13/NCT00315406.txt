      systemic vasculitis. PAN causes the inflammation of small- to medium-sized blood vessels,
      especially those supplying the nerves, skin, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, heart, eye, and
      genitals. Unlike another form of vasculitis called microscopic polyangiitis, PAN does not
      usually cause glomerulonephritis, a type of kidney disease, or vasculitis in the very
      smallest blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries, and venules). There are no radiographic or
      serologic tests that can reliably measure disease activity in PAN. Currently, clinicians must
      rely on patients' symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, and imaging to guide treatment
      decisions, but such data are rarely consistently reliable in determining PAN disease
      activity. This study will use new scientific methods to discover new biomarkers that can be
      used to monitor disease activity in PAN patients. These biomarkers may be used to help direct
      clinical care for PAN patients and assist in future drug development.

      Study visits will occur monthly for the first year, then every 3 months thereafter for the
      remainder of the study. Blood and urine collection will occur at every visit. A physical exam
      and medical and medication history will occur every 3 months; also, participants will be
      asked to complete several questionnaires to assess disease activity, health status, and
      tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Participants may have additional study visits if a disease
      flare or disease-related complications occur during the study.
