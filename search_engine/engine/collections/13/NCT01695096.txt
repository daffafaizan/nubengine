      designers and IVF specialists believed that the humidity will maintain stable ph and Temp.

      Recent reports suggest that humidity is recommended and the others suggest no difference So
      we decide to go for this RCT. Nevertheless; high humidity is maintained in vivo (uterus and
      fallopian tubes) due to the fluid content and stable body temperatures at 37Â°C. David
      McCulloch reported 15% reduction of the miscarriage rate after changing the humidity from 76%
      to 100% (Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Techniques: Laboratory Perspectives, Fourth
      Edition). Some embryologists claim that the humidity free incubators may increase the chance
      of chemical pregnancy and early fetal loss (Private center IbnSina IVF, Sohag, Egypt.
      unpublished data). This observations are never tested in a well designed randomized clinical
      trial (RCT) to eliminate the probability of chance and to reach a solid evidence.

      The question that should be asked : is high humidity culture should be applied or there is no
      difference between dry and high humidity culture conditions?
