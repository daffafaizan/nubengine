      well as patient outcome. Evaluating the subjectively experienced satisfaction is challenging.
      The investigators will use a questionnaire and assess waiting times in the process to
      determine patient satisfaction between digital, telephonic and conventional obtaining of
      informed consent for anaesthesia.

      In this questionnaire study, patients are asked to partake in a survey after the process of
      obtaining consent for anaesthesia is completed. The questionnaire covers aspects of patient
      satisfaction with the process, such as subjective assessment of comprehensibility, waiting
      time and privacy.

      Patients are divided into three groups. In one group, consent is obtained conventionally, in
      form of a visit to our anaesthesia department. In the other two groups, consent is obtained
      telephonically and digitally, respectively. Patients are not randomised into these groups,
      but included into the study after the process of obtaining consent by one of the three
      methods mentioned above is completed.
