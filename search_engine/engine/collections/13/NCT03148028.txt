      colitis is complex and is thought to be related to genetic, environmental and microbial
      alterations that lead to a hyperactive/dysregulated immune system that mediates tissue
      damage. In rare cases, IBD can develop in patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PID) who
      develop severe, atypical or recurrent infections. The bowel disease in these patients can
      present after they develop infectious complications but also prior to that. The goal of the
      current study is to characterize immune function in patients with PID and IBD in order to
      identify alterations in pro-inflammatory and regulatory pathways.

      The investigators will obtain blood samples from PID patients with IBD in order to perform
      deep immune profiling using various techniques such as flow cytometry, ELISA and others.
      Moreover, the investigators wish to characterize the microbiome of these patients. This
      multi-disciplinary approach will advance our understanding why specific patients with an
      immunodeficiency develop an IBD-like phenotype.
