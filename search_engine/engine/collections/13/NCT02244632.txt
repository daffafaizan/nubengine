      (30 to 240 mg/m2) in therapy combinations with the chemotherapeutic agents 5-FU, Oxaliplatin
      +/- bevcizumab, and Irinotecan.

      When the selected phase 2 dose is determined, 40 additional patients, will be included in the
      study in order to acquire more data on the safety and tolerability of Modufolin at this dose
      level. Twenty (20) of these additional patients will be treated in with Oxaliplatin, 20 with
      Irinotecan.
