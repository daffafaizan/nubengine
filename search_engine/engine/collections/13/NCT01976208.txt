      moderate or severe allergic asthma(IgE>=60IU/ml), who demonstrate inadequate asthma symptom
      control. Response to Omalizumab will be assessed by the overall improvement in control of
      asthma.

      Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human
      immunoglobulin E(IgE). The antibody has a molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons
      and produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary cell.

      Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor on the surface of
      mast cells and basophils. Reduction in surface-bound IgE on cells limits the degree of
      release of mediators of the allergic response.
