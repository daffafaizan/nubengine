      hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer in recent years. How can make an early diagnosis of
      gastrointestinal and liver cancer as well as prognostic evaluation and efficacy monitoring,
      has become the hotspot. "liquid biopsy", which is meant to detect cancers by sequencing the
      DNA in a few drops of a person's blood. It may detect cancers early, even before symptoms
      arise, when there is just a few cells in the blood circulation.

      ct-DNA in cancer patients often bears similar genetic and epigenetic features to the related
      tumor DNA. There is evidence that some of the ct-DNA originates from tumoral tissue. Besides,
      ct-DNA can easily be isolated from the circulation and other body fluids of patients, makes
      it a promising candidate as a non-invasive biomarker of cancer.

      It is known that levels of cellular ROS correlate with the aggressiveness of tumour cells and
      prognosis of patients. Cancer cells with increased endogenous ROS stress are more sensitive
      to anticancer agents and high levels of ROS generated by chemotherapeutic agents can induce
      cell death. Hence, ROS levels before and after chemotherapy in cancer cells can be an early
      indicator of treatment efficacy, which has the potential to shed new light on the choice of
      cancer therapy.

      This study aims to evaluate the role of ct-DNA and ROS as biomarkers in the diagnosis,
      treatment and recurrence monitoring of gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary pancreatic cancer.
