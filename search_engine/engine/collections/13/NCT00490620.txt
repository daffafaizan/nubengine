      cells extracted from patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis. Although there is no formal
      proof that this virus is etiologically related to the disease, we have found evidence for
      viral infection in the majority of patients with PBC using standard serologic and
      hybridization assays. In order to address the hypotheses that PBC is etiologically related to
      a retrovirus infection and that anti-retroviral therapy may be beneficial for patients with
      PBC, we have conducted 2 pilot studies using lamivudine and Combivir (lamivudine 150mg and
      Zidovudine 300mg). On the whole, little clinical improvement was observed in patients on
      lamivudine therapy alone, whereas those on Combivir had significant reductions of hepatic
      biochemistry studies and histologic improvement. Moreover, 4 of 10 Combivir patients
      completely normalized their liver function tests and the anti-viral therapy was well
      tolerated. We now propose a larger randomized trial to assess the short term (6 months)
      safety and efficacy of Combivir for patients with PBC. Efficacy in this study will be defined
      using both liver biochemistries and virologic endpoints.
