      neurochemistry non-invasively in vivo. However, the primary shortcoming in most studies is
      the lack of spatial coverage afforded by the typical single-voxel design. Limits on
      participant tolerance and financial resources restrict single-voxel studies to an examination
      of one or two carefully chosen voxels per scan, thus inadequately addressing the question of
      focal vs. global pathophysiology. A secondary shortcoming is that most studies report on
      either GABA or glutamate-glutamine (Glu-Gln) due to the technically demanding
      spectral-editing techniques that must be implemented in order to resolve and quantify those
      metabolites with any accuracy.

      1H MRS imaging (MRSI) can partially overcome these limitations by providing a global picture
      of brain chemistry rather than just the focal snapshot afforded by the single-voxel design.
      However, the scan time necessary for collecting enough data for adequate spatial resolution
      and signal-to-noise, particularly if also using specialized spectral-editing techniques, is
      still too lengthy. We recently developed a method that combines Spectroscopic Imaging with
      the MEGAPRESS-based difference-editing acquisition for optimal GABA detection as well as for
      optimal detection of Glu and Gln. This MEGACSI sequence will permit us to obtain the maximum
      amount of neurochemical information in a clinically sound scan time, while using the current
      state-of-the-art MRS editing methods for optimal detection of GABA, Glu, and Gln.
