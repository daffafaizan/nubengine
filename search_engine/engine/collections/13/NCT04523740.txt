      worsening on pain, health-related quality-of-life and level of function compared to
      continuing paracetamol treatment in patients aged 65 years or more.

      Trial design: Patients are randomized to either arm 1: standard care (paracetamol
      continuation) or arm 2: experimental treatment (placebo).

      The investigation is double-blinded.

      Patients are screened and recruited from Department of respiratory medicine at Copenhagen
      University Hospital Bispebjerg. Patients with a daily consumption of 3 grams or more of
      prescribed paracetamol and who comply with the other eligibility criteria will be invited to
      participate in the trial and asked for written, informed consent. If given we collect data
      regarding the patient's medications, any medication changes during the intervention and
      followup, frailty (FRAIL Scale), self-reported history of falls, recent admissions,
      self-reported health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), level of function tested by hand
      grib strength and sitting-rising test, and death.

      Data is collected at baseline and after 2 weeks when ending treatment intervention, and a 26
      week follow-up.
