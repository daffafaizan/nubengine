    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalating study. Escalating doses of M-T412
      are administered to cohorts of 5 patients each receiving a single dose intravenously over 2
      hours.

      Patients who complete the single dose assessment of M-T412 may receive up to 3 additional
      single doses of M-T412 IV over 2 hours, with each repeated dose given at least 1 month apart.

      Then, patients receive one dose level of M-T412 IV over 2 hours at 3 month intervals over a
      period of 12 months for a total of 5 doses. Once recovery of CD4 cells is obtained, the next
      scheduled infusion of M-T412 begins. Patients are omitted from study if CD4 cells remain
      attenuated following 2 scheduled infusion sessions.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the first infusion.
