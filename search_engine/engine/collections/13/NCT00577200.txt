      transportation unescorted for a 24 hour period if they undergo any minor ambulatory surgical
      procedure with monitored anesthesia care (MAC).However, recently introduced short-acting
      anesthetics may facilitate rapid recovery and an early return to normal daily activities. The
      proposed study will compare newer short-acting anesthetic agents (propofol, benzodiazepine,
      opioid) utilized in MAC, to determine if a particular pharmacological agent, or a combination
      of agents, impair driving performance as evaluated by driving simulator assessment, at time
      of discharge from the ambulatory center after minor surgical procedures.The three critical
      measures of driving performance selected are: weaving, reaction time, and number of
      collisions. If any of the experimental MAC conditions shows statistical equivalence at
      discharge with baseline, for all three criterion measures, then that anesthetic regimen can
      be designated as "safe to drive". If this study can demonstrate such an early recovery of
      driving ability, which is probably the most complex and dangerous activity commonly
      encountered, this begs the re-examination of all post-operative activity restrictions imposed
      on this patient population. Subjects will be grouped as patients with chronic pain undergoing
      procedures and those without chronic pain undergoing procedures.Subjects with pain issues
      will be randomized with either 1)Midazolam + Sufentanil + Propofol or 2)Midazolam +
      Sufentanil. There will be a third group of subjects who are controls not undergoing any
      procedures.
