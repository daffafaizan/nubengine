      fractionation; 5-6 weeks with moderate hypo-fractionation, while it is only 1- 2 weeks with
      extreme hypo-fractionation (SBRT).The health costs and out of pocket expenditure involved in
      the conventional hypo-fractionated radiotherapy treatment largely depends on the overall
      treatment duration. This involves expenditure not only for the patient but also the
      caretaker. Moreover most of these patients presenting to a tertiary care centre from
      different parts of the country, have logistic issues of accommodation, food, travel along
      with the treatment costs. Also for patients staying away from family, 5 weeks treatment
      without considerable family support has a psychological impact, especially on elderly group
      of patients commonly seen with prostate cancer.This further leads to a major cause of
      distress among these patients, especially in a resource limited setting as ours.

      Extreme hypo-fractionation with a total duration of 2 weeks, would offer an opportunity to
      optimize the therapeutic ratio taking advantage of the potential therapeutic gain due to low
      alpha/beta for prostate to higher dose/fraction(compared to surrounding organs at risk).
      Moreover, shortened overall treatment time,would lead to less distressing and early
      recommencement of their daily activities for the patients,with an obvious impact in improving
      the quality of life and health costs.

      Given the potential positive economic impact with shorter duration treatment with similar
      clinical outcomes and probable similar toxicity profile, SBRT (extreme hypo-fractionation) in
      prostate cancer is an attractive treatment option, especially in a limited-resource setting
      and can have a large and positive impact on the patient care.
