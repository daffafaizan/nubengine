      introduction to the United States in 1967, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has overtaken
      sucrose as the main sweetener in manufactured foods and beverages, and thus, is responsible
      for the approximately 30% increase in fructose in our diet. Numerous studies have shown that
      excessive fructose consumption can cause a variety of harmful metabolic effects, suggesting
      that fructose may partially be responsible for the current epidemic in obesity, hypertension,
      metabolic syndrome, and diabetes.

      This preliminary study will investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fructose
      in a broad population. Specifically, the goal of our research are to compare the impact of
      the two main sources of dietary fructose, sucrose versus HFCS, on fructose bioavailability
      and acute metabolic changes by measuring response phenotypes, such as serum uric acid,
      lactate, and triglyceride levels.
