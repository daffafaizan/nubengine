    
      This is a proof-of-concept phase 1/2a pilot and endpoint development study that is designed
      to provide initial evidence of biological activity of (-)-epicatechin. Primary endpoints
      include initial assessment of tissue-specific evidence of efficacy from muscle biopsy
      samples. Secondary endpoints include measures of strength and physical function, and safety
      and adverse event data. Pilot endpoints include assessment of mRNA and miRNA peripheral blood
      profiles and validation of non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) muscle perfusion
      studies during exercise and a recumbent cycle exercise test that may be employed as endpoints
      in future clinical trials.

      This single center open-label pilot study will enroll 10 adults with genetically-confirmed
      Becker muscular dystrophy, who will receive the purified nutritional extract (-)-epicatechin
      100mg/day orally for 8 weeks. After screening visits, participants will be enrolled in the
      study if they meet all inclusion criteria. They will be evaluated at baseline and at
      screening, day 1, and weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8.
