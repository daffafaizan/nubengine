    
      This is an open label, multicenter, phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      PRC-063 (methylphenidate hydrochloride controlled-release capsules 25, 35, 45, 55, 70, 85 or
      100 mg/day) in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adolescent
      subjects aged ≥12 to <18 years of age and adult subjects aged ≥18 years of age. In order to
      participate, subjects must have completed Purdue Pharma Study 063-009 or Purdue Pharma Study
      063-010. This study will be conducted at approximately 50 centers across the United States
      and Canada. After giving written informed consent (as well as informed assent for subjects
      <18 years of age), subjects will be screened to ascertain their suitability for the study
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. There will be seven monthly efficacy and
      safety visits during which subjects will be assessed on active, open-label PRC-063. The
      starting dose will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Dose-adjustment visits may occur
      weekly to optimize the subject's dose via titration. For adolescent subjects, the maximum
      dose will be 85 mg/day. For adult subjects, the maximum dose will be 100 mg/day.
