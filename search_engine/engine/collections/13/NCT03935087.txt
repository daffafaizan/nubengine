      carrying a single-chamber or a bicameral implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for
      primary prevention of sudden death, undergoing therapy with Sacubitril/Valsartan (according
      to current Guidelines) will be enrolled in the study. A two-dimensional echocardiogram with
      evaluation of left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-systolic volume,
      and left ventricular ejection fraction will be performed, according to standard clinical
      practice, at the beginning of the observation, and at a 6-month follow-up. The improvement of
      the left ventricle volumes and of the left ventricular ejection fraction will be evaluated.
