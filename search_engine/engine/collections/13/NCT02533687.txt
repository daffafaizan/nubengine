      who will undergo TUR-P due to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) with one of the resectoscopes
      using different energy sources:

        1. Preoperative data: age, height, weight, body-mass index, concomitant morbidities, use of
           any drug, history of operation, duration of lower urinary tract symptoms, history of any
           previous treatment taken for BPH, serum level of prostate specific antigen, prostate
           volume, maximum and average urine flow rate, postmicturation residual urine volume,
           hemoglobin level

        2. Operative data: duration of operation, volume of resected tissue, observation of
           obturator reflex (if any), kind and size of the urethral catheter used

        3. Postoperative data: time to removal of urethral catheter, hospitalization duration,
