    
      Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging using 18F-FDG is an
      important, commonly used cancer, neuroscience and cardio-vascular imaging methodology to
      detect disease and to monitor therapeutic interventions. While considerable technological
      progress of PET/CT systems has occurred over the last decade, we have not re-evaluated the
      ability to potentially reduce the radiation burden of the used PET imaging pharmaceutical
      (FDG).

      This early phase trial intends to accomplish the following:

        -  to validate that the radiation dose burden from the PET imaging pharmaceutical (FDG) can
           be reduced by more than 50% from the current standard of clinical care (SOC) level
           without affecting the diagnostic ability;

        -  to confirm that a low dose approach will be feasible for response assessment;

        -  to validate that the difference in FDG uptake between imaging 60 min +/- 10 min post
           injection and 75 min +/- 10 min post injection is independent/equivalent of the injected
           FDG dose

        -  to validate a simulation methodology to streamline future dose finding studies for PET
           imaging pharmaceuticals.
