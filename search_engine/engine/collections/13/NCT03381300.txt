      relatedness:

      The primary objective remains to preserve the fertility of the respective (minor) patient,
      facing a very high risk of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) of 95-98%. Disadvantages of
      participating in this study are the potential risk of complications related to the
      laparoscopic unilateral oophorectomy and/or the unknown effect on future fertility of these
      girls. Moreover, the procedure might raise false hope in patients (and/or parents) about the
      chance of getting pregnant after auto transplantation of cryopreserved-thawed ovarian tissue
      in the future. However, we attempt to overcome this by extensive and objective information
      provision by both written materials and face to face counselling.
