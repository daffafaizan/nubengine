      noninflammatory lesions. Systemic antibiotics play a role as the first line therapy of
      moderate acne vulgaris treatment. Since bacterial resistance tends to increase, alternative
      therapy for moderate acne vulgaris is needed.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of comedone extraction compared to oral
      antibiotics as the main therapy of moderate acne vulgaris; and to etermine the expression of
      HIF-1 alpha by examining the immunohistochemistry and ELISA as a sign of hypoxia/anoxia in
      MAV lesion.

      This was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that was performed in 2015 at three
      different dermatology clinics in Indonesia, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital Jakarta, Gatot
      Soebroto Army Hospital Jakarta, and PT. Mattel Indonesia, Cikarang.

      One hundred and twenty eight subjects, aged between 15 and 50 years, with moderate acne
      vulgaris were recruited and randomized to receive either oral doxycycline (100 mg) or
      comedone extraction for six weeks. Subjects who had acne lesion and the back area were
      offered skin lesion biopsy to evaluate immunohistochemistry and ELISA before administration
      of medication.

      At each follow-up visit, subjects were asked to grade the overall response and questioned
      regarding adverse events. The objective or main outcome was total reduction of inflammatory
      and noninflammatory lesions.
