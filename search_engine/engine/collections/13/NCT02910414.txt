    
      The TARGET BP I Trial is a randomized, blinded, multi-center, international, sham-procedure
      controlled trial, comparing renal denervation performed with the Peregrine System Kit in the
      treatment group to the sham control group (without renal denervation - no alcohol infusion).
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment versus sham control via central
      randomization.

      The TARGET BP I clinical trial uses a percutaneous catheter to deliver very small amounts of
      alcohol (neurolytic agent). The patient population for this trial is comparable to those used
      in other renal denervation studies, but also incorporates lessons learned from recent trials
      of renal denervation. This is to enable the study of an optimized patient population who
      stands to benefit from the intervention, in a manner that reduces possible study bias.

      This trial is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Peregrine Catheter when
      used to deliver a 0.6 mL volume of alcohol to the perivascular area of the respective renal
      arteries while patients are adequately managed with oral antihypertensive medications.
