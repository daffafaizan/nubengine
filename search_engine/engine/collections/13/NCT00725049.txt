      randomly assigned to the short implant group (test) or the standard length and augmentation
      group (control). All implants will be placed using a two-stage approach with healing
      abutments placed at three months and temporary prosthesis at four months following implant
      and/ or sinus augmentation surgery. Time, materials, and efforts associated with treating
      test and control cases will be documented to allow an assessment of the costs incurred with
      each approach.
