      I. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-week computerized working memory
      training program in breast cancer survivors who subjectively report cognitive deficits:
      evaluate feasibility of study procedures (recruitment and screening procedures, number of
      participants recruited, screened, and retained, attrition rate and reason, weekly phone calls
      completed with participants); evaluate the acceptability of an adaptive computerized working
      memory training intervention (burden, adherence to training schedule, performance level
      achieved, and participant satisfaction with computerized exercises).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the difference in the posttest means at T2 (week #7) adjusted for T1
      (baselines) in the primary working memory outcomes of visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM),
      visual working memory (VWM), and executive function (EF) as measured by the
      neuropsychological tests (Rey Auditory Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS] IV
      symbol test, WAIS IV coding test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System [DKFES] color tests,
      Trails A and Trails B tests, and WAIS IV Letter and Number sequencing test) and self-report
      Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) surveys (Applied Cognition
      General Concerns Short Form, Applied Cognition Executive Function Short Form, and Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy [FACT] Cognitive Function) between the intervention group and
      wait control group.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (COMPUTER-ASSISTED COGNITIVE TRAINING): Patients complete a computerized working memory
      training program (Cogmed) over 35 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 6 weeks.

      ARM II (WAIT LIST): Patients undergo standard follow-up care for 6 weeks. Following standard
      follow-up care, patients may complete Cogmed as in the Intervention Group in weeks 7-13.
