      I. Phase I portion is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of liposomal
      irinotecan (MM-398) when given in combination with ramucirumab at 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks in
      patients with gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEAC) who had failed or are
      intolerant of platinum-based therapy.

      II. Phase II portion is to assess the preliminary efficacy and tolerability of MM-398 in
      combination with ramucirumab in patients with GEAC who had failed or are intolerant of
      platinum based therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the best overall response rate through up to three cycles of therapy among
      patients with measurable disease at study entry.

      II. To assess the incidence and severity of toxicity of the combination.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Descriptive of quality of life domains using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS) global health instrument (PRO).

      II. Descriptive of altered genes on liquid biopsies. III. To assess the effect of the
      anti-angiogenic ramucirumab on distribution of MM-398 via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      with and without ferumoxytol.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of MM-398followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive ramucirumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and MM-398 IV over 90 minutes
      on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 6
      months.
