      intubation successful rate at the first time but also decrease the incidence of tissue
      trauma. Laryngoscope blade used in daily practice is usually Macintosh 3. However, compared
      with Caucasian people, Asian people are smaller and thinner especially in women. This study
      aims to confirm that the Macintosh 2 blade is not inferior to size 3 blade in laryngeal view
      and intubation rate.

      Female patients without known difficult airway will be enrolled and allocated into Macintosh
      blade size 2 and size 3 groups. The age, body weight, body height, Mallampati classification,
      mouth opening, thyromental distance, neck circumference, intubation time, Cormack-Lehane
      grade, intubation difficulty scale scores and associated teeth or tissue traumas will be
      recorded.
