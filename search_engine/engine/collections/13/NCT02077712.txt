      respiratory depression.Clinical trials have demonstrated that intranasal dexmedetomidine in a
      dose of 1ug/kg produces satisfactory sedation in between 53% and 57% of children at
      anaesthetic induction. There are also reports using higher doses of intranasal
      dexmedetomidine. The investigators compared the sedative effect of 1ug/kg intranasal
      dexmedetomidine with those of 2 ug/kg for ophthalmic examinations in children aged 2
      months-10 years and hypothesised that the higher dose would produce satisfactory sedation in
      more children at the time of anaesthetic induction.
