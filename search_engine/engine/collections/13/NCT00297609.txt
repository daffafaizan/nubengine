      (CPOE+CDSS) is an important tool in attempting to reduce medication errors. The objective of
      this study was to evaluate the impact of a CPOE+CDSS on (1) the frequency of errors in
      ordering resuscitation (CPR) medications and (2) the time for printing out the order form, in
      a pediatric critical care department (PCCD).

      Methods: Setting: An 18-bed PCCD in a tertiary-care children's hospital. Design: Prospective
      cohort study. Measures: Compilation and comparison of number of errors and time to fill in
      forms before and after implementation of CPOE+CDSS. Errors were identified by reviewing
      orders and classified as potential adverse drug events (ADEs), medication prescribing errors
      (MPEs), and rule violations (RVs). They were compared during the year preceding and following
      implementation of CPOE CDSS. Simulated forms were also used to further test error occurrence.
      Time to fill in conventional, simulated and CPOE forms was measured and compared.

      Results: There were 3 reported incidents of errors among 13,124 CPR medications orders during
      the year preceding implementation of CPOE+CDSS. These represent errors that escaped the
      triple check by three independent staff members (two nurses and one physician). There was an
      average of 11.6 errors/100 orders in the simulated CPR form and potential ADEs occurred at a
      rate of 11.3/100 orders and MPEs at a rate of 0.3/100 orders. There were no errors after
      CPOE+CDSS was implemented (100% error reduction). Time to completion of drug forms dropped
      from 14 min 42 sec to 2 min 14 sec (p<0.001).

      Conclusions: CPOE+CDSS completely eliminated errors in filling in the forms and significantly
      reduced time to completing the form.
