      planned to enrol a total of 130 patients with advanced emphysema and low collateral
      ventilation. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive modified medical
      care including a 48 bed rest or standard medical care following valve implantation. All
      patients will undergo treatment at one study centre in Heidelberg.
