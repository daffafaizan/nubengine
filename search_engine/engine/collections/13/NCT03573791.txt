      into two groups: complete response (ypT0N0) and poor response (>ypT1-2N0). Differentially
      expressed genes between complete response and poor response will be analyzed. A scoring
      formula will be established based on the results. Tumor tissue samples are collected before
      neoadjuvant therapy and will be analyzed via RNA sequencing.
