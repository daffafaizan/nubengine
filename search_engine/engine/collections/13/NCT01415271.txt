    
      Purpose: This project will investigate the benefits (as measured by change in the primary
      outcome measure hemoglobin A1c) of bi-weekly reporting of blood sugar values for patients
      with type 2 diabetes in long term care facilities.

      Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is bi-weekly reporting will result in a reduction in A1c after 3
      months.

      Justification: Elevated A1c values increase risk of health complications for people with type
      2 diabetes.

      Objectives: Improved type 2 diabetes management for patients in long term care facilities.

      Research Methods: Patients who meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria and are interested in
      participating in the study will self-identify to the research coordinator. Consent will be
      done in person with any questions answered. Strips and blood glucose meters will be provided.
      Blood glucose values and testing frequency will be recorded using the internet reporting
      system Heath-e-Connect. HbA1c, serum creatinine and demographic data will be collected at 0
      and 3 months to determine effect of bi-weekly remote communication of blood glucose with an
      endocrinologist.

      Statistical Analysis: HbAlc values at 0 and 3 months will be compared using an unpaired
      t-test to measure the effect of the intervention
