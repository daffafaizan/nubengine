      aero-digestive tract. They are the 6th most prevalent type of cancer worldwide, with
      approximately 600 000 new cases every year. The investigators hypothesize that a
      specifically-designed tobacco cessation intervention initiated and driven by trained nurses
      of the health care team, either in the otolaryngology (ENT) department or in the radiotherapy
      department, is more efficient than a classic intervention based on the same pharmacological
      support during the hospital stay (NRT) followed by an orientation in an external smoking
      cessation center, while remaining feasible for both patients and caregivers.The health care
      setting represents an ideal place to initiate cessation interventions with smokers who are
      newly diagnosed with a malignancy. The investigators' aim is to compare two models: one is a
      specific model of tobacco cessation intervention designed for health care teams treating
      patients with HNSCC; the other is the current standard of care for these patients, namely
      referral to external care after general advice on tobacco cessation. The investigators will
      evaluate the efficacy of this intervention 12 months after randomization. This intervention
      will be implemented into otolaryngology (ENT) care by training ENT nurses with a specific
      program for tobacco cessation delivered to patients diagnosed with HNSCC.
