      condition known as transfusion-associated microchimerism. This occurs when white blood cells,
      or leukocytes, from the donor's blood persist in the recipient long after the transfusion
      occurs. The genetically distinct donor cells can remain in the individual for decades, and
      may account for as many as 4% of the white blood cells in the recipient's body. This suggests
      that the donor cells are tolerated by the recipient's immune system. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the incidence of microchimerism among individuals with three different
      types of injuries: 1) traumatic injuries; 2) thermal, or burn, injuries; and 3) injuries
      resulting from elective orthopedic surgical procedures.

      In this study, blood samples will be collected from individuals who were treated for
      traumatic injury, thermal injury, or elective orthopedic surgical procedures at the
      University of California at Davis Medical Center. Individuals who were treated from 2000 to
      2003 and received a blood transfusion, as well as a control group of individuals who did not
      receive a transfusion, will be approached to enroll in the study. Individuals who agree to
      participate will have their blood analyzed for evidence of microchimerism. Information on
      health status, injury characteristics, hospital care, blood transfusion details, and blood
      donor characteristics will be collected from all participants.
