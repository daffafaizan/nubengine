      I. Develop blood sample collection and preparation procedures for reliable, meaningful
      metabolomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by liquid
      chromatography/quadruple-time of flight/mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF/MS) that can be
      implemented in a clinical setting.

      II. Optimize data analysis methods and software usage to create a metabolic profile for
      patients at the time of blood collection.

      III. Compare metabolite profiles of isolated PBMCs versus (vs.) other blood fractions
      (plasma, red blood cells [RBCs], and whole blood).

      IV. Identify elements of the PBMC metabolite profile that may correlate to patient disease
      state.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood for metabolic profiling via LC/Q-TOF/MS.
