      infection due to Candida spp. that mainly involves the liver and spleen. HSC occurs mostly in
      patients with profound and prolonged neutropenia, which is more often seen in patients with
      hematologic malignancies. Despite an appropriate antifungal prophylaxis, the incidence of HSC
      in France might be closed to 5% in patients suffering from acute leukemia. Early and adequate
      diagnosis and treatment of HSC are crucial, as treatment delays can negatively affect the
      prognosis of the underlying condition. Current guidelines recommend a 6-month duration
      treatment. Prolonged treatments up to 6 months are frequent, leading to antifungal toxicity
      and cost increase. Preliminary study by our team has already assessed F18 fluorodeoxyglucose
      (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomography scan (PET scan) as a diagnostic tool for HSC. 18F-FDG
      PET scan could be helpful in the diagnosis, follow-up and therapy strategy of HSC, helping to
      stop antifungal treatment. Other molecular, immunological and serological tools have to be
      developed in order to avoid hepatic biopsies. Actually, mycological evidence of infection is
      found in only 20% of the cases. The pathogenesis of HSC is also not well understood, but it
      is believed that it may be due to an unbalanced adaptive immune response that leads to an
      exacerbated inflammatory reaction, resulting in an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory
      Syndrome (IRIS). In that context, a better understanding of the disease pathophysiology and
      of the potential genetic susceptibility could have an impact on therapy strategy. For
      example, new approaches such as the use of adjuvant high-dose corticosteroids have been shown
      beneficial. This study is the first step to improve HSC diagnosis and therapy strategy.
