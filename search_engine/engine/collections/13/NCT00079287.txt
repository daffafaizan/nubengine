      Primary

        -  Compare the therapeutic effect of vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and docetaxel vs paclitaxel
           and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vinorelbine IV and gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Patients then receive docetaxel IV on day 1.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV on day 1. Treatment repeats
           every 21 days for 6 courses.

      Patients are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
