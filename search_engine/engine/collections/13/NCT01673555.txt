    
      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded (subjects and
      investigators will be blinded, GSK internal personnel will not be blinded) study designed to
      test whether short-term administration (5 days) of GSK1278863 affects PASP under normoxic and
      hypoxic conditions in healthy volunteers. Approximately 45 healthy subjects with
      mild-moderate baseline tricuspid regurgitation (sufficient to allow reliable assessment of
      PASP) will be enrolled into this study and will provide ~15 evaluable subjects in each arm
      [Placebo, 5 mg, and 100 mg GSK 1278863].
