      provocation of the nose with the birch pollen, dilutant and xylometazoline affect the
      breathing style (breathing pattern) and how these possible changes could be controlled in the
      measurement of the breathing with respiratory effort belts. In addition to this, our
      intention is to clarify the effect of the facial mask on the breathing.

      The allergic and control subjects undergo nasal provocation in 2 sessions. The first is done
      with birch pollen extract (should block the nose in allergic subjects) and the second with
      xylometazoline (should open the nose).

      The mask group undergo similar measurements without nasal exposures.

      The second objective of the study is to clarify if there are differences between the allergic
      and control subjects in the function of the autonomous nervous system during these
      provocations. This is done with the heart rate variability analysis method.
