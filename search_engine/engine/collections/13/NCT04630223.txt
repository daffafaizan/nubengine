      in association with the severity of endothelial damage. Endothelial dysfunction and abnormal
      angiogenesis in the placental tissues are the main pathophysiological mechanisms leading to
      intrauterine growth retardation.

      It has been known that there was a significant association between maternal serum levels of
      endocan and preeclampsia. In cases with preeclampsia, increased serum levels of endocan in
      maternal blood samples has been reported.

      Intrauterine growth retardation is a situation in which endothelial dysfunction and abnormal
      angiogenesis are the leading disturbances. In fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation, a
      hypoxic environment secondary to uteroplacental insufficiency. In previous studies, increased
      levels of endocan in maternal blood samples have been shown. Although maternal blood can be a
      good reflector of situations both in fetuses and their mothers, measurement of endocan in
      umbilical cord blood samples may better represent the pathology in fetuses.
