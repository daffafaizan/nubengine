    
      The aim of this study is to perform a randomised controlled vitamin D3 intervention study in
      apparently healthy, free-living adults (aged 50+ y) to investigate whether different levels
      of habitual calcium intake, ranging from low-moderate to high, influence serum 25(OH)D
      concentrations and indices of vitamin D activation and catabolism during winter, when vitamin
      D intake is adequate versus inadequate.

      This research will provide new data and scientific understanding in relation to the impact of
      different levels of dietary calcium intake on vitamin D requirements in the older adult
      population. As such, this new data will inform dietary reference values for vitamin D.
