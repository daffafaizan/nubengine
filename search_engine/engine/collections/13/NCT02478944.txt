      pathologic peristaltic amplitude values among patient before and after therapy (mesalazine,
      steroids, biologicals) compared to the standard values detected among the normal population.
      Diagnosic intervention like oesophagoduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and stenosis ballon dilation
      are allowed as are part of the IBD therapy and follow up.

      No other interventions are administered to participants during this study.
