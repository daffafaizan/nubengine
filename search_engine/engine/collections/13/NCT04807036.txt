      which impacts their long-term health and wellbeing. A major issue is that scores for
      predicting recovery are typically generated only once in the period before surgery, but
      subsequent events during and immediately after surgery can also alter the likelihood of a
      prolonged and difficult recovery.

      One such event appears to be low blood pressure (hypotension). Hypotension Prediction Index
      can be calculated from routine blood pressure measurements, and is an indicator of blood
      pressure instability. The investigators propose that Hypotension Prediction Index during and
      immediately after surgery may be used to improve their accuracy of scores that predict
      postoperative problems.

      To explore this, the investigators will collect information about the health and care needs,
      surgery and postoperative recovery of adult patients' requiring major surgery. This data will
      be taken from hospital information systems, a bedside monitor, test reports, a questionnaire
      and National Databases. The investigators will then use statistical models to determine
      whether Hypotension Prediction Index improves the accuracy of preoperative scores for
      predicting postoperative problems.

      Ultimately, the investigators hope to create a tool for predicting how well a patient will
      recover based on the information available at any given point in time. Healthcare
      professionals will be able to use this tool to identify and support the needs of patients who
      need extra help recovering from major surgery.
