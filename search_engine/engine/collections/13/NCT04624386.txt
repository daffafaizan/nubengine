      control group premenopausal women). Biometric data such as age, bmi, obstetric anamnesis,
      history of komorbidities, PAP smear results are recorded. Mammography results, dexa scores of
      post menopausal women are also obtained. Venous blood samples from all subjects are
      collected. Thiol disulfide levels will be determined from serum samples. Thiol disulfide
      levels will first be compared between the study and the control group in order to determine
      the oxidative stress in menopause. In secondary evaluation years of menopause, age, and dexa
      scores will be included.
