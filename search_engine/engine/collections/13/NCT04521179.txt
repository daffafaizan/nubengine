      epitopes of HER2, leading to a dual HER2 signal blockade.KN046 is a PD-L1 - CTLA-4 bispecific
      antibody. The study composes of two stages. The first stage plans to enroll HER2-positive
      solid tumors. All subjects will be treated with KN026 at 30 mg/kg Q3W in combination with
      KN046 at 5 mg/kg Q3W at the first stage.A SMC meeting will decide whether to proceed to the
      nest stage.
