    
      In a previous Phase I clinical trial at M.D. Anderson, patients with CLL received an
      intravenous infusion of autologous leukemia cells transduced ex vivo with an adenovirus
      encoding the wild-type murine CD154. This treatment was well tolerated and without
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients each experienced acute reductions in the leukemia-cell blood
      count and in the size of enlarged lymph nodes and spleen.

      The infusion induced changes in circulating bystander, non-infected CLL cells and both acute
      and long-term clinical responses. The changes in bystander CLL cells were similar to those
      observed in CLL cells following ligation of CD40, which included enhanced or de novo
      expression of CD54, CD80, and CD86, allowing the modified CLL cells to function more
      effectively in presenting antigens to autologous T cells. Following CD40 ligation, CLL cells
      are induced to express CD95 and DR5 and to undergo changes in expression of pro- and
      anti-apoptotic proteins, ultimately favoring apoptosis in the CLL cells.

      To build upon these results, an extension to this trial will be completed in order to assess
      the tolerability of repeated infusions of ISF35 and to test whether additional
      administrations will enhance the anti-leukemic activity exhibited in the previous Phase I
      trial.
