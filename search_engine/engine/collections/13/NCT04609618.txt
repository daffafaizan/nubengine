      upper airway obstruction that occur during sleep. OSA lead to desaturation and often lead to
      an arousal.

      Associated features include loud snoring and fragmented non-refreshing sleep and have
      profound impact on quality of life, on safety on the roads and at work, and on the
      cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

      The standard treatment for apnea remains a device consisting of a pump and nasal mask that
      provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a pneumatic splint that
      elevates and maintains a constant pressure along the upper airway during inspiration and
      expiration that prevents airway collapse. The major disadvantage of CPAP is the relatively
      low compliance.

      Appscent developed a non-contact effortless bedside solution based on the following: odors
      modify respiratory patterns during wake . Mildly trigeminal and pure olfactory odorants do
      not arouse or wake. Odorants transiently presented during sleep induced a respiratory
      rejection type response, this suggests that manipulating the respiratory system without
      waking is viable .
