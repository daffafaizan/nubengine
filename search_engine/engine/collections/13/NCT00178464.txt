      aspirin in children with sickle cell disease. The secondary objectives are to assess (1) The
      feasibility of recruiting children with Hgb SS and Hgb S Beta-0 Thalassemia to an aspirin
      trial, (2) The level of compliance with aspirin administration in the proposed patient
      population, (3) The most useful assessments in a battery of age-appropriate neurocognitive
      tests, (4) The feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance
      angiography (MRA) studies and the utility of classification systems for use in group
      comparisons, (5) Preliminary data regarding trends in transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound
      velocities over time and the validity of using trends for group comparisons, (6) Preliminary
      data regarding the effect of aspirin therapy on the incidence of cognitive deficit, imaging
      changes, overt stroke, painful crises, and acute chest syndrome. Subjects will include
      children between the ages of 2 and 7.99 years with documented Hgb SS or Hgb S Beta-0
      Thalassemia who are followed at Golisano Children's Hospital at Strong and the University of
      Miami. All subjects will receive daily aspirin (about 2.5 - 5.1 mg/kg daily). Subjects will
      receive therapy for 12 months. There will be careful laboratory and clinical monitoring every
      3-6 months and more frequently if needed. Pre and post treatment clinical complications,
      neurocognitive testing, MRI, MRA, and TCD studies will be assessed.
