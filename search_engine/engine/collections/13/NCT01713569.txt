      investigator's discretion if they meet inclusion/ exclusion criteria and provide written
      informed consent. Enrolled subjects will be treated with an assigned transducer based on
      their order of enrollment. At the study follow-up visit, subjects will undergo resection of
      the treated tissue for histological analysis prior to their planned rhytidectomy procedure.
