    
      Fentanyl endovenous (ev) is an excellent analgesic drug for pain relief in acute traumatic
      pain. Fentanyl sublingual (Abstral Â®) is an excellent analgesic drug in the breakthrough
      cancer pain relief in oncologic patients.

      The immediate (less than 10 minutes) effect and the ease of administration of sublingual
      fentanyl is a feasible drug administration for immediate analgesia in remote areas such as
      mountain rescue missions eg. the slope.

      Patients will be recruited according to a randomized list to fentanyl ev or fentanyl
      sublingual versus placebo oral or placebo ev.

      Safety issues like control of vital signs will be warranted.
