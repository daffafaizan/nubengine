    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed 300 mg dose of tralokinumab administered
      subcutaneously every 2 weeks in adult and adolescent subjects with oral corticosteroid
      dependent asthma. Approximately120 subjects will be randomized globally. Subjects will
      receive tralokinumab or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection at the study site,
      over a 40-week treatment period.
