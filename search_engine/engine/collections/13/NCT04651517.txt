      planning and advancement of an instrument during Computed Tomography (CT) guided percutaneous
      lung procedures. The system is used for trajectory planning and is intended to assist the
      physician in the positioning of an instrument, such as a needle, where CT imaging is used for
      target trajectory planning and intraoperative tracking. This study will evaluate safety and
      accuracy of the XACT ACE Robotic System in subjects undergoing CT guided, minimally invasive
      percutaneous procedures of the lung in the interventional radiology suite.
