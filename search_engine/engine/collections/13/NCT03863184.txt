    
      This is a single-arm phase 2 study to evaluate the preliminary evidence of efficacy and
      safety of the combination of acalabrutinib, lenalidomide and rituximab (ALR) in previously
      untreated mantle cell lymphoma.

      The study includes an induction phase consisting of 12 cycles of ALR. Responding subjects
      will be eligible to enter a maintenance phase. Subjects will continue maintenance ALR until
      disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal. Subjects
      in complete response wishing to attempt stem cell collection following at least 6 months of
      induction treatment can hold lenalidomide for up to 30 days, and restart following stem cell
      collection.

      Subjects will be monitored for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) status in peripheral blood at
      baseline and completion of 12 cycles of induction treatment using Adaptive Biotechnology
      Clonoseq assay, and then every 4 cycles.

      Subjects will be followed after completing study intervention every 6 months for alternate
      anti-cancer therapy and survival.
