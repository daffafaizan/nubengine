      individuals. Some 30 percent of community dwelling people aged 65 years and older, and over
      50 percent of those living in institutions fall each year. Among older adults, complications
      of falls are the leading cause of deaths due to injury and are the most common cause of
      nonfatal injuries and hospitalization for trauma. The total lifetime healthcare cost of
      fall-related injuries for the elderly have been projected to reach $85 billion by the year
      2020. Even in the absence of injury due to falling, the tendency to lose balance among the
      elderly commonly results in an overall reduction in the level of physical activity, and to a
      decreased ability to satisfactorily function in social roles.

      Despite the contributions of multiple risk factors to age-related falls (e.g., environmental
      hazards, orthostatic hypotension, disorientation, sedation), it is well recognized that those
      who fall present greater impairments in neuromechanical (NM) factors than do older
      non-fallers. Aging changes in balance and gait associated with NM impairments have also been
      consistently found to be among the most important risk factors for falls. What is presently
      unresolved, however, is which among the age-associated NM impairments, altered balance and
      mobility functions are best associated with falls and responsive to interventions (training).
