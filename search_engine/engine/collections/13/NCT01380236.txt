      signs, measuring the use of concomitant medication, routine laboratory tests, urinalysis,
      sputum analysis, serum IL-1 and TNF-Î±, lung carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, pulse
      oximetry and measuring AEs

      There are 5 study phases: screening (phase 1), run-in (phase 2), treatment A (phase 3) with
      Active or Placebo, treatment B(phase 4) with Active or Placebo and end of study (phase 5)
      that includes a wash out period and a final visit.
