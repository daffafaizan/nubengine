      prevention of UTI in patients with ureteral stents will be studied by comparining the results
      of urine and stent cultures with patients who had non-coated ureteral stents. The impact of
      antimicrobeal stent coating on patients' quality of life will be evaluated with comparing the
      scores of ureteral stent symptom questionnaire between both groups.
