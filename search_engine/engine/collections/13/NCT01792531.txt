      Specific Aim #1: PARENTING OR LIFESTYLE? To determine the effectiveness of two obesity
      treatment conditions: 1) parent training (n=90) and 2) treatment as usual focused on
      lifestyle changes (n=90). The two treatment conditions will be evaluated with respect to
      child weight status (BMI SDS; primary outcome), psychosocial and metabolic health, lifestyle
      choices, and family functioning (secondary outcomes).

      Specific Aim #2: OPTIMAL LENGTH OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP? To understand the influence of
      treatment duration we will compare the effectiveness of the parent training program
      administered for 10 wks only and for 10 wks plus additional booster sessions at 8-week
      intervals for the following year. All groups will be followed up for at least one year
      post-baseline.

      Specific Aim #3: TO START AT AGE 4,5 OR 6? To assess the influence of child age at the start
      of treatment on the treatment outcomes.

      Specific Aim #4: MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS? To determine whether changes in targeted parenting
      skills (such as limit setting, monitoring and problem-solving) will mediate child obesity
      outcomes by examining all treatment groups. In addition, we will examine moderators of
      intervention effects (e.g. socioeconomic status (SES), parental weight status, and
      depression).
