      kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 receiving dialysis. SHPT is an adaptive response to CKD and is
      characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and consecutively high calcium
      levels. Elevations in calcium levels, phosphate levels, and PTH are correlated with CKD
      disease progression as well as development or aggravation of cardiovascular impairment. Many
      CKD patients cannot be treated well with Vitamin D analogues because of effects on calcium.
      Hypercalcemia is a well - known factor for cardiac disease. No data are available in Austria
      for a cohort with cardiac disease treated with Zemplar (paricalcitol IV).
