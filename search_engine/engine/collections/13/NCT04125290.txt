      from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with
      relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who received at least two prior systemic
      therapies, including treatment with a PNA, on 13 September 2018. Since HCL is a rare disease,
      clinical research has limited information concerning the safety of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk
      in elderly patient populations and patients with moderate renal impairment.This study is
      being conducted to satisfy a post-marketing requirement (PMR) to provide evidence
      characterizing the safety of moxetumomab in these patients .
