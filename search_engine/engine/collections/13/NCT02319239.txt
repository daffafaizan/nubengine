    
      New local prostate cancer patients needing external radiotherapy are included into three
      radiation dose groups;

      Group I will be treated normal dosing (39 x 2 Gy) and study group II with hypofractionated
      dosing (20 x 3 Gy) and group III extreme hypofractionated dosing. Primary goal is to develop
      safe and effective curative radiotherapy for these patients

      Second aim is to study Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image (DW MRI) in radiation
      treatment response in intermediate prostate cancer.

      Patients are followed by MRI, PSA, bone scans and quality of life questionaries.
