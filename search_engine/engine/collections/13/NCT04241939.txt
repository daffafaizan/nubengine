      who are obese. It will test a novel intervention that combines modified MI-based counseling
      and BDS. We will test the feasibility of the intervention over a 12-week period, with 24-week
      follow-up compared to use of standard digital scale. All participants will undergo the
      standard adolescent weight loss program, which includes monthly clinic visits with dietary
      and physical activity counseling. The MI intervention will include modified MI, brief weekly
      telephone reinforcement, and use of a BDS. The BDS with its mobile app offers daily feedback
      through colors, daily missions to promote healthy habits, and weekly healthy tips from
      nutritionists. In addition to the primary outcome of feasibility (daily weighing)
      investigators will also explore the intervention's effect on motivation, psychological
      outcomes and various aspects of feasibility and acceptability.
