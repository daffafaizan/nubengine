        1. To compare the exhaled molecular profiles (GC-MS and eNose) between neutropenic patients
           who develop IA and neutropenic controls.

        2. To investigate whether exhaled molecular profiles can serve as surrogate to predict IA
           at an early stage.

        3. To compare the alterations in the viral/bacterial microbial profiles during the
           neutropenic episode between patients who develop IA and controls.

        4. To examine the relationship between microbial and molecular profiles in order to
           generate mechanistic hypotheses.
