      immune systems mount successful antiviral responses. However, in some instances, apparently
      immunocompetent persons manifest infections with viruses that would otherwise be observed
      only in severely immunocompromised hosts. For example, cases of herpes simplex virus (HSV)
      encephalitis, esophagitis orgastritis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, adenovirus hepatitis or
      pneumonitis, recurrent or persistent skin infections caused by HSV or varicella zoster virus
      (VZV), severe warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), recurrent respiratory
      papillomatosis caused by HPV, severe influenza or respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia, and
      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to JC polyomavirus have been described
      in apparently immunocompetent patients. While a variety of case reports have described severe
      viral infections in immunocompetent hosts, the pathogenesis of the vast majority of these
      cases is not understood, and therapy can be unsuccessful.

      In this protocol, we will evaluate patients without known immunocompromise, who have severe,
      persistent, or treatment-refractory viral infections caused by herpesviruses, adenoviruses,
      polyoma viruses, papillomaviruses, or other viral infections. We will investigate whether
      certain host or virologic factors predispose these individuals to severe disease. We will
      also determine the usefulness of various microbiologic tests (e.g., cultures, serology,
      molecular assays) for following the course of infection in these patients. The physicians in
      the Clinical Center will provide optimal therapy for these patients, as part of standard of
      care. Identification of virologic or host factors that predispose these patients to severe
      viral infections may have important implications for elucidating the pathogenesis of
      infection and for the development of novel therapies.
