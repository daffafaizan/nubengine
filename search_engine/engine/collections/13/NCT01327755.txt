      Kinyinya Health Center in Kigali), Rwanda that offer care and treatment for HIV/AIDS
      patients. Patients will be recruited during a 3-4 month period. Consenting adults who fit the
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled and followed for 2 years. Study assessments will occur at
      enrollment, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after initiation of selenium supplementation.

      Participants will be randomized using a simple randomized block design to receive either
      cotrimoxazole and selenium or cotrimoxazole and an identically appearing placebo taken once
      daily for 2 years. Participants who do not return to the clinic as scheduled will be followed
      up at home.

      All consenting patients with CD4 count between 400 and 650 mm3 will be selected because they
      are at similar immunological level and hence they will not be eligible to start ARV treatment
      at the study start. The study will look at the efficacy of selenium supplementation to this
      already compromised group of patients at a similar stage of the disease.
