      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LP-108
      administered daily as a single agent dosed orally in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory
      MDS/CMML/AML; to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LP-108 in adult subjects
      with relapsed/refractory MDS/CMML/AML.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect of LP-108
      (monotherapy or combination therapy) on ORR for AML, MDS, CMML, PFS, DOR, and OS
