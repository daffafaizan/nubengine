      both sympathetic and sympathoadrenal activities. While the adverse hemodynamic effects of
      laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation can precipitate myocardial ischemia, even in
      patients without hypertension, the responses are exaggerated in patients with hypertension .
      In the previous studies , many drugs, including opioids and beta-blockers, have been used to
      modify the hemodynamic response associated with laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. To seek
      the correlation of Fentanyl given time, we will analysis the data collected from vital signs
      monitoring machine.

      All patients were premedicated with Midazolam 0.1mg/kg , Lidocaine 0.5mg/kg (L), Propofol
      2mg/kg (P), Rocuronium 1mg/kg (R) before induction of general anesthesia. Laryngoscopy
      lasting a maximum of 30 s was attempted 3 min after administration of the induction agents.
      Fentanyl 2mcg/kg was given at different time before intubation.
