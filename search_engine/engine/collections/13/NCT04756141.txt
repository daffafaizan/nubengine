      of hospitalized patients who have a diagnosis of COVID19. The CGM will measure glucose levels
      every 5 minutes which will be accessible for viewing using a receiver phone placed outside
      the patient's room and/or an iPad located at the nursing station.

      Alarm limits for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be set on the receiver phone for nursing
      staff to review. These alarms settings will vary depending on whether the patient is on IV
      insulin infusion vs. subcutaneous (SQ) insulin. The number of glucose checks required with
      these two types of insulin varies significantly and requires separate handling.

      Hospital glucometers will be used to confirm the accuracy of CGM readings during an initial
      "Adjustment Phase" of the study. If CGMs are found to be accurate, then finger-stick
      glucometer check frequency will be decreased, and some of the CGM values will be used to dose
      insulin therapy during the "Utilization Phase" of the study. The instructions for these
      phases will differ for patients on IV insulin infusion vs. SQ insulin infusion and are
      detailed in separate protocols. Nursing staff will choose the appropriate protocol at the
      time of CGM placement based on the type of insulin the patient is receiving.

      Different patient variables (demographics, comorbidities, labs and vitals, administered
      medications) will be collected from electronic health record and will be evaluated to
      determine if they interfere with CGM readings. At the time of discharge, patients will
      receive a survey regarding satisfaction with the use of CGM monitors to manage their diabetes
      during their inpatient stay.
