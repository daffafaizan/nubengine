      traditional approach of chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy, or are not candidates for
      these approaches because of the advances stage of disease. Novel therapies that may offer
      greater potential than those currently available are urgently needed.

      AV 412 is a potent inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor family receptor tyrosine
      kinases (TKIs) and represents a growing class of anti-cancer agents. The recent introduction
      of TKIs has opened the door to new approaches to cancer treatment in which the goals of
      therapy are to halt disease progression, ameliorate symptoms, and improve patient quality of
      life. AV412 may inhibit growth of solid tumors, with fewer and less debilitating side
      effects.

      This study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of
      daily oral administration of AV 412. Patients will be assigned to escalating drug dose
      cohorts to determine the optimal dose. Evaluations to determine tolerability include PK, PD,
      and the adverse events which occur during the course of study drug administration.
