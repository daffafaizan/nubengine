    
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The introduction of modern staging systems such as computed
      tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
      has increased the detection of small peripheral lung cancers at an early stage [1]. Stage I
      non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are confined to the lung without lymph node involvement,
      and surgical resection is currently considered the standard therapeutic approach. Lobectomy
      with radical lymphadenectomy is currently considered the treatment of choice for early-stage
      lung cancer, irrespective of tumor size or its metabolic features on PET. However, the new
      TNM classification recently demonstrated that very small lung cancers may be less aggressive
      than others [2], suggesting a less aggressive surgical approach to reduce morbidity.

      According to the new TNM classification (8th edition), the overall 5-year survival rate for
      pathological stage IA NSCLC was 85%, ranging from 80% to 90% for T1a and T1c tumors
      respectively, compared with 64% for stage IB tumors [2]. Among patients with stage I cancer,
      tumor size may affect outcome and drive survival, as confirmed by different studies [7-12].

      Several studies demonstrated that primary invasive non- small-cell lung carcinomas > 2.0 cm
      were twice as likely to have nodal metastases as carcinomas ≤ 2.0 cm, emphasizing that small
      lung cancers had less lymph node involvement, and confirming a better survival [11-15]. Based
      on that, Ishida et al. and then Konaka et al. have already demonstrated the absence of lymph
      node involvement in sub-centimeter lung cancers and the feasibility to omit lymph node
      dissection in those cases [15,16]. However, Zhoua et al. recommended systematic nodal
      dissection in the presence of sub-centimeter disease, finding nodal metastases in 15% of
      NSCLC < 1 cm, but also including higher tumor stages such as stage II and III in their study
      without performing PET scan as part of the preoperative staging [17]. In our pilot study [18]
      published in 2011 in the European Journal of Thoracic Surgery, no nodal involvement was
      observed in any of the 62 patients with pulmonary nodule size less than 10 mm, in 20 out of
      120 patients (17%) with nodule size 11-20 mm, and in 9 out of 37 tumors (24%) 21-30 mm in
      size (p = 0.0007). All 55 patients with nodule SUV < 2.0 and all 26 non-solid lesions were
      pN0 (respectively, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.03). So we adopted cut-offs of 10 mm for nodule
      diameter and 2.0 as peak SUV to distinguish patients with nodal involvement from those
      without.

      These patients could be spared radical lymph node dissection if deemed not essential, thereby
      reducing operative risks, postoperative morbidity, and surgery time. A preoperative
      diagnostic determination to establish the size and correct staging of the tumor is mandatory
      for appropriate selection of candidates, avoiding unnecessary surgery.

      Data have demonstrated that positron emission tomography (PET-FDG) is a reliable tool versus
      CT in evaluating both solitary pulmonary nodules and lymph node involvement [3]. Standard
      nodal staging is initially performed non-invasively with PET followed by minimally invasive
      staging with endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA)
      when PET is suggestive of mediastinal nodal involvement. In fact, EBUS-TBNA is a minimally
      invasive procedure with a high yield for lymph node staging of lung cancer [4]. EBUS-TBNA
      allows access to the paratracheal lymph node stations (levels 2R, 2L, 4R, 4L), the subcarinal
      lymph node (level 7), hilar, interlobar, and lobar lymph nodes (levels 10, 11, and 12).
      Previous studies, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and more recently Yasufuku
      et al. have demonstrated a major impact of EBUS-TBNA on management of patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a diagnostic yield comparable to mediastinoscopy [5,6]. Annema
      et al. have recently confirmed that the sensitivity of endosonography is similar to that of
      mediastinoscopy (85% vs 79%, respectively), and associated with a lower complication rate (1%
      vs 6% for mediastinoscopy), so concluding that endosonography should be the first step for
      mediastinal nodal staging [19].

      In patients without evidence of mediastinal nodal metastasis on PET and CT, the need for
      EBUS-TBNA becomes less clear. The most recent American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)
      evidence-based guidelines recommend minimally invasive mediastinal staging with a needle
      technique in patients with a central tumor or nodal hilar disease (N1) on PET/CT. This is
      based on the increased prevalence of N2 disease in this group, but this is a grade 1C
      recommendation, that is based on low quality evidence. In patients with peripheral tumors and
      no evidence of mediastinal or hilar nodal disease on PET/CT, invasive staging is not
      recommended.

      Concerns have been raised regarding these recommendations given that the prevalence of occult
      nodal metastasis in patients with N0 disease by PET/CT appears to be higher than previously
      reported, with recent studies showing values as high as 17-22% [20,21]. EBUS-TBNA may provide
      an attractive option to increase staging accuracy. However, sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA in
      patients with clinical N0/N1 disease on PET/CT is unclear and largely based on retrospective
      studies [22,23]. The only prospective study published by Leong et al. [24] demonstrated that
      a significant proportion of patients with N0/N1 disease by PET/CT had N2 disease (20%) and
      EBUS-TBNA was able to identify a substantial fraction of these patients, thus improving
      diagnostic accuracy compared with PET/CT alone. Sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA however appears
      lower compared with historical data from patients with larger volume mediastinal disease
      [5,6,26].

      TRIAL OBJECTIVES

      Hypotheses:

        -  In selected series the overall sensitivity of EBUS varies from 80-90% (88%) but for
           clinical N0/N1 drops to 40-49%.

        -  About 24% of patients with early stage lung cancer > 2 cm and less than 5 cm (T1b,c and
           T2a,b N0 PET-) would be N+ , whereas none of the T1a (less or equal than 1 cm) NSCLC
           would be upstaged considering the absence of N+ [19].

      From reference 19 pT size ALL pN+ <10 mm 62 0 ( 0%) 11-20 mm 120 20 (17%) >20 mm 37 9 (24%)

      7. OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF TRIAL

      7.1 Design of the study All patients clinical stage I and II will be undergone EBUS-TBNA for
      the staging of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.

      All patients will be undergoing robotic (RATS) or videothoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy plus
      radical lymph node dissection following the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) guideline. All
      lymph nodes previously sampled with EBUS-TBNA will be compared with those harvested during
      surgery.

      Statistical analysis Observed (Surgery) pN- pN+ Predicted EBUS Negative TN FN UPSTAGING =
      (FN+TP)/total patients Positive FP TP SENSITIVITY is defined as the ration of TP/ (TP+FN) A
      sample size of 12 upstaged patients will achieve 80% power to detect a difference of
      sensitivity >38.4% assuming that the sensitivity under the null hypothesis is 49% (results of
      the meta-analysis by Leong et al, 2018 [22]), and that the actual sensitivity is >88% (95.6%
      in the study by Guarize et al, 2018 [25]) using a two-sided binomial test.

      Assuming that the proportion of patients with pathological pN+ (upstaging) is 24%, a total
      sample of 50 patients will be necessary to be enrolled in the study.

      This hypothesis will be rejected if 2 or more FN are observed among the 12 upstaged patients.
