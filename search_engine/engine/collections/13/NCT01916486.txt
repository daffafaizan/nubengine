      twice-weekly exercise program, complex mental and social activities program, or stretch and
      relaxation program. After 6 months of intervention, they will be followed for an additional 6
      months. There will be four measurement sessions: baseline, 3 months, 6 months (end of
      intervention period); and 12 months.
