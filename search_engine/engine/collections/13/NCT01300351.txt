    
      Fulvestrant, at a dose of 250mg every 28 days, is the first oestrogen receptor antagonist
      with no agonist effects shown to be at least as effective for both TTP (Time to Progression)
      and OR (Objective Response) as a third-generation aromatase inhibitor in the second-line
      treatment of advanced breast cancer (Howell et al 2002, Osborne CK et al 2002).In these
      studies overall survival was also similar between the fulvestrant and anastrozole treatment
      arms (Pippen J et al 2003). Fulvestrant has received approval in 70 countries worldwide at
      this dose regimen.

      However, evidence from a number of studies suggests that higher dose may be able to enhance
      efficacy further:

        -  Data from Study 0036 (Addo S et al, 2002) suggested that a dose-response relationship
           may exist. In female volunteers given a single intramuscular (i.m.) injection of
           fulvestrant (250mg, 125mg or placebo), there was a dose-dependent inhibition of
           ethinyloestradiol-induced endometrial thickening seen at Day 28.

        -  Results from short term exposure to fulvestrant in Studies 0002 (DeFriend D et al 1994)
           and 0018 (Robertson et al 2001) showed that expression of ER, progesterone receptor
           (PgR) and the cell proliferation-related antigen Ki67 are reduced in a dose-dependent
           manner.

        -  Data from Studies 0020 (Howell et al 2002) and 0021(Osborne CK et al 2002) suggested
           that a dose-response effect exists for fulvestrant. Fulvestrant 250mg was shown to be
           superior to fulvestrant 125mg, which was discontinued as it failed to meet minimum
           efficacy requirements.

        -  Evidence from pharmacokinetic modelling indicated that fulvestrant 500 mg dose regiment
           can achieve higher steady state plasma concentrations compared with fulvestrant 250mg
           and that steady state concentrations can be achieved earlier than with fulvestrant
           250mg.

        -  Data from Study CONFIRM (A Di Leo et al 2009), a phase III randomised parallel-group
           trial, demonstrated that fulvestrant 500mg offers a statistically significant longer TTP
           compared with fulvestrant 250mg (median TTP: 6.5 months vs. 5.5 months; hazard
           ratio=0.80 [95% CI 0.68 to 0.94]; P=0.006), which seemed to be the consequence of an
           increase in the rate, and of a prolongation in duration, of disease stabilization. The
           50% events overall survival analysis also seemed to favour fulvestrant 500mg, although
           statistical significance was not reached(hazard ratio=0.84 [95% CI 0.69 to 1.03];
           P=0.091). The safety analysis did not raise any relevant concerns in relation to
           fulvestrant 500mg. Therefore, this study will compare Fulvestrant 500mg with fulvestrant
           250mg in a Chinese population in order to understand the optimal dose for Chinese
           patients with breast cancer.
