      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary Efficacy of intermittent oral dosing of CM082
      tablets in Chinese patients with mCNV. The study will be performed in two different parts,
      dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose-expansion phase (Part 2). Subjects will receive CM082
      orally for two weeks followed by two weeks off in four-week cycles. There are three dose
      levels, 25mg BID,50mg QD and 50mg BID. The total treatment period is tentatively set at 3
      cycles (12 weeks). Based on data from dose escalation studies, identify safe and effective
      doses for expanded enrollment studies.The assessment of the safety and efficacy will be done
      in 2、4、8、12weeks after the first dose.Also, single/multiple dose pharmacokinetics in these
      patients will be studied.
