      was incidence of CNP three months postoperatively (POP) in patients undergoing VATS surgery
      with ESPB as the regional anaesthesia technique. The secondary outcome was to describe pain
      control at PACU, 12 and 24 hours POP and QoL reported up to three months after surgery. We
      hypothesised that patients with ESPB would have a low incidence of acute and CNP and report a
      good QoL.
