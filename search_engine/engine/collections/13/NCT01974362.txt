    
      Retrospectively study the behavior of implant supported rehabilitations made from
      full-zirconium dioxide (monolithic) and zirconia veneered with feldspathic in full-mouth type
      of rehabilitations (maxilla and mandible).

      In a private clinic we will record the behavior, regarding chipping and complications in both
      groups (monolithic vs feldspathic ceramic) after 1 year in function.

      We will make calibration of the investigators for chipping detection, characterization of big
      and small problem and accept an inter-observer agreement (Kappa) of 0.9 for each parameter.

      Recording will be made without the help of magnifying utilities such as magnifying glasses or
      optical microscopes.
