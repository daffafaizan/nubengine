      flap is done for the filtering surgery. The concept of ologen collagen matrix is to creat the
      subconjunctiva bleb and modulate the wound healing for the surgery. By implanting ologen
      collagen matrix in the place, subconjuctival and trabdoor scars might be prevented. This is
      because the ologen collagen matrix is a 3-D scaffold porous structure that can guide
      fibroblast to grow randomly, instead of linear alignment. This can reduce the scar formation.

      Doctors apply MMC for the glaucoma surgery is also trying to inhibite the scar formation. But
      MMC has been long time used and glaucoma specialists have not found anything to replace it.

      Ologen collagen matrix concept is not INHIBITION, it is guiding and creating a physiological
      tissue. The successful of ologen collagen matrix may be on par with MMC but the safety and
      side effects will be much less.
