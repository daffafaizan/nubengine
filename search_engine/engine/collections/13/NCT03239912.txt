    
      Class II malocclusion is considered as the most common malocclusion between patients.

      Recently low-level laser enters the world of dentistry, some studies assessed the effect of
      low-level laser on the growth of mandibles and condyles in animals and showed that there is a
      good effect of laser on the mandible growth.

      This study will evaluate the effect of low-level laser on the growth of the mandible and the
      duration of functional treatment.

      Twin-block will be applied in two groups: The control group will receive the twin-block only,
      and the experimental group will receive the twin-block combined with low-level laser therapy
      on the TMG region.

      Cephalometric radiographs will be gotten before and after functional treatment to evaluate
      the dento-skeletal changes.
