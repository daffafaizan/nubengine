      investigation about its effects.

      However, firstly it is needed to assess the feasibility and safety of the HIIT protocol, to
      integrate it in the daily practise and future research.

      In a single-center, single-blinded randomized feasiblity study, the investigators aim to
      prove the feasibility and safety of a 12 week HIIT programm.
