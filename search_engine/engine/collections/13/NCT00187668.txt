      in membrane transporters and other genes relevant to human disease or drug response,
      including drug metabolizing enzymes, collagen, race/ethnicity, neurovascular disease,
      asthma/allergy/lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. This phase of the study will serve
      as the hypothesis-generating phase for future studies by identifying genetic variants and
      determining allele frequencies among an ethnically diverse cohort of healthy volunteers.
      Future investigations (separate IRB applications) will attempt to correlate genotypes to
      phenotypes among this cohort of volunteers. The allele identification and frequency data from
      this group of healthy volunteers will also be used to design association studies in relevant
      disease populations.

      Determine if identified sequence variants are associated with gain or loss of in vitro
      biologic function using lymphocytes obtained from patients.
