      sustained hyperglycaemia in the development of diabetic complications. The present randomized
      controlled trial was designed with primary aim to evaluate glycaemic fluctuation in the
      comparison between twice-daily Exenatide and other treatment paradigm (e.g. insulin Aspart
      30).
