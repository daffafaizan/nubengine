      of bleeding during surgery.

      The in vivo calibration has not been adjusted to the gold standard haemoglobin determination
      in the literature yet.

      Two blood samples will be withdrawn at the same time from an arterial line, one for the
      central laboratory and the other one for the POC device. At the same exact time the SpHb
      measurement will be recorded. At least eight samples are expected per patient. A maximum of
      20 samples will be withdrawn per patient.

      To compare bias, precision and limits of agreement among SpHb, LabHb and COoxHb the Bland
      Altman method will be used with multiple observations per subject when the true value varies.
      An error grid analysis will be made to know how it could affect to clinical decision making.
