      established fast-track concept. During the premedication visit, the investigators informed
      the patients that the intention is to perform the TF-TAVI, if acceptable, solely in local
      anaesthesia, in order to minimize potentially adverse pharmacological central effects by
      analgosedation. After insertion of two peripheral venous lines and an arterial line,
      monitoring of cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy was established.
      Transthoracic echocardiography has been performed to evaluate volume status, using the
      inferior vena cava collapsibility index. Additionally, cardiac output and ejection fraction
      was calculated.

      Based on the data of the investigators and current data from the literature, the
      investigators assume a postoperative hospital stay of 8 days after TF-TAVI. With a possible
      reduction of the hospital stay by about 25%, the investigators calculated a case number of
      100 patients per group. The study is designed with a control group under standard therapy.
      Data are recorded and analyzed descriptively. Qualitative comparisons will be made in the
      discussion of previously published data.
