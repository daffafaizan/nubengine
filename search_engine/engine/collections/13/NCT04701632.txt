      at Methodist Dallas Medical Center between June 2018 and February 2019. These patients were
      all administered PHQ-9 as part of a quality improvement project. The medical records included
      for analysis will be from male and female patients aged 18 years or older. The medical
      records will be reviewed for the following information: general demographics, information
      including age, sex, ethnicity, race, PHQ-9 score (total and individual items), medical
      conditions, wound history, past medical history, general symptoms, abuse and suicide risk,
      activities of daily living, motivation assessment, mental status, and pain ratings. This
      information will be used to measure the prevalence of clinically significant depression in
      the sample, which is the primary aim. We will also use the data to establish factors and
      variables correlated with the presence and severity of clinically significant depression.
