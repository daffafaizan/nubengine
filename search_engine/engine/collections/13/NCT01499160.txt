      HER2 status:

      Group 1: HER2-positive in the tumor tissue Group 2: HER2 negative in the tumor tissue

      In the first part of the study, all of the patients will receive the combination of lapatinib
      1,500 mg/day and letrozole 2.5 mg/day. We do not expect any significant toxicity from this
      combination since the previous study of lapatinib and letrozole showed that this combination
      is safe with no grade 3-4 toxicities observed. Restaging scans (CT scan, MRI, or bone scan)
      will be obtained after every 12 weeks of treatment. In those patients who progress from any
      group, everolimus 5 mg/day will be added to letrozole and lapatinib will be reduced to 1,250
      mg/day as per the SWOG phase I study of lapatinib and everolimus. The outcome of each group
      will continue to be assessed separately. We do not expect to see additional serious toxicity
      from adding everolimus to the combination of lapatinib and letrozole. All of the treatment
      will be continued until disease progression.
