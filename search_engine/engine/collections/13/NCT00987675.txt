      Primary

        -  To evaluate the side effects and patient-reported quality of life outcomes of the index
           (largest) lesion treatment with high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation in patients
           with progressive â‰¤ T3b, N0, M0 prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the success of this treatment by demonstrating the absence of cancer in the
           treated or ablated area on the 6 month post-treatment transrectal ultrasound biopsy.

        -  To evaluate the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after index lesion ablation
           treatment in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the proportion of these patients who, after undergoing index lesion control
           treatment, require androgen blockade at the 12-month follow-up.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo transrectal high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation (HIFU) to
      the index lesion and other identifiable secondary lesions. Patients are evaluated at 6 months
      and may repeat HIFU treatment.

      Patients undergo MRI and ultrasound at baseline and periodically thereafter, and blood
      samples are collected periodically for PSA, renal function, full blood count, and
      testosterone levels. Patients also complete questionnaires (IPSS, IPSS-QOL, ICS, FACT-P, and
      IIEF-5) at baseline; at 6 weeks; and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 months.
