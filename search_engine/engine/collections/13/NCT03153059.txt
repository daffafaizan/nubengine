        1. a large number of defecation group (≥ 2-3 times/day) - 20 subjects

        2. normal defecation group (1 time/day or 1 time/2 days) - 20 subjects

        3. a small number of defecation group (≤ 2 times/week) - 20 subjects

      After collection of stools, we will analyze the composition and distribution of gut
      microbiota, and compared the results of three groups.
