    
      Retrospectively review of the medical records of all patients with orbital complications of
      paranasal sinusitis hospitalized at the ORL-HNS department at the University of Tanta between
      2010 and 2020. Sex, age, symptoms, history, ophthalmological findings, laboratory and imaging
      findings, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed by staging.

      The data that will be retrieved from the medical records including:

        1. History taking including personal present and previous medical history.

        2. General examination

        3. Oto-rhinolaryngological clinical examination

        4. Routine preoperative laboratory investigations (e.g. complete total and differential
           blood count, blood sugar, coagulation profile, and renal and liver function)

        5. Diagnostic nasal Endoscopy with zero and/or a 30-degree telescope.

        6. CT paranasal sinuses with contrast, fine cuts in coronal axial, and sagittal planes.

        7. The type of intervention whether medical or surgical. 8- Culture results, treatments,
           hospital stay durations, and outcomes.

      Ophthalmology data collection:

        1. Visual acuity (onset of decrease) (unilateral or bilateral) ant its improvement after
           sinus surgery

        2. Presence or absence of double vision (Diplopia)

        3. Ocular motility and if its associated with pain

        4. Proptosis (present or absent) and calculate the degree and direction

        5. Ptosis (present or absent)

        6. Pupil reactivity

        7. Fundus examination to exclude optic nerve neuropathy

        8. Association between ocular pain and headache and its improvement after surgery

        9. CT data collection (CT orbit, MRI of sinus and head)

       10. Fundus photography after surgery to see improvement of optic nerve neuropathy if present
