      created in Jaseng Hospital. This treatment involves patients with musculoskeletal pain to
      move the part of their body actively during acupuncture treatment under physicians'
      observation. This treatment is known to relieve the pain and increase the range of
      motion(ROM). However, there has been no specific value for the effect of this treatment.

      So, we conducted a randomized controlled trials to verify the efficacy and safety of
      trapezuis MSAT. From July 2019 to September 2019, we collected 100 inpatients who were
      suffered from posterior nick pain with the numeric rating scale(NRS) over 4 after whiplash
      injury by acute traffic accident(TA). For experimental group(n=50), we conducted MSAT three
      times(on 2nd, 3rd and 4th day of hospitalization) and other Korean medical treatment. For
      control group(n=50), just Korean medical treatment except MSAT was conducted. For these two
      groups, we compared NRS, Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), Range Of Motion(ROM), Nthe amount of
      pain via NRS(Numeric Rating Scale), VAS(Visual Analogue Scale), ROM(Range Of Motion), Neck
      Disability Index (NDI), and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D).
