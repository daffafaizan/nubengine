      I. Determine the prevalence of HPV-associated premalignant lesions in the anus and penis in
      Indian HIV-seropositive men who have sex with men (MSM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe risk factors for prevalent premalignant lesions in the anus and penis in Indian
      HIV-seropositive MSM.

      II. Describe the prevalence and incidence of penile and anal HPV infection in Indian
      HIV-seropositive MSM.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive a questionnaire and undergo a targeted physical and anal clinical exam
      at months 0, 6, and 12. Participants also undergo a penile skin cell and anal swab at months
      0, 6, and 12 for cytology, HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and CD4+ T-cell count at months 0
      and 6 and HIV viral load testing at months 0 and 12. Participants also undergo
      high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and penile clinical exam at month 12.
