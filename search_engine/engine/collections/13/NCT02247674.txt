    
      Objective: To investigate the training effects of interlimb force coupling training on
      paretic hand and upper extremity outcomes in patients with chronic stroke; to analyze the
      relationship between motor recovery of paretic hand, arm and functional abilities.

      Design: A double-blind randomized controlled trial with outcome assessment at baseline and
      after 4 weeks intervention.

      Setting: Department of physical medicine and rehabilitation in Taipei Veterans General
      Hospital.

      Participants: Thirty-three subjects (mean age = 55.1 Â± 10.5 y/o) with chronic stroke were
      recruited and randomized assigned to training (n=16) and control group (n=17).

      Interventions: Interlimb force coupling training task included different gripforce generation
      on the both hands.

      Main Outcome Measures: Barthel Index (BI), and the upper extremity motor control of
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), Motor Assessment Score (MAS), and the Wolf Motor Function
      Test (WMFT). All assessment was executed by a blinded evaluator, and data management and
      statistical analysis was also conducted by a blinded statistic researcher.
