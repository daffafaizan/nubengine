    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the 3-month rate of patients experiencing an increase in Child-Pugh (CP)
      score by 2 or more points of 5-fraction stereotactic body proton radiotherapy (SBPT) in the
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 3-month complication rate as defined by grade 3 or higher acute adverse
      event.

      II. To assess late toxicity with 2 year follow-up. III. To estimate the 6-month local
      control, liver disease control, progression free survival and overall survival.

      IV. To determine objective imaging response rates at 6 months by Modified (m) Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and RECIST criteria.

      V. To determine the value of volumetric imaging analysis compared to mRECIST and RECIST in
      the setting of HCC treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

      CORRELATIVE AND EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate patient-reported outcomes. II. To evaluate clinical features, treatment
      technique, and dose-volume parameters associated with better local control and fewer adverse
      events.

      III. To determine the value of additional imaging analyses and techniques for assessing tumor
      response after treatment with SBRT IV. To blood bank patient specimens for future analysis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 1 SBPT fraction over 20-30 minutes per day for a total of 5 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 , 6, 12 and 24
      months, then annually for 3 years.
