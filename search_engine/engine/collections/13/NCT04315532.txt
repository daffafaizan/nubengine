      periodontal treatment on sex steroid and stress markers at pregnancy gingivitis. A total of
      84 subjects; 22 pregnant women with gingivitis (group 1) and 25 pregnant women with
      periodontal healthy (pregnant group), group 2), 22 non-pregnant women with gingivitis (group
      3) and 15 non-pregnant women with periodontal healthy (non-pregnant group), group 4)
      participated in this study. Clinically, plaque index, gingival index, and probing pocket
      depth were measured at baseline and after therapy.
