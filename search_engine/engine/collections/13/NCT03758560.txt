      admitted in-patient-unit of orthopaedic ward planned for lower limb trauma surgery under
      spinal anesthesia. Recruited patients will be counseled and informed about the study and
      information sheet and consent form provided. Will obtain consent from the participant.
      patients will be asked to complete N- PCS questionnaire preoperatively a night before surgery
      in patient unit. On arrival to the operating room, standard monitoring will be applied. All
      the patients will receive spinal anaesthesia with 2.6 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine (0.5%) and
      fentanyl 20 µg. NRS scale will be used to assess the intensity of their pain postoperatively
      on arrival to Post-anesthesia care unit, at 2, 4, 6, 12 h and 24 h after the end of surgery.
      One gram paracetamol IV and Ketorolac 30 mg IV will be given at the end of surgery and
      continued at 6 and 8 h intervals postoperatively. If the Numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain
      is > 3 at rest, tramadol 50 mg IV bolus administered, and repeated at 10 min intervals until
      NRS was ≤ 3 for the first 24 h. Patients will be asked to rate their worst or maximum pain
      intensity during the first 24 hours after surgery, on an 11-point numerical rating scale.
      Socio-demographic variables (age, BMI, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, occupation
      and education), preoperative anxiety of the participant will be recorded.
