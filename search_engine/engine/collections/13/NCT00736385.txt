      results, and scarring of the liver. It may occur more often in people with obesity, high
      levels of cholesterol (blood fats), diabetes (high blood sugar), or the insulin resistance
      syndrome (where a person's body does not respond to the hormone insulin which helps keep
      blood sugar levels normal). Currently, no effective drug treatment for NAFLD exists. There is
      increasing evidence that NAFLD may be a condition due to a problem with metabolism (the way
      your body uses energy). Previous studies have shown that high glucose (sugar) levels may play
      an important role in the development of fatty liver disease. Medications that decrease your
      natural glucose level may reduce the amount of fat in the liver and, therefore, might be
      useful in the treatment of NAFLD. Metformin, a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in patients with diabetes, has been shown to improve fatty liver
      in animals and in a small number of human beings.
