      be conducted. Forty subjects ages 18 years and older will be enrolled.The Internet-based
      survey will be piloted to evaluate its effect on adherence to topical psoriasis medication.
      Subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Internet-survey group will log their impression of
      the state of their psoriasis on a weekly basis. Subjects in both the intervention and control
      groups will receive standard-of-care topical fluocinonide 0.05% ointment to be applied to
      affected areas on the skin twice daily. Adherence to fluocinonide will be assessed using
      Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMSÂ®) caps, electronic monitors affixed to the
      medication containers. Investigators and subjects will be blinded to the adherence data until
      the final (Month 12) treatment visit.
