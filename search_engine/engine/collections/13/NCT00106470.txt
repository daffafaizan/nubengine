      This study will concentrate on a genetically isolated Hispanic population with a high
      prevalence of COPD living in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Nine hundred individuals from
      descendants of the Costa Rican Central Valley founder population will be enrolled. To
      identify regions of the genome that are likely to contain genetic determinants of
      COPD-related phenotypes in this population, the study will collect phenotypic and genotypic
      data on 30 large families with a history of moderate to severe COPD that have multiple
      individuals affected with smoking-related airflow obstruction. A genome scan will be
      conducted on these individuals using short-tandem repeat (STR) markers. Linkage analysis will
      be performed on 6 COPD-related phenotypes, which will include the following: 1) chronic
      bronchitis; 2) airflow obstruction; 3) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); 4)
      FEV1/FVC[forced vital capacity];5) bronchodilator responsiveness; and 6) total serum
      immunoglobulin E. Within genomic regions demonstrating linkage to COPD-related phenotypes in
      the genome scan, narrowly spaced STR markers will be genotyped and tested for linkage between
      these markers and COPD-related phenotypes. Within selected genomic regions, the association
      will be tested between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and
      COPD-related phenotypes. By enrolling a large number of participants of a genetically
      isolated population and utilizing a family-based study design, this study should be able to
      address an important yet unstudied issue: the genetic influences on the expression of the
      COPD phenotype in Hispanics.
