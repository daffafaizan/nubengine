    
      The trial is designed

        1. To investigate the cardiac MRI related adverse event-free rate in patients with long
           term implanted coradial pacing leads (Fineline-II) after implantable pulse generator
           (IPG) exchange to a MRI conditional system (short term and long term): Safety.

        2. To assess the technical performance of MRI conditional pacemaker systems with long term
           implanted coradial pacing leads, for cardiac MRI (short term and long term):
           Effectiveness pacemaker.

        3. To assess the image quality (IQ) and the diagnostic value (DV) of the cardiac MRI scans
           in patients with implanted MRI conditional systems: Effectiveness cardiac MRI.

           2) To evaluate the clinical incidence of MRI procedures in the population of long term
           implanted pacemaker patients (long term-follow up)
