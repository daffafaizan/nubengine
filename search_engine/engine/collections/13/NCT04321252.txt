        -  Part A is a single ascending dose (SAD) study with 4 cohorts of 8 subjects each, where
           participants will receive 1 dose of KAE609 or placebo (contains no medicine).

        -  Part B is a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study with 2 cohorts of 9 subjects each, where
           participants will receive 5 doses of KAE609 or placebo.

      A review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data will be conducted at the completion of each
      cohort prior to dosing of the next subsequent cohort.
