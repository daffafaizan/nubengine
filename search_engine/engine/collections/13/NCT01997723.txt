      laboratory-based PSG in effectively diagnosing OSA in urban African Americans.

      The specific aims of this project are:

      Primary Aims: Aim 1. To compare the validity of a comprehensive and current PM technology to
      standard in-laboratory full PSG

      1a) to measure and compare diagnostic accuracy of home-based PM with laboratory-PSG

        1. b) to measure and compare diagnostic accuracy of simultaneous laboratory-based PM with
           laboratory-PSG Aim 2. To test the reliability and examine the applicability of PM in the
           home-setting

        2. a) to compare diagnostic accuracy of home-based PM with laboratory-based PM

      2b) to examine factors associated with technical reliability (data failure rate) of
      home-based PM 2c) to compare patient satisfaction and preference of testing in home-setting
      to laboratory-setting
