      excess health care costs in the United States and accounts for 30% of U.S. cancer deaths.
      Varenicline and bupropion SR (sustained-release) are non nicotine pharmacotherapies
      FDA-indicated for the treatment of tobacco dependence in cigarette smokers. Although
      varenicline has proven greater efficacy than bupropion SR, both medications are associated
      with high end-of-treatment smoking abstinence rates. However, almost two-thirds of smokers
      treated with varenicline report smoking at 6 months. Because varenicline and bupropion SR
      have different mechanisms of action and different neuropharmacologic targets, combination
      pharmacotherapy with these agents may increase long-term smoking abstinence rates above what
      is observed with single-agent therapy. In our recent pilot study of combination therapy with
      varenicline and bupropion SR, we observed treatment to be well-tolerated with 7-day point
      prevalence smoking abstinence rates of 71% (95% CI: 54-85%) at 3 months and 58% (95% CI:
      41-74%) at 6 months. Determining the efficacy of combination therapy compared to single-agent
      therapy has immediate and important clinical implications. In this study, we will conduct a
      randomized, multicenter, controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of combination
      therapy with varenicline and bupropion SR compared to varenicline and placebo in 506
      cigarette smokers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, and the University of Minnesota in
      Minneapolis, MN.
