      Alzheimer), is in line with a steady increase of the average life expectancy in Switzerland.
      With the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and the increasing number of elderly
      people, the need for institutional care intensifies, which contrasts with the desire of most
      elderly and patients to live independently. The rapid evolution of assistive technology
      offers new possibilities in providing medical professionals preventive services in real-time.
      An extended stay in the hospital could influence independent ageing negatively and thus,
      monitoring has great potential to prevent critical events. In this study, the main focus is
      on the individual sensors and how they can be combined to one unobtrusive system. In
      addition, to get an understanding which parameters of the sensors are important and how the
      data can be extracted and processed (algorithms). Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      validate the accuracy to assess human behaviour and daily activities during day and night by
      unobtrusive sensors in an instrumented apartment in healthy participants.
