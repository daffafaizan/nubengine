      and long-term treatment efficacy of AOIE, action observation alone, versus control treatment
      on clinical outcomes of patients with subacute stroke, (2) examine the neural mechanisms and
      activation changes after the 3 interventions by using an advanced brain imaging technique,
      magnetoencephalography (MEG), (3) determine the correlations between neural activation
      changes and clinical outcomes, and (4) identify who are the good responders to the AOIE
      therapy. An estimated total of 96 patients with subacute stroke will be recruited in this
      study. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of the 3 interventions for 3
      weeks (a total of 15 sessions). Clinical outcome measures will be conducted at baseline,
      immediately after treatment (3 weeks), and at 3 months follow-up. The MEG assessment will be
      conducted at baseline and immediately after treatment (3 weeks). For the MEG study, The
      investigators anticipate to enroll 12 to 15 patients in each group to complete neuroimaging
      evaluation because of the specific eligibility criteria and high costs of MEG. The patients
      can still participate in the study, receiving rehabilitation therapy and clinical
      evaluations, even if the participants will not be included in the MEG study.
