      The CUA uses the Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) that combines the length of life with the
      health related quality of life (HRQoL) into a single score.

      In Quebec, no QALY calculation tool has been adapted to its linguistic and socio-cultural
      context, neither for its general population nor for a particular subpopulation, like patients
      with cancer.

      The objectives will be to analyze the extent of the divergence in terms of health states
      utilities between the general population and patients with breast or colorectal cancer; to
      develop a QALY preference weights dataset for patients with cancer; to perform "mapping" with
      different health-related quality of life questionnaires by correlating SF6Dv2 with EQ-5D-5L,
      EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT- G. The data will be collected with a self-administered online survey.
      Patients outcomes will be measured at the beginning of the chemotherapy treatment cycle and
      about 8 days after the start of chemotherapy. Health utilities will be measured with a hybrid
      method using the time-trade-off (TTO) and the discrete experimental choice (DCE) method using
      SF6Dv2 questionnaire for health states.
