      diagnosed during the first year post SOT and HSCT; 2a) Determine the all-cause mortality
      within 3 months of a respiratory viral infection diagnosed during an inpatient admission in
      the first year post SOT and HSCT; 2b) Determine the proportion of deaths within 3 months of a
      respiratory viral infection diagnosed during an inpatient admission deemed to be directly
      attributable to that infection; and 3) To identify factors known at time of onset of the
      inpatient respiratory viral infection that are associated with all-cause mortality. The study
      cohort will consist of any SOT or HSCT recipient â‰¤18 years of age that received their
      transplant between January 1st, 2010 and June 30th, 2013. Th cohort will determine the
      incidence of respiratory viral infections diagnosed during an inpatient admission in the
      first year post-transplant. A sub-cohort of patients that develop a respiratory viral
      infection within one year of transplantation will be leveraged to investigate factors
      associated with mortality in the 3 months after respiratory viral infection. Baseline and
      demographic characteristics will be summarized by standard descriptive summaries. Categorical
      variables will be summarized by frequencies while continuous variables will be summarized
      using mean, standard deviation and/or median, twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles,
      minimum, and maximum. This is a minimal risk study using data that will be collected
      retrospectively from medical charts. The only potential risk would be loss of
      confidentiality.
