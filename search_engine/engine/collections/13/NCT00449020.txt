      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with newly diagnosed stage IIIA or
           IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treated with concurrent carboplatin, irinotecan
           hydrochloride, and radiotherapy followed by consolidation docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the safety, toxicity, and complications of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the median survival, 1-year and 2-year survival, and time to tumor progression
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes followed by
           irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo radiotherapy
           once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats weekly for up to 7 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Consolidation chemotherapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy,
           patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for
           up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 4 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
