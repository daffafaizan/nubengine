        1. Remove one ovary (maybe both ovaries depending on the condition) is performed by
           laparoscopic surgery. (Depending on the condition of patients, the investigators remove
           both ovaries to increase a chance to obtain residual follicles. Also, in some cases, the
           investigators need to perform laparotomy, i.e. open surgery, depending on the patient's
           condition).

        2. Quickly dissect ovarian cortex from the ovarian medulla and cut into small stripes.
           Histological analyses are performed using small parts of the ovarian stripes to find
           residual follicles.

        3. Optional: Cryopreserve the ovarian stripes by a vitrification method. Two days before
           the day of reimplantation, thaw the ovarian stripes.

        4. The ovarian stripes are cut into small cubes (1 x1 mm2). The ovarian cubes are cultured
           with medium containing drugs to activate dormant follicles for 2 days before
           transplantation. After washing, the cubes are transplanted beneath the membrane of both
           Fallopian tubes and the remaining ovary under laparoscopic surgery.

        5. Monitor follicle growth by ultrasound and serum hormone assays. Once follicles reach >16
           mm in diameter, patients receive hCG, followed by egg retrieval in ~36 hours. Then the
           investigators will perform intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using the husband's
           sperm. When embryos reached the four-cell stage, they were cryopreserved, waiting for
           frozen-thaw embryo transfer.

      II Current procedure:

      Only superficial cut of the ovarian cortex by laparoscopy or laparotomy, without taking ovary
      outside or cultured with medium.
