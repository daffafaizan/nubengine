      I. Evaluate cardiovascular reserve capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption
      (VO2peak), in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors.

      II. Define the determinants of VO2peak impairment in HCT survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo echocardiogram to assess cardiac function and mechanics, cardiopulmonary
      exercise test, pulmonary function test, musculoskeletal ultrasound, bioelectrical impedance
      analysis to measure total lean body mass and percent body fat), physical function tests, and
      collection of blood samples within 45 days from the start of conditioning therapy, and at 6
      months, 1 year, and 2 years post-transplant.
