      screening tool for BE. The capsule, which is attached to a thin, flexible tether, is reusable
      after being processed by a standard disinfection technique. Used without sedation, the
      capsule is swallowed by the participant and travels in the esophagus to the gastroesophageal
      junction (GEJ) via peristalsis. Cross-sectional microscopic OCT images of the entire
      esophagus are collected during transit. The total time needed for swallowing, imaging and
      retrieval does not exceed 10 minutes, with a total of 30 minutes for the procedure. The
      investigators have tested the feasibility and the tolerability of this new OCT screening
      technology in 250 procedures in healthy volunteers and patients with various esophageal
      diseases including BE. The procedure has been safe and well tolerated. High quality
      microscopic images of the esophagus have been obtained in 90% of the enrolled subjects.
