      young children require a return to the operating room every six to nine months until skeletal
      maturity. The Shilla system allows for more spinal growth with fewer surgical procedures
      necessary for lengthenings. This is a major advantage over existing growth permitting systems
      and allows surgery to be performed at younger ages with better deformity correction without
      concerns of repeated surgeries.
