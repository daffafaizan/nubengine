        -  Determine whether a lidocaine patch vs placebo improves postsurgical neuropathic pain in
           cancer patients.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on mood states, functional abilities, and overall
           quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to etiology of pain (breast surgery vs lung surgery vs amputation vs
      other), duration of pain (1-3 months vs 4-6 months vs more than 6 months), and current
      analgesic regimen (opioids [including tramadol] vs antidepressants vs anticonvulsants vs
      combination vs other vs none). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a lidocaine transdermal patch (up to 3 patches) applied directly
           to the painful area for 18 hours once daily. Treatment continues for 4 weeks in the
           absence of unacceptable toxicity. At the end of week 4, patients cross over to arm II.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a placebo transdermal patch applied to the painful area as in
           arm I. At the end of week 4, patients cross over to arm I.

      Pain and quality of life are assessed at baseline and weeks 4 and 8.

      Patients are followed at 3-7 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
