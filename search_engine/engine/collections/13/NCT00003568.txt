    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Define the antitumor activity of gp100:209-217 (210M), a melanoma peptide derived from
           gp100 mixed with Montanide ISA-51, in combination with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)
           administered by various schedules in patients with advanced melanoma.

        -  Examine the effect of the addition of gp100:209-217 (210M) peptide vaccine to high-dose
           IL-2 on the toxicity of the treatment in these patients.

        -  Define the induction of T-cell responses to gp100:209-217 (210M) peptide and its gp100
           (parent) protein by ELISA with interferon gamma production or CTL precursor frequencies
           in these patients after the initial course of treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      therapy (adjuvant interferon vs chemotherapy for advanced disease vs both vs none), ECOG
      performance status (0 vs 1), and number of organ sites involved (1 vs more than 1). Patients
      are randomized into 1 of 3 treatment arms. (Arm III closed to accrual as of 11/30/1998.)

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccination comprising gp100:209-217 (210M) peptide mixed with
           Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Patients also receive
           high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours on days 2-6 and 16-20.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vaccination as in arm I on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Patients
           also receive high-dose IL-2 as in arm I on days 44-48 and 60-64. Patients who
           demonstrate rapid visible disease progression during the initial 4 weeks of therapy
           while maintaining good performance status may begin high-dose IL-2 on day 23.

        -  Arm III (closed to accrual as of 11/30/1998): Patients receive vaccination as in arm I
           on day 1 and then high-dose IL-2 as in arm I on day 2. Patients with nonhematologic
           toxicity may only receive vaccination on weeks 4, 7, and 10. Other patients may also
           receive IL-2 beginning on day 2 of each treatment week (4, 7, and 10) for up to 14
           doses.

      Patients in each arm may receive up to a total of 3 courses of treatment.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 90 patients (25 patients for arms I and II and 40 patients
      for arm III [arm III closed to accrual as of 11/30/1998]) will be accrued for this study
      within 12-18 months.
