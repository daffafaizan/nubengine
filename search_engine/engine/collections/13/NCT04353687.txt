    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational pilot study evaluating surgeon efficiency
      and proficiency of traditionally open or laparoscopic surgeons performing robotic-assisted
      inguinal hernia repair. The study will focus on surgeon intraoperative efficiency and
      technical performance outcomes as well as conversions, intraoperative complications, and
      mental and cognitive workload. Surgeon subjects will be assessed for technical proficiency
      through a study specific technical proficiency form and the GEARS scale by independent
      surgeons.
