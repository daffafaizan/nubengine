      is nutrition, since it involves biochemical events that depend on the substrates it provides.
      Wound healing is a phase that demands higher needs of energy-protein than the requirement.
      Problem statement: Poor nutrition decreases, through specific phases, normal processes that
      allow the progression of wound healing. Nutrient deficiencies can have negative effects on
      wound healing by prolonging the inflammatory phase, decreasing fibroblast proliferation, and
      modifying collagen synthesis. Some amino acids are essential for the process, such as
      Glutamine and Hydroxymethylbutyrate.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of Glutamine and Hydroxymethylbutyrate supplementation over
      the cells involved in wound healing of bloody areas. Hypothesis: Glutamine and
      Hydroxymethylbutyrate supplementation promotes a positive effect over the cells involved in
      wound healing of bloody areas. Methodology: A randomized controlled clinical trial, in
      patients with diagnosis of bloody areas. They will be divided into two groups, the first will
      receive an intervention with Glutamine (14g) and Hydroxymethylbutyrate (3g) and a control
      group will receive a placebo with calcium caseinate (17g)

      A sample of the affected tissue will be taken before and after the supplementation where
      histology will be analyzed.

      Remains of tissue will be obteined during surgery wash for histology.
