      in France On a cohort of patients presenting at least two out of three symptoms of the
      classic triad (urinary symptoms, cognitive symptoms and gait disturbance) and enlargement of
      ventricles non explained by cortical atrophy.

      Participants are offered, as routine care, a diagnostic evaluation of the effect of depletive
      lumbar puncture on these triad symptoms (this exam is part of routine care).

      Before the planned lumbar puncture, the participants are requested to participate to the
      study, with written consent and information given. The participants are requested to fill in
      a USP (urinary symptoms profile, validated international questionnaire) questionnaire and a
      micturition calendar. The same urinary evaluation is made 5 days after lumbar puncture. Gait
      and cognition are evaluated as in routine practice.

      Of the participants initially evaluated, some will be proposed shunt surgery (routine care).
      These participants will be proposed to fill in the same questionnaire and micturition
      calendar around 3 months after shunt surgery (post operative evaluation).
