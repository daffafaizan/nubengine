    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percent of patients who meet criteria for intubation within 28 days of
      study inclusion.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (NIPPV THERAPY): Patients undergo intermittent NIPPV, with the recommended schedule
      comprising 2 hours on NIPPV followed by =< 2 hours off NIPPV and continuous NIPPV at night or
      while sleeping for 8 hours per day, for 28 days or until discharged from the hospital.

      ARM B (HIGH FLOW OXYGEN THERAPY): Patients continue to receive high flow nasal cannula oxygen
      therapy using current protocol for titration of high flow oxygen therapy for 28 days or until
      discharged from the hospital. Patients may receive NIPPV if they develop evidence of
      accessory muscle use with breathing or at the discretion of the treating physician.

      IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY SYNDROME (IPS) SUBGROUP (INCLUDING DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE):
      Patients with IPS receive methylprednisolone daily on days 0-48 and every other day (QOD) on
      days 49-55 in parallel with NIPPV or oxygen therapy, with a taper at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up until day 100.
