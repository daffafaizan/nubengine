      may suffer from an acquired ataxia or a genetically determined ataxia despite negative family
      history. In the majority of them, however, a genetic or acquired cause of ataxia cannot be
      identified suggesting a sporadic degenerative ataxia. They can be subdivided into two groups.
      In one group, the underlying brain disease is multiple system atrophy (MSA), specifically MSA
      of cerebellar type (MSA-C). The characteristic clinical feature of MSA is the presence of
      severe autonomic failure defined by orthostatic hypotension or urinary incontinence. The
      second group is distinguished from MSA-C by the lasting absence of severe autonomic failure.
      These patients have been designated as sporadic adult onset ataxia of unknown aetiology
      (SAOA). In the first years after ataxia onset, a distinction between MSA-C and SAOA is often
      not possible.

      There are only few studies comparing the phenotype of MSA-C and SAOA, and longitudinal
      studies focussing on the evolution of the phenotype of these disorders are completely
      lacking. In particular, the progression rate of SAOA compared to MSA-C has not been defined.
      In addition, it is unknown which factors predict the development of MSA-C vs. SAOA, and at
      which time after onset of ataxia, a reliable distinction between both disorders is possible.

      To answer these questions, we plan to create a European registry of patients with sporadic
      degenerative ataxia of adult onset and to perform a natural history study. The planned study
      will also allow to collect blood samples and other biomaterials from patients with sporadic
      ataxia, which will be useful for future genetic and biomarker studies.
