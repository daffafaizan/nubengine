      Primary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of bortezomib in patients with metastatic
           non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma in terms of objective response rate after a minimum
           of 2 courses of treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate clinical response in these patients with baseline von Hippel-Lindau expression
           and nuclear factor-KB activity.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month and then periodically
      for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
