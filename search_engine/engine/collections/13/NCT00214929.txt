    
      In order to carry out the Cooperative Investigation Plan for home treatment of pulmonary
      embolism, a network of multidisciplinary groups was built with the participation of 10
      groups, distributed in 6 different regions and integrated within the Spanish Society of
      Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR).

      Those groups will share a database integrated in the Spanish Registry on Thromboembolic
      Disease (RIETE), which is a project already being carried out and in which many of the groups
      of the network already participate.

      The research project will be a study developed in two phases. In the first phase, predictive
      profiles for a favourable progression of the disease in patients with pulmonary embolism will
      be studied using the actual management of the disease with the current assistance model.

      In the second phase, a randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of two models of
      home treatment ( discharge from hospital during the first 72 hours after the diagnosis of PE
      and discharge from hospital during the first 5 days) in patients previously selected,
      according to predefined criteria which were modified on the basis of the results of phase I
      versus the current assistance model will be developed

      The results will be measured in terms of efficacy, safety, economic burden, and quality of
      life in both models (at home and at hospital).
