      approach through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at 27 K-8 public schools. The STEPs
      model has two components: (1) a modular protocol that combines 33 modules-i.e., descriptions
      of common elements within evidence-based therapies for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic
      stress, and conduct problems; and (2) a web-based system for monitoring student responses to
      treatment and providing weekly feedback to therapists, to guide their selection and
      sequencing of the STEPs modules. The project will include an evaluation of the effectiveness
      of STEPS compared to "treatment as usual" (known as Usual Care or UC) on students' mental
      health and school-related outcomes, and an analysis of whether changes in school outcomes are
      mediated by changes in student mental health.
