      with a 2:1 ratio in an open label manner to the 2 arms (94 patients in the combination
      treatment arm and 47 patients in the paclitaxel arm) for efficacy and safety evaluation. The
      randomization will be stratified by country: United States (US) vs China , duration of the
      platinum free interval (PFI): 1 3 months vs >3-6 months and number of prior platinum based
      therapy treatments (1/2 versus 3 prior platinum regimens). The study will consist of 3
      periods. The first period is the Screening Period (Day -24 to -1) during which patients are
      screened for eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The second period
      is a Treatment Evaluation Period with a randomized, open-label, two arm parallel design (from
      starting study treatment until patients have progressive disease [PD], unacceptable toxicity,
      death, or withdrawal of consent). The PK study will be applied to both the combination
      treatment arm and control arm. The third period is a Follow up Period (safety evaluation at
      30 days after the last dose of study treatment and OS and PFS follow up). Patients will be
      tested at baseline for phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/PTEN pathway alterations, BRCA1/2
      mutations and/or level of phospho AKT by IHC; the correlation of the efficacy endpoints and
      biomarker status will be analyzed retrospectively as an exploratory endpoint.
