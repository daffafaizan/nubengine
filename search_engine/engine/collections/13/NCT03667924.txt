      administered by Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota to assist families better manage their
      relatives' Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRDs); identify and facilitate use of
      community-based long-term services and supports (LTSS); and improve engagement with
      healthcare providers. This intervention, called the PorchLight Project has the following
      aims:

      Specific Aim 1. Implement PorchLight Project for 25 persons with ADRD or memory concerns
      (collectively, persons with memory loss [PWML]) and/or their caregivers in one urban and
      rural region of Minnesota. A convergent parallel mixed methods design [(QUAN+QUAL)-->QUAL]
      will be utilized to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of PorchLight Project
      for 25 families and their SC-Ds (n = 20) over a 3-month period (i.e., Stage I of the NIH
      Stage Model).

      Specific Aim 2. Refine PorchLight Project delivery and implementation for efficacy
      evaluation. Activities to support this aim will include assessment of R61 milestones and
      incorporation of R61 findings to refine the PorchLight Project prior to efficacy evaluation.
      Through stakeholder engagement with the Dementia Healthcare Research Advisory Group (DHR) as
      well as analysis of the various quantitative and qualitative data elements collected during
      this Phase, we will finalize and refine effective training approaches for PorchLight Project
      Senior Companions (SCs), identify and confirm stakeholder-centric measures, and enhance the
      overall implementation of the PorchLight Project to inform a subsequent R33 Phase.
