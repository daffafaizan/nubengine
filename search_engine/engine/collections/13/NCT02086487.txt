    
      This is a multicenter, open label trial which will be conducted within Kingdom of saudi
      Arabia for which CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) patients who meet eligibility criteria and
      showing sub optimal response to Imatinib therapy as per European leukemia Net ELN 2013
      guidelines will be recruited and switched to Nilotinib 300 mg twice a day therapy.

      Efficacy assessments of hematologic and cytogenetic response and disease progression, will be
      performed every 6 months at a minimum, including hematologic analysis, bone marrow
      cytogenetics, and molecular studies to ensure that nilotinib is being provided to patients
      who were responding and that patients who progressed could discontinue therapy.

      Safety assessments include evaluation of adverse events, hematologic assessment, biochemical
      testing, cardiac enzyme assessment, serial electrocardiogram evaluation, and physical
      examination. Adverse events are graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0. Survival will be dated from start of
      nilotinib therapy until death from any cause and censored at last follow-up for patients who
      were alive.

      The data will be summarized with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics,
      efficacy evaluation, and safety observations and measurements.
