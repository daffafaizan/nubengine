    
      Specific Aim 1: Develop targeted health messages based on audience segmentation to encourage
      smokers to enroll in a comprehensive union-sponsored smoking cessation program.

      We will craft six specific health messages that appeal to four different audience segments:
      workers under 30 years old without children, workers under 30 with children, workers 30 years
      old or older without children, and workers 30 or older with children.

      Specific Aim 2: Conduct a randomized controlled trial of targeted messaging based on audience
      segmentation versus standard smoking cessation messaging.

      After conducting baseline surveys with union carpenters and floor layers, we will randomize
      current smokers (smoked within the last 30 days) into either the intervention or control
      group.

        -  Control subjects will receive one standard mailing informing them about the free smoking
           cessation program available to union members.

        -  Intervention subjects will receive the standard mailing in addition to six targeted
           smoking cessation messages delivered monthly by mail to their homes. Messages will be
           specific to one of four audience segments determined by age and parental status. In
           addition to a segment-specific anti-smoking message, each mailing will have contact
           information for the union smoking cessation program. Intervention subjects who consented
           to text messaging will also receive one booster text message each month with a shortened
           targeted message.
