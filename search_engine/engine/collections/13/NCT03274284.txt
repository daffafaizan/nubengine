      urologists the treatment of T1G3 tumor poses a dilemma of management.The spectrum of clinical
      behavior includes; T1 lesions that will not progress however T1G3 may be potentially lethal,
      associated with metastatic disease at the time of presentation.

      The major goal of treatment for T1G3 BC should be bladder preservation whenever possible.

      Intravesical therapy with Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) may decrease the recurrence rate by
      compared with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) alone.
