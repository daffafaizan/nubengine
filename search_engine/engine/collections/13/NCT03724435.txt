      (FUS) technology and health outcomes. A wide variety of approaches exist for using FUS on
      pancreatic cancer patients, and the primary goal is to capture this broad spectrum of
      approaches and their impact on patients overall health. This information will help provide a
      better understanding of current care, and may possibly direct further, more specific
      investigations that will follow this registry. After obtaining informed consent a baseline
      history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging studies needed per standard of
      care will be performed. Patients' treatment is determined by their caregivers only, and thus
      the registry will evaluate patient management in "real-world" conditions.
