      on VO2max and performance will be assessed during 12 weeks endurance exercise training in
      untrained healthy young men. The ready to drink carbohydrate beverage consists of 30g
      carbohydrate or 30g protein. Previous studies show that the supplementation of 30g protein is
      in the optimal range to stimulate the muscle protein synthetic response following resistance
      type exercise. The protein supplementation group in the present study will be compared with
      an iso-caloric carbohydrate group. In addition, to the pre- and post-intervention biopsies 1
      additional muscle biopsies will be taken (in week 6) during the 12 week intervention period.
      This will create a unique opportunity to establish the timeline of the skeletal muscle
      adaptive response at functional and mechanistic level following prolonged endurance exercise
      training, including potential differences between both groups.
