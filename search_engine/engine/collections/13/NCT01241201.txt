    
      Study population: 36 Healthy male volunteers; age >= 21 and <= 40 years. Intervention: One
      group receives twice daily two sachets containing 450 billion live freeze-dried lactic acid
      bacteria per sachet and the other group receives twice daily two placebo sachets.

      Study design: The study is designed as a randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind study. Study substance (probiotics) and placebo will be given during 4 weeks.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the percent change in faecal dry
      weight and total faecal output between the probiotics group and the placebo group. In
      addition, intestinal permeability, inflammation and other clinical symptoms will be
      evaluated.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: In this study healthy male volunteers will be challenged with an attenuated ETEC
      strain after three weeks of either probiotics or placebo. This infection will lead to a mild
      traveller's diarrhoea in the subjects during approximately three days maximally. Sequels of
      this infection and the effects of commercially available probiotics compared to placebo will
      be followed up. The subjects will therefore collect their faeces on several days, record
      their defecation pattern and gastro-intestinal complaints during four weeks, undergo a
      physical examination and five venapunctions, and visit our facilities in total on 8 days
      (excluding two pre-study visits). The oral administration of probiotics in a healthy
      population is not associated with risk.
