      located in Moscow, Russian Federation.

      The study will include 50 patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment due to a
      horseshoe-tear. In addition to the standard ophthalmological examination, all patients will
      undergo wide-field optical coherence tomography to determine the extension and localization
      of the vitreoretinal traction zone. The obtained data will be used to planning the 1st step
      of laser-surgical treatment. All patients will undergo a combined laser-surgical technology,
      which includes 3 steps: 1) Nd-YAG laser excision of the vitreoretinal traction zone 2)
      pneumatic retinopexy (10% C3F8) 3) barrier laser photocoagulation around retinal break after
      retinal attachment.

      The patients are going to be followed up for at least 1 year, the main outcome measures are
      postoperative primary and final anatomic outcome, BCVA and complications.
