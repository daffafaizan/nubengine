    
      The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of
      Decitabine with Gemcitabine in previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
      and advanced sarcoma and to define the recommended Phase II dose and describe the
      dose-limiting toxicity of the combination of Decitabine with Gemcitabine. The preliminary
      efficacy parameters of the combination of Decitabine with Gemcitabine will be estimated in
      terms of response rate, disease control rate and progression-free survival.
