      for patients with serious mental illness (SMI) to be connected to a psychiatrist and case
      manager when cancer is diagnosed. Many people with illnesses like major depression,
      schizophrenia and bipolar disorder face barriers to receiving high quality cancer care. It
      can be difficult to get to appointments, have many different doctors, and experience
      depression or worry. Better communication between the patient, the oncology team, and mental
      health providers may improve care. As for all patients, it is important for people with
      mental illness to have access to high quality cancer treatment that is patient-centered and
      coordinated. Having a case manager and psychiatrist at the cancer center who collaborates
      with the oncology team starting at cancer diagnosis may help patients to receive the cancer
      care that they need.

      This study includes a single-arm open pilot (n=8) to pilot patient and caregiver measures and
      refine the intervention manual; a run-in period (n=6) to pilot the randomized trial
      procedures; and a randomized controlled trial (n=120) to compare the impact of the Bridge
      model with enhanced usual care on disruptions in cancer care.
