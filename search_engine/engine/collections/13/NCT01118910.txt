      moisture, maceration, friction, or lack of air circulation. It is typically chronic with
      insidious onset of itching, burning, and stinging within the affected skin folds. Intertrigo
      frequently worsened or colonized by infection, which most commonly is candidal but also may
      be bacterial, fungal, or viral. The etiology of diaper dermatitis shows significant overlap
      with that of intertrigo. Vusion ointment, a highly effective treatment for diaper dermatitis,
      has been used by physicians for the treatment of intertrigo; however, there is a paucity of
      data in the literature regarding the use of Vusion ointment in this indication.

      This study is the first to formally investigate the efficacy and safety of Vusion ointment
      for the treatment of intertrigo.
