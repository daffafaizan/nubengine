      physical activity measured by tri-axial accelerometer (wearable device) between the HDF
      patients in intradialytic exercise group and control during the 6-month period. After
      inclusion in to the study, all of the participants will be evaluated before randomized. The
      investigators will prescribe the exercise program for each participant in the exercise group.
      The exercise program use intradialytic cycling which will be gradually increased to at least
      30 minutes with moderate intensity. The participants in control group will receive dialysis
      as usual without intradialytic exercise prescription. The participants will go on the program
      for at least 6-months period. In each session, any adverse event or side effect will be
      reported.
