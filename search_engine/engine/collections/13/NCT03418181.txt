    
      This study is feasibility randomised controlled trial.

      50 patients who have newly started on haemodialysis will be recruited into the study from 4
      UK centres.

      Eligible patients will be approached prior to initiation of dialysis or after starting
      dialysis. The details of the study will be explained to them and a Patient Information sheet
      will be provided. Interested participants will be invited to the study and a written consent
      will be obtained.

      The participants will be randomly allocated to 2 groups.

        1. Thrice weekly dialysis (control arm)

        2. Incremental dialysis - Twice weekly dialysis to start with and slowly increasing the
           duration and frequency of dialysis to thrice weekly depending on their native kidney
           function.

      All participants will be monitored at least once monthly by performing dialysis related blood
      tests, urine tests, clinical evaluation, medications, weight, dialysis adequacy, adverse
      events.

      Questionnaire involving quality of life, mood, illness intrusiveness, functional status,
      cognitive function will also be performed.

      Participants will be recruited in the first year and all participants will be followed up for
      12 months. All participants may withdraw at any time without any change in their dialysis
      care.

      To ensure independence, the University of Hertfordshire will perform randomisation, and
      assist with data monitoring and data analysis.

      A 6 month rate of loss of native kidney function between the 2 groups will be analysed.
