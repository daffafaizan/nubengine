    
      In 2016, results of Cochrane review of 22 trials on the efficacy of EA in patients undergoing
      abdominal surgery showed that an epidural containing a local anesthetic, with or without the
      addition of an opioid, accelerated the return of gastrointestinal transit (high quality of
      evidence) and no difference in the incidence of vomiting or anastomotic leak (low quality of
      evidence). For open surgery, an epidural containing a local anaesthetic would reduce the
      length of hospital stay (very low quality of evidence).

      However, in a recent analysis from American College of Surgeons revealed that the use of EA
      did not improve postoperative recovery after elective colectomy in their analysis and was
      associated with increased postoperative ileus and prolonged hospital stay after open
      colectomy.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the efficacy of EA to reduce the
      postoperative ileus and hospital stay, as well in the patients undergoing colorectal surgery.
      This prospective randomized study planned to include 100 consecutive patients with colorectal
      disorders.
