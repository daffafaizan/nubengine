      The effect of oral hygiene on the occurrence of esophagogastric anastomotic leakage has not
      yet been studied for along time. We will use a random cohort study model and investigate the
      effect of perioperative oral anti-infective gargle agent on the esophagogastric anastomotic
      wound healing.

      Method:

        1. Design:

           One hundred and twenty patients are divided into 3 groups and each group has 40
           esophageal patients. Minimization stratified randomization will be applied. Oral
           anti-infective gargling agent, Mycostatin oral suspension, will be employed for one week
           before operation. The first groups will be treated without oral gargle agent; the second
           groups will be treated with gargling water; and the third groups will be treated with
           anti-infective gargling agent.

           An end-to-side two-layer esophagogastric anastomosis will be constructed using
           interrupted sutures with metallic staple through cervical wound. On the other hand, the
           anastomotic leakage rates in different groups will be investigated.

        2. Data Collection and Statistic Analysis:

      The records of all patients, various biologic parameters, and the management of leakage are
      analyzed. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality are determined, and stepwise multivariable
      logistic regression analysis assesses the effect of preoperative and postoperative variables
      on anastomotic leakage. Time variation of starting oral feeding and hospital stay are
      compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.
