      a number of multimodal pain control strategies also exist including combining opioids with
      NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, acetaminophen and regional blocks. Recently, literature
      underlines the importance of performing regional anaesthetic and analgesic techniques for
      postoperative analgesia following breast surgery. PECS block provides analgesia for breast
      surgeries with few adverse effects.

      OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of ultrasound guided pectoral block in reducing
      intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption following modified radical mastectomy.

      The secondary objective is to determine patient satisfaction levels associated with adequate
      pain control.

      HYPOTHESIS Pectoral nerve blocks provides superior analgesia with less opioid consumption and
      improves patient satisfaction in postoperative period compared to conventional pain
      management for modified radical mastectomy patients
