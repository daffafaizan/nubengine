      characterised by orbital inflammation without any identifiable local or systemic causes. It
      is a rare clinical entity and a diagnosis of exclusion. Lymphomas, thyroid eye diseases or
      systemic diseases can have similar presentation and so, a histopathological diagnosis is
      considered important. IOIS is a difficult condition to treat. Compilation of reported small
      series of patients with IOIS suggested that they require multiple systemic immunosuppressant
      drugs and radiotherapy. Recently, a large monocentric study including patients with biopsy
      proven IOIS showed that up to 40% of them can relapse. Their clinical and pathological
      features did not correlate with treatments outcomes. The investigators decide therefore to
      conduct a multicentric retro/ prospective study to determine clinical features,
      histopathology and treatment outcomes of French patients with IOIS.
