      hallucinations and delusions). Concordance rates with anti-psychotic medication can be low.
      Even when positive symptoms are successfully treated, emotional distress can remain e.g.
      depression, anxiety and trauma. Relapse occurs in up to two thirds of patients within two
      years of the first episode. The treatment of subsequent episodes has been shown to be
      progressively less efficacious. Research has shown that fear of recurrence patients can
      experience following psychosis is predictive of relapse. Randomised clinical trials have
      found that Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBTp) is efficacious for treating residual
      distressing positive and negative symptoms. However, the evidence for treating emotional
      dysfunction (e.g. social anxiety, post-psychotic depression) is less clear. Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) incorporates acceptance and mindfulness elements into a CBT
      framework. Rather than altering the content or frequency of cognitions, ACT seeks to alter
      the individual's psychological relationship with thoughts, feelings and sensations to promote
      psychological flexibility. This research will be a pilot randomised control trial of ACT for
      treating distress following psychosis. This pilot study will establish (a) whether a larger
      scale multi-centre randomised controlled trial is warranted, (b) the acceptability of
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (c) the expected primary and secondary outcomes for such a
      trial and (d) the sample size required to detect such outcomes. It is hypothesised that ACT
      plus treatment as usual will be associated with a greater reduction in levels of distress
      than treatment as usual only.
