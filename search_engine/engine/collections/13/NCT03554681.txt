      combines maternal characteristics and medical history (Mat-CH) together with mean arterial
      pressure (MAP), uterine artery pulsatility index (PI), and serum placental growth factor
      (PlGF) with a plan to assess the predictive performance.

      The reference standards will be PE defined according to the International Society for the
      Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy and the American College of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists. The systolic blood pressure should be >140 mm Hg and/or the diastolic blood
      pressure should be >90 mmHg on at least two occasions four hours apart developing after 20
      weeks' gestation in previously normotensive women and there should be proteinuria (>300 mg in
      24 hours or two readings of at >2+ on dipstick analysis of midstream or catheter urine
      specimens if no 24-hour collection is available). In the absence of proteinuria, new onset of
      any of the following systemic findings: a) thrombocytopaenia (platelet counts <100,000 ÂµL);
      b) renal insufficiency (creatinine >1.1 mg/dL or 2-fold increase in creatinine in the absence
      of underlying renal disease); c) abnormal liver function (ie, hepatic transaminase levels
      twice normal); d) pulmonary oedema; or e) cerebral or visual symptoms. Preterm-PE is PE that
      requires delivery before 37 weeks' gestation. If a participant fulfills the criteria for PE
      by one definition and not the other she will be considered to have developed PE.
