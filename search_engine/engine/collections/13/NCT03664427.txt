      veno-occlusive disease (VOD). This complication is unpredictable and serious by involving the
      vital prognosis of the child. In addition, this complication may affect the patient's quality
      of life and have serious long-term sequelae. The incidence varies from 15 to 60% and the
      mortality is greater than 60% after severe VOD. The risk factors of occurrence of these
      complications are, to date, unknown except for a susceptibility to some therapeutic
      (busulfan, radiotherapy ...). Pharmacogenetic aspects of hepatic VOD susceptibility are
      supposed and targeted screening supported this hypothesis. But pharmacogenetic predisposition
      to VOD was never explored with as many polymorphisms and considering the whole exome.
