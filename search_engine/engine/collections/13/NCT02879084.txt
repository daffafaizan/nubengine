      recruited at the Centre universitaire d'ophtalmologie du CHU de Qu√©bec. RNFL thickness will
      be measured with optical coherence tomography at 3 times. For anterior uveitis, the RNFL
      thickness will be measured at presentation, 1 week and 4 to 6 weeks. For intermediate
      uveitis, the RNFL thickness will be measured at presentation, 4 to 6 weeks and 4 months. The
      initial thickness will be studied for each type of uveitis and progression over time will be
      studied also for each type of uveitis.
