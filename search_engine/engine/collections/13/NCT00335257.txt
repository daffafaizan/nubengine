    
      Drospirenone is a novel progestogen with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid properties.
      A large active post-marketing surveillance study has demonstrated that a 21-day regimen of
      3mg drospirenone and 30mcg ethinylestradiol can be used safely for oral contraception. This
      study investigates the risks of short and long-term use of a 24-day regimen of
      drospirenone/ethinylestradiol in comparison to established OCs in a study population that is
      representative of the actual users of the individual preparations.

      INAS-OC is a prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort study with two study arms:
      OCs containing drospirenone and OCs containing any other progestogen. The study was started
      in the USA in April 2005 and was extended to several European countries in September 2008
      based on the launch status of the 24-day regimen. New users of an OC (starters, switchers
      without a pill intake break and recurrent users with a pill intake break [same or different
      OC]) are accrued by a network of prescribing physicians. Baseline and follow-up information
      are collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis will be based on
      life-table methods comparing the cohorts. All analyses will make allowance for confounding,
      using methods that will include multivariate techniques such as Cox regression.
