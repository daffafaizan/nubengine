      variable between centers, some discharging home after 3-4 hours while others request bed
      restriction for 24 hours. Concern about lead dislodgements due to early mobilization are
      probably not justified. Bed restriction may result in considerable inconvinience to the
      patients.

      Patients will be randomally assigned to early mobilization (after 4 hours) or bed restriction
      till the morning after the procedure.

      Primary outcome: lead malfunction, patients' satisfaction
