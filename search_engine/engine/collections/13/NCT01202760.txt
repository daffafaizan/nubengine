      16. A total of 66 joints were examined for swelling, and a total of 66 joint were examined
      for tenderness. For participants who had at least 5 swollen and 5 tender joints at baseline,
      Week 16 non-responders (NRs) were defined as participants with <20% improvement from baseline
      in both tender joint counts and swollen joint counts. For participants who did not have at
      least 5 swollen and 5 tender joints at baseline, Week 16 NRs were defined as participants who
      had at least 2 additional tender and 2 additional swollen joints from baseline. All Week 16
      NRs and all participants who discontinued study treatment at any time, for any reason, were
      defined as NRs starting at that timepoint and going forward for all American College of
      Rheumatology (ACR) imputed analyses, including the Week 24 endpoint.
