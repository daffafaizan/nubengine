      arteriovenous grafts (SAVGs) and immediate-access arteriovenous grafts (IAAVGs) in end stage
      renal disease (ESRD) patients for one year after the intervention. Patients were randomly
      divided into two groups: SAVGs group and IAAVGs group. Patients with ESRD with no chance for
      native AVF were examined clinically and by duplex ultrasonography preoperatively. Follow up
      was for one year. Primary end points were the success rate, complications rate (hematoma,
      pseudo-aneurysm, graft site infection, systemic bacteremia), time of first cannulation.
      Secondary end points were primary and secondary patency within one year.
