      with hypoxemic respiratory failure to improve the comfort, to attenuate respiratory failure
      and to decrease the rate of tracheal intubation and mortality. Although theoretically HFNC is
      a potential and ideal treatment for AECOPD patients, the related clinical researches are very
      few. It still needs to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of HFNC in patients with
      AECOPD. For moderate AECOPD(pH<7.35), several guidelines have strongly recommended NPPV as
      standard therapy, which can reduce the rate of intubation and mortality. A few previous
      studies have shown that HFNC can efficiently improve alveoli ventilation and breathing
      pattern in some severe AECOPD patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that HFNC is not inferior
      to NPPV for preventing endotracheal intubation in moderate AECOPD patients. To assess this
      hypothesis, we performed a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial of HFNV vs NPPV in
      moderate AECOPD patients.
