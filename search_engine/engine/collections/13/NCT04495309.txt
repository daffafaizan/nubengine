      image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT)) with few high-dose fractions. Larger lesions or lesions
      with critical normal tissue involvement should be treated with three-dimensional conformal
      radiation therapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in moderate
      hypofractionated radiotherapy (depending on the size and location of the target volume and
      the decision of the radiooncologist). For critical organs in the target volume, standard
      fractionated radiotherapy can be used.
