      Database during 01/01/2003 through 12/31/2007, who were 18 years of age or older with at
      least 183 days of continuous enrollment in the database and without any doctor visits
      associated with a diagnosis of ischemic optic neuropathy during the 183 days prior to cohort
      entry.

      From the study population, patients with a claim associated with an ischemic optic neuropathy
      diagnosis code were identified as potential NAION cases (n = 3,732). From the potential NAION
      cases, definite and possible NAION cases were identified using medical record review and a
      claims algorithm (n=1,283).

      From the study population, patients without a claim associated with an ischemic optic
      neuropathy diagnosis code were randomly selected as controls (n = 20,000)
