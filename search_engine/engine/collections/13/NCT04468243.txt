      newly diagnosed cancer and T2D. We define feasibility indicators as: (a) efficient study
      recruitment is possible given prevalence of T2D (diagnosed and undiagnosed) in UF patients
      with newly diagnosed cancer; (b) retention rates in both groups ≥80% to indicate that the
      study design and methods are adequately patient-centered; (c) identified barriers to and
      facilitators of a nurse-led intervention are respectively modifiable or optimizable; and (d)
      patient acceptability scores >8 for the study procedures. We hypothesize that we will recruit
      up to 40 patients within 18 months and retain ≥ 80% of patients in all groups; minor but
      important revisions will be required to resolve issues identified with using the nurse-led
      intervention; and 80% of patients from both groups who complete the study will report that
      the burden of the study is acceptable through their retention in the study.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the variation in HbA1c at baseline and at the end of the
      three-month intervention period in each of the two study groups.
