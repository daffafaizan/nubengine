      especially in the domain of self-management of symptoms. The Symptom Navi© Program was
      developed to support symptom self-management of 16 core symptoms frequently experienced by
      patients in outpatient oncology units. The acceptability and feasibility of the Symptom Navi©
      Program was supported by a qualitative study with 10 cancer patients who received
      semi-structured patient consultations and subsequently used the Symptom Navi© Flyers at home.

      The overall objective of the current study is to pilot test the implementation of the Symptom
      Navi© Program under real-life conditions. The aims are to evaluate procedures, to test
      preliminary effectiveness and to assess potential unintended effects using a
      cluster-randomised waitlist design complemented by qualitative methods. The unit of
      randomization are the participating cancer outpatient centres with each centre representing a
      cluster. Intervention cluster will provide the Symptom Navi© Program, control clusters will
      provide usual care for symptom-management.
