      to be beneficial in slowing progression of disease. This would include use of ACEI,
      aggressive blood pressure and blood sugar control as well as other possible interventions.
      Experimental studies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in China has suggested that
      rhubarb extract when used alone is equivalent to the protection afforded by ACEI. Furthermore
      when used in combination with ACEI, the renoprotective effect of rhubarb appears to be
      additive.

      Rhubarb extract is a chinese herbal preparation that is used extensively in china and other
      asian countries to treat constipation and CKD. Its mechanism of action in preventing
      progression of CKD is uncertain but perhaps related to TGF beta and TNF alpha inhibition.

      The specific aim is to determine the combined effect of rhubarb plus enalapril slowing the
      rate of decline of CKD (using Iothalamate GFRs) in patients in diabetes. A secondary aim
      would be to measure serum TGF beta concentrations over time and see if any observed decrease
      in the rate of decline of CKD is related to changes in TGF beta levels.
