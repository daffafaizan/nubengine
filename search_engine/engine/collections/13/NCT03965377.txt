      (n=15) to a wait list group (n=15) who just play it once. The study will examine reaction
      times to identification and resolution of the risks overall and by category of risk (e.g.,
      poisoning, burns, suffocation, etc.). The study will also examine failures on levels of the
      game which are graded for difficulty. The game was designed for low failure rate to increase
      engagement and to improve motivation.

      Changes in the participants' perception of efficacy in preventing injuries to children and
      their engagement with the game (using a standardized usability survey) will be examined. The
      study will also examine the role of experience with the use of technology and cognitive
      capacities in relation to performance and pre-post changes with multiple plays of the game.
