      or a prior biopsy (archived tissue) will be used for genetic testing. Genetic testing looks
      at whether specific genes are changed (mutated) in the tumor.

      The results of the genetic testing will be documented in your medical record. Your doctor may
      use the results of the genetic testing to help decide which treatment you will have. While
      awaiting results of the genomic profile assay, you may be enrolled in another treatment
      either at MD Anderson or near your home. This will be decided by your treating physician.

      Your samples will be given a code number when they are sent for genetic testing to Foundation
      Medicine. No identifying information will be directly linked to your samples. Only the
      researcher in charge of sending all tissue for testing will have access to the code numbers
      and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the samples
      to be updated as needed. Foundation Medicine will not be able to link this data to you.

      Researchers will also review your medical history from before and following the collection of
      tissue, to learn if the use of genetic testing had any effect on the outcome of your
      treatment.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 300 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
