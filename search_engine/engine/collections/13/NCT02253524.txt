           rotational, of the patient or the patient's surroundings which is caused by sudden tonic
           neural activity.

        -  The management and episodic treatment of patients with spontaneous vertigo related
           nausea-vomiting symptoms are somewhat controversial in the emergency department setting.

        -  Patients admitted to the emergency department with complaints of vertigo in addition to
           a large portion of the symptoms are accompanied by nausea and antiemetic agents are
           frequently used in the treatment.

        -  An ideal treatment should be rapid in onset and effective, and lack debilitating side
           effects.

        -  Although a wide variety of classes of pharmacologic agents and modalities are used, the
           emergency department treatment of acute spontaneous vertigo and associated with nausea-
           vomiting has not been well studied.

        -  It has been reported that the most commonly used medications for parenteral treatment of
           vertigo and nausea-vomiting in emergency department are dimenhydrinate (DMT) and
           metoclopramide (MTP).

        -  It has a depressant action on hyper-stimulated labyrinthine function and antiemetic
           effects, believed to be due to the antihistamine.

        -  Dimenhydrinate inhibits vomiting by affecting the histaminic receptor and cholinergic
           receptor function center of vestibular nucleus in the central vestibular system.

        -  Dimenhydrinate reduces the symptoms of vertigo with depressant effects on the labyrinth
           function by this means.
