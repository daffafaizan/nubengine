      into the study and will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either oral ibrexafungerp or
      ibrexafungerp matching placebo, as follows:

        -  Oral ibrexafungerp 300-mg dose BID for 1 day

        -  Oral ibrexafungerp matching placebo BID for 1 day

      Subjects will receive their first dose of study drug at the site and will be dispensed the
      second dose for self-administration at home 12 hours after the first dose. Study Blinding,
      Randomization and Stratification: This is a randomized, double-blind study.

      All site and sponsor personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment. Approximately 366
      eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the two study
      treatment groups. For the purpose of maintaining treatment blinding, all subjects randomized
      to the placebo group will receive matching ibrexafungerp placebo tablets.
