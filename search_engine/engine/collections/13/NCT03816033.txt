    
      The study design will be a separate randomised clinical trial for each of the arrhythmias
      studied. There will be 1:1 randomisation to either the cryotherapy protocol or RF protocol.
      Arrhythmia patients already under the care of this cardiac centre, who have already opted for
      catheter ablation treatment will be approached to ask if they will also be willing to
      participate in this longterm research program.

      The protocols for each different arrhythmia are in line with current practice and knowledge
      and utilising current technology. In the program, the investigators have 1 or 2 protocols
      that mildly differ from conventional use but have already passed through initial experience
      with publication on this- this is the multi-catheter cryocatheter approach.

      Acute procedural outcomes, short, medium and longterm success will be recorded for each
      patient, in addition to patient or participant experience and quality of life outcomes.

      The catheter ablation research program has passed through ethical panel review in London and
      has the potential to become a multi-centre study.
