    
      The trial incorporated a Type I error control plan, as follows:

      The testing of the primary endpoint was conducted in the following hierarchical order. A
      p-value that is less than 0.05 can only be claimed statistically significant if statistical
      significance has been claimed at the previous stage.

        -  Stage 1: Omalizumab 300-mg group vs. placebo

        -  Stage 2: Omalizumab 150-mg group vs. placebo

        -  Stage 3: Omalizumab 75-mg group vs. placebo

      A hierarchical analysis of the secondary endpoints was performed for each dose found to be
      significant in the primary endpoint. A p-value that is less than 0.05 can only be claimed
      statistically significant if statistical significance has been claimed at the previous stage.
