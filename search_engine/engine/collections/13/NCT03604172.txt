      intervention (n=20) or a waitlist control (WL; n=20). Both groups will have blood oxygen
      level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at baseline and
      after the 16-week intervention. During the scans, participants will complete the following
      tasks: 1) food-specific stop signal task (SST), and 2) script-driven imagery of binge foods.
