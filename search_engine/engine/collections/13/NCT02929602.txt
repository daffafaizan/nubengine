    
      Specific Aims The overall objective of the proposed study is to determine (1) the pattern of
      analgesic prescriptions (Rx and OTC) and recommendations (OTC) in dental practices; and (2)
      the effectiveness of and side effects associated with these medications as measured by
      patientreported outcomes (PROs).

      Specific Aim 1: To document (a) dentists' postprocedural prescriptions and recommendations
      for analgesic medication: and (b) the effectiveness of these medications and side effects
      associated with their use as measured by PROs.

      Specific Aim 2: To analyze by procedure class and anticipated pain severity the PROs of Rx
      and OTC analgesic medications.

      Specific Aim 3: Determine the incidence of analgesic side effects of Rx and OTC analgesic
      medications.

      The outcomes of Specific Aims 1-3 will be:

        -  The distribution of dentists' Rx/OTC prescriptions/recommendations by dentists for
           anticipated pain severity.

        -  The effectiveness of different types of Rx and OTC analgesics (e.g., Rx NSAIDs vs. OTC
           NSAIDs, Rx NSAIDs vs. Rx narcotics) by procedure class and anticipated pain severity.

        -  The incidence of analgesic side effects for Rx and OTC analgesics. Analysis of the
           results and methods of the proposed research will furthermore serve as guidance in
           designing a randomized PBRN clinical trial comparing the efficacy of and complications
           associated with two or more analgesics.
