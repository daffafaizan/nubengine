      abnormal biomechanical stress on the foot and ankle.(1). Overuse can injure the fibrous
      tissue that connects the heel to the calf muscles. Treating an injured Achilles tendon is
      crucial to avoid exacerbating the injury further, which may lead to partial or full rupture
      of the tendon.

      Tendinosis, sometimes complicated by partial rupture, appears to be the major lesion in
      chronic Achilles tendinopathy; the paratenon is rarely involved. Important features are a
      lack of inflammatory cells and a poor intrinsic ability to heal.

      Several million Americans receive treatment for tendinosis each year, with more than 200,000
      patients treated each year for Achilles tendonitis and tendinosis alone.(5) Conservative
      treatment options for Achilles pain include rest, stretching, strengthening, ice and/or
      physical therapy. In general, non-surgical treatment of Achilles tendonitis and tendinosis is
      believed to be unsuccessful, so that surgical treatment is required in about 25% of patients;
      however, results of traditional surgical treatments have been reported to deteriorate with
      time. (3).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate longitudinal improvement of AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot
      Scale scores in patients with symptomatic Achilles tendinosis treated using
      radiofrequency-based plasma microtenotomy compared to standard surgical debridement.
