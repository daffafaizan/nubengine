      the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist, exendin-(9-39), on fasting blood
      glucose levels, protein-induced hypoglycemia, and fasting tolerance of subjects with
      congenital hyperinsulinism due to mutations in the ATP- sensitive potassium channel (KATP)
      channel.
