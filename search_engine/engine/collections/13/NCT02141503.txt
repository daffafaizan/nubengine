    
      Alpha-mannosidosis (AMD) is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in
      the LAMAN gene, which encodes lysosomal alpha-mannosidase and is characterized by
      neurodevelopmental delay, mild immune deficiency, facial and skeletal abnormalities, hearing
      impairment, intellectual disability, muscle weakness and ataxia. The progression of
      neuromuscular and skeletal deterioration is insidious, occurring over several decades,
      rendering most patients wheel-chair dependent. No consistently successful treatment is
      available. To better characterize the biochemical phenotype and natural history of this
      disorder, we will study 15 patients with AMD, ranging in age from five to 60 years, recruited
      from Departments of Biochemical Genetics and Medical Genetics at university medical centers
      mainly in the US and Canada or referred by the Intl Society for Mannosidosis & Related
      Diseases. Participants in the study will visit the NIH Clinical Center 2-3 days on an
      outpatient basis and will undergo clinical and biochemical evaluations to establish reliable
      clinical

      benchmarks and to identify cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers that could serve as candidate

      surrogate markers of treatment effect in future clinical trials. The protocol will take
      advantage of the NICHD Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Facility to generate CSF proteomic
      profiles. Patients will also undergo MR spectroscopy (under sedation/anesthesia, if
      appropriate) in order to establish the phenotypic baseline and for possible utility as a
      guide for natural history and/or treatment outcomes in future studies. If the pre-clinical
      components of this proposal prove promising, the prospect of a recombinant adeno-associated
      viral gene therapy trial involving a brain-directed (intrathecal) approach for AMD would be
      possible within 3 years.
