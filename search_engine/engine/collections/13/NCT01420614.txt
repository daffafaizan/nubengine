    
      Prospective, randomized, double arm study. The study population will include all consecutive
      patients presenting with a ST-elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome and candidates for primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention, who agree and provide written informed consent for the
      study.

      Before arterial stick for percutaneous access, patients will be randomized according to
      sealed numbered envelopes. Subsequently, arterial access will be obtained and the
      diagnostic/interventional procedure will be performed according to routine clinical practice,
      leaving ancillary medications, choice of devices and means of hemostasis at the physician's
      discretion.

      In the randomization process all participating centers will be equally stratified to avoid
      statistical unbalance.
