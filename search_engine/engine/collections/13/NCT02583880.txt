    
      The Screening Day Latin America is a non-interventional, cross-sectional and retrospective
      study. The study focusses on patients receiving enteral (tube feeding, EN) and/or parenteral
      nutrition (PN).

      All patients hospitalized on the defined Screening Day in participating ICUs will be checked
      for eligibility. In eligible patients the patient charts will be reviewed and the following
      parameters will be documented:

        -  Caloric deficit (daily target energy - actually administered energy via EN and PN). The
           caloric deficit will be calculated for 1 to up to 5 days before the Screening Day. The
           analysis will be done for each day and for the complete documentation period up to 5
           days. Primary focus will be the caloric deficit on Day -1.

        -  Nutritional status of the patient based on information from the patient charts. For
           this, three tools will be applied independently: Subjective Global Assessment (SGA),
           NUTRIC Score, ESPEN diagnosis of malnutrition

      The study will be performed in 8 Latin American countries.

      Data will be recorded anonymously in an electronic case report form.

      The study data of this explorative study will be analyzed using descriptive statistical
      methods.
