      St. Louis Children's Hospital's Emergency Department, Pediatric Clinical Research Center
      (PCRC), and Orthopedic Clinic. This project has 3 major aims and 1 exploratory aim addressed
      by a prospective randomized blinded placebo controlled drug trial to test whether a
      pharmacological strategy can prevent NMDA receptor hypofunction-induced behavioral and
      cognitive dysfunction in pre- and post-pubertal children. Based on previous preclinical and
      clinical research on the effects and blockade of the effects of ketamine and similar
      compounds, the study investigators have carefully selected a dose of the alpha-2 adrenergic
      agonist dexmedetomidine that will permit this study to be conducted with low risk to enrolled
      subjects who are undergoing clinically-indicated ketamine sedation for forearm fracture
      reduction.

      General Experimental Design: This project will test the safety and effectiveness of
      dexmedetomidine for preventing ketamine-induced behavioral and cognitive symptoms in healthy
      human children undergoing clinically indicated ketamine sedation for forearm fracture
      reduction.

      Aims 1 and 2 will be addressed by randomized, blinded administration of dexmedetomidine or
      saline placebo to ketamine-sedated subjects to test the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in
      preventing ketamine-induced behavioral and cognitive changes during recovery from sedation.

      Aim 3 will be addressed by comparing between the subjects randomized to receive
      dexmedetomidine or saline placebo measurements of distress and frequency of adverse
      cardiopulmonary effects during sedation, fracture-reduction, and recovery.
