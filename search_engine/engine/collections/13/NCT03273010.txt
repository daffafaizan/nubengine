      cyanoacrylate was placed over the palatal wounds; conversely, the 16 control group patients
      were allowed to heal in a conventional way without cyanoacrylate.

      Primary bleeding time, presence of secondary bleeding, postoperative pain and completion of
      epithelization were assessed following free gingival graft operation. As a result, compared
      to the control group it was determined that the cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive could reduce
      the postoperative morbidity and improve the wound healing.
