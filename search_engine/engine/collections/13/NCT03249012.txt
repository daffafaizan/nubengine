      receive calcium carbonate and calcitriol in the post-operative period, with standardized
      weaning. In group 2, patients will be prescribed calcium carbonate and calcitriol only if
      their post-operative PTH dosage is 25% or less of the pre-operative dosage, or if
      post-operative PTH is inferior to 15.

      The Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire (French canadian version) will be used to assess
      quality of life pre-operatively and at post-op week 1 and 4. Symptoms of hypocalcemia and
      adverse effects of calcium carbonate and calcitriol will be monitored at week 1 and 4.
