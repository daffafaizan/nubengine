    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intra-lesional talimogene laherparepvec
      injections in combination with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy in patients with metastatic,
      unresectable, or locoregionally recurrent HER2-negative breast cancer who have injectable
      sites of disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with chemotherapy or
      endocrine therapy in the study population

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I (CHEMOTHERAPY): Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intra-tumorally (IT) on
      day 1 of cycle 1, on days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, on day 8 of cycle 3, then on day 1 of
      subsequent cycles. Patients also receive paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over
      60 minutes on days 1, 8, and possibly 15, or gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes and
      carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II (ENDOCRINE THERAPY): Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec IT every 2 weeks for
      the first 10 weeks and then every 3 weeks thereafter. Patients also receive letrozole orally
      (PO), anastrazole PO, exemestane PO, tamoxifen PO on days 1-28 or fulvestrant intramuscularly
      (IM) every 2 weeks for 3 doses then every 4 weeks for the subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
