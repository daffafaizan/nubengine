      production. It is characterized by the impaired ability to coordinate the sequential,
      articulatory movements necessary to produce speech sound. It can result from insult to the
      brain, such as in stroke, or as the presenting sign/symptom of another neurodegenerative
      disease.

      TMS is a neurostimulation technique which has been shown to modulate cortical excitability in
      a non-invasive manner, and has been associated with positive outcomes in a variety of
      neurological and psychological disorders.There is evidence to support the role of TMS in
      individuals with primary progressive aphasias. In addition, there is a a case report
      suggesting an improvement in speech following TMS in an individual with primary progressive
      AOS. This study is being undertaken to further examine the role of TMS in primary progressive
      AOS.
