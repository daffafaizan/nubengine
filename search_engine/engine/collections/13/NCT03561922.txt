      the patient's daily life. In addition, the study will provide additional information about
      the safety and efficacy of the CE-certified RETINA IMPLANT Alpha AMS. In several studies it
      has been shown that patients who received this subretinal implant regain visual function to a
      certain extent and that its use is safe. So far, all assessments of patients with the RETINA
      IMPLANT Alpha AMS have been done in a controlled environment within the scope of
      interventional studies where the benefit in daily life has been assessed anecdotally only.
      Currently, there is no standard method available for an objective assessment of the impact of
      such devices in daily life of these patients. Hence, the aim of this study is to further
      assess the impact in daily life with a combination of already validated and newly developed
      assessments and questionnaires.
