    
      This study aims to do the following;

        -  To evaluate the frequency of influenza virus infections due to various subtypes in
           immunocompromised children and young adults at SJCRH

        -  To describe and compare the clinical course and outcome of pandemic H1N1 influenza
           infection with that due to other influenza virus subtypes in immunocompromised children
           and young adults.

        -  To evaluate the duration of influenza virus shedding in immunocompromised children and
           young adults.

        -  To evaluate the immunologic response to natural infection with various subtypes of
           influenza virus including the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus.

        -  To evaluate the viral resistance to antiviral agents in relation to antiviral therapy.

        -  To compare accuracy of rapid methods for influenza A subtyping and for determination of
           antiviral resistance.
