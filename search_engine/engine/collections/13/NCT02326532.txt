      for whom PRO data either is or is not made available to the treating physician. The question
      addressed by this proposal is whether patient reported outcome (PRO) data change patient's
      outcomes. The hypothesis is that the availability of these data in the form of the
      patient-completed Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire/routine assessment of
      patient index data (MDHAQ/RAPID3) questionnaire will change patient-centric outcomes such as
      patient reported well-being, patient satisfaction and medication compliance.
