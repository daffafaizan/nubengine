    
      Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterised by
      excessive connective tissue in the skin (causing skin thickening called 'scleroderma'),
      muscle, joints and internal organs. A number of different drugs with effects on the immune
      system (known as 'immunosuppressants') are currently being used by clinicians in the
      treatment of early diffuse cutaneous SSc, but all can have significant side effects. We want
      to know whether any one is definitely effective and, if so, which is the most effective.
