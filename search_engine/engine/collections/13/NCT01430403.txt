      mortality remain near record highs. An asthma exacerbation is a major factor contributing to
      morbidity, and even mortality in patients with asthma. Although current approaches to
      treatment have reduced these risks, asthma exacerbations are major problems for inner-city
      patients and their families, and prevention of these events continues to be a significant
      challenge. In children with asthma, there are predictable seasonal epidemics of
      exacerbations, especially during the fall season, otherwise known as the "September
      epidemic."
