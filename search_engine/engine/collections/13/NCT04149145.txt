    
      The primary, secondary, and exploratory objective are to assess the safety of the combination
      of M4344 and Niraparib in a phase 1 trial of patients with PARP resistant recurrent ovarian
      cancer; to determine the response rate and percentage of participants who remain progression
      free survival (PFS) at 6 months (%PFS) among ovarian cancer participants that have become
      resistant to poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]) ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) who are
      treated with ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein inhibitors (ATRi) + Niraparib in
      the dose expansion cohort; and to identify potential biological predictors of response and
      progression of disease with the combination of M4344 and Niraparib.
