      evaluated. In case group endometrial biopsy was obtained from 48 patients in the luteal phase
      of previous cycle and implantation and clinical pregnancy rate were compared with 45 patients
      in control group.

      The implantation rate was determined as 10.9% in biopsy group compared with 3.38% in
      controls. Clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in case group than controls (27.1%
      and 8.9% respectively
