      is clearly involved in cancer developement control, and it is suggested that it could
      participate to the response to anti cancer treatment.

      There is however no validated immunomonitoring strategy to allow a reliable patient's immune
      status along time, and particularly after treatment.There are scarce existing information on
      immunologic reconstitution profile recovery after treatment.

      This study aim to perform immunomonitoring in young patients with cancer to describe kinetic
      of recovery/variation of a panel of innate and adaptative immune system cells and molecules,
      selected by their potential relevance according to literature.

      The concerned population are young women (Ë‚40 yo) with breast cancer.

      There will be 2 patients cohorts A or "End of treatment" : patients recruited at the end of
      treatment (study cohort) B or "Diagnosis" : Patients recruited at diagnosis (reference
      values)

      This study should contribute to give sufficient data to determine the pertinent timing and
      cells/molecules panel to evaluate immunity profiling after treatment.

      These results could be used for further studies.
