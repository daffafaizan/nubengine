      making obesity a national epidemic with significant impairments in physical and psychological
      functioning, increasing healthcare costs, and high mortality rates. A significant proportion
      of overweight and obese individuals binge eat in response to stress or negative emotions,
      further contributing to obesity. Obesity and binge eating are independently related to a
      number of physical and mental health co-morbidities such as diabetes, coronary heart disease,
      osteoarthritis, respiratory symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Although behavioral weight
      loss interventions have been partially effective, few show long-term maintenance of weight
      loss, especially for patients with binge eating behavior. Thus, a stepped-care approach that
      provides more intensive treatment to specifically address the emotional and behavioral
      factors associated with problematic eating and obesity may be necessary. Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (ACT), an empirically-supported intervention that is being rolled out
      nationally by the VA, has been effective in reducing distress, increasing quality of life,
      and improving other indices of health in a wide range of conditions from depression to
      diabetes. The investigator's preliminary findings suggest that a brief ACT-based group
      intervention for patients with overweight or obesity can substantially reduce binge eating
      and distress, and improve functioning. This study proposes to test the efficacy of an ACT
      intervention for binge eating in conjunction with a standard behavioral weight loss
      intervention, Managing Overweight and/or Obesity for Veterans Everywhere (MOVE!), at the VA
      San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS). Patients (N = 154) who are overweight or obese (body
      mass index > 25 kg/m2) and meet the clinical criteria for binge eating will be randomized to
      receive either four 2-hour weekly ACT intervention groups or brief MOVE-II active control
      groups after their participation in MOVE!. This study hypothesizes that: 1) patients in the
      ACT intervention will experience significantly greater reductions in binge eating severity
      than patients in the brief MOVE-II active control group (primary outcome); 2) patients in the
      ACT intervention will experience significantly greater improvements in physical and mental
      health functioning, obesity-related quality of life, physical activity levels, caloric and
      nutrient intake, emotional distress symptoms, binge frequency, and other forms of emotional
      eating than patients in the brief MOVE-II active control group; 3) gains associated with the
      ACT intervention will be maintained longer than gains associated with the brief MOVE-II
      active control group; 4) at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups, patients in the ACT intervention
      will have greater decreases in body mass index compared to patients in the brief MOVE-II
      active control group; and 5) measures of acceptance and action will mediate treatment
      response in the ACT intervention on outcomes of interest. Given the significant physical and
      psychological sequelae of binge eating and obesity, a brief intervention that can reduce
      disordered eating, enhance the maintenance of weight loss, and improve functioning among
      patients who suffer from binge eating, could be critical in the comprehensive approach to
      patient care at the VA.
