      question to imit or withdraw specific therapies (DLWT) is raised, with a cross-analysis of
      physicians and pts points of view.

      This study took place in 5 oncology and hematology units : 2 university hospitals, 1 general
      hospital, 1 cancer center and 1 private hospital. The study included two different
      approaches: an epidemiological section to identify the prevalence of these situations in
      different institutions and a qualitative study section exploring factors influencing the
      decision process. The epidemiological analysis included all hospitalized patients identified
      with advanced cancer for whom the question of DLWT was raised in a given week or during the
      two weeks preceding the investigation.

      The qualitative analysis was based on interviews with the referent oncologist (or
      hematologist) and his patient (conducted by a physician and a psychologist respectively) as
      well as interviews with other partners involved in the situation (care staff and relatives)
      depending on the center. Researchers also participated in multidisciplinary meetings and
      monitored changes in the decision over a three month period.
