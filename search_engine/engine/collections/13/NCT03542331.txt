      fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be asked to do blood samples and
      ultrasounds for the detection of the LH (luteinizing hormone) surge in a natural cycle. The
      intervention group will undergo endometrial flushing with Lipiodol between day 6 and 8 of the
      cycle, while the control group between day 6 and 8 of the cycle will have a mock catheter
      introduction without any Lipiodol flush. An endometrial biopsy will be performed 7 days after
      the LH peak in all the participants. Furthermore, all the participants will undergo one cycle
      with flushing and one cycle with introduction of a mock catheter but without flushing with
      any medication. The wash-out period between the 2 biopsies will be 3 months.
