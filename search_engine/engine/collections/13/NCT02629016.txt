    
      For this study, sophomores who are enrolled in health at Jesuit High School, (n = 320
      students) will be invited to participate in a research study, conducted during health class,
      comparing mindfulness to a wellness or waitlist control. The students will be randomized by
      classroom, to either wellness or mindfulness or waitlist, with approximately 3-4 classes per
      intervention or control. Initially, six classes or sections of health will be randomized to
      one of the two active interventions, with the remaining classes/sections of health on the
      waitlist. Both of the intervention groups will meet weekly, during one of the regularly
      scheduled health classes, and have daily assignments. The students in the waitlisted
      classrooms will receive an intervention at the start of the next term. At the end of the
      study, students will have access to the materials from the other group, if desired.
