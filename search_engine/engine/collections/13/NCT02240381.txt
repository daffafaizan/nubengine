      I. To determine whether pre-transplant insulin resistance predicts for the development of new
      onset post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) in individuals without diabetes undergoing
      matched related donor (MRD) hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT).

      II. To define the role of circulating tissue-specific Th1 cells in the development of PTDM.

      III. To characterize the phenotype and function of circulating tissue-specific regulatory T
      cells (Tregs) in HCT recipients with or without PTDM.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo OGTT and a standard 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure prior
      to HCT. Patients then undergo repeat OGTT and a 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp
      procedure once after HCT between days 90-100.
