    
      SDD for ICD is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study designed to show that SDD is
      safe in a defined patient population receiving an ICD implant and that this approach can be
      more cost effective for the hospital than the current NDD approach. Safety is to be
      demonstrated by showing that postoperative complications do not occur at a higher rate in the
      SDD group of patients when compared to the NDD group. Cost effectiveness is to be
      demonstrated by comparing health care utilization between the SDD and NDD groups for the
      first week post implantation. Patients who were implanted with a St. Jude Medical single or
      dual chamber ICD for primary prevention and who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria may
      be enrolled in the study. Patients areconsidered enrolled at the point of randomization.

      Randomization is assigned in a 1:1 ratio between the NDD group and the SDD group. Patients
      will undergo study evaluations after implant, pre-discharge, 1-week and 6 months post
      implant.
