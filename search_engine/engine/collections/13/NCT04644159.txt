      France after the diagnosis of the first case of COVID-19 on February 2020.
      Sero-epidemiological studies were conducted in this town by the Institut Pasteur in early
      2020 among families, teachers and non-teaching staff of the high and elementary schools.

      These surveys have documented the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in one of the first French
      COVID-19 outbreaks and this study proposes to better characterize the specific immunity
      generated by the infection among this community. Indeed, the nature of this immunity and its
      persistence over time are crucial information. The goal of this new project is to explore the
      specific immune response to the SARS CoV 2 virus for a period of 2 years from the initial
      circulation of the virus in this north of France city, within a large cohort of participants
      in the general population covering all age groups from 5 years of age but also in patients
      and residents of retirement homes in this city. It is expected that the immune response
      conferred by natural infection or vaccination will differ according to age.

      This study will focus on systemic humoral and cell responses, immunity of the nasopharyngeal
      mucosa and the humoral response present in saliva. The genetic basis of the diversity of
      humoral responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and those related to the multiplicity of clinical
      manifestations of COVID-19 will also be investigated. This would provide initial evidence to
      determine the protective character against re-infection of the natural immunity generated by
      CoV-2-SARS. Finally, these data will be used to model the intra-family transmission of the
      virus.
