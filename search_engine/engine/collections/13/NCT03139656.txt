      intervention condition (values clarification, planning, and combined) on self-reported health
      goal progress and related outcomes at 1-week and 4-week follow-up, relative to baseline.
      Based on this design, participants will first be instructed to generate a health-related goal
      on which they want to make progress over the course of the next month (following procedures
      adapted from Little, 1993, and Sheldon & Kasser, 1998; see details below). Participants will
      then be randomly assigned (using a random number table) to one of three intervention
      conditions: (1) values clarification, (2) planning, and (3) combined (values clarification +
      planning). All conditions are described in more detail below. Fifty-three participants will
      be randomized to each condition. Questionnaire measures assessing a variety of psychological
      variables as well as neuropsychological measures will be modeled as between-subject predictor
      and/or moderator variables of goal-consistent health behavior. Additionally, differences in
      self-concordance, goal commitment, and expectancies of success will be modeled as potential
      moderator and/or mediator variables.
