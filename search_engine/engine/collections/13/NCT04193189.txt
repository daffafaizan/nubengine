    
      This phase III/IV study will evaluate the response to and safety of the HBV vaccine
      HEPLISAV-B in two study populations living with HIV: prior HBV vaccine recipients who are
      deemed non-responders (Group A) and individuals who are naïve to HBV vaccination (Group B).

      Group A (HBV vaccine non-responders)

      The study is designed as an open-label three-arm study to evaluate whether:

        1. HEPLISAV-B vaccination given as a two-dose series achieves non-inferior seroprotection
           response (SPR) compared to standard dose ENGERIX-B.

        2. HEPLISAV-B vaccination given as a three-dose series achieves superior SPR proportion
           compared to standard dose ENGERIX-B.

      Participants are randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to the following study arms, stratified by sex at
      birth (male vs. female) and diabetes diagnosis status (yes vs. no):

        -  Arm 1: Two doses of HEPLISAV-B at weeks 0 and 4.

        -  Arm 2: Three doses of HEPLISAV-B at weeks 0, 4, and 24.

        -  Arm 3: Three doses of ENGERIX-B at weeks 0, 4, and 24.

      The target sample size in Group A is 561 participants, 187 participants in each arm.

      Group B (Naïve to HBV vaccination)

      Group B study is a single arm evaluation of vaccine response and safety of three doses of
      HEPLISAV-B. The target sample size is 73 participants.

      All participants will remain on their non-study-provided antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      throughout the study. Participants in both groups will attend several study visits through
      Week 72. Visits may include physical examinations and blood collection. For 7 days after each
      vaccination, participants will record temperature and any reactions they have to the vaccine.
