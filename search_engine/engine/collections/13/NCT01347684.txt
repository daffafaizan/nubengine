      multi-disciplinary treatment in TMD patients with episodic or chronic tension-type headache
      (TTH) with pericranial tenderness involving the temporalis muscle at reducing the intensity
      of TTH pain at 1 and 6 months. The hypothesis is that a team approach will reduce the
      intensity of headache more than usual care in this group of patients.
