      concluded, an additional two years of follow-up visits will be conducted for all
      participants. Participants enrolled in the first year of the study can expect to complete
      follow-up visits for approximately four additional years if progression to stage 3 (Type 1
      Diabetes Onset) does not occur. Participant follow-up visits after the treatment phase of the
      study includes general assessments (medical history, physical exam, medications and adverse
      events) and laboratory assessments to determine current health status and glucose tolerance.
