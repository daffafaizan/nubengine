      due to a rupture of a pouch or bulge in a brain vessel (called an aneurysm). It is a rare but
      serious condition with a high risk of death. Even patients who have had successful repair of
      the aneurysm remain at risk for developing cerebral vasospasm, which can result in harmful
      conditions related to the lack of oxygen to parts of the brain and death. Cerebral vasospasm
      usually occurs within the first couple of weeks after aSAH, and it is difficult to treat.
      Currently there is no safe, efficacious and widely available treatment. Previous animal
      studies have shown that a new drug under investigation, clazosentan, was able to reverse
      cerebral vasospasm in animal models of SAH. A first trial conducted in a small number of
      patients showed some benefit of clazosentan in reversing established cerebral vasospasm after
      aSAH. Clazosentan has already been evaluated in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm in
      several large clinical trials in aSAH. This current study aims to evaluate if clazosentan is
      effective and safe in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after aSAH.
