    
      Two overnight sleep studies, a placebo night and a drug night, will be performed
      approximately one week apart in random order. The placebo or drug will be administered 3
      hours before lights out. At least 10 minutes of quiet wakefulness will be recorded to
      quantify the subject's awake EMG GG activity before the administration of
      placebo/dalfampridine.

      EMG GG activity will be measured again 10 mins before lights off and during stable NREM and
      REM sleep (free of arousals and other artifacts).

      During the second part of the night, the subjects will be connected to a modified continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine (Pcrit3000, Respironics) which can provide a wide
      range of pressures between 20 and -20 cmH2O in order to modify upper airway pressure and
      measure change in EMG GG as a function of epiglottic pressure (muscle responsiveness).
