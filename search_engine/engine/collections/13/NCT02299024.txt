      written and spoken communications - are inadequate, and patients often leave without the
      knowledge necessary to properly care for themselves. In the context of opioid pain relievers,
      this lack of knowledge is potentially dangerous, as patients may not possess the requisite
      knowledge for safe use of their medication or an awareness of the dangers of medication
      misuse.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an opioid information sheet and spoken
      counseling on patient knowledge about opioids and safe use behaviors. The investigators
      conducted a randomized controlled pilot test of a dual-modality educational intervention
      (written information sheet and spoken counseling about opioids) to assess if the intervention
      can increase patient knowledge about opioid pain relievers. These activities were intended to
      guide future modification of educational interventions and the future development of best
      practices for emergency physician spoken counseling about opioid pain relievers.
