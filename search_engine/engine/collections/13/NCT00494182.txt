    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival of the combination of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006),
      carboplatin, and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of
      the head and neck (SCCHN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate, toxicity, safety profile, exploratory biomarker data, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours on day 1, and sorafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 2-19. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses. Starting with course 7, participants receive sorafenib PO
      daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up between 21-35 days.
