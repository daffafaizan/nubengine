      AL-SENSE can indicate whether wetness sensed by pregnant women may be caused by amniotic
      fluid leakage rather than by urinary incontinence. Subjects arriving at the hospital and
      reporting unidentified wetness (undetermined whether this is amniotic fluid leakage or
      urinary incontinence) will receive a single AL-SENSE to use up to 12 hours or until they
      notice any wetness. The clinician will explain the proper use and handling of the AL-SENSE.

      In each case, the blinded clinician will be required to read and record any occurrence of
      color change of the AL-SENSE 10 minutes after the AL-SENSE removal and to mark if it changes
      color to blue or to green on the designated form.

      The blinded physician (other than the clinician who records the AL-SENSE results) will
      perform a diagnosis according to the standard diagnostic methods (clinical assessment). The
      standard diagnostic methods will include the following tests: (1) Pooling test, (2) Ferning
      test, (3) pH test by pH paper. A positive Pooling test or positive result in both the pH test
      and the Ferning test is defined as a positive clinical assessment.

      In cases where the AL-SENSE shows positive results but the clinical assessment results are
      negative, reference laboratories, or any other standard procedure will check for the
      possibility of BV or Trichomonas in addition to the tests noted above.
