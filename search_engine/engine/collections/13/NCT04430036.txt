      to expansion to the full planned phase II. The overall phase II will be an open-label, single
      arm study in two stages to evaluate the efficacy of the combination in pathologic downstaging
      of MIBC. Patients will receive four 21-day cycles of neoadjuvant therapy consisting of
      cisplatin and gemcitabine plus AGEN2034 in all 4 cycles and AGEN1884 in cycles 1 and 3.
      Patients will proceed to radical cystectomy within 10 weeks after the final dose of this
      therapy. The primary endpoint of pathologic tumor downstaging will be assessed at the time of
      cystectomy.
