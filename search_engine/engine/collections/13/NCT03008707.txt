      in the management of complicated acute diverticulitis. Recently, three important prospective
      randomized-control studies (SCANDIV, LOLA, DILALA) have reported contradicting conclusions,
      as two of them (SCANDIV and LOLA) state that LPL is not superior to sigmoidectomy for the
      high reoperation rate and morbidity, while DILALA confirms that LPL is feasible and safe in
      the short-term. To our knowledge, no international guidelines promote the use of LPL in
      complicated acute diverticulitis. We believe this technique could be safely used in a
      selected cohort of patients and, in some circumstances, could represent a "bridge" to a
      possible planned resection. The aim of the study is to collect and analyze the multicentric
      data of the LPL and LS and give a substantial contribution to the scientific community about
      this very debated topic.
