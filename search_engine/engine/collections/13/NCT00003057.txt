      therapy with loperamide hydrochloride for chemotherapy related diarrhea in patients with
      advanced colorectal malignancies undergoing chemotherapy with fluorouracil or fluorouracil
      based regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, randomized, parallel, open label, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified by therapy, grade of diarrhea, and prior use of loperamide hydrochloride or
      octreotide acetate. Patients undergo 1 of 3 treatments. Patients receive either low doses of
      octreotide (arm A) or high doses of octreotide (arm B) subcutaneously 3 times daily for 5
      days. Patients in arm C receive oral doses of loperamide following each unformed stool for 5
      days. A diary is completed by patients to record medications and bowel history. Treatment
      continues if diarrhea persists beyond day 5, but will be considered a treatment failure. If
      diarrhea continues to worsen, patients are removed from study. All patients are followed for
      24 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a total of 500 patients.
