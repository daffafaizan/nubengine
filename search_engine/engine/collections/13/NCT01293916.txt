        -  double-leg spica casting is the treatment of choice at many centers for the treatment of
           diaphyseal femur fractures in children 2 to 6 years old.

        -  Investigators hypothesize that these patients can be effectively treated with single-leg
           spica casting and that such treatment will result in easier care and better patient
           function during treatment.

      Methods

        -  Prospective randomized controlled study of patients between 2 and 6 years old with
           diaphyseal femur fractures

        -  patients randomly assigned to either immediate single or double-leg spica casting groups
           after consent was obtained

        -  Radiographs serially evaluated for maintenance of reduction with respect to length,
           varus/valgus angulation and procurvatum/recurvatum angulation

        -  After casts removal, the Activity Scale for Kids (Performance Version) questionnaire and
           a custom written survey were given to parents evaluating ease of care and function of
           children during treatment.
