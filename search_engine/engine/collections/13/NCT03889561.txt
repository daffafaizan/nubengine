      and dental carries. While drinking water is associated with these and many other positive
      health outcomes, many do not meet the recommended dietary intake of water. This is more
      profound in low income and minority communities that are more likely to drink less water and
      drink more SSBs. School-based water promotion interventions have shown that improved access
      to clean drinking water coupled with promotion leads to increases in water consumption and
      improved health outcomes. No studies have studied the impact of similar strategies on
      beverage intake and health in parks and public spaces. Parks are an inconspicuous and widely
      utilized public space, with the majority of Americans going to a park in the last month. This
      study's central hypothesis is that visitors in parks with SSB taxes coupled with increased
      access to appealing drinking water and rigorous promotion of its consumption will be more
      likely to drink water and less likely to drink SSBs, compared to visitors in parks with only
      SSB taxes. This quasi-experimental study makes use of naturally-occurring policy changes in
      the San Francisco (SF) Bay Area to disentangle the impacts of anti- SSB policies, water
      station installation, and multicultural water promotion efforts, using control groups to
      isolate the effects of anti-SSB policies alone or no intervention. This study will analyze
      beverage consumption in 10 SF parks that received new water stations and a multicultural
      water promotion campaign compared to 20 matched control parks (10 parks SF and 10 parks in
      Oakland) with only SSB taxes.
