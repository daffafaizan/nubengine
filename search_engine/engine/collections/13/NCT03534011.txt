      support (ACLS as described in the present guidelines from the Norwegian Resuscitation
      Council) is established, a REBOA catheter is inserted via the femoral artery and the aortic
      balloon inflated, according to a procedure described in a separate document. Ultrasound is
      used to limit risk related to cannulation and placement of the guidewire. The ultrasound
      images will be stored and later processed by the principal investigator. If the physician
      experiences technical problems during the procedure (i.e. severe difficulties in establishing
      vascular access, resistance during insertion of the guidewire, introducer or balloon
      catheter, severe bleeding, prolonged time consumption) the effort will be aborted. If ROSC is
      achieved, the aortic balloon is deflated gently. If the patient re-enters cardiac arrest, the
      normal ACLS-guideline is followed. The balloon is then re-inflated, as described in the
      procedure.
