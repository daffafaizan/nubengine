    
      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, four-period, cross-over study to
      assess the effect of single-doses of ZTI-01 at therapeutic (T) and supratherapeutic (ST)
      plasma concentrations on the QTc interval versus placebo (P) and an open-label moxifloxacin
      (M) control (400 mg PO).

      Assessment of safety data will include changes from baseline in vital signs and laboratory
      parameters, infusion site reactions, adverse events and clinically significant changes from
      baseline in 12-lead ECG parameters.
