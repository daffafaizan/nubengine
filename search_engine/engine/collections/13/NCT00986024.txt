      syndrome. There seem to be a strong age-dependence in the prevalence of the metabolic
      syndrome, but the incidence rises rapidly within adolescents and middle-aged groups and
      follows the development of obesity in the general population. Metabolic syndrome confers an
      increased risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and premature death;
      therefore, effective and affordable strategies to combat the syndrome would be of great
      individual and social importance.

      Despite the general agreement that moderate-intensity physical activity for a minimum of 30
      min five days per week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20
      min three days a week promote and maintain health, the optimal training regime to treat
      metabolic syndrome and its associated cardiovascular abnormalities remains uncertain.
