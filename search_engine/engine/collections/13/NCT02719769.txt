    
      The clinical study entitled "Evaluation of Clinical Performance of the Accelerate ID/AST
      System for Positive Blood Culture Identification & Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing" is
      designed to demonstrate the clinical performance of the Accelerate ID/AST System for positive
      blood culture identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) in a
      clinical setting compared to reference results. Approximately 3,000 positive blood culture
      samples (across all Clinical Sites) will be tested on the investigational device and
      reference methods. Up to 50% of samples enrolled will be comprised of seeded blood cultures
      prepared from clinical stock isolates. Quality Control testing will be performed each day of
      testing. The study population is comprised of left-over clinical specimens that are indicated
      as positive by blood culture monitoring systems utilized by clinical microbiology
      laboratories. Positive blood culture samples must be tested on the Accelerate ID/AST System
      within 8 hours of positivity by the blood culture monitoring system. Testing of clinical
      samples will continue until the required sample size for each target organism and
      antimicrobial agent, including sufficient on-scale and resistant strains, are tested across
      all the sites.
