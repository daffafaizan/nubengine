      biological calibration of in-House Reference Preparations (IHRP). The method is not intended
      for routine testing of allergen extracts. The use of this procedure is the basis for the
      definition of biological activity units: "the activity of an allergen extract is 10,000
      Biological Units (BU) per ml (10 HEP per ml), when the extract provokes an specific skin
      reaction in the median sensitive patient with a wheal of the same size as a wheal provoked by
      a positive reference solution consisting of histamine 54.3 mmol/l (for example histamine
      dihydrochloride 10 mg/ml), when both solutions are administrated using the same technique
      (prick testing) on at least 20 individuals who are clinically allergic and cutaneously
      reactive to the allergen concerned".
