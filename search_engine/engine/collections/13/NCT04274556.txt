      mortality and morbidity. As a prolonged recovery time affects both the patients and the
      healthcare professionals and caregivers, there has been increased interest on determining the
      modifiable treatment-related factors in the international literature. The patients are
      limited in their daily living activities at home and at work during this period and a
      significant amount of time is therefore required to go back to normal life.
