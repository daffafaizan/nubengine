      study. Eighty patients developed septic complication during ICU stay (sepsis group). Eighty
      patients were critically ill without evidence of infectious organism (SIRS group). Patients
      received anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids before admission, who had
      immunosuppressive illness, who had chronic organ failure; who had received massive blood
      transfusion; those with radiation therapy, previous organ transplantation were excluded from
      the study. At admission, the patient's age, sex, height and weight were recorded. These data
      include the following: clinical status; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score;
      temperature; heart rate; respiratory rate; blood pressure; central venous pressure;
      laboratory analysis (complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, blood sugar, serum sodium,
      potassium, calcium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time,
      albumin and CRP) and arterial blood gas analysis. Routine cultures of blood, urine and
      suspected sites were obtained to determine the presence of infection. We attempted to
      maintain the patient hemoglobin level at 10-12g/dl and central venous pressure at 8-12 cmH2o.
      If needed, blood products, intravascular fluid replacement and inotropic and/or vasopressor
      agents were administered. Each day the attending physician in the ICU evaluated all the study
      patients for sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock.
