    
      Methods: A double-blind randomized sham-controlled pilot study will be conducted in 40
      patients with bipolar treatment-resistant depression receiving either active (n=20) or sham
      (n=20) iTBS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

      Depression severity will be assessed by an investigator blinded to iTBS condition before and
      after 10 to 30 iTBS sessions depending on remission onset. Remission will be defined as Beck
      Depression Inventory, BDI score<10.

      Objective/Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesized the superiority of active iTBS over sham
      ITBS
