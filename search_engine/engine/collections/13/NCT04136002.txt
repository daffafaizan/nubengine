      who would otherwise undergo screening for malignant disease using invasive methodologies such
      as colonoscopy. The intended use of such a test would be to return a result of ctDNA
      detected/ ctDNA not detected in a patient eligible for average risk screening for colorectal
      cancer. Those patients who receive a ctDNA detected result should undergo further
      investigation with colonoscopy.

      In order to define the performance characteristics of the test in a relevant population, this
      study will perform a blood draw prior to the patient undergoing the standard of care
      colonoscopy (and all associated preparatory medications) and retrospectively compare the
      performance characteristics of the LUNAR-2 test with the findings of the index colonoscopy.

      Outcomes of patients at one and two-years post-procedure will be collected as secondary
      endpoints to investigate the possibility of incidental, non-colorectal cancer cases and
      interval cancers that had not reached the clinical threshold for detection at the time of the
      index colonoscopy.
