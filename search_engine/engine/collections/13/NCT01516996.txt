      the most complex management challenges. This stage of disease is still potentially curable,
      but requires combined-modality therapy. Recent studies have showed that induction
      chemotherapy（neoadjuvant）reduced the 3-year distant relapse rate. Concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy(CCRT), on the other hand, has demonstrated a significant and consistent
      benefit in local control rates, but its impact on distant failure is inconsistent.
      Nimotuzumab is a novel EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibody that has the potential.to be used
      as a single agent or as a radio- and chemotherapy sensitizer for the treatment of SCCHN.
      Thus, investigators conducted a randomized, multicenter phaseⅡ study to compare the
      efficiency and safety of adding nimotuzumab to neoadjuvant and CCRT with neoadjuvant and CCRT
      in the treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oropharynx and hypopharynx.
