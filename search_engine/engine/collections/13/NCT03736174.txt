      for the diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS). The results of the
      ultrasound will help determine if there are any significant radiologic findings or patterns
      seen in patients with CECS. Evaluation of ultrasonographic findings will be dependent on
      tissue density as measured by hypoechoic versus hyperechoic signal as well as muscle
      compartment thickness at its largest dimension. A specific aim for this study would be to
      facilitate future research in order to eliminate the need for painful and invasive diagnostic
      techniques for CECS.
