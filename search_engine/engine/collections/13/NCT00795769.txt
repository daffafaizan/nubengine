      I. To determine whether the incidence of nausea and vomiting related to administration of
      autologous hematopoetic stem cells cryopreserved in DMSO can be reduced by the use of a
      single dose of intravenous ondansetron prior to the stem cell infusion.

      II. To determine the number of patients who experience nausea and vomiting.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ondansetron IV once 30-60 minutes before undergoing autologous
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
