      it shows serious bleeding manifestations in types 2 and 3. Overall, the symptoms reported in
      vWD include easy bruising, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, excessive menstrual
      bleeding, postpartum haemorrhage, and excessive bleeding after surgical operation and minor
      wounds.However, A distinctive bleeding history is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of any
      bleeding disorder and should guide further laboratory investigations In an attempt to
      standardize the diagnostic criteria of VWD, a bleeding questionnaire and a bleeding score
      were developed The combination of a standardized bleeding questionnaire and a well-defined
      interpretation grid (for the computation of the final (BS) has been referred to as a Bleeding
      Assessment Tool (BAT).
