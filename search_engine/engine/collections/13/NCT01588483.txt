    
      As standard care, all patients with a suspicion of GCA undergo a biopsy of the temporal
      artery and a PET scintigraphy to evaluate the presence of large vessel vasculitis. Patients
      with proven GCA on biopsy and/or scintigraphy undergo a computed tomography (CT) of the aorta
      without the administration of contrast, at diagnosis and yearly thereafter (every 12 +/- 3
      months) for 10 years.

      Measurements include the diameter of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta,
      suprarenal, juxtarenal and infrarenal aorta, and the volume of the thoracic and the abdominal
      aorta. These measurements are correlated with FDG-uptake at the level of the aorta on
      PET-scintigraphy at the time of diagnosis. All patients will be treated according to accepted
      guidelines and standard care in our center (methylprednisolone started at 32 mg/day, with
      slowly declining doses until stop after 1 to 1,5 years of treatment).
