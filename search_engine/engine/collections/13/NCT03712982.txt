    
      Couples who have been trying to conceive for at least a year, have attended at least one
      doctor's appointment with an infertility/fertility specialist and have been advised by their
      physician to undergo their first IVF cycle will be recruited for this study.

      Participants (couples) will be randomly assigned (assignment determined immediately following
      recruitment by a member of our research team), if eligible to one of four of five
      experimental conditions, which are described below. Assignment will occur on a 1:2:2:2:1
      basis, such that for every two couples assigned to Conditions 2, 3 and 4 (mindfulness
      conditions) one couple will be assigned to Conditions 1 and 5 (control conditions). Couples
      will be told that we are interested in exploring if practicing mindful attention during the
      IVF process may improve patient and partner wellbeing during and following their first IVF
      cycle. All participants will be instructed to complete study measures, at three different
      points in time, via an online link.
