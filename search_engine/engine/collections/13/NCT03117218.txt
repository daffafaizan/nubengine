    
      Coronary MR angiography is performed with a 3.0-T imager with 32-channel coils. Qunatitative
      analysis of coronary MR angiogram is evaluated on the basis of the signal intensity (SI)
      profile along the vessel. Quantitative analysis of coronary MR angiogram (QCMRA) is
      calculated as [1 - (SImin/SIref)] x 100, where SImin is minimal SI and SIref is corresponding
      reference SI. Diagnostic performance of quantitative analysis of coronary MR angiogram for
      predicting functional significant coronary stenosis was evaluated by using fractional flow
      reserve (FFR) as the reference standard.
