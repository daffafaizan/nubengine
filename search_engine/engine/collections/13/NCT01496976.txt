      CLL/SLL, utilizing a two-stage trial design. The primary endpoint for this trial is the
      combined complete and partial response rate (at 3 months-the end of cycle 3) to the protocol
      therapy. We anticipate this trial will have a complete response (CR) and partial response
      (PR) rate of at least 80%.

      A two-stage design is employed for this trial. The null/unacceptable CR+PR response rate is ≤
      60% while the anticipated true response rate to the protocol treatment is at least 80% for
      each disease cohort. At the first stage, 26 patients will be accrued to the trial. If 15 or
      fewer of these patients respond, then the trial will be terminated early and the response
      rate to the protocol treatment will be deemed unacceptable (≤ 60%). Otherwise, if more than
      15 patients respond during the first stage, an additional 19 patients will be enrolled to
      this trial during stage 2 for a total of 45 patients. If 32 or fewer of these 45 patients
      respond to the protocol treatment at the end of stage 2, no further investigation of the
      protocol treatment is considered warranted. On the other hand, if more than 32 patients out
      of the 45 enrolled patients respond, the protocol treatment will be considered promising. If
      the true response rate is ≤ 60%, the probability of ending the trial at stage 1 is 0.48. If,
      however, the true response rate is at least 80%, then the probability of ending the trial at
      stage 1 is only 0.01. This two-stage design has an overall alpha level of 0.045 and a power
      of 0.90.
