    
      This is a randomized, multicenter, evaluator blinded study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of SCY-078 compared to Fluconazole in adult
      patients, from 18 to 65 years of age, with moderate to severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC)
      and a history of frequent episodes of VVC. Approximately 90 subjects, meeting the inclusion
      criteria will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 3 treatment arms:
      oral SCY-078 does regimen 1, or oral SCY-078 does regimen 2, or oral Fluconazole. After
      enrollment, subjects will be evaluated on Day-5 (end of treatment visit), Day-24 (test of
      cure visit), Day-60, Day 90 and Day 120 (end of observation period visit) or at any time that
      a recurrence or clinical failure is suspected, up to the end of observation period.

      Primary Objectives:

      * To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 dosing regimens of Oral SCY-078 in subjects with
      moderate to severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC)

      Secondary Objectives:

      * To estimate the effect of Oral SCY-078 therapy in the rate and time to recurrence in
      subjects with a history of frequent episodes of VVC
