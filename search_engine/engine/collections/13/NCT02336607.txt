      years old with mild to moderate essential hypertension. At first 2 weeks, all patients will
      use felodipine 5mg daily. If the blood pressure dosen't meet the target (140/90mmHg), they
      will be randomized into metoprolol, lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide combination groups for
      another 4 weeks therapy. After that, if the blood pressure has still not met the target,
      up-titrate the felodipine into 10mg, followed by a 4 weeks therapy. And if the blood pressure
      is still not met the target after that, up-titrate the combine drugs into maximum dosage. The
      whole treatment duration is 14 weeks.

      The primary outcome is to evaluate the percentage of subjects reaching blood pressure target
      (defined as < 140 / 90 mmHg) after 14 weeks treatment with felodipine sustained release in
      combination with metoprolol, lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide.
