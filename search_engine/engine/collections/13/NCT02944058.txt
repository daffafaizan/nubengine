      between two implants. The investigators will use deltopectoral or deltoid split as surgical
      access. All patients will have calcar screws and cuff sutures. When lack of bone for example
      after decompressing valgus compressed fractures, a bone-substitute might be used in the
      surgeons preference. Follow up in outpatient clinic at 6, 12, 52 and 104 weeks, but also a 5
      year follow up is planned. Postoperative radiographs of both shoulders and CT of operated
      shoulder will be taken.
