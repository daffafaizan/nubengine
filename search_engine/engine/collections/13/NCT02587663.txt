      I. To determine how surgical treatment is influenced by the three imaging arms.

      II. To compare three imaging arms in terms of accurately measuring the size of the index
      lesion and the number and location of tumor foci (using surgical pathology as gold standard).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In women with dense breasts: To retrospectively compare the accuracy of three imaging arms
      in measuring the size of the index lesion and the number and location of tumor foci (using
      surgical pathology as the gold standard).

      II. To report the incidence of synchronous contralateral breast cancers detected by the three
      imaging arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      GROUP 1: Patients undergo standard of care diagnostic imaging comprising bilateral
      mammography and targeted breast ultrasound.

      GROUP 2: Patients undergo standard of care diagnostic imaging as in Group 1. Patients also
      undergo bilateral whole-breast ultrasound.

      GROUP 3: Patients undergo standard of care diagnostic imaging as in Group 1. Patients also
      undergo bilateral breast contrast-enhanced MRI.

      All patients undergo standard of care breast conserving surgery, or mastectomy if the tests
      indicate a change in the surgical plan.
