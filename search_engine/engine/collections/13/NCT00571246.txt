      disorder (PTSD). The rates of PTSD among individuals with AD are at least twice as high as
      those in the general population. In addition, alcohol dependence is the most common comorbid
      condition in men with PTSD. Despite this, little is known about how to best treat individuals
      with comorbid AD and PTSD. The use of anticonvulsants represents a novel approach to
      treatment that may target symptoms of both AD and PTSD. Both Topiramate and Lamotrigine act
      on the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. Topiramate has GABAergic effects by robustly
      increasing brain GABA, and antiglutamatergic effects by inhibiting glutamate function that
      might antagonize alcohol's rewarding effects in AD and could contribute to the regulating of
      reexperiencing and arousal symptoms in PTSD. Lamotrigine is a glutamate-inhibiting
      anticonvulsant that has shown efficacy in some dually diagnosed patients with alcohol
      dependence, and in patients with PTSD. Neither topiramate nor lamotrigine have been used to
      treat patients with comorbid PTSD and AD. Methods: Ninety men and women with a current
      diagnosis of AD and PTSD will be enrolled in a 16-week trial. They will be assigned, in a
      double-blind fashion, to either topiramate, lamotrigine or placebo. Significance: This
      project will be the first to compare anticonvulsants (topiramate and lamotrigine) to placebo
      as effective treatments for reducing alcohol consumption and PTSD symptoms in patients with
      AD and PTSD.
