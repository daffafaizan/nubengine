    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the researchers
      nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), multi-center (more
      than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study),
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in participants who are asymptomatic and at risk for
      developing Alzheimer's dementia. The study will consist of a Screening Phase (approximately
      90 days), treatment Phase (54 months) and follow-up Phase (7 to 28 days). In treatment Phase
      eligible Participants will be randomized to receive study drug or placebo once daily for up
      to 4.5 years. The maximum study duration for a participant will be 58 months. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
