      catheterization will be eligible. Twenty subjects will be enrolled: 10 patients will receive
      40mg and 10 patients will receive 80mg; each dose will be equally distributed among those
      with preserved (â‰¥50%) and reduced (<50%) EF. Subjects will get a baseline echo prior to the
      heart catheterization. Baseline invasive hemodynamic measurements will be performed using a
      Swan Ganz catheter. A single oral dose of sildenafil will then be administered (40mg or
      80mg), followed by invasive hemodynamic measurements at 30 and 60 minutes. Also at 60
      minutes, limited echocardiographic images will be obtained.
