      impacted by geographic isolation and a shortage in the number of endocrinologists in the
      United States. CGM use has been endorsed for individuals with T1D by the American Diabetes
      Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the Endocrine Society,
      and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes. Despite these
      recommendations and the compelling evidence of the benefits of CGM, many individuals with T1D
      or insulin-using T2D have not incorporated CGM into their diabetes management.

      The study was designed to assess feasibility and efficacy of establishing a virtual diabetes
      clinic with a focus on introduction of CGM technology and ongoing CGM use to minimize such
      rate-limiting factors as geography, cost and access to specialty care. The virtual diabetes
      clinic model will include a comprehensive care team with support for diabetes technology such
      as CGM and decision support to align with current recommendations in diabetes care. The
      virtual diabetes clinic model will also include mental health screening and support services,
      particularly for diabetes-related issues.
