      cells and triggered by environmental factors based on genetic susceptibility. LADA shows some
      characteristics of type 2 diabetes at its onset, which develops slowly and latent, and easily
      be misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes due to slowly β cell function deterioration. This is a
      multi-center, open- label, 1:1:1 randomized controlled trial to investigate the protective
      effects of saxagliptin and vitamin D3 in LADA patients. The study comprises the 0-6weeks of
      screening period and the 104-week intervention period. After obtaining the informed
      consent，the screening will find out the eligible patients according to the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, then the patients will be randomized to the 104-week
      intervention period. Subjects will be randomized into one of the three groups(arms) through
      central dynamic randomization: metformin (and insulin), metformin(and insulin) +saxagliptin,
      metformin(and insulin) +saxagliptin+vitamin D3. Our previous randomized- controlled pilot
      study showed that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors could significantly improve islet
      β-cell function in patients with LADA. The main purpose of this study: To evaluate whether
      saxagliptin (and vitamin D3) with metformin (and insulin) therapy can better protect islet β
      cell function than metformin (and insulin).
