      study. When there is a upper GI bleeding with active bleeding or stigmata on the lesions,
      endoscopic hemostasis will be done.

      After randomization, patients in both group will undergo endoscopic hemostasis with
      epinephrine injection therapy. In the study group, Endo-clot will be applied after
      epinephrine injection therapy. In the control group, hemoclip will be applied after
      epinephrine injection therapy. The efficacy of Endo-Clot and hemoclip will be compared.
