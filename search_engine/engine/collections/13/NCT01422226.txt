      contraceptive devices in nulliparous women.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the ability to place an IUD in the standard fashion, without
      ancillary measures, in nulliparous women who have received misoprostol versus placebo
      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate in nulliparous women who have chosen to receive an IUD whether
      pre-procedure misoprostol eases pain, compared to placebo Specific Aim 3: To evaluate whether
      misoprostol reduces the rate of complications of IUD placement, compared to placebo Study
      drug (misoprostol) is being obtained from the University of Utah Health Sciences Center,
      which is the main study site. The University of Utah Health Sciences Center has obtained an
      Investigational New Drug (IND) exemption from the FDA in order to use misoprostol for this
      use in this study. This study is part of a prospective meta-analysis. Deidentified data will
      be provided to the other sites in a password protected spreadsheet and sent via encrypted,
      secure email. No identifiable data will be shared with other sites or via the internet. We
      did not complete attachment G, use of the internet, because this research is not being done
      via the internet, and no identifiable data will be accessible via the internet or shared with
      other sites involved in the study. Only deidentified data will be made available to the other
      sites involved in the prospective meta-analysis.
