      monomethyl auristatin E. It is currently evaluated in combination with multi-agent
      chemotherapy as frontline treatment of systemic ALCL (sALCL) and other CD30-positive mature T
      cell and NK cell lymphomas. Preliminary results of this phase 1 study have been presented at
      the 2012 ASH Annual Meeting: 26 patients have been treated with combination brentuximab
      vedotin and CHP. Nineteen of 26 patients had a diagnosis of sALCL and 7 patients had a
      diagnosis of another mature Tor NK-cell lymphoma (EATL, n=1). The maximum tolerated dose of
      brentuximab vedotin in combination with CHP was not exceeded at 1.8 mg/kg IV. Adverse events
      were manageable. All patients achieved an objective response, with 23 patients (88%)
      achieving a complete response (CR). All 7 non-sALCL patients achieved a CR.

      Finally, it has been recently reported that EATL type 1, but not refractory coeliac disease,
      strongly expressed CD30 and might benefit from brentuximab vedotin. Since the safety profile
      of the combination brentuximab vedotin and CHP is known and since the role of etoposide as
      part of induction regimen is not demonstrated, the investigator will assess the efficacy and
      toxicity of the combination brentuximab vedotin and CHP followed by HDT/ASCT, as frontline
      treatment of EATL.
