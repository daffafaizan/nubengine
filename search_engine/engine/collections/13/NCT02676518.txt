    
      -  To study the association between serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level and glucose
           intolerance and metabolic syndrome in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

        -  Glucose intolerance is detected by 2-hours 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

        -  Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed by using the Harmonized criteria; the presence of any 3
           of 5 following risk factors constitutes a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.

             1. Elevated waist circumference (> 80 cm in Asian women)

             2. Elevated triglycerides (> 150 mg/dL)

             3. Reduced HDL-cholesterol (< 50 mg/dL)

             4. Elevated blood pressure )systolic > 130 and/or diastolic > 85 mmHg)

             5. Elevated fasting glucose ( > 100 mg/dL)

        -  Percentage of glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome in PCOS women as well was any
           differences in parameters between PCOS patients with and without glucose intolerance and
           metabolic syndrome will be analysed.
