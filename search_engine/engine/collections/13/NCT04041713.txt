      studies implicate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stresses in the pathophysiology of
      Rett syndrome. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in Rett patients, Rett mouse
      models and MECP2-deficient cells.

      Collaborators have tested a combination of specific antioxidants known to enhance
      mitochondrial function in a cell and mouse model of Rett syndrome. The formulation normalized
      mitochondrial membrane potential in MECP2 neurons, and MECP2-deficient mice displayed
      improved exploratory, locomotor and social behavior compared to MECP2-deficient mice. These
      results support testing anti-oxidative strategies for benefit in individuals with Rett
      syndrome.In this study, the formulation has been adjusted and optimized based on current
      guidelines for human use, with the goal of translating a potential new treatment from the
      animal model to use in humans. Results of this study could lead to the first approved
      medication treatment for the disorder.
