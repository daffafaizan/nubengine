      for 1-2 days. Previous randomized control studies have demonstrated the pain relief effect of
      using high frequency TENS in dysmenorrheal pain. However, no investigation has been conducted
      to investigate the effect of high frequency TENS in female population in our country. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of high frequency TENS and compare to the
      placebo effect by sham TENS in a randomized control study.
