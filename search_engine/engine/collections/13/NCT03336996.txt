      injuries. And the clinical use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells has been approved by
      FDA. However, the results are inconsistent from both human study and animal research, it
      often difficult to visualize the reconstruction of the motor circuits. A separate application
      of DTI could not precisely reveal white matter integrity. Combining BOLD-fMRI with diffusion
      tensor-based tractography (DTT), to detect neural activities in the brain involved in the
      motor function restore and then using the two seeds method to reconstruct the nerve fibers
      between these connecting regions. The main aim of this study: i. To characterize and evaluate
      functional and anatomical changes of nerve fiber injuries after umbilical cord mesenchymal
      stem cells transplantation with BOLD drived-DTI. ii. To determine the therapeutic efficiency
      of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and also the utility of the integration of BOLD-fMRI
      and DTI. iii. To correlate the imaging results with the electrophysiology outcomes.
