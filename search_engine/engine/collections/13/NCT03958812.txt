      samples and peripheral venous blood will be collected. Two blood samples and two breath
      samples will be collected from each patient. One blood sample will be send to CTC tests for a
      blind test and the other will be used for headspace VOCs analyses. One breath sample was used
      for analysis with the Nano-sensors array, and the other was used for gas chromatography
      coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The VOCs samples were collected using
      sorbent tubes at a total flow through sorption trap of 200ml/min, then will be send to Israel
      Institute of Technology for further test.
