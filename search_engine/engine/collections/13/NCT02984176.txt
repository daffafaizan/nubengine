      discomfort, and abdominal pain by promoting the clearance of excessive gas along the
      gastrointestinal tract.

      Objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative oral simethicone for bowel
      preparation in gynecological laparoscopies.

      Methods: 100 infertile women will be scheduled for laparoscopy, patients randomized to
      receive either Simethicone (Group I) or placebo tablets (Group II). The primary outcome
      measure will be the overall exposure of the surgical field and pain scoring. Assessment of
      the overall exposure of the surgical field was done using a five-point scale (poor,
      sufficient, medium, good, and excellent). Visual analog score (VAS) will be used for
      assessment of postoperative pain and verbal analog scoring was used for assessment of patient
      satisfaction.
