        -  Assess 6-months progression-free survival of patients with stage III or IV
           adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with cisplatin, capecitabine, gemcitabine
           hydrochloride (PXG) and epirubicin hydrochloride vs PXG and docetaxel.

        -  Evaluate the activity and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (PEXG): Patients receive cisplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and docetaxel on
           days 1 and 15, and capecitabine on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
           6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (PGDX): Patients receive cisplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and epirubicin
           hydrochloride on days 1and 15, and capecitabine on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may then undergo surgery if the tumor becomes resectable.
