           2 gm/day) plus low dose aspirin (ASA 81 mg/day)compared to ASA alone on periodontitis
           over three months. Our hypothesis is that DHA plus ASA will improve periodontitis as
           measured by objective periodontal exam, including decreased pocket depth (mm), gingival
           index (0-3), plaque index (0-3) and bleeding on probing (yes/no) compared to ASA alone.

        2. Assess the effect of DHA and ASA exposure on markers of local inflammation, including
           gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) CRP, IL-1 beta and IL-6 three months after exposure to
           DHA plus ASA compared to ASA alone.

        3. Evaluate potential mechanisms through changes in the periodontal microbial flora which
           may occur as a result of exposure to DHA and ASA compared to ASA alone. Our hypothesis
           is that there will be a substantial post therapy change in the microbial flora of dental
           plaques, favoring bacteria associated with a lower systemic inflammatory state.

        4. Assess the effect of DHA and ASA exposure on markers of systemic inflammation, including
           serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular adhesion molecule
           (VCAM) compared to ASA. Our hypothesis is that there will be a decrease in serum CRP,
           IL-6 and VCAM three months after exposure to DHA plus ASA compared to ASA alone.

        5. Assess the effect of DHA and ASA exposure on markers of systemic bone turnover,
           including urine N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) compared to ASA. Our hypothesis is that
           there will be a decrease in urine NTx three months after exposure to DHA plus ASA
           compared to ASA alone.
