      patients. Primary symptoms of cancer cachexia comprise of progressive loss in weight and
      exhaustion of host skeletal muscle tissue as well as adipose tissue reserves.

      Cancer cachexia is defined as a multifactorial syndrome, characterized by anorexia as well as
      diminished body weight, loss of skeletal muscle, and atrophy of adipose tissue (Fearon et
      al., 2011). Specifically, weight loss of more than 5% over 6 months span in previously
      healthy individuals or more than 2% in subjects with depletion of current body weight (BMI
      less than 20 kg/m2) or in individuals with reduced appendicular muscle index (males less than
      7.26 kg/m2 and females less than 5.45 kg/m2) constitute the diagnosis of cancer cachexia.

      Among potential mechanisms involved in the development of cachexia, the primary initial
      process is probably the systemic inflammatory response followed by increased production of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α. Multiple biological activities of TNF-α were found
      in numerous physiological states, including the regulation of cell differentiation,
      proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism .
