        -  Compare the efficacy of concurrent radiotherapy with fluorouracil and hydroxyurea with
           or without paclitaxel in terms of survival without dysphagia in patients with inoperable
           stage II or III epidermoid carcinoma of the esophagus.

        -  Compare the overall survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of life in this
           patient population treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to weight loss (less than 10% vs at least 10%) and inoperability criteria
      (nonresectable vs due to anatomical terrain). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously, oral hydroxyurea, and concurrent
           radiotherapy daily on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fluorouracil, hydroxyurea and radiotherapy as in arm I.
           Patients also receive paclitaxel IV on day 1.

      Treatment continues every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with possible resectable disease undergo surgical resection at 4-6 weeks following
      the last course of chemoradiotherapy. Patients with continued unresectable disease receive 2
      additional courses of chemoradiotherapy as above within 8-17 days following the last course
      of chemoradiotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, monthly during therapy, every 2 months for 6 months,
      every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every
      6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.
