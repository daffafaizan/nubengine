      I. To observe the response rate of ameloblastoma to dabrafenib and trametinib at 6 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility and safety in this patient population. II. Response will be assessed
      pathologically. III. Two main histologic assays for treatment response will be used: tumor
      necrosis and phosphorylated-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK),
      phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Ki-67 levels as measured by
      immunohistochemistry.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) every 12 hours and trametinib 2 mg
      daily PO for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      whose disease is judged to be not amenable to resection will continue dabrafenib and
      trametinib indefinitely as long as there has not been tumor progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.
