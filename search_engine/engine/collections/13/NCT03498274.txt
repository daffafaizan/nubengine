      profound hearing impaired subjects. The basic benefit of amplification should be present with
      any method that the trained professional fitting the instruments uses. The goal of this study
      is to compare two fitting methods and determine whether the end user perceives more benefit
      from one fitting method over the other. The objective benefit is expected to be the same;
      however, the subjective benefit may be different due to a possible psychological effect from
      more effort or time spent by the trained professional.

      Bernafon will conduct this clinical investigation to test current hearing instruments fitted
      with the standard procedure and a self-directed procedure. Safety and performance validation
      of the new self-directed fitting software is needed before release to the market.

      The reason for this study is to evaluate a currently marketed, CE certified, hearing aid and
      determine whether different fitting methods provide the same perceived benefit. Additionally,
      this study will validate the safety of the fitting procedure as well as collect post market
      safety information about the devices themselves. The goal is to evaluate the audiological
      performance objectively as well as the subjective benefit. Furthermore, it is important to
      identify unexpected, unwanted behavior from the fitting software and the devices.
