      therapeutic efficiency limitation, the searching for the protective intervention for this
      condition is required. Based on the previous findings that the combined extract of Z. mays
      (purple color) and P. amaryllifolius based-drink (MP1) could attenuate memory impairment in
      animal model of menopause, the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of MP1
      functional drink on working memory, psychological fitness, possible underlying mechanism and
      the consumption safety in menopausal volunteers.
