    
      This is a controlled, randomised, open-label, 3-arm parallel single centre confinement study
      to investigate exposure to selected smoke constituents in smokers switching from CC to SMAR
      for 5 days.

      112 eligible subjects will be randomised to the 3 study arms: SMAR, conventional cigarettes
      (CC) and smoking cessation (SC) in a 2:1:1 ratio.

      Following the screening visit (within 4 weeks prior to the day of admission), the study will
      be run over an 8-day period in a confined environment, consisting of the admission day (D-2),
      a 2-day baseline period (D-1 and D0), and a 5-day exposure period (D1 to D5). Subjects will
      be discharged in the morning of D6. From the discharge of the subject, a 7-day safety
      follow-up period will be carried out (until D13).
