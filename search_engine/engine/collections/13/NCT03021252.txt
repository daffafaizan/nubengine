      degrees of oropharyngeal dysphagia (25-85% of patients) and respiratory muscle dysfunction
      associated with an increase in medical complications such as bronchoaspiration, malnutrition
      and death. Dysphagia is present in a significant proportion of patients admitted to
      Rehabilitation (up to 85% depending on series) in stroke. Standard swallow therapy consists
      of educational intervention aimed to improve self-management of dysphagia and protect the
      airway, oral exercises to improve lingual praxis, and compensatory techniques based on
      videofluoroscopic findings. Recent studies suggest that IEMT can improve swallowing efficacy
      and reduce eventual bronchoaspiration events.

      Nutritional status appears in 9-67% of patients with acute and subacute stroke and has an
      impact on functional outcomes and provides information about the risk of hospitalization and
      death. Stroke patients are at risk of developing malnutrition because of neurologic
      impairments related to feeding (chewing, deglutition and self-feeding) that can result in a
      poor food intake. To date, there is only few studies on prevalence and influence of
      malnutrition in stroke.
