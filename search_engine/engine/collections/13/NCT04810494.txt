      anesthesia.[1] In the absence of prophylaxis, it can occur in greater than one third of the
      patients undergoing surgery, and the incidence is even higher in patients with predisposing
      risk factors.[2] Surgical procedures that have been shown to be associated with a high
      incidence of PONV include breast, gynecologic, abdominal, and thyroid surgeries.[3-5]
      Although PONV usually resolves with treatment, its occurrence can increase postoperative
      morbidity, increase hospital cost, and prolong hospital length of stay.[1-6]Despite numerous
      available prophylactic treatments and proposed strategies, the incidence of PONV continue to
      be high given its complex pathogenesis.[1]

      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and its intravenous administration has been used as an
      adjuvant for the treatment of postoperative pain.[7] Intranasal lidocaine has also been used
      for the treatment of pain, specifically migraine, with significant relief of nausea.[8] The
      theoretical basis for this effect of intranasal lidocaine on migraine relief is reported to
      be due to its action on the sodium receptors within the sphenopalatine ganglion.[9] Although
      there is no reported association between PONV and migraines, injecting lidocaine within the
      sphenopalatine ganglion has proven to be effective in reducing PONV in patients undergoing
      endoscopic sinus surgery.[10]

      Due to the complex mechanism of PONV, proven benefits of lidocaine on pain and possibly
      nausea, and previously shown benefit of sphenopalatine block in reducing PONV, we hypothesize
      that intranasal lidocaine could provide effective prophylaxis for PONV.
