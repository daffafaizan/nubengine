        -  To establish a panel of hypermethylation assays for minimal disseminated disease
           analysis in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS).

        -  To apply the hypermethylation assays to a series of bone marrow specimens from RMS
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor, bone marrow, and peripheral blood samples are analyzed for DNA
      hypermethylation by PCR-based assays and microarray assays. Results are then compared with
      each patient's clinical and pathological characteristics, and outcomes. Patterns of locus
      hypermethylation in tumor and paired bone marrow samples are also compared.
