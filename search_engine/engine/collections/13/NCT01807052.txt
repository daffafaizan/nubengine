      OBSERVATIONAL STUDY MODEL: Case-only

      TIME PERSPECTIVE: Retrospective

      BIOSPECIMEN RETENTION: Samples without DNA

      BIOSPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Tissue samples obtained from Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN)

      STUDY POPULATION DESCRIPTION: Patients enrolled on P9754 and AOST0121 clinical trials

      SAMPLING METHOD: Non-probability sample

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there is differential expression of tumor factor (TF) among patients with
      osteosarcoma.

      II. To determine if there is an association between overall survival and disease free
      survival and the extent of TF expression.

      III. To determine if TF expression correlates with presence of gross metastatic disease at
      presentation, and development of subsequent metastases.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue samples are analyzed for tumor factor expression levels by immunohistochemistry.
