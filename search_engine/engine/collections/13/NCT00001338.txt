    
      This is a prospective, randomized Phase III trial of FLAC chemotherapy with GM-CSF versus
      PIXY321 in advanced breast cancer. The primary endpoints of this study will be the duration
      of thrombocytopenia and the time to recovery of platelets to 50,000/microliters. Other
      clinical endpoints will include the depth and duration of leukopenia, neutropenia, and
      anemia, the platelet and RBC transfusion requirements, and the number of documented instances
      of sepsis and hospitalizations for fever and neutropenia.

      Laboratory correlates will include the detailed evaluation of the effects on circulating
      hematopoietic progenitor cells by GM-CSF and PIXY321 and the potential effects these agents
      have on the bone marrow micro-environment.

      After 5 cycles of FLAC with GM-CSF versus PIXY321, patients will be treated with 5 cycles of
      96 hour infusional taxol. The goal of this part of the study will be to assess the toxicity
      and feasibility of administering infusional taxol following dose-intensive FLAC chemotherapy.
