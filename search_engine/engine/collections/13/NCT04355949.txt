      the optimum dose (30 and 60mg) dapoxetine for 4 separate times with no response.

      Serum vitamin D, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels will be assessed in all subjects included
      in the study. Venous blood samples will be drawn and kept into EDTA bottles in the morning
      between 8 and 10 a.m. after an overnight fast of about 10-14 hr.
