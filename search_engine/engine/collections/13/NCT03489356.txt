      skin cancer is on the rise. Individuals can decrease their risk of skin cancer by engaging in
      protective behaviors such as limiting intentional and unintentional UV exposure, and wearing
      broad-spectrum sunscreens and protective clothing. Despite knowing the risks and receiving
      dermatological care, many patients with and without a history of skin cancer frequently
      forget to use UV protection or fail to use it in an optimal manner to reduce their UV risk.
      To address these concerns, Mallett and colleagues developed a 3-minute brief ABC intervention
      - Addressing Behavior Change. The ABC intervention is designed to be delivered by
      dermatologists in the context of a routine office visit involving a skin examination.
      Previous work by Mallett and colleagues showed dermatologists were highly motivated to
      deliver the intervention, quickly learned the requisite skills, delivered the intervention
      with fidelity, and showed minimal decay in knowledge, motivation, and skills over a 6-month
      period. This study builds on a previous study by conducting an examination of the efficacy of
      the ABC intervention on patients' motivations and behaviors utilizing a prospective
      longitudinal design.
