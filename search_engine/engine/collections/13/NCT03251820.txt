    
      Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES), also known as continuous spikes and waves
      during slow sleep (CSWS), is an age related, self - limiting disorder characterized by:

        1. epilepsy with different seizure types,

        2. neuropsychological regression, and

        3. typical EEG pattern of continuous epileptiform activity during non-rapid eye movement
           sleep (NREM).

      During wakefulness, the EEG shows focal/multifocal spikes that increase in frequency during
      the acute stage. During sleep, ESES appears and is characterized by (1) marked potentiation
      of epileptiform discharges during non-REM sleep, leading to (2) a (near)-continuous,
      bilateral, or occasionally lateralized slow spikes and waves, (3) and these spikes and waves
      occur "during a significant proportion" of the non-REM sleep with a threshold ranging from
      25% to 85%

      The exact incidence of CSWS is not known. In pediatric neurology clinics, a reported
      frequency of 0.2% of childhood epilepsies most probably underestimates the incidence of CSWS.

      CSWS is a devastating syndrome, which requires prompt treatment, the efficacy of which is
      checked with regular intervals, e.g. three or six months. Although epilepsy resolves with
      time in most cases, many children are left with significant cognitive or language impairment.
      Longer duration of ESES appears to be the major predictor of poor outcome.

      So, early recognition and effective therapy are necessary to improve long-term prognosis in
      this condition.

      The goal of treatment is not only to control clinical seizures but also to improve
      neuropsychological functions and prevent potential cognitive deterioration. There was no
      agreement on best treatment, but potential candidates included high-dose benzodiazepines,
      valproate, levetiracetam, and corticosteroids.
