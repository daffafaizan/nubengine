      not fully established up to now in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.

      Prophylactic bilateral central lymph node dissection can give a important clinical
      information about the status of lymph nodes, and possibly guide a further adjuvant treatment.
      However, it causes high postoperative morbidity, including hypocalcemia and hoarseness. In
      this respect, some advocate no central lymph node dissection in prophylactic settings.

      Thus, we aimed to prove the efficacy of prophylactic ipsilateral central lymph node
      dissection in thyroid papillary microcarcinoma, compared to the bilateral dissection and no
      dissection.

      Type of Study design: Prospective randomized, controlled double-blinded (to subjects and
      observers) study.

      Group I: Limited/ipsilateral central lymph node dissection (UniCND) Group II:
      Comprehensive/bilateral central lymph node dissection (BiCND) Group III: No central lymph
      node dissection (NoCND)

      Outcomes: vocal cord palsy, hypocalcemia, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis
