      satisfaction of entry criteria and screening procedures, all subjects will receive RETIN-A
      MICRO PUMP 0.04% and a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide wash (OTC) for the entire 12-week treatment
      period. Subjects will be randomized to either both morning treatments (test) or to the
      morning/evening treatment (active control). Subjects will be assessed at baseline, at week 3,
      week 6 and again at the end of therapy, week 12 for number and type of individual lesions and
      safety. At selected sites, photographs will be taken at the same time points. At Week 12
      subjects will be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment of Acne Severity. The
      investigator will conduct all of the lesion counts, global assessments and safety
      assessments.
