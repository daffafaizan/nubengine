      active chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of melanoma. The rationale for combining
      taxanes and platinum agents is that both have activity in melanoma; in vitro and clinical
      data suggest synergy between these drugs when used in combination in a wide variety of
      tumors, including melanoma; and the toxicity profiles of these agents do not overlap.
      Temozolomide (a drug approved for the treatment of melanoma) has been combined with other
      drugs, including taxanes and platinums, in previous clinical trials for melanoma.
      Specifically, a previous phase I study of the combination of temozolomide, paclitaxel, and
      carboplatin in melanoma showed objective responses. The efficacy of this combination is now
      being studied in this phase II trial.
