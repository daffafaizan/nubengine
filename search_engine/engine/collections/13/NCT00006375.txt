      solid tumors. II. Determine the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these
      patients. III. Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral LY293111 twice daily.
      Treatment continues for a maximum of 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LY293111 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated
      at the MTD. Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
