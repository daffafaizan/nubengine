      loading dose regimen, in a weekly administration schedule, during the aplastic phase
      following induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, and during the initial
      phase of allogeneic stem-cell transplant, which are both high risk periods as far as severe
      fungal infections development is concerned.
