      18F-FDG PET/CT scan for the purpose of RT or surgical planning. In addition to that, an
      18F-EF5 PET/CT scan will be performed on a separate day. The patients receive intravenous
      injection of 250-350 MBq of [18F]EF5. After that, a venous blood sample will be obtained for
      measurement of plasma radioactivity. A low-dose CT (helical) will be performed for
      attenuation correction and anatomical reference. After that, a PET scan will be performed
      (starting at 3 h after injection). The second 18F-EF5 scan will be performed in a similar way
      4-7 days after the first scan. A representative histologic sample of primary tumor is
      pre-condition for study and an effort is made to store part of fresh histologic material in
      liquid nitrogen for later use in immunohistochemical analysis.

      Patients are scheduled to undergo preoperative or definitive chemoradiotherapy using current
      clinical standards after completion of the current protocol. Follow-up information
      (event-free survival and overall survival) will be gathered.
