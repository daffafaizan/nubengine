        1. To evaluate, in current smokers, the efficacy of a single dose of study medication given
           an hour prior to smoking-related cue exposure (post-reactivation treatment) on
           psychophysiological response to smoking cues one week later.

        2. To evaluate, during the smoking cessation process, the clinical effect of study
           medication in an ensuing series of 6 post-reactivation treatments on psychophysiologic
           response to smoking cues measured one week after the last post-reactivation treatment.

        3. To evaluate whether medication effect on psychophysiologic response during a single
           memory reactivation session with script-driven imagery will predict clinical response to
           an ensuing series of 6 post-reactivation treatments with script-driven imagery and study
           medication.

        4. . To assess whether a single post-reactivation treatment or series of six
           post-reactivation treatments is associated with reduction in self-reported craving for
           cigarettes as assessed with the Tiffany QSU.

        5. To assess whether a series of six post-reactivation treatments is associated with
           reduction in smoking as assessed with self-report of cigarettes smoked per day and
           expired air Carbon monoxide.

      To achieve these aims, we will conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      in a convenience sample of 50 smokers.
