      under ultrasound guidance in anesthetized women immediately following surgical abortion and
      from controls, all of whom are undergoing a separate planned obstetric/gynecologic surgery.
      Tissue studies will be performed on these biopsy samples to examine oxytocin receptor
      expression and function.
