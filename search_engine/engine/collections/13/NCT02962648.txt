      isomaltoside/ferric derisomaltose may allow flexibility in terms of high and rapid dosing. Up
      to now, most clinical trials with intravenous (IV) iron treatment were of 4-12 weeks in
      duration; longer trials are warranted to follow-up on long-term safety.

      The aim of the trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV iron isomaltoside/ferric
      derisomaltose re-dosing in subjects who were previously treated with iron isomaltoside/ferric
      derisomaltose in lead-in trials.

      This was a 6-months extension trial lasting 26 weeks. Eligible subjects attended 5 visits:
      screening, baseline (subjects treated with a single IV dose of 1000 mg iron
      isomaltoside/ferric derisomaltose), and follow-up visits at week 2, 13, and 26 weeks after
      the IV dose, for safety and efficacy assessments.
