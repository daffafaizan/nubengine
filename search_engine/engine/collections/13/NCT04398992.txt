      from the tear of the aortic intima, separating the mediastinum and extending along the long
      axis of the aorta to form the true and false separation state of the aortic wall. Risk
      factors for aortic dissection included hypertension, cystic necrosis or degeneration of the
      middle aorta, hereditary connective tissue disease, congenital two-lobe active pulse valve,
      arteritis, aneurysm, atherosclerosis and iatrogenic injury, etc. The leading cause of aortic
      dissection is hypertension, and more than 75% of aortic dissection is associated with
      hypertension.Therefore, for hypertension patients to do a good job in the prevention and
      control of hypertension, pay attention to the regular use of antihypertensive drugs and
      monitoring blood pressure. In case of sudden chest and back lacerations, the patient should
      be immobilized in bed, contacted with an ambulance and sent to the hospital for emergency
      treatment, so as to avoid greater risks. The aim of this study is analyze clinical outcome of
      Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection.
