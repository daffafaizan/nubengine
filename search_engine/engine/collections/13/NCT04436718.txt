      significant morbidity and premature mortality. Administration of intravenous (IV) diuretics
      is largely guided by clinical judgment based on physical exam, net fluid measurement, changes
      in daily weights and chest x-ray findings. The key objective is to promote adequate diuresis
      while improving symptoms, without compromising renal function. Laboratory tests demonstrating
      hemo-concentration, increasing BUN, and increasing creatinine have been proposed as positive
      prognostic indicators in patients receiving IV diuretic therapy but these methods suffer from
      inadequate predictive value. Observational studies have identified worsening renal failure
      (WRF) in patients admitted for heart failure as an important clinical entity associated with
      worsening clinical outcomes.

      Point of care Ultrasound (POCUS) has the potential to fill an unmet need for monitoring
      patients recieving IV diuretic therapy. POCUS provides clinicians with immediate diagnostic
      information obtained and interpreted at bedside that can augment and enhance the physical
      examination. Numerous studies have examined POCUS assessment of pulmonary edema and
      measurement of the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) to estimate hemodynamic parameters for patients
      with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). No study to date has examined POCUS effect on
      clinical outcomes.
