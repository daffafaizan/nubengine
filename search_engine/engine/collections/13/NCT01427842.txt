    
      DEVINE will be a randomised controlled trial of a new vancomycin dosing regimen against a
      control.

      The control group regimen will receive the doses recommended by Therapeutic Guidelines -
      Antibiotics 2010. The intervention group will receive a dosing regimen that has been devised
      by modelling the antibiotic properties within the body over a large range of renal function
      and weight that will be more specific for the individual patient. They will receive this
      regimen for approximately 36-60 hours at which point they will have a vancomycin level blood
      test (a routine practice as part of their normal care). After this time the treating team
      will determine further dosing requirements.

      All patients will be randomised at commencement of vancomycin with consent being obtained for
      the trial prior to the first dose of vancomycin
