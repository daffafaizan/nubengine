      activation treatment for smoking (BATS) vs. standard smoking cessation treatment (ST). We
      will recruit 200 smokers with elevated depressive symptoms who will be randomized into one of
      two treatment groups. Treatment will be delivered in group format across both the BATS (n =
      100) and ST condition (n = 100). All participants will receive 8 weeks of transdermal
      nicotine patch in addition to their assigned treatment group. We intend to compare the BA
      treatment for smoking (BATS) to a standard smoking cessation intervention (ST)on abstinence
      and relapse outcomes. In addition we will examine to what extent depressive symptoms and
      reward sensitivity prior to quit date will mediate the effects of BATS on improved smoking
      cessation outcomes relative to ST.
