    
      The main objective of the trial is to prospectively evaluate the ability of a zirconium 89
      labelled trastuzumab PET, to predict, before initiation of the treatment, treatment failure
      to a new targeted drug: T-DM1.

      At the same time, the early FDG-PET/CT, performed after 1 course of T-DM1, will also
      evaluated for its ability to predict non response to TDM1.
