      gradually for years, regardless of the amount of supervised practice driving or age at
      licensure. Graduate Driver Licensing (GDL) and parental management are the only approaches to
      this problem with demonstrated effectiveness. The Checkpoints Program consists of persuasive
      messages and materials designed to increase adoption of the Checkpoints Parent-Teen Driving
      Agreement and increase parent limit setting on higher-risk driving privileges among novice
      teenage drivers. The current study builds on the results of several previous trials of the
      Checkpoints Program that have shown significant treatment group effects on parent limit
      setting, teen risky driving, and violations. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      efficacy of conducting an online adaptation of the Checkpoints Program through the American
      Automobile Association (AAA) clubs. The study will be conducted with parents whose teenage
      children are enrolled in AAA-affiliated driving schools. 800 families will be recruited
      through AAA Clubs, assigned to intervention or comparison groups, provided online access to
      Checkpoints or comparison materials, and assessed at baseline and after teen licensure.
