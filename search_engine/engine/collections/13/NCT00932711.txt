      events in patients with high-risk chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). But the
      majority of COPD patients belong to the low-risk category. We propose that a less intense
      educational intervention will have a similar beneficial effect in reducing hospital
      admissions and emergency department (ED) visits in this larger group of low-risk COPD
      patients.
