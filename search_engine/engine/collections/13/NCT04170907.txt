      of 10 puffs). Blood samples will be collected to measure nicotine 15 minutes before vaping
      and 2, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the last puff. Heart rate and blood pressure
      will be measured 15 minutes before and 2, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the last
      puff. Post-use withdrawal, craving, reward, and satisfaction will be assessed 10 minutes and
      1 and 3 hours after the last puff using the modified Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale
      (MNWS), the Tiffany Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (QSU), and the Positive and Negative
      Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaires. Respiratory symptoms will be assessed at baseline and
      5 minutes after the last puff. Ten minutes post-use, the direct effects of the assigned
      product (e.g. satisfying, calming, pleasant, vape another one right now) will also be
      assessed using visual analog scales.
