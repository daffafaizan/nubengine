        1. To validate the feasibility of PET-tracer EF5 in EOC imaging.

             -  Quantify the amount and exact locations of hypoxic tumors in EOC patients using
                herein developed protocol and tracers (18F-EF5 and 18F-FDG) in diagnostic and
                neoadjuvant settings.

             -  Measure the non-cancer related EF5 accumulation spots and establish the potential
                pitfalls in abdominal EF5 imaging

             -  Establish a method to verify hypoxic locations with 18F-EF5-PET/CT information
                during the operation.

             -  Develop and validate a model that predicts chemotherapy response based on
                functional imaging information.

        2. To reveal hypoxia related alterations in collected tissue samples (i.e. altered DNA
           damage repair, altered mitochondrial respiratory functioning, overexpression of hypoxia
           response elements etc)
