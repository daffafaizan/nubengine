        1. Develop an Enhanced ENDS Coaching (EEC) intervention to improve standard quitline
           treatment for dual users who contact the quitline for help quitting smoking and are
           using ENDS, and train tobacco cessation coaches to deliver the intervention.

        2. Phase 1 (n=10): Assess preliminary EEC acceptability and feasibility, and refine the
           intervention with 10 dual users. Hypothesis 1: ENDS users will rate the helpfulness and
           usability of EEC positively and will exhibit increased knowledge about ENDS and
           cessation aids.

        3. Phase 2 (n=100): Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of EEC compared to quitline
           treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized pilot study of 100 smokers who use ENDS and are
           seeking help with quitting smoking. Hypothesis 2a (engagement): EEC participants will
           complete as many or more coaching calls than TAU. Hypothesis 2b (acceptability,
           satisfaction; assessed via 3-month survey): EEC will have satisfaction at least as high
           as the TAU group and rate their quit plan development experience more positively.
           Hypothesis 2c (beliefs; assessed at 3-month survey): EEC participants will report more
           accurate knowledge and beliefs about ENDS, smoking, and FDA-approved cessation
           medications.
