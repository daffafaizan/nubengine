      the effect of adalimumab on QOL (as measured by Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease
      Questionnaire (SIBDQ)), the utilization of health care resources, and the costs of care for
      subjects with UC who were treated with adalimumab in the usual clinical practice setting. The
      secondary objectives were to further assess the effect of adalimumab on disease activity and
      to collect additional safety data in subjects with UC.
