      Alendronate (ALN) act as an antiosteolytic agent. The aim of the present study is to evaluate
      and compare the efficacy of 1% ALN and 1% MF gel as a local drug delivery system in adjunct
      to scaling and root planing (SRP) for the treatment of intrabony defects in patients with
      chronic periodontitis.

      Methods:

      The study had 3 groups comprising of ninety subjects, divided into three groups 1% MF with
      SRP, 1% ALN with SRP and placebo gel with SRP. Clinical parameters (plaque index (PI),
      modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment
      level (CAL) were recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months. Radiographic parameters intrabony
      defect depth (IBD) and defect depth reduction (DDR%) was calculated on standardized
      radiographs by using image analysis software at 6 and 9 months
