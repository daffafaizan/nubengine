      medicine and internal medicine in one of the centers participating to the study. Those
      patients with a primary PR will be considered as Index cases.

      In all participating centers, there will be a recruitment of index cases without family
      screening to form a series of cases that will validate the results obtained in family forms.

      The investigators will conduct genealogical trees of index cases to identify families, whose
      number of healthy individuals and those with relevant PR makes sense for a family genetic
      study, i.e. a genetically informative family.

      In all centers, relatives of included Index cases, agreeing to participate in this research,
      will be enrolled and followed.

      Nantes University Hospital is the only center to perform a cold test (for reasons of
      availability of the technique) but this test will be reserved for patients whose diagnosis of
      primary Raynaud's phenomenon would be doubtful. Exposed identified relatives, agreeing to
      participate in this research, will all be included and followed in their enrollment center.
