      motion. Although the effect of rehabilitation for motor recovery on stroke patients has been
      well established, the perceptual change during the movement recovery and its relationship
      with social participation still remain unclear.

      A total of 90 stroke patients will be recruited. Each patient will receive initial
      evaluation, first follow-up evaluation after four weeks and second follow-up evaluation after
      five months. The contents include basic clinical screen tests, perception tests, motor
      function test, daily living ability tests and social leisure participation questionnaires.

      The purposes of this study are: 1) to observe the change of the during the experiment and
      clarify the progression of perception deficit and 2) to understand the relationships among
      perception deficit and the other functional indicators and determine the impact of perception
      deficit on activities and participation in stroke patients.
