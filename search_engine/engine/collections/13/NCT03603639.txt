    
      Adult participants with epilepsy will be enrolled in this study. This study will consist of 2
      phases: Prerandomization and Randomization Phase.

      The Prerandomization Phase will consist of a Screening Period (up to 3 weeks), during which
      each participant's study eligibility will be determined and baseline assessments will be
      conducted. The Randomization Phase will consist of 3 Treatment Periods with a single dose in
      each period (placebo, E2730 40 mg, or E2730 120 mg), each separated by a 3-week washout
      interval for a total of approximately 6 weeks, and a Follow-up Period (3 weeks after the last
      dose of study drug).
