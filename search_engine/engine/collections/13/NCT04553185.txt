      abnormal deposition in the brain of aggregates called Lewy Bodies, packed with a protein
      called α-synuclein. The mechanisms why this protein accumulates in the brain of patients with
      PD, as well as its relationship with clinical symptoms, is unknown.

      Recently, an internal mechanism of drainage of waste proteins called glymphatic system has
      been identified and characterized. This system is silent during wakefulness and works during
      sleep. When it is active, a virtual space between the blood capillaries and cells of the
      brain called astrocytes opens and lets out waste products from the brain. This process is
      mediated by a protein of the astrocytes called Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Preclinical studies have
      shown that the function of this system could be critical for the clearance of β-amyloid, a
      protein linked with the development of Alzheimer's Disease. Studies in humans have shown that
      genetic variations some parts of the AQP4 gene, defined as single nucleotide polymorphisms,
      may increase the likelihood to develop an aggressive form of Alzheimer's Disease. However, no
      studies in humans have ever been performed in Parkinson's disease and α-synuclein.

      In this study, the investigators aim to elucidate whether genetic variations in the AQP4 gene
      contribute to variations in the clinical presentation and progression of sporadic and genetic
      forms of Parkinson's disease. To do so, the genetic profile of patients will be determined
      through a small venous blood sample collection. This will be coupled with clinical and sleep
      assessment.
