      aggressive lymphomas. Novel strategies that target this biology could markedly improve the
      outcome of these participants. To date no drugs that directly target Myc have been approved
      for cancer treatment. Recent results by Deng et al. (Blood. 2017 Jan 5. PMID: 27784673)
      described a highly synergistic regimen discovered in preclinical models, through combining
      TGR-1202, an investigational drug that inhibits PI3K delta, and carfilzomib, a drug approved
      by the FDA for multiple myeloma. Importantly, the combination of TGR-1202 and carfilzomib
      acts by potently silencing the translation of c-Myc and inducing apoptosis in many cell lines
      and primary lymphoma cells representing broad histological subtypes of lymphoma. These
      results suggest that TGR-1202 and carfilzomib may be highly effective in relapsed and
      refractory lymphoma where c-Myc plays a key pathological role.
