        -  To determine the efficacy of a preparative regimen of pentostatin and alemtuzumab plus
           related or unrelated allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in
           inducing durable donor lymphohematopoietic cell chimerism (defined as at least 50% donor
           cells in the peripheral blood) by 100 days after PBSCT (day +100) in subjects with
           high-risk malignancies who are at high risk for morbidity and mortality with
           conventional intensive pre-transplant conditioning regimens.

        -  To determine the safety of a preparative regimen of pentostatin and alemtuzumab plus
           related or unrelated allogeneic PBSCT, as measured by the non-relapse mortality at day
           +100 in the study subject population.
