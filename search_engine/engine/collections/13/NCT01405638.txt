      baseline to 6 months and (2) CRC screening rates as determined by colonoscopy report or fecal
      immunochemical test (FIT) result from the primary care provider at 6 months. Blood pressure
      will be assessed with an automated digital BP monitor based on American Heart Association
      guidelines.1 CRC screening will be assessed by self-report and verified with medical records
      and/or the actual colonoscopy or FIT report from participants' providers.
