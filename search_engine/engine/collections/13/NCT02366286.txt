    
      Specific Aim 1: We will determine whether exposures to HBV and HCV infections in African
      (Somalis, Kenyans, Liberians, and Ethiopians) and Southeast Asian (Hmong, Vietnamese,
      Laotian, and Cambodian) are associated with a single HBV/HCV genotype or few specific
      subtypes. In the following Sub-Aims we will:

        -  confirm the viral status of study subjects using serological and DNA tests including
           HBsAg, HBcAb, anti-HCV, HBV DNA and HCV RNA.

        -  perform nucleic acid testing to identify the HBV and HCV genotypes/sub-genotypes for
           each patient

        -  examine the presence of either common or unique HBV and HCV viral mutations

      Specific Aim 2: We will determine whether African (Somalis, Kenyans, Liberians, and
      Ethiopians) and Southeast Asian (Hmong, Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian) exposed to HBV or
      HCV have unique TLR or Treg immune signatures as compared to control subjects free from both
      HBV and HCV infections. In the following Sub-Aims we will:

        -  measure the expression levels of toll-like receptors (in monocytes) of the host innate
           immune response to assess whether the expression of TLR differs between those exposed to
           HBV vs HCV

        -  measure the circulating Tregs of the host adaptive immune response to determine whether
           the abundance of Treg differs between those exposed to HBV vs HCV Specific Aim 3: To
           determine whether genetic variation of IL28B (assessed by single nucleotide
           polymorphisms, rs12979860 and others) is associated with HCV treatment outcome in
           Somalis.

        -  We will perform SNP analysis of IL28B in lymphocyte DNA in 60 HCV cases, 60 HBV and HCV
           cases and 60 healthy controls (this group and additional 60 HBV cases alone will provide
           baseline SNP frequencies in the Somali population), all the 240 subjects of the study
           will be tested for this SNP

        -  We will measure treatment outcome using virological response by comparing pre-treatment
           viral load and post-treatment viral load in HCV case

      Aim 4: To recruit a cohort of African (Somalis, Kenyans, Liberians, and Ethiopians) and
      Southeast Asian (Hmong, Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian)immigrants for screening for
      chronic HBV infection and education on prevention and treatment of hepatitis B. We will
      specifically:

        -  Establish a community-based program to recruit African and Southeast Asian individuals
           in Minnesota for screening for hepatitis B and hepatitis C

        -  Establish partnerships with African and Southeast Asian community organizations and
           physicians to enhance screening and education about prevention and treatment of
           hepatitis B, hepatitis C and its sequelae, including HCC.
