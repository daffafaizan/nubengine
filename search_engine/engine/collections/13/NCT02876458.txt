      All eligible patients with SCD will be included and randomized by the Emergency Medical
      Service (EMS) to one of the 2 following arms: immediate CA vs delayed CA. Patients randomized
      in the immediate CA group will be admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory.
      Patients randomized in the delayed CA will be admitted to the intensive care unit and a CA
      will be planned 48 to 96 hours after admission. Investigators can perform the CA in the
      delayed group < 48 hours if the following events appear:

        -  ST segment elevation or new left bundle branch block on the ECG

        -  Shock unresponsive to inotropes

        -  "Electrical storm" (repeated Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)/Ventricular Fibrillation (VF))

        -  Segmental hypokinesia or akinesia on an echocardiogram

      Echocardiography and assessment of neurological status are done at discharge form the
      Intensive Care Unit, at hospital discharge and during the follow-up visits (90 and 180 days).
