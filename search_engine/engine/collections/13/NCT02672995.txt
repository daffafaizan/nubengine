    
      For each group (two groups according to tumor size), the design proceeds with cohorts of
      three patients, with the first cohort treated at a starting dose. If none of the three
      patients in a cohort experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the next cohort with three
      patients will be treated at the next higher dose level. If one of the first three patients
      experiences a dose-limiting toxicity, the next cohort will be treated at the same dose level.
      The dose escalation continues until at least two patients among a cohort of three to six
      patients experience DLTs and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be the dose level just
      below. If the highest planned dose was achieved without two patients experiencing DLTs, the
      MTD will be that dose level.

      The DLT is defined as grade 4 or above toxicities according to the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 within 4 months after stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS):

      Grade 4 central nervous system necrosis (life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention
      indicated) Grade 4 sensory or motor neuropathy (life-threatening consequences; urgent
      intervention indicated) Grade 4 hemorrhage (life-threatening consequences; urgent
      intervention indicated) or Grade 4 thromboembolic event (life-threatening consequences such
      as pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular event, arterial insufficiency; hemodynamic or
      neurologic instability; urgent intervention indicated) Grade 4 hypertension (life-threatening
      consequences such as malignant hypertension, transient or permanent neurologic deficit,
      hypertensive crisis; urgent intervention indicated)

      Study treatment:

      Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery:

      Group 1: tumors 1.5~2.5 cm in diameter Dose level 1: 21 Gy in 3 fractions Dose level 2: 24 Gy
      in 3 fractions Dose level 3: 27 Gy in 3 fractions Group 2: tumors 2.5~3.5 cm in diameter Dose
      level 1: 18 Gy in 3 fractions Dose level 2: 21 Gy in 3 fractions Dose level 3: 24 Gy in 3
      fractions Three fractions will be given in one week with at least 1 day break.

      Concurrent bevacizumab:

      Bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg will be given one day before the first fraction of radiosurgery and 2
      weeks after the first dose of bevacizumab.
