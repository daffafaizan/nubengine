    
      Aim of this study is to develop a partial least squares regression model incorporating
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL) measurements as well
      as visual field testing to represent a glaucoma expert opinion on the stage of glaucoma.

      In addition, microperimetry will be compared to conventional perimetry and reproducibility
      will be assessed.
