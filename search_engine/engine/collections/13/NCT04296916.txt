      glaucoma in HM is a challenge. More and more viewpoints had been raised that HM eyes with
      optic disc head damage or/and visual field (VF) defects should been classified as glaucoma
      suspects.

      IOP is the only modifiable parameter in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. However, the
      decision to begin treatment to lower IOP in the glaucoma suspect patient is complex,
      especially for glaucoma suspects with HM. There are lack of guideline and consensus of
      treatment choices. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of medically IOP
      lowering on the progression of glaucoma suspects with HM.
