    
      This is a 6-week, multiple-dose, dose escalation study of SPR001 for the treatment of adults
      with classic CAH. After screening, eligible patients will be enrolled into a 6-week treatment
      period followed by a 4-week washout/safety follow-up period.

      It is initially planned that up to approximately 18 patients in 2 dose cohorts will be
      enrolled. Additional patients or dose groups may be considered based upon specific safety,
      PK/PD, and/or efficacy findings, or if an active dose has not yet been reached.

      SPR001 will be administered as an oral daily dose. Patients will undergo titration of SPR001
      through three escalating dosage strengths at 2-week intervals. Patients will have overnight
      PK/PD assessments performed at baseline, which include an pre-dose overnight assessment and a
      post-dose overnight assessment for PK/PD following administration of the first dose. At the
      end of each 2-week dosing period, patients will return for single overnight visits for
      steady-state PK/PD assessments.

      A follow-up outpatient visit will occur 30 days after their last dose.
