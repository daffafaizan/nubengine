      hundred patients were involved in this study. All these patients were suffered from radicular
      leg pain with MRI features of multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis and were treated by
      conservative treatment of medical treatment and physiotherapy without benefit for (6) months.
      Those patients were divided into two groups; Group A, (50) Microdecompression, and Group B,
      (50) patients who were treated by open wide laminectomy and posterior stabilization. Both
      groups of patients were followed up with ODI (Oswestry disability index) and VAS (Visual
      analogue score) for the back and leg pain for one year.

      Results: The results showed that both groups got significant improvement regarding Oswestry
      disability index. Regarding back pain, there was a significant improvement in both groups
      with better results in-group A due minimal tissues injury as the advantage of minimal
      invasive technique. In both groups, there were marked improvement of radicular leg pain
      postoperatively.

      Conclusions: Both Microdecompression and wide open laminectomy with posterior stabilization
      were effective in treatment of multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis with superior results of
      Microdecompression regarding less back pain postoperatively with less blood loss and soft
      tissue dissection.
