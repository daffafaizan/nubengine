      delicate balance of immunosuppression to avoid either infection (overimmunosuppression), or
      rejection (under-immunosuppression). Conventional clinical parameters are not adequate
      enough. ImmuKnow (Cylex Inc, Columbia, MD) is an FDA-cleared assay for the detection of cell
      mediated immune response in populations undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for organ
      transplant. There have been limited retrospective studies discussing the effectiveness of the
      ImmuKnow assay. There is no prospective head-to-head trial showing the benefits of periodic
      ImmuKnow testing.

      Objective: To demonstrate whether there are any outcome benefits of a serial ImmuKnow assays
      in de novo renal transplant recipients Patients and Methods: A prospective, randomized,
      pilot, controlled 12-month study to compare the outcomes of 2 cohorts of de novo renal
      transplant patients will be conducted. The outcomes that will be investigated include a
      combined infection rate (primary end-point), separate infection rates and episodes, acute
      rejection rate and episodes, quality of life, graft and patient survivals (all secondary
      end-points). Biopsy of the transplanted kidney is used to confirm rejection whenever
      possible. Among the study cohort, the patients' immunosuppressants will be adjusted according
      to the results of a serial ImmuKnow assay besides using conventional clinical parameters;
      whereas among the control cohort the patients' immunosuppressants will be adjusted according
      to conventional clinical parameters.

      Expected Results: At the end of this study we will be able to learn whether the study cohort
      patients have less infection, less acute rejection, better allograft function, better quality
      of life, and better graft or patient survivals.
