    
      The objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of bilastine in children (aged
      2 to <12 years) with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (seasonal allergic rhinitis [SAR] and/or
      perennial allergic rhinitis [PAR]) or chronic urticaria (CU) in order to ascertain that the
      systemic exposure attained with a dose of 10 mg/QD or lower is comparable to that achieved in
      adults and adolescents administered with a dose of 20 mg/QD.

      Additional objectives are to describe the safety and tolerability of a repeated
      administration of bilastine in children with AR or CU.
