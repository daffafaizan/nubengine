      recurrence and improves progression free survival (PFS) in patients with post-operative
      intermediate and high risk factors following Wertheim's hysterectomy. However, adjuvant
      external beam radiotherapy and vaginal cuff brachytherapy increase the risk of small bowel
      toxicity such that patients undergoing external beam pelvic radiotherapy and vaginal cuff
      brachytherapy may have 15-18% incidence of late RTOG ≥ grade II small bowel toxicity. Phase
      II studies using new techniques like Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) have reported up
      to 50% reduction in small bowel doses with up to 30% reduction in ≥ grade II acute toxicity.
      However, there is no randomized data demonstrating the benefit of highly specific and
      conformal techniques like image guided (IG)-IMRT in reducing radiation induced small bowel
      toxicity in patients with cervical cancers. The present study is being proposed to test if
      use of IG-IMRT with Tomotherapy is associated with reduced small bowel late toxicity
