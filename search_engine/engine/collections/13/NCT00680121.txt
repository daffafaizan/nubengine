    
      B1AS is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of the effectiveness of
      Benfotiamine at reducing abusive drinking patterns in individuals with recent alcohol
      problems. Subjects consume 4 tablets of Benfotiamine (600 mg) or placebo daily for 6 months.
      Monthly follow-ups track alcohol use and alcohol-related problems over the 6 months. Blood
      tests are also conducted to determine the frequency of an inherited abnormality in thiamine
      processing that may be related to the risk of developing alcoholism.
