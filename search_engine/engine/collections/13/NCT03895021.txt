    
      Stepping On is an evidence-based falls prevention program for community-dwelling persons 65+.
      It uses principles of self-efficacy in 2-hour sessions held once a week for 7 weeks + one
      home visit to review principles learned in class and one booster class after 3 months.

      The program, developed and researched in Australia, was found to reduce falls by 30%. It was
      brought to the U.S. in 2006 by the Kenosha County Aging Division in collaboration with Dr.
      Jane Mahoney, U.W. Madison and other Wisconsin partners using foundation and state funding.
      Funding from the CDC provided the opportunity to adapt the program for widespread
      dissemination in the United States. In addition preliminary work was done on translating and
      culturally adapting Stepping On for the Latino community. The adapted program, known as
      Pisando, was offered as a pilot class at the United Community Center in Milwaukee in 2012.
      Further revisions were made to the program based on the experience at the pilot classes and
      advice from the advisory board, but questions remained about some key areas of workshop
      format.
