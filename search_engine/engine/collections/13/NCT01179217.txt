      To evaluate the efficacy of oral L-glutamine as a therapy for sickle cell anemia and sickle
      ß0-thalassemia as evaluated by the number of occurrences of sickle cell crises.

      Secondary objectives:

      To assess the effect of oral L-glutamine on: (a) frequency of hospitalizations for sickle
      cell pain; (b) frequency of emergency room/medical facility visits for sickle cell pain; and
      (c) hematological parameters (hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte count); and to assess
      the safety of L-glutamine as a therapy for sickle cell anemia as evaluated by adverse events,
      laboratory parameters, and vital signs.

      Methodology:

      This was a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      study in patients with sickle cell anemia and sickle ß0-thalassemia who were at least 5 years
      old. Informed consent was obtained up to four weeks prior to Week 0 (Baseline). Screening
      procedures were performed anytime between the date of consent and Week 0, as long as all
      eligibility criteria had been confirmed prior to Week 0. At Week 0, patients were randomized
      (to L-glutamine or placebo) and underwent 48 weeks of treatment (orally BID), with dose
      calculated according to patient weight. Patient clinic visits occurred every 4 weeks, and
      phone calls took place between visits to monitor compliance. After 48 weeks of treatment, the
      dose was tapered to 0 within 3 weeks. A final evaluation visit occurred 2 weeks after last
      dose for a total of 53 weeks on study.
