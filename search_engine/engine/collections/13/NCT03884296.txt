      volunteers, 2-49 years of age. Volunteers were patients undergoing tonsillectomy for
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or other non-infectious indication as part of
      their routine medical care.

      The investigator intends to collect blood and lymphoid tissues routinely discarded during
      surgery from adults and children after routine seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccination
      (LAIV) to determine how immune memory develops at the actual site of infection, and how
      immunization may alter this process.

      The first research study visit will take place approximately 3-14 days prior to the scheduled
      date of tonsillectomy surgery. During this visit, 20 mL blood sample will be obtained and
      participants will receive FluMist (intranasal, quadrivalent, live-attenuated influenza
      vaccine). This is one of the routinely available and recommended vaccines for the age groups
      included in this study.

      The second study visit will take place on the same day of the scheduled surgery for the
      tonsillectomy. Another blood sample (maximum volume of 20 mL) will be collected along with
      the discarded tonsillar tissue. Blood and tissues will be sent to the lab.
