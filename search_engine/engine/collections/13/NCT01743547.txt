      program among gynecologic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The investigators concluded
      that it is not feasible due to the lack of participation and difficulty in recruiting
      patients. Of 25 consented patients, 16 agreed to participate in the control arm, 9 agreed to
      participate in the Yoga classes. Three (3) of those 9 changed their minds and withdrew
      consent. Of the 6 remaining patients, only 3 attended at least 1 of the 8 classes.
