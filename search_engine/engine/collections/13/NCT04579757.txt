    
      This open-label, phase Ib/II study of surufatinib in combination with tislelizumab will
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      The study consists of 2 parts - dose finding (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).

      Part 1 will be conducted to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of surufatinib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have progressed on, or are intolerant to standard
      therapies.

      Part 2 will be an open-label, multi-cohort design to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of
      surufatinib in combination with tislelizumab in patients with specific types of advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. Patients will receive the RP2D determined in part 1 of this study.
