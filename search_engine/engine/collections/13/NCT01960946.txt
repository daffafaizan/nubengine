      clinical heart failure. In this study, we seek to identify individuals at risk for the
      development of heart failure based on clinical hypertension and elevated Gal-3
      concentrations. Participants will be randomized to receive a Gal-3 inhibitor (MCP) or
      placebo. The primary outcome will be the effect on collagen metabolism, and secondary
      outcomes include echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function, and
      non-invasive measures of vascular function.
