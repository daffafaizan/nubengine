      prevalence has been reported as 21-33%. Currently, there are no universal criteria for the
      diagnosis, or treatment strategies or approaches for PE. Lack of observational studies
      directed to PE makes comprehension of this sexual dysfunction difficult. The common point for
      definition of PE is a short duration between penetration and ejaculation, little or no
      control on voluntary control of ejaculation, and annoying character and negative effect of
      this condition on the individual. There are various treatment methods since ejaculation
      physiology and neuroanatomy is not yet clearly demonstrated. According to neurobiological
      hypothesis of Waldinger, a dysfunction in the serotonin pathway of the central system such as
      serotonin-2C hyposensitivity and/or serotonin-1A receptor hypersensitivity is a possible
      cause of lifelong PE. These experimental animal models showed that serotonergic activity at
      hypothalamic level inhibited ejaculation reflex. Based on this physiological effect,
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and serotonin agonists increase intravaginal
      ejaculation latency time (IELT). A number of studies showed that exercise increased the
      functional effect of serotonin in the human brain.

      The effects of physical activity level on human health have attracted interest worldwide.
      Lack of physical activity forms the basis of various health problems, however regular
      physical act contributes prevention and treatment of a number of disorders.

      In current study, investigators will compare the ejaculation control, IELT, and prevalence of
      PE between sportsmen that have regular physical activity, and the individuals with a
      sedentary lifestyle.
