      and atelectasis, is a common entity in neonates ≥ 36 weeks in our unit. Currently our
      standard of care includes using the respiratory modality of bubble nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (BNCPAP) to support these neonates during this illness. BNCPAP provides
      positive distending pressure to recruit alveoli and prevent atelectasis, however, it is
      associated with air leak (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum), nasal irritation and necrosis,
      and intolerance. HFNC is another respiratory modality that uses high flow gas that also
      provides positive distending pressure and thus prevents atelectasis. This modality does not
      cause nasal irritation or necrosis and has a minimal risk of air leak. We postulate that HFNC
      is a superior modality to BNCPAP in treating neonates ≥ 36 weeks with TTN. This will be
      determined by comparing the duration of respiratory support (in hours) for newborns ≥ 36
      weeks gestation with a diagnosis to TTN randomized to receive either NCPAP or HFNC for
      respiratory care.
