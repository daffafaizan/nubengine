      clinics. The control group will be patients to whom the conservative treatment continues.
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate and sign the informed
      consent. Therefore the investigators have two treatment groups: group 1 who receives an elbow
      joint debridement arthroscopically without physiotherapy and group 2 who receives only
      conservative treatment with physiotherapy.
