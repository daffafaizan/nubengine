      conducted at 1 site in Serbia. Sixty (60) healthy male and female adults, 18 to 45 years of
      age, will be enrolled into the trial. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment
      allocations: 30 to vaccine, 30 to placebo. The study will utilize a "randomized block design"
      to assure a balance of 1:1 vaccine and placebo when all subjects are enrolled. The study will
      be double blinded, meaning the study subjects, investigators, and the sponsor will be unaware
      of the treatment allocated to each subject until the clinical trial database is declared
      final and locked. The study should take about 5 months to complete, with each subject
      involved for 3 months from the day of injection. The justification for the 3 month follow up,
      rather than 6 month follow up is that this is an inactivated vaccine that follows very
      standard manufacturing practices with standard antigens. The safety of inactivated influenza
      vaccines is well-established. Adding length to the follow up results in delays in future
      testing of the vaccine for licensure.
