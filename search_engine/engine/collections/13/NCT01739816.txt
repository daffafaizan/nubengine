      review and screening for adherence issues, offers a large field of interesting research
      questions. Using the current PMC-Protocol as a structured interview guide, pharmacists are
      able to document their counselling on medication use issues and other drug related problems.

      In a randomized-controlled trial we aim at analysing 800 recruited patients from 70 study
      pharmacies during seven months. Patients were recruited in the regions Basel,
      Aargau-Solothurn, Waadt in Switzerland and randomised using 1:1 block randomisation.

      Primary outcome focuses on the improvement of adherence and persistence after 'Polymedication
      Check' (using medication possession ratio (MPR), gaps in medicines history records and
      patient's interviews).

      Second outcomes are time to planned or unplanned consulting with a physician or
      hospitalisation, knowledge, safety of medicines use and patients management of polypharmacy.
