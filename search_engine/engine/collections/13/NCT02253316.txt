      post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for multiple myeloma and the benefits seen
      of consolidation/maintenance treatment with immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and
      lenalidomide and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the natural next step is to evaluate
      combination regimens of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors as
      consolidation/maintenance post-ASCT. The regimen consisting of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and
      dexamethasone (IRD) has been shown to have low toxicity, and the availability of an oral
      formulation of ixazomib allows for easier administration when compared to bortezomib.

      In this study, following consolidation with IRD, patients will be randomized to maintenance
      therapy with lenalidomide or ixazomib in order to collect pilot data comparing the toxicity
      and efficacy of maintenance therapy with immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors.

      09/23/2019: Upon review of the interim analysis that suggested inferior progression-free
      survival in the ixazomib maintenance arm, there will be no further randomizations into the
      maintenance portion of the trial. All patients will be enrolled into the lenalidomide arm
      with the exception of those who discontinue lenalidomide during the consolidation phase due
      to toxicity. Patients who discontinue lenalidomide may be enrolled into the ixazomib arm
      following approval from the principal investigator.
