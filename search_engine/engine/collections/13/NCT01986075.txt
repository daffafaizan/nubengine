      problems. Psychosocial treatments can be helpful for many individuals. However, a significant
      proportion of individuals do not benefit from counseling alone. Our research group has
      demonstrated that deficient dopamine transmission, predicts poor response to a behavioral
      treatment and that a regiment that included an agonist replacement strategy with stimulants
      maybe effective for promoting abstinence in severe cocaine dependent patients.

      In this 15-week study 155 treatment-seeking cocaine dependent participants will receive a
      computer-assisted behavioral intervention based on the community reinforcement approach with
      contingency management (CRA + CM). The counseling approach will include both
      computer-assisted life skills training via and counseling. Individuals who fail to achieve
      abstinence will continue the behavioral treatment (CRA + CM) and will be randomly assigned to
      a behavioral therapy enhancement strategy that will include either Mixed Amphetamine
      Salts-Extended Release (80mg) or placebo.
