    
      Phase I-II multi-site, exploratory, interventional, unmasked, non-randomized, single arm
      clinical trial. A single drug will be administered in four different, increasing doses to
      four consecutive cohorts.

      The first phase of the study will focus on determining the most effective and tolerated dose
      of the study drug. The second phase will follow patients to the end to evaluate the safety of
      the drug.

      The dose escalation will be decided by the Study Coordinator, who will evaluate and assess
      each cohort. Once the cohort of 6 patients is complete, the Coordinator will evaluate
      patients and, based on the tolerability and efficacy obtained, will decide whether to proceed
      with the dose escalation, or whether to end the trial The study will remain open until the
      overall number of participants is achieved; Â§progressive dose increases (PI) will be
      discontinued if dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in more than two patients in the
      previous cohort, *PI of the dose will only continue (for the third cohort) if at least two
      patients in the first two cohorts achieve the overall response rate (ORR), that is, complete
      response (CR) at four weeks from initiation of treatment; ** the study will only move on to
      the fourth cohort if CR is achieved in at least one of the six patients in the third cohort
      at four weeks from initiation of treatment; ***microscopy/cytofluorometry; ****complete blood
      count, microscopy, biochemistry; *****as long as there is no relapse, treatment will continue
      after the end of the study (planned for 24 months after the start of recruitment); AE,
      adverse events
