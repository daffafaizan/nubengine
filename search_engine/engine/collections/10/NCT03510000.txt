      labelled indication for use of empagliflozin in clinical practice is as an adjunct therapy to
      diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. The
      investigators are proposing to use the medication as an adjunct anti-diabetic therapy in
      individuals with type 1 diabetes and would like to examine whether empagliflozin can
      alleviate need for carb-counting by eliminating post-prandial hyperglycemia in a setting of
      an artificial pancreas (AP).

      The study is designed as a randomized open-label, crossover non-inferiority trial comparing
      empagliflozin 25 mg oral daily in the setting of the single-hormone AP to single-hormone AP
      without empagliflozin in adults with type 1 diabetes. The duration of the study for each of
      the participants is about 3-9 weeks and during this time three different meal announcement
      strategies for AP will be used, on and off empagliflozin treatment.
