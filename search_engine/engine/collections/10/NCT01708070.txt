      been shown to be associated with worse asthma as defined by more symptoms, more
      hospitalizations and greater use of medications. There have been few studies trying to
      improve asthma outcomes in patients with known depression. One method to improve outcomes is
      to instruct patients in ways to better self manage asthma. The goal of this study is to test
      a comprehensive intervention to improve asthma self-management by increasing knowledge and
      self-efficacy in patients with a known history of a positive screen for depression. Patients
      will be randomized to two groups - a control group and an intervention group. Patients in the
      control group will receive an asthma workbook, will make a contract to adopt behaviors they
      think will improve asthma, and will receive telephone follow-ups approximately every week for
      8 weeks and then approximately every 2 months. Patients in the intervention group will
      receive these components plus they will be taught how to use a peak flow meter and specific
      chapters of the workbook will be used as templates for focused instruction during telephone
      follow-ups. The primary outcome will be a comparison of within-patient change in
      asthma-related quality of life between groups.
