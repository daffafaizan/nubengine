      is contagious to the general population, all the suspected or confirmed newborns will be
      admitted to the neonatal departments in designated hospitals of China. In this study, the
      diagnosis of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the criterion provided by National
      Health Commission and the Chinese perinatal-neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Committee. All samples will
      be treated as biohazardous material. SARS-CoV-2 will be tested in blood, cord blood, amniotic
      fluid, placenta, respiratory tract, stool, urine from mothers or neonates. The medical
      information questionnaires are classified into maternal and neonatal version, which include
      demographic details, epidemical history, clinical manifestations, tests collected time and
      results, imaging performed time and results and therapeutic data. Two researchers
      independently checked and recorded the data to ensure the accuracy of the data.
