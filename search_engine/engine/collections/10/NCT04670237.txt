      disturbances (glares, halos), neuronal adaptation and patient satisfaction after implantation
      of multifocal diffractive apodized toric intraocular lens- Liberty 677MTY -
      diffractive-refractive apodized IOL based on EPS technology manufactured by Medicontur Ltd.
      (Zsámbék, Hungary).

      The tested IOL model, Liberty 677MTY, has an overall length of 13 mm, an optic diameter of
      6.0 mm without haptics angulations but with posterior vaulting. The refractive index of the
      optic material is 1.46 (at 23°C). The IOL is a single-piece-IOL, the optic and haptics are
      made from a hydrophilic acrylic co-polymer with integrated - covalently bound UV absorbent.
      The IOL is produced with yellow filter, covalently bound yellow chromophore. The toric
      component of Liberty 677MTY IOL is located on the posterior surface of the lens optic. The
      optic is marked with 2 marks. The marks are positioned exactly in middle between the two
      loops of haptic at the angulation at the flat axis of toric equivalent. The Liberty 677MTY is
      available with cylinder powers of 1.0 diopter (D) to 6.0 D. The IOL is designed with sharp
      edge following 360º to prevent migration of the lens epithelial cells , thereby to prevent
      PCO formation.

      The trifocality of the lens is provided by the EPS technology recently developed by
      Medicontur uses an elevated phase shift on the central diffractive part of the lens in order
      to cause constructive interference between the 0th (far) and 1st diffractive (near) order,
      thus creating a 3rd (intermediate) focal point.
