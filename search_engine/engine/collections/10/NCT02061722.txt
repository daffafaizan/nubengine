      HCs will be studied. The data obtained in the first cohort will be analysed and depending on
      the variability of the data, there will be approximately 10 HDGECs and an equal number of HCs
      in the second cohort and the size of the third cohort may be altered to in total include
      approximately 45 HDGECs and an equal number of HCs.
