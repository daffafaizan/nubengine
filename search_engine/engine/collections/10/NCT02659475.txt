    
      This is an exploratory open-label trial of PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia®) in BED. It is hypothesized
      that PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia®) will be an effective, safe, and well tolerated treatment for BED
      and propose to conduct a 1-site, 12-week, open-label, flexible dose study of PHEN/TPM ER
      (Qsymia®) in 10 outpatients, ages 18 through 65 years, with BED. It is also hypothesized that
      PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia®) will reduce weight and binge eating behavior, and will be well
      tolerated. The primary objective is to show that PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia®) along with nutritional
      and lifestyle modification counseling is effective in reducing weight in overweight or obese
      patients with BED. Secondary objectives are to show that PHEN/TPM ER (Qsymia®) is effective
      in reducing frequency of binge eating episodes and associated eating psychopathology and is
      safe and well tolerated in patients with BED.
