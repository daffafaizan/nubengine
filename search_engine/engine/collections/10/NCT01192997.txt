    
      Between 550 and 650 subjects enrolled in a previous Meningococcal C vaccine study will be
      invited to join this new study looking at the boosting effects of two quadrivalent
      meningococcal ACWY vaccines. If they choose to participate, they will be randomised to
      receive one of the ACWY vaccines. Within each vaccine group, there will be further division
      into short (6 months) or longer (9 months) follow-up.

      Each participant will be given one dose of an allocated vaccine. Blood samples will be taken
      three times from each participant - the first sample will be pre-vaccination; the second
      sample will be taken one month after vaccination; and the third and final sample at either
      six or nine months after vaccination (depending on the group they are randomised to).
