      uncontrolled bleeding that leads to hemorrhagic shock. During shock, inadequate blood flow
      results in local ischemia and tissue hypoxia (insufficient oxygenation) of critical organs
      with resulting lactic acidosis. More than 10% of trauma victims who reach hospital alive will
      die, and many will suffer from organ failure. The primary goal when treating traumatic
      hemorrhage is to control blood loss, support ventilation and oxygenation, and maintain
      cardiovascular function to maintain organ perfusion.

      Despite optimal care, organ dysfunction is present in many patients as evidenced by
      persistent lactic acidosis. Blood transfusions are intended to improve circulation of
      oxygen-carrying red blood cells, but are frequently insufficient, even when the hemoglobin
      level is optimized. The severity of lactic acidosis in trauma victims has also been shown to
      correlate with worse outcome.

      Support for the proposed application for MP4OX as a therapeutic adjunct to standard treatment
      of severe hemorrhage shock, is based on multiple preclinical studies in different animal
      models of hemorrhagic shock resuscitation. These preclinical studies demonstrated that
      survival was greater and restoration of acid-base status and hemodynamics were improved with
      MP4OX. The benefits of MP4OX in animals were observed with or without co-administration of
      autologous blood, demonstrating that red cell transfusion alone was insufficient, and that
      the effects of MP4OX were additive.

      The hypothesis for the current study is that MP4OX will enhance perfusion and oxygenation of
      ischemic organs and thereby prevent and reduce the duration of organ failure and improve
      morbidity and mortality outcome measures.
