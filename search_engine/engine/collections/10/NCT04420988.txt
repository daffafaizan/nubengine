      life-threateningly ill with COVID-19 access to investigational COVID-19 convalescent plasma
      (CCP). A clinical team comprised of Infectious Disease specialists, Pulmonary/Critical Care
      specialists and Hospitalists identify appropriate patients in accordance with FDA
      recommendations for patient eligibility and the daily availability of ABO-compatible CCP. CCP
      is obtained through New York Blood Center and American Red Cross in coordination with the
      University Hospital Blood Bank. Safety outcomes include monitoring for transfusion-related
      acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and any
      allergic reactions.Patients admitted to our institution prior to the availability of CCP will
      be separately reviewed.
