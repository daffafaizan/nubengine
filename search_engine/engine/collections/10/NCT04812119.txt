      have been 28 studies published describing 71 patients with this syndrome, which leaves much
      to be yet discovered. The goal of the study is to reach out to the community and include as
      many families of patients with CTNNB1 syndrome as possible to create a strong and reliable
      base of information. the investigators are specifically interested in the correlation between
      different genotypes and phenotypes and the natural course of the disease. The information
      gathered with this study will help understand CTNNB1 mutations as well as their effect on
      patient's overall health and wellbeing. The long-term goal is using this information to help
      create new treatment options, e.g. gene therapy.

      The participants will be guided through a detailed questionnaire about the patient's history,
      prenatal and delivery risk factors, current medical issues and standardized questionnaires on
      a variety of subjects that constitute the patient's health and daily function. The
      investigators wil ask the participants to provide results of genetic testing and other
      diagnostic measures, thus providing the medical community as well as the families of the
      patients a reliable overview of the syndrome.
