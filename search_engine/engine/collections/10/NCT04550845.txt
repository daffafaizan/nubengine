      improved the understanding of prostate cancer biology and prognosis. The National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), in 2016, recommended that patients and clinicians
      consider tissue-based genetic tests for localized prostate cancer. However, while much
      enthusiasm currently exits for the rapidly increasing field of genomic medicine, the use of
      multi-gene mRNA expression panels raises the potential for further divergence in prostate
      cancer treatment outcomes by race and low socioeconomic status. We know that health
      disparities persist in low income groups despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines
      and that adoption of state-of-the-art methods often lag behind in these groups.

      The goals of this study are to (1) explore how men with localized prostate cancer and their
      caregivers comprehend prognostic genetic technology, and (2) examine how an educational video
      about genetics impacts patient-caregiver communication of prognostic genetic technology. The
      study rationale is that without direct attention to genomic comprehension, the enthusiasm
      that exists in the rapidly increasing field of prostate cancer genomic medicine may not
      translate into health benefits for men with localized prostate cancer. The central hypotheses
      are (1) men and caregivers with lower levels of education will demonstrate a severe lack of
      genomic comprehension of tissue-based genetic tests for localized prostate cancer; and (2)
      tailored prostate cancer education, communication coaching, and a genomic literacy
      educational video will significantly improve patient-caregiver communication in a low
      literacy population.

      The study approach is innovative because it applies a mixed-methods community-engagement
      research framework to explore how African American and rural White men with localized
      prostate cancer, comprehend and interpret data generated from genetic technology. The
      proposed research is significant because of its potential to improve public health by (1)
      improving the understanding of prognostic genetics in minority, low income, and rural
      populations, and (2) engage and educate these diverse communities about genomics.
