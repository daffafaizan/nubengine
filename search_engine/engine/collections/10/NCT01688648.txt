      previous study has reported that low-dose lidocaine infusion can decrease the incidence of
      ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia during the first 24 hours after coronary artery
      bypass graft (CABG). A recent study also reported that the lidocaine infusion during CABG
      could decrease the myocardial injury by measuring the CK-MB and Troponin-I blood level.

      Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 agonist and reduces the sympathetic tone and neuroendocrine
      stress response. Dexmedetomidine was reported to have a cardioprotective effect by a previous
      animal study. However, there was no clinical study evaluating the cardioprotective effect of
      dexmedetomidine.

      Therefore, we are trying to evaluate and compare the antiarrhythmic and myocardial protective
      effect between lidocaine, dexmedetomidine, and their combined infusion in subjects undergoing
      coronary artery bypass graft.
