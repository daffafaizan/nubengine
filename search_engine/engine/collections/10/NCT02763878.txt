      still common. Radical surgery is the only way to treat gastric antrum cancer, surgical
      procedures and reconstruction are closely related with the prognosis and quality of life, the
      choice is crucial. Gastrojejunostomy after distal gastrectomy may affect the quality of
      radical surgery, and postoperative diet, nutritional status and quality of life. More and
      more centers tend to choose Billroth II anastomosis, but patients prone to have a variety of
      complications, including reflux gastritis and bile reflux, malnutrition, seriously affecting
      the quality of life and so on. According to preliminary pilot study found that, uncut
      Roux-en-Y anastomosis way can keep the continuity of nerve-muscle function of the
      reconstruction of digestive tract, and closes the input in order to reduce the incidence of
      reflux, for improving the nutritional status and reducing complications and improve quality
      of life. Therefore, the investigators intend to conduct multi-center randomized controlled
      study to find if Uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis to the distal gastric cancer patients after
      radical D2 can reduce the long-term complications, affect the quality of life, and improve
      the prognosis.
