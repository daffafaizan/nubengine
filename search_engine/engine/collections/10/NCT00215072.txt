      mortality following congenital heart surgery has become extremely low. Also, with the
      introduction of extracorporeal support (ECMO), especially in the emergency setting, acute
      deaths are extremely rare. The majority of post-operative deaths seem to be the result of a
      prolonged hospitalization with a progressive decline to multi-system organ failure.

      The primary aim of the study is to elucidate the patterns of death following congenital heart
      surgery. The secondary aims of the study are to discover patterns and consistencies among the
      deaths and to discover points of potential intervention to reduce surgical mortality. The
      study will be conducted through a retrospective chart review of approximately 40 patients.
