      than their counterparts in the general population. This study aimed to evaluate the
      effectiveness of an adapted physical activity (APA) program in reducing weight among
      adolescents with ID.

      Methods: A 9-month randomized controlled trial was conducted between August 2018 and June
      2019. Adolescents (12-18 years old) with ID and overweight/obesity were recruited from six
      special education schools in Hong Kong. The participants in the intervention group
      participated in the APA intervention, which consisted of simple and fun endurance and
      strength-building exercises at a frequency of two sessions per week. Data on obesity-related
      variables, subjective PA levels, sleep duration and eating habits were collected before the
      intervention, at the midpoint of the intervention and after the intervention. Changes in the
      outcome variables were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models.
