      situations, such as malignant or resistant renal vascular hypertension, OAP (Acute pulmonary
      oedema) flash or acute renal failure of ischemic origin.

      There is no work in the literature that has studied retrospectively the evolution of
      angioplasty practices renal artery disease on atherosclerotic stenosis since 2009, nor their
      remote results of the gesture.
