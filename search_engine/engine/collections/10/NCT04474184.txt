      I. To conduct focus groups to elicit perceptions and knowledge among African American women
      (AAW) and white women (WW) concerning abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)/post-menopausal
      bleeding (PMB), endometrial cancer (EC) risk factors, barriers to seeking medical evaluation,
      sources of medical information and acceptance and feasibility of tampon self-collection for
      laboratory testing.

      II. To perform a demonstration project of tampon self-collection from 25 AAW and 25 WW with
      AUB/PMB in Jacksonville.

      OUTLINE:

      AIM 1: Participants attend a focus group over 2 hours about endometrial cancer including
      knowledge of abnormal uterine bleeding, post-menopausal bleeding, risk factors, sources of
      medical information, barriers to seeking gynecologic care, and acceptance of tampon
      self-collection for endometrial cancer detection.

      AIM 2: Participants receive a tampon kit for collection of vaginal samples.

      After completion of study enrollment, participants may be followed up annually for 10 years.
