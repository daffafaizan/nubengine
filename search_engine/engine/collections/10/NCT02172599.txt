    
      This study adopts a randomised control trial design and is mixed methods (qualitative and
      quantitative). The outcome data from the trial is quantitative. Alongside this a qualitative
      process evaluation will be conducted to inform the intervention, explain trial results and
      understand the intervention implementation and context (Cathain et al. 2014). Two worksites
      will participate in this study, in line with COCHRANE recommendations for randomised control
      trials.
