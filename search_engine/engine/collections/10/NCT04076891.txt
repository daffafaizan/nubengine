      above the knee or women and men with nodular Dercum's disease. Each cohort will have 6
      subjects who will receive RZL-012.

        -  The 1st cohort will be comprised of subjects with Dercum's disease

        -  The 2nd cohort will be comprised of subjects with lipedema with substantial fat above
           the knee.

      Within each cohort, dosing of the subjects will progress consecutively from one individual to
      the other with a minimum of 7-days between subjects to assess safety. This study design will
      allow the physicians to monitor safety for at least 7 days prior to dosing the next subject.
      Cohort 2 will be conducted in a dose escalation manner and the decision to proceed to the
      next dose level will be made after reviewing all safety data collected by Day 14 within 2 Â±
      1d of the last dosed subject. The trial will proceed within a cohort provided that no more
      than one subject experiences intolerable side effects in a cohort, and based on the decision
      made by the Principal Investigator (PI) and the Medical Monitor.
