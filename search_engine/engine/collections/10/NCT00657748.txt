      deficiency in Aspartoacylase (ASPA) enzyme. There is no available treatment. ASPA deficiency
      leads to:- the accumulation of high levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), involved in myelin
      degeneration and epilepsy;- the deficient synthesis of acetate in oligodendrocytes, that
      could impair CNS myelination.Lithium administration induces a decrease in NAA in the brain of
      the tremor rats (animal model for CD) and in one patient (JANSON, 2005). On the other hand,
      administration of acetate could improve myelination in Canavan patients.For this reason, we
      propose to combine both treatments: Lithium Gluconate and Glyceryl Triacetate (GTA). Eighteen
      patients, aged 1 to 15 years, will receive oral GTA or Lithium during 4 months, then both
      treatment in association during 6 months. Patients will be sequentially evaluated up to the
      end of the treatment and 2 months thereafter for:-tolerance of the therapy (careful
      monitoring of clinical and biological parameters).- efficacy of the therapy on clinical,
      biological and radiological parameters. Particularly, we will evaluate using MRI-spectroscopy
      and CSF samples the decrease in NAA and increase in acetate levels in the brain.
