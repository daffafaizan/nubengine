      cervical radiculopathy. The standard of care is a sequential approach in which the patients
      receive interventions successively. This study will provide the standard of care approach for
      one group while the other group receives the concurrent approach in which the patient will
      have neuromobilizations while they are receiving mechanical traction. Both groups will also
      receive exercise and manual therapy to the cervical and thoracic spine.
