      scan, which is standard of care and cone beam CT scans during treatment, which are also
      standard of care. One of the MR scans will be close to the start of treatment and the other
      will be approximately 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy treatment. If the patient has
      had a PET scan within 4 weeks of the 1st MR scan then the PET images will also be used for
      target volume delineation. If the PET scan > 4 weeks old, it can be repeated as per standard
      practice.

      The MRI protocol includes up to 60 minutes of scanning which will include anatomical,
      respiratory dynamic and functional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). The patient will be set
      up according to the treatment position on the MR scanner, using flat couch. The MR scans will
      not be used for clinical decision making.

      Clinicians will then contour organs at risk (OARs) and target volumes on both the CT (guided
      by PET if available) and MRI scans and contours will be compared to determine the usefulness
      of MRI for radiotherapy treatment planning.

      The contoured data sets will be fully anonymised, and used in house and shared with Elekta to
      assist with the development of automatic contouring / tumour tracking software, comparing CT
      to cone beam CT (CBCT) tracking (standard of care) with MR to MR tracking (experimental).

      To assess experiences of MRI and CT, participants will be asked to complete baseline
      self-report questionnaires and additional questionnaires after MRI and CT scans. A small
      sample of participants will also be invited to participate in a semi-structured interview to
      explore their experiences in greater depth.
