      to be a cause for DVT, partly due to blood stasis. VACOped is a weight-bearing orthosis with
      adjustable range of motion of the ankle which is used in our department in patients operated
      for Achilles tendon rupture.

      Aim: To assess the effects of a) lower leg casting in equinus without loading and b)
      application of the aforementioned orthosis with full weight baring in blood flow and
      microcirculation in the lower limbs.

      Study Plan: Ten healthy individuals are planned to be recruited for this study. Blood flow in
      the Right popliteal will be measured with vein before, 30 and 60 min after the application of
      the cast or orthosis (alternate order between consequent individuals) with Duplex Ultrasound.
      The orthosis will be set to allow for ankle plantarflexion restricted between 15 and 30
      degrees. Tissue oxygen saturation in the lower limbs will also be measured using a somatic
      regional oxymetry modality, INVOS, with adhesive sensors applied on each leg above the
      soleus.
