    
      This study is a multi-center, single arm, non-interventional study to assess the safety and
      performance of NOVOCART速 Basic and the clinical outcome of MAC with NOVOCART速 Basic in
      patients treated for cartilage defects in the knee. In this study data will be collected
      retrospectively from patient files of adult and pediatric patients who had received an MAC
      with NOVOCART速 Basic for cartilage defects in the knee according to medical practice. In
      addition, at the time when a patient consents to participate in the study, he/she will have
      to fill-out questionnaires on current symptoms and knee function, quality of life,
      satisfaction with treatment and subsequent surgical interventions on the target knee
      performed outside the study site, i.e. the duration of follow-up is not standardized. All
      clinical sites having treated more than 8 patients with NOVOCART速 Basic between 2014 and 2017
      will be contacted for participation. Participating clinical sites will be asked to collect
      informed consent from their patients to document relevant data from their medical charts and
      to complete the questionnaires. Consenting patients will send the signed informed consent
      form(s) and the completed questionnaires back to the study site. The date of questionnaire
      completion is regarded the end of observation for an individual patient. For data
      documentation, a medical documentation specialist authorized by TETEC AG will be given access
      to the patient files, the informed consent forms, and the completed questionnaires. The
      relevant data will be entered directly into an electronic database by the medical
      documentation specialist. Only data from patients who have given informed consent to study
      participation will be documented. If available, post-MAC MRIs will be collected and reviewed
      by independent experts.
