    
      The ExeQOL study is an ancillary study of the ExSTRESS trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov
      identifier: NCT01969149).

      The ExSTRESS trial is a phase II/III randomized-controlled trial that aim at assessing
      intravenous exenatide versus insulin for perioperative glycemic control in CABG surgery.

      The phase II of the ExStress trial will assess the safety and the efficacy of a continuous
      intravenous infusion of exenatide for the management of post operative stress hyperglycemia
      after planned coronary artery graft bypass (CABG) surgery.

      The aim of the phase III of the ExSTRESS trial is to compare the efficacy of a continuous
      intravenous infusion of exenatide to the gold standard treatment, i.e the intravenous
      infusion of short-acting insulin, for the management of post operative stress hyperglycemia
      after planned CABG surgery.
