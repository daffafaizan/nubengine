      single dose or as multiple doses over several days, depending on the clinical situation, and
      according to the Full Prescribing Information guideline and the investigator's judgment. For
      each treated event, the subject's treatment period will be finished when, in the opinion of
      the local Investigator, the participating subject would not benefit from further infusions of
      the study concentrate.
