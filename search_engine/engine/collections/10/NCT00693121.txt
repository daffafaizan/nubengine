      admission for rehabilitation. Our investigations of confusion conducted as part of the TBIMSM
      have clarified the nature of confusion in early recovery after TBI. Early confusion (PTCS)
      has been found to be a complex syndrome characterized by disorientation, cognitive
      impairment, restlessness, decreased level of daytime arousal, sleep disturbance, fluctuation
      of symptoms, and psychotic-type symptoms. PTCS complicates early management of patients with
      TBI, and may contribute to increased risk of injury to patients and hospital staff, increased
      stress among family members and staff, decreased participation in therapies, increased cost
      of care, and an increased likelihood of being discharged to psychiatric or long-term care
      settings. These facts indicate the need for effective management of PTCS. Consensus regarding
      optimal treatment of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms encountered among patients with
      PTCS does not exist currently. While many agents have been tried to address such symptoms in
      TBI, few have been investigated systematically. These circumstances indicate the need for
      appropriate clinical trials to provide guidance to clinicians for medical treatment of PTCS.
      In response, the NIDRR-Traumatic Brain Injury Model System of Mississippi proposed a
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial for the pharmacological
      treatment of PTCS. The agent selected for this clinical trial is amantadine, an NMDA and
      indirect dopamine agonist. This agent will be compared to placebo on response measures of
      efficacy and safety.

      Study hypothesis: Amantadine will reduce the severity and number of symptoms of PTCS.
