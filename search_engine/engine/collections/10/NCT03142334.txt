      unacceptable adverse events (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration
      of treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, noncompliance with study
      treatment or procedural requirements, administrative reasons requiring cessation of
      treatment, or until the participant has received 17 cycles of study treatment (approximately
      1 year). Each cycle is 3 weeks long.

      With Protocol Amendment 02 (dated 04 Sep 2019), the secondary study objectives for the
      evaluation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and the presence of pembrolizumab antidrug
      antibodies (ADA) were reclassified as tertiary study objectives.
