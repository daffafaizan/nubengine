    
      This is a cross-over, randomized, double-blinded study in which 10 participants will undergo
      6 experimental days each. The participants will have their plasma glucose clamped at either
      euglycaemia (fasting level), hypoglycemia (2,5 mmol/l) or hyperglycemia (10 mmol/l) during
      infusion of GLP-2 or saline (placebo)

      The six days will be as follows:

        -  Euglycaemia + Placebo

        -  Euglycaemia + GLP-2

        -  Hyperglycaemia + Placebo

        -  Hyperglycaemia + GLP-2

        -  Hypoglycaemia + Placebo

        -  Hypoglycaemia + GLP-2

      The primary endpoint will be levels of plasma glucagon. Secondary endpoint will be levels of
      GLP-1, GLP-2, Insulin/C-peptide, OXM, Amino acids, CCK, Gastrin, norepinephrine, bile acids,
      FGF-19/FGF-21. Secondary endpoints will also include ultrasound scan of the gallbladder.
