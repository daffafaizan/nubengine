      depression and autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is an important neural control system
      for maintaining cardiovascular stability and plays a major role in regulating cardiovascular
      homeostasis. There are many methods for the administration induction of propofol, such as a
      manually bolus or target-controlled infusion (TCI) techniques. TCI devices could rapidly
      achieve and maintain the desired predicted concentration and is a more satisfactory technique
      to reduce the incidence of side effects and with the advantage of better hemodynamic control.
      More precise knowledge of how anesthetic agents modify ANS activity is important for
      understanding subsequent cardiovascular responses. However, there was no study using
      validated measurement of ANS index comparing propofol induction anaesthesia with TCI or
      manually bolus would have different effects on ANS.
