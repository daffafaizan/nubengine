      and concomitant BC ( 24 patients; group A) or POP repair alone without any anti-incontinence
      procedure ( 23 patients.; group B). They were followed-up at 3, 6, and 9 months after surgery
      and then annually. The primary outcome measures were anatomical outcome and changes in
      incontinence status as indicated by a bladder diary, the number of daily pads and the stress
      test. Secondary endpoints were changes in subjective symptoms and Quality of Life (QoL) as
      measured by the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and the Impact Incontinence Quality of
      Life (IIQ-7) questionnaires.
