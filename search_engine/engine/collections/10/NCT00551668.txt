      young physically active adults. Acute lateral patellar dislocation is a relatively common
      injury among young adults. Proper treatment for this condition has been researched for
      decades. However, there is a lack of prospective randomized studies to evaluate the different
      treatment options for traumatic primary patellar dislocations. Therefore a prospective,
      randomized study was designed with the aim to compare the outcome of operative versus
      nonoperative treatment of primary traumatic patellar dislocations in young adults.
