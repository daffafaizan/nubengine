      hypertension in patients with cirrhosis of liver. It is associated with a mortality rate of
      up to 50% in these patients. Prophylactic treatments to prevent variceal bleeding, therefore,
      assume paramount clinical significance. Currently, primary prophylactic treatments using
      pharmacologic agents with non-selective beta blockers as well as endoscopic variceal ligation
      (EVL) are effectively employed in preventing variceal bleeding. The American Association for
      the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines recommend that patients with Child's stage A
      cirrhosis and portal hypertension with platelet count less than 140,000/mmq or portal vein
      diameter > 13mm and those patients classified as Child's B and C cirrhosis should undergo
      screening endoscopy for esophageal varices. Patients with cirrhosis and no esophageal varices
      detected during screening should undergo endoscopy ever three years. Patients with small
      esophageal varices are recommended to be screened endoscopically every 1 to 2 years.

      Currently, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) under conscious sedation is the gold standard for
      variceal screening. However, EGD has certain limitations especially when used in patients
      with cirrhosis of the liver. Prolonged conscious sedation may have an adverse effect on
      encephalopathy. EGD also may not be cost effective for screening esophageal varices.

      The use of PillCam ESO capsule endoscopy to detect esophageal varices has become an
      attractive alternative to conventional endoscopy especially in patients unwilling to undergo
      EGD. Identifying patients with small varices, which have the potential for progression to
      large varices and bleeding, is an important clinical issue to address.
