      2-month period were identified. Patient data including demographics, surgical diagnosis,
      mortality, morbidity and hospital length of stay was collected. Based on the investigators'
      early experience from the first patient, the investigators designed a protocolized
      institutional pathway which incorporated the risk of COVID-19 infection and urgency of
      operation.
