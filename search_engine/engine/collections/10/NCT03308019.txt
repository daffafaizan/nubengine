      (b) self-reported never-smokers; (c) patients with CP (presence of at least 30% sites with ≥
      3 mm of CAL and PD ≥ 3 mm 18, 19 ). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) patients with
      systemic diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome/HIV and diabetes mellitus; (b)
      habitual smokeless tobacco product and alcohol users; (c) third molars and fractured teeth
      with embedded root remnants and edentulous individuals; (d) patients with misaligned teeth;
      and (e) patients that reported to have used antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs and/or steroids within the past 90 days.

      Demographic information was collected using a questionnaire. Cigarette-smokers (group-1) and
      never-smokers (group-2) with chronic periodontitis were included. Treatment wise, these
      individuals were divided into two subgroups as follows: (a) SRP alone and (b) SRP with
      adjunct aPDT. Periodontal parameters (plaque index [PI], bleeding on probing [BOP], clinical
      attachment loss [CAL] and probing pocket depth ≥4mm [PD] were measured at baseline and at 1
      month and 3 months' follow-up.
