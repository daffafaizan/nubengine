    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, using Percutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation (PENS). PENS is technique to provide a transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation current throughout needling filaments place close to the nerve.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to compare the immediate effect of a single session
      of PENS on pressure pain sensitivity as measured by pressure pain threshold in patients with
      lateral epicondylalgia with random assignment to two treatments: PENS or Sham PENS

      Aim #2: The secondary aim of the study is to compare the immediate effect on pain free grip
      strength, on intensity of pain as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS), extent of pain and
      global rating of change in patients with lateral epicondylalgia with random assignment to two
      treatments: PENS or Sham PENS.
