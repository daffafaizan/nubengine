    
      This is a prospective monocentric longitudinal study on a consecutive population of patients
      who require breast MRI as part of their course of care in the radiology department of the
      Tenon Hospital (3T MRI).

      The standard protocol for breast MRI routinely performed in Tenon hospital consists of a set
      of MR acquisitions performed with contrast agent injection. The research consists of adding
      perfusion and diffusion sequences to the regular MR protocol. The addition of these sequences
      does not require a new injection of contrast medium.

      Diagnosis of lesions after the breast MR exam will be performed using standard MR sequences
      as usual. According to the recommendations of SIFEM, the final diagnosis of the lesions will
      be made either by histological analysis of a biopsy performed as part of the patient's
      standard care pathway, or during patient's follow-up if a biopsy is not indicated (up to two
      years after breast MR exam).

      The research will focus on evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of perfusion MRI
      sequence with or without diffusion MRI sequence compared to the sensitivity and specificity
      of the standard protocol.

      For the perfusion sequence, the following data will be extracted: qualitative (shape of the
      contrast curve), semi-quantitative (elevation slope and asymptote of the curve) and
      quantitative by compartmental modeling (tissue perfusion, blood volume fraction, surface
      capillary permeability).

      For the diffusion MRI, the extraction of quantitative data such as CDA, IVIM and Kurtosis
      will be performed and parametric maps, cellularity maps and an assessment of lesion
      heterogeneity will be calculated.

      A correlation will be made with histological, immunohistochemical and molecular results of
      cancers following biopsy
