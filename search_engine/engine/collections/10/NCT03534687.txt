      and other ligands, modulates the development and progression of diabetic complications
      through persistent and cyclic activation of nuclear factor-kappa beta. Targeting RAGE
      directly as a therapeutic strategy has largely been unsuccessful. However, RAGE signaling can
      be interrupted, in vivo, by ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) directed
      proteolytic cleavage of the RAGE ectodomain, and thus creating a soluble isoform of RAGE
      (sRAGE) that is released from the cell and appears into the circulation. Maintaining high
      levels of circulating sRAGE is advantageous as sRAGE will sequester RAGE ligands and prevent
      RAGE cell signaling.

      Although the exact mechanisms of ADAM10 mediated RAGE release remain undefined, calcium
      related and other signaling (SIRT1) impact ADAM10. Aerobic exercise presents a unique model
      for mechanistic study of RAGE release as muscle contraction induces robust calcium signaling,
      activates SIRT1, and provides stimuli for tissue remodeling and resolution of the metabolic
      profile that drives inflammation.
