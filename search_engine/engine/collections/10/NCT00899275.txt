      I. To collect biological specimens from patients with osteosarcoma at Children?s Oncology
      Group (COG) institutions.

      II. To provide a repository for long-term storage of osteosarcoma-related biological
      materials.

      III. To make these specimens available to qualified researchers to understand the biology of
      osteosarcoma and correlate these results with the patients' clinical data.

      OUTLINE:

      After the initial submission of blood samples, patients may undergo open or closed biopsy in
      order to obtain fresh and frozen tissue samples as well as paraffin embedded material.
      Patients who are enrolled at the time of initial diagnosis but then have a definitive surgery
      or develop recurrent disease may submit additional samples (paraffin block, frozen and fresh
      tumor tissue, or slides together with blood samples). Autopsy tumor samples may also be
      submitted.
