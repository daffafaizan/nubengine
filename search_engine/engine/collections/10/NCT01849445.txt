    
      The study is a randomised controlled trial comparing the effect of intensive physiotherapy
      compared to current standard of care therapy, targeted to patients performing poorly at 6
      weeks following total knee replacement.

      All patients will be made aware of the study pre-operatively at the recruiting centres. Prior
      to surgery they will complete the routine pre-operative outcome assessment questionnaires
      (Oxford Knee Score and EQ-5D) as part of the national PROMS program and then undergo the
      local standard total knee replacement and immediate post-operative care pathway.

      All patients will be routinely reviewed 6 weeks post-operatively by the usual clinical teams.
      At this review the Oxford Knee Score will again be assessed. Those patients who report a
      score of 26 or less (on the 0-48 OKS scoring system), which is defined as poor by the
      Kalairajah classification (Kalairajah, 2005), will be approached to consent. If consent is
      given and the patient is eligible to enter the trial, randomisation into one of the following
      groups will occur: to standard care (encompassing a one off physiotherapy review, 6 weeks of
      home exercise prescription and final review) or to an interventional arm, where 18 sessions
      of structured physiotherapy will be administered over a 6 week period, where 6 of these
      sessions will be 'contact sessions' performed under the supervision of the physiotherapist.

      All trial participants will be reviewed immediately post intervention (i.e. at 14 weeks post
      operation) and then by postal questionnaire at 26 and 52 weeks post-operation.
