    
      Approximately 600 patients will be randomized using an Interactive Voice Response System
      /Interactive web system (IVR/IWR system) in a 1:2 ratio to the treatments as specified below:

      A. Arm A: Placebo + bevacizumab & platinum-based chemotherapy.

      The placebo arm will include one of 3 following regimens up to investigator choice (chosen
      prior to randomization)

        1. Carboplatin (day1)combined with gemcitabine (day1 & day8) and bevacizumab (day1) +
           placebo ( day1) x 6 cycles q3weeks followed by maintenance with bevacizumab ( day1) +
           placebo (day1) q3weeks until disease progression or

        2. Carboplatin (d1) combined with paclitaxel (day1) and bevacizumab (day1) + placebo (d1) x
           6 cycles every 3weeks followed by maintenance with bevacizumab (day1) + placebo (day1)
           q3weeks until disease progression or

        3. Carboplatin (day1) combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) (day1) and
           bevacizumab (day1 & 15) + placebo ( day1& 15) x 6 cycles every 4weeks followed by
           maintenance with bevacizumab (day1) + placebo (day1) q3weeks until disease progression.

      B. Arm B: Atezolizumab + bevacizumab & platinum-based chemotherapy

      The atezolizumab arm will include one of 3 following regimens up to investigator choice
      (chosen prior to randomization)

        1. Carboplatin (day1) combined with gemcitabine (day1 & d8) and bevacizumab (day1) +
           atezolizumab ( day1) x 6 cycles q3weeks followed by maintenance with bevacizumab (day1)
           + atezolizumab (day1) q3w until disease progression or

        2. Carboplatin (day1) combined with paclitaxel (day1) and bevacizumab ( day1) +
           atezolizumab (1200mg, d1) x 6 cycles every 3wk (day1) q3weeks until disease progression
           or

        3. Carboplatin (day1) combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) (day1) and
           bevacizumab (day1 & 15) + atezolizumab (day1& 15) x 6 cycles every 4weeks followed by
           maintenance with bevacizumab (day1) + atezolizumab ( day1) q3weeks until disease
           progression.

      Before randomization to the study:

        -  A tumor biopsy should have been obtained and sent to the central laboratory

        -  PD-L1 status should be determined
