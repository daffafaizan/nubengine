      investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of a new catheter (The Spanner) to reduce the
      acute urinary retention and to determine whether they are consistent with the daily life of
      the patient, compared to the Foley catheter previously used.

      The study include all patients with acute urinary retention due to prostatic obstruction.
      Subjects were excluded if they had prior surgery for prostate cancer, had any other urethral
      or bladder surgery, or if they were at high risk of developing bladder or kidney stones The
      study will be national community based study conducted in different hospitals in Saudi
      Arabia. Investigators will test two different types of stents in patients with acute urinary
      retention for a short period (not exceeding five days), find out the compatibility of these
      stents with the daily life of the patient and determine their impact on his quality of life
      using an appropriate questionnaire after each use.
