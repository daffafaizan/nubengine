    
      Participants will be recruited from patients who visit the sleep lab for CPAP titration. Only
      eligible participants, that provide written informed consent, will be enrolled into the
      investigation

      Only those participants whom are previously diagnosed with an AHI >5 can be approached and
      enrolled into the study.

      Once the consent form has been signed, participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      either Pilairo or any other standard care nasal/nasal pillows mask for their CPAP titration.
      A randomisation log will be provided by FPH.

      The titration session will take place as per the lab's routine practice.

      Throughout the night the Sleep Technician will record in the CRF the absolute leak value for
      the mask every 10 minutes.

      At the end of the session the Sleep Technician will complete a questionnaire in relation to
      the titration experience for that participant/mask. The data will be collected in the CRF
      that FPH staff will provide to the site.
