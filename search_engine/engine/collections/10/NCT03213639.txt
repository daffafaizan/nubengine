      hypoxia), placental release of the anti-angiogenic factors Soluble Fms Like Tyrosine Kinase
      -1 and soluble endoglin and maternal endothelial dysfunction. A drug that can counter these
      pathological steps could be a strategy to treat pre-eclampsia.

      If an affordable and safe treatment was available it could temporize the disease progression
      of pre-eclampsia thereby delaying delivery to gain gestation. This could save the lives of
      many infants and decrease the hospital burden caused by iatrogenic prematurity.

      Currently, there are trials investigating the possible use of pravastatin to treat
      pre-eclampsia, and to prevent it There are no other significant trials of orally available
      small molecules to treat pre-eclampsia that we are aware of.

      The Translational Obstetrics Group at Melbourne University has generated strong preclinical
      evidence suggesting esomeprazole as one of the proton pump inhibitors may have potent actions
      giving it significant potential as a treatment for pre-eclampsia

      Proton pump inhibitors have been commonly used in pregnancy to treat gastroesophageal reflux
      disorders and more serious gastrointestinal complications like Helicobacter pylori-infection,
      peptic and duodenal ulcers and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

      Esomeprazole counters three key steps in pre-eclampsia pathogenesis, by up-regulating heme
      oxygenase-1 ( strongly decreasing the release of antiangiogenic factors Soluble Fms Like
      Tyrosine Kinase -1 and soluble endoglin and quenching endothelial dysfunction.
