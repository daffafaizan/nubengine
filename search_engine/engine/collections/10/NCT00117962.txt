    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with pemetrexed disodium, carboplatin, and thoracic radiotherapy
           with or without cetuximab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the failure-free survival and response rates in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor, erbB2, and K-ras mutations with survival and
           tumor response in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy (courses 1-4): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes followed by
                carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Patients also undergo
                thoracic radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and
                43-47.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium, carboplatin, and thoracic
                radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients also receive cetuximab IV over 2 hours on day 1
                and then IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.

        -  Consolidation chemotherapy (courses 5-8): Beginning 3-5 weeks after completion of
           chemoradiotherapy, all patients receive consolidation chemotherapy comprising pemetrexed
           disodium alone IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 10-13 months.
