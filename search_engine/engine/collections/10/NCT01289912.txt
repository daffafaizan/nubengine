    
      This is a signal-seeking Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trial of RAD001 in children
      and young adults with TSC with neurocognition as the primary outcome and autism spectrum
      disorder as a secondary outcome.

      Specific Aims /Objectives Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of RAD001 on neurocognition in patients with TSC compared to
           placebo as measured by well-validated, standardized, direct and indirect neurocognitive
           tools.

        -  To evaluate the safety of RAD001 compared with placebo in patients with TSC focusing on
           NCI CTCAE Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, and Grade 3 and 4
           laboratory toxicities.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Comparison of absolute change from baseline in frequency of epileptiform events as
           recorded on seizure diaries between patients taking RAD001 vs. placebo

        -  Comparison of sleep disturbances between patients taking RAD001 vs. placebo, measured by
           the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) and sleep logs

        -  Comparison of autism spectrum disorders features between patients taking RAD001 vs.
           placebo, measured by ADOS and SRS

        -  Comparison of academic skills between patients taking RAD001 vs. placebo, measured by
           WRAT4

        -  Comparison of behavioral problems between patients taking RAD001 vs placebo, measured by
           behavioral rating scales (BRIEF, BASC, SDQ, CHQ and SRS)
