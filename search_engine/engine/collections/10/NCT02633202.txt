      treatment modality for intermediate risk NPC (stage II and T3N0M0) according to the National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline. However these recommendations were based on the
      evidence in the two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy (2DCRT) era. The introduction of
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in NPC treatment has brought substantial better
      treatment outcomes than 2DCRT. It has been questioned whether additional concurrent
      chemotherapy is still necessary for intermediate risk NPC within the excellent framework of
      IMRT. Thus, the investigators jointly conduct the first non-inferior randomized trial to
      determine the value of concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin for intermediate risk NPC
      patients treated with IMRT. Given the results of clinical studies mentioned above, the
      investigators decide to adopt the concurrent regimen to be cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1, 22,
