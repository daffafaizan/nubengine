      with ADHD using double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Method: Participants
      included 24 college students with ADHD and 26 college students without psychopathology.
      Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) examined for ADHD participants over five weekly phases
      (no-drug baseline, placebo, 30, 50, & 70-mg LDX per day). Self-report rating scales of
      functioning and direct assessment of ADHD symptoms, verbal learning/memory, and adverse
      side-effects were collected (baseline only for control students).
