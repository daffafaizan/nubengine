    
      A prospective cohort study, conducted in Canada, to evaluate whether the use of the DCIS
      score changes the treatment recommended and the treatment received in women with low to
      moderate risk DCIS following breast conserving surgery who are candidates for radiation
      therapy. We plan to study 280 eligible, consenting women who will have their tumour tissue
      specimen sent to Genomic Health to assess their DCIS score.

      At each centre, all patients with DCIS referred to radiation oncology will be documented.
      When a physician identifies an eligible patient, the patient will be approached by the
      referring physician or delegate to voluntarily provide informed consent to participate in
      this study. Consenting patients will be registered through the Ontario Clinical Oncology
      Group's (OCOG) web-based registration system. Data related to the patient demographics,
      surgery details, and tumour characteristics will be collected. The preliminary treatment
      recommendation and patient preference for treatment will be documented. Patient Decisional
      Conflict will be documented by the patient using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The
      patient's tumour specimen will be sent for analysis to Genomic Health. DCIS score results
      will be sent to the referring physician. OCOG will also receive the DCIS score results. The
      final treatment recommendation, patient preference, and treatment received by the patient
      will be documented. Patient decisional conflict will be documented by the patient using the
      DCS. The study data will be verified by source documentation.
