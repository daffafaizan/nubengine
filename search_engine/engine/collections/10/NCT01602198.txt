      with chronic use among MCI and AD patients. Some studies also demonstrate a slight treatment
      benefit for persons who are APOE 4 positive. We propose to conduct a 24-week, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of the ExelonÂ® [rivastigmine]
      transdermal patch in 120 aMCI patients who have one or both APOE 4 alleles. Our preliminary
      analyses indicate that aMCI patients, even those who convert to AD, exhibit increased fMRI
      activation on our semantic memory activation task relative to not at-risk healthy
      participants and that increasing activation over time correlates with declines on
      neuropsychological testing. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that ChEI treated aMCI
      patients demonstrate normalization (i.e. reduction) in the magnitude of task-related neural
      activation over time relative to an untreated group. Furthermore, changes in fMRI magnitude
      demonstrated greater sensitivity to cholinergic modulation than changes on neuropsychological
      testing.
