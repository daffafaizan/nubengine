      that is delivered over very few sessions. In the case of limited pulmonary 'oligometastases',
      SABR can result in long-term survival. It is non-invasive and associated with high rates of
      tumour control and relatively low toxicity. Additionally, the large doses of precision
      radiotherapy involved may evoke a strong immune response to recognise and attack any
      remaining tumour cells. In the future, SABR may be an attractive alternative to invasive
      surgery. There are two SABR techniques emerging in Australia; fractionated and single
      fraction treatments. We aim to conduct the first clinical trial of SABR in patients with
      limited pulmonary metastases testing fractionated versus single fraction treatments.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity, Quality of Life, clinical efficacy
      and cost effectiveness of single fraction SABR compared to multi-fraction SABR in patients
      with oligometastases to the lung.

      The secondary aim of this study is to assess the immune response evoked by both fractionated
      and single fraction SABR and its prognostic implications for patient outcomes.
