      Gy radiation scheme is followed by six cycles of combination chemotherapy (capecitabine/5FU
      and oxaliplatin) and surgery and a control group (arm A) with long course chemoradiotherapy
      followed by surgery. In arm A adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed according to the local
      protocol of the institution. In both groups the rectal tumour will be removed by TME surgery
      or more extensive surgery if required because of tumour extent.
