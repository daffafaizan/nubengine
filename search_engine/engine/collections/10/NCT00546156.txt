    
      -  To prepare for the surgery that will occur at the end of the study treatment, a small
           "clip" will be placed into the tumor area so that the surgeon can locate the site of the
           tumor at the time of surgery. This is a standard procedure for breast cancer.

        -  During the clip placement, a needle will be inserted into the tumor to measure
           interstitial fluid pressure (IFP measurement). IFP is done for research purposes to help
           understand how the tumor responds to the study treatment.

        -  Study treatment will begin with one dose of bevacizumab alone, followed two weeks later
           by chemotherapy and bevacizumab in eight two-week cycles. The study treatment will be
           given intravenously in the clinic.

        -  After the first dose of bevacizumab and prior to starting chemotherapy, a needle biopsy
           of the breast tumor will be performed for research purposes. A second measurement of IFP
           will also be done at this time.

        -  During the treatment period, tests and procedures will be performed at specified
           intervals and include the following: research MRI, physical exams, blood tests, urine
           tests, EKG, and MUGA or ECHO.

        -  Surgery to remove the tumor will occur no less than four weeks after the last dose of
           Paclitaxel.
