        2. The lesion needs to be pre-expanded or special circumstances should be carefully
           considered according to the clinical manifestations

        3. The selection of target vessel is based on the criteria of a diameter between 2.25mm and
           4.0mm

        4. If a stent needs to be placed at the target vessel, it is recommended that there be at
           least 2mm overlap between the stents; if the stent expansion is not sufficient,
           post-dilatation treatment is required.
