      bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine (control group) or extended release lipossomal
      bupivacaine. Primary outcomes are postoperative pain measured by visual analog scale, amount
      of morphine equivalent narcotics used, and postoperative complications. Patients are excluded
      if they undergo open thoracotomy, or minimally invasive decortication.
