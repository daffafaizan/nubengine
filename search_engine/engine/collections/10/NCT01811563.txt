      the fact that we did not use the 6 week time point in the final analysis based on the
      clinical decision that 6 weeks was too early in recovery to provide accurate information for
      clinical decision making. Therefore the patients used in the final analysis were those
      subjects who were able to and completed the assessment at pre-op and 1 year post-op which is
      how we get to the 20 subjects per group.
