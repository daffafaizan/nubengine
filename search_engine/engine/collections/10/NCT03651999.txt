    
      For more than two years, nurse anesthetists have developed a personalized treatment of
      children who will be asleep using the theoretical bases of hypnosis in children and
      distraction, in order to improve the conditions of falling asleep, especially by promoting
      the acceptance of the mask during inhalation induction, or by preparing it for an Intra
      Venous induction, if it so desires or if it is obligatory.

      Indeed, the announcement of a surgical intervention is sometimes experienced as a real
      emotional shock by the parents and / or the child, whatever the gravity or the stake of the
      surgical gesture. To all this is added the phobic fear of anesthesia and all conditions are
      met to generate a climate of maximum stress. The work of nurse anesthesists prior to this
      surgical procedure was to establish a relationship of trust with the child through this
      "dream workshop", to restore a more serene climate.

      Thus, is it the idea of this "workshop of the dream", allowing thanks to the imagination of
      the child, to recreate a universe of confidence full of colors, songs and perfume ...

      After consultation with the pediatric surgeon or the anesthesiologist, parents and children
      are invited to meet nurse anesthesists, if they wish, in a room dedicated to this purpose and
      specially designed to accommodate children; they will find a playmobil model, photographs of
      the patient circuit as well as different games or activities that can be performed during
      induction; the nurse anesthetist will take care to explain to them the progress of the
      hospitalization and help them to choose a pleasant dream, a perfume adapted to their taste, a
      distraction adapted to their age (animated book, soap bubbles, favorite song ...) ; he can
      customize his mask and choose the blanket he wants to take; the most recalcitrant or special
      sites (autism, long-term hospitalization) will be able to be accompanied by a parent during
      sleep.
