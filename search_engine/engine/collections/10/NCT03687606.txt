      in some studies. However, these studies were mostly non-randomized controlled studies with
      small size of samples and short follow-up time. There was also no reported study which aimed
      to compare the efficacy and safety of long term use of hCG or hCG plus hMG in the treatment
      of male patients with IHH. So the difference in the efficacy and safety between long term use
      of hCG alone and hCG plus hMG in the treatment of IHH is unknown. In different reported
      studies, the hCG plus hMG treatment had two regimens: using hCG alone for six month, then hMG
      was added and using hCG plus hMG since the beginning of the treatment. The difference in the
      efficacy and safety between the above two regimes is also unknown.
