      demographic and medical history questions, limited to the presence or absence of medical
      problems and treatment for them.

      Participants will be recruited into either Group 1 or Group 2 depending on their previous
      clinical observations assessed during screening.

        -  Group 1 participants will have oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate
           measured.

        -  Group 2 participants will have blood pressure and respiratory rate measured.

      For all participants, the study team will complete a set of pre-measurement observation
      questions. Background luminosity will be measured using a handheld lux meter. The staff
      member will then prepare for and take the participant's routine observations using standard
      clinical equipment during the same 60-second period that video is captured of the
      participant's face using LifelightÂ® Data Collect (from which only the RGB data will be
      uploaded to the cloud). These measurements and RGB data capture will be repeated two times
      following the initial observations. Once measurements are concluded, the study staff member
      will complete the post-measurement observation questions.
