    
      MSC-1 is a first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the
      immunosuppressive human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat
      adult patients with advanced solid tumors. LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in many
      physiological and pathological processes including the promotion of an immunosuppressive
      environment. In cancer, it is hypothesized that LIF expressing malignancies co-opt this
      activity, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment as well as promoting the
      activity of cancer-initiating cell(s) (CICs). LIF is highly expressed in a subset of tumors
      across multiple solid tumor types.

      During dose escalation, patients with Advanced Solid Tumors will be treated with MSC-1 with
      the primary objective of determining the safety and tolerability of MSC-1 and defining an
      appropriate dose for further evaluation in dose expansion. MSC-1 will be administered
      intravenously (IV) until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or
      study termination.

      In dose expansion, up to 4 parallel cohorts of patients with LIF-High tumors (NSCLC, Ovarian
      Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer), and a cohort of mixed Solid Tumors (referred to as the "basket
      cohort"), may be treated at the recommended expansion dose to further characterize the
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD and anti-tumor activity of MSC-1.
