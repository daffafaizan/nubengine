      validity of a measure of cancer-related risk perception. As such, the primary outcomes of the
      study will be initial construct validity (convergent validity and discriminant validity) of
      the proposed scale as evidenced by correlations of this test with other tests that vary in
      the degree of association to the proposed construct of cancer-related risk perception. It is
      anticipated that the cancer-related risk perception scale will correlate most highly
      (.50-.60) with measures of tobacco and environmental risk exposures, readiness to quit
      smoking, and family cancer history.
