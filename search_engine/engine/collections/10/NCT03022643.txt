      in patients with chronic pain as well as the relationship between behavioral rhythms and the
      pain-related clinical symptoms. Additionally, this study will provide preliminary data for
      the feasibility, acceptability, and treatment effects of repurposing interpersonal social
      rhythm therapy (IPSRT) along with light therapy for patients with chronic pain exhibiting
      significant rhythm dysregulation, sleep disturbances, and mood symptoms. The deliverables at
      the end of this project will include 1) preliminary evidence concerning the prevalence of
      behavioral rhythm disturbances in patients with chronic pain; 2) the association between such
      behavioral rhythm disruptions and the symptom cluster of pain-sleep-fatigue-mood; 3)
      feasibility and acceptability of a prototype IPSRT repurposed for chronic pain patients along
      with bright light therapy. The specific aims of this proposed study are as follows:

      Aim 1: To evaluate regularity of social and behavioral rhythms (SBR), disruption of circadian
      activity rhythms (CAR), and the relationship of SBR and CAR with clinical symptoms of
      pain-sleep-fatigue-mood in chronic pain patients compared to healthy control.

      Hypothesis 1: Patients with chronic pain will show high degrees of SBR and CAR disruption
      compared to controls.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients with increasingly dysregulated SBR and attenuated CAR will exhibit
      worse clinical symptoms.

      Hypothesis 3: SBR will be associated with CAR in patients with chronic pain and in controls.

      Aim 2: To assess feasibility and acceptance of interpersonal social rhythm therapy repurposed
      for chronic pain patient population along with bright light therapy provided to patients
      exhibiting SBR disruption with significant sleep and mood symptoms.

      Hypothesis 1: The IPSRT will be well tolerated and accepted by the patients

      Hypothesis 2: Descriptive data will suggest improvement of SBR, CAR, and the pain-related
      symptoms and functioning.
