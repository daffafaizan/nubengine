    
      Idiopathic membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults.
      Over the past decade, a number of studies have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment
      with tacrolimus plus steroid in patients with nephrotic syndrome including patients with
      membranous nephropathy. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a
      traditional herbal extraction, Tripterygium wilfordii, plus steroid in reducing the amount of
      protein in the urine in patients with membranous nephropathy. A hundred patients with
      biopsy-proven membranous nephropathy will be recruited. They will be screened with a medical
      history, physical examination, blood tests, and an examination for infection, cancers, and
      other conditions that can cause membranous nephropathy. The investigators plan to conduct an
      open-label study of the efficacy and safety of Tripterygium wilfordii in the treatment of
      membranous nephropathy. Half of them will be treated with oral Tripterygium wilfordii plus
      steroids for 6 months, followed by 6 months of maintenance, and the other half treated with
      tacrolimus plus steroid as positive contrast. Proteinuria, renal function will be monitored.
      Complete remission is defined as 24-hour urinary protein excretion to less than 0.4 mg/day
      and serum albumin>35g/L. This study will explore the potential role of Tripterygium wilfordii
      in the treatment of membranous nephropathy, it's cost less .
