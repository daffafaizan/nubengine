    
      Proton pump inhibitors are metabolized through the CYP2C19 hepatic enzyme system. Several
      variant genotypes of this enzyme exist which may lead to decreased, normal or increased
      metabolism of the proton pump inhibitor. With alteration of metabolism, the degree of gastric
      acid suppression achieved and efficacy in treating reflux could be affected. For example,
      Asian populations who have low activity of CYP2C19, commonly need lower doses of proton pump
      inhibitors to manage gastroesophageal reflux because of more sustained blood levels and
      availability of the drug. Theoretically, those patients who are rapid metabolizers would
      receive less effective treatment with proton pump inhibitors
