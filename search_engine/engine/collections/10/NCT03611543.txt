      to 600 subjects. The number of subjects was chosen to allow evaluation of screening and
      diagnostic patients with a variety of breast densities (fatty, scattered densities,
      heterogeneously dense or extremely dense) and women with a range of breasts sizes that fit on
      the current detector. The evaluation of pain reduction will be the primary endpoint, while
      examining the potential of increased tissue capture without a compromise in image quality
      will be assessed as secondary endpoints. The enrollment will be consecutive for subjects who
      sign informed consent to participate. Women participating in the study will present for a
      screening or diagnostic imaging exam.
