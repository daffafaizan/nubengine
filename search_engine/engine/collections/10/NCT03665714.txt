      either IMPACT Oral or Enteral Nutrition Emulsion(TPF-T) will be given to surgical patients
      for 5 days before surgery and 7 days after surgery. Both of the study products include
      immunonutrition, but the nutrient proportion is different.

      Prealbumin, C-reaction protein (CRP), Albuminï¼Œimmunology parameters, the results of physical
      examination, vital signs, relevant nutrition- and safety-related laboratory parameters and
      the number, severity, seriousness, relatedness and outcome of Adverse Events (AEs) will be
      evaluated in this study.
