    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with the following
      treatment assignments:

        1. Investigational FMT (one-time)

           a. Subjects in this group will blindly receive placebo FMP250 at week 8 by flexible
           sigmoidoscopy.

        2. Investigational FMT (one-time) + Psyllium (2x/day for 8 weeks)

           a. Subjects in this group will blindly receive placebo FMP250 at week 8 by flexible
           sigmoidoscopy.

        3. Placebo FMT (one-time) + open label FMT (one-time) +/- Psyllium (2x/day for 8 weeks) a.
           Subjects in this group will blindly receive investigational FMP250 at week 8 by flexible
           sigmoidoscopy.

      Subjects will blindly receive the investigational or placebo FMP250 treatment if they meet
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria during the day 0 screening colonoscopy. Subjects will
      receive follow-up phone calls at day 1, week 2, week 6, and week 10 post-FMT and will return
      for clinic visits at week 4, week 8 and week 12 post-FMT. Stool and blood samples will be
      collected for research purposes from subjects at every clinic visit (Day 0 colonoscopy, Week
      4, Week 8, and Week 12). Mucosal biopsies will also be taken during the initial colonoscopy
      at day 0 and during the follow-up flexible sigmoidoscopy at week 8. At week 8 post-FMT, all
      subjects will be evaluated by flexible sigmoidoscopy in the clinic. Subjects originally
      randomized into the placebo cohort will receive investigational FMP250 by flexible
      sigmoidoscopy and subjects originally randomized into the investigational cohort will receive
      placebo FMP250 by flexible sigmoidoscopy. Lastly, all subjects will be contacted for
      follow-up phone calls every subsequent 6 months for the next year.
