    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry designed to
      collect real world data associated with the use of Medtronic market-released
      neurothrombectomy devices in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients from countries in South
      East Asia, including Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The primary objective of this registry
      is to assess clinical outcomes associated with the use of these devices in patients
      experiencing AIS due to large intracranial vessel occlusion within 8 hours of symptom onset.
      This registry may enroll up to 500 patients.

      This clinical trial information was submitted voluntarily under the applicable law and,
      therefore, certain submission deadlines may not apply. (That is, clinical trial information
      for this applicable clinical trial was submitted under section 402 (j)(4)(A) of the Public
      Health Service Act and 42 CFR 11.60 and is not subject to the deadlines established by
