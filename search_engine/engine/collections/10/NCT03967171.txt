      worldwide contributing to nearly 25% of direct maternal deaths. The average blood loss during
      cesarean section is 1000 ml which is nearly double the blood loss during vaginal delivery.
      Worldwide, the most commonly used uterotonic for the prevention of PPH is oxytocin. Several
      regimens of oxytocin have been tested during cesarean section with variable wanted
      (uterotonic) and unwanted (cardiovascular) effects. In the current study, we tested the
      hypothesis that initiating IV oxytocin infusion earlier before uterine incision would induce
      a rapid acceptable uterine contraction and minimize the intraoperative blood loss than the
      same dose administered after delivery of the fetus.
