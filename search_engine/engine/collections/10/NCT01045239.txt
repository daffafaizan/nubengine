      mortality and morbidity globally. Diabetic macular oedema is the most common cause of visual
      loss in the working population.

      In 1985, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) demonstrated that focal
      (direct/grid) laser photocoagulation reduces moderate vision loss from diabetic macular
      oedema (DMO) by 50% or more. However, further studies have shown that photocoagulation can
      eventually result in complications leading to loss of central vision and decreased colour
      vision. Thus, many newer laser machines that claim to reduce the rate of complications have
      been developed over the years.

      In this project, we plan to evaluate the usage of the micropulse 577 nm laser, which is a
      yellow light laser, and compare it to the conventional 532 nm green laser that is widely
      used. The 577 nm laser has a high affinity for oxyhemoglobin, a slightly lower affinity for
      melanin and almost no affinity for macular xanthophylls, as shown in the graph
      below.22,23,24,25 The yellow 577 nm light also scatters very little and does not cause
      photochemical reactions in the tissues.

      The theoretical advantage of using the micropulse 577 nm yellow laser would be the reduced
      energy requirement to obtain the same results as with green 532 nm. This leads to less
      retinal toxicity and damage due to reduced absorption by the xanthophylls. Our aim in this
      project is to observe whether the theoretical advantage translates to a more effective
      treatment in reality.
