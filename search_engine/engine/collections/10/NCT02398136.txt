    
      The objective of the present research protocol, a parallel-arm, double-blind, randomized
      controlled clinical trial, is to test the efficacy of repeated intranasal administration of
      the glutamatergic NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine in providing (1) rapid relief of and (2)
      sustained improvement in core PTSD symptoms and co-morbid depressive symptoms in patients
      with chronic PTSD. The effects of ketamine will be compared with those of repeated intranasal
      administration of the benzodiazepine anesthetic midazolam, which mimics some of the acute
      subjective effects of ketamine but is expected to have lesser or less sustained anxiolytic
      effect, and no sustained antidepressant effect.
