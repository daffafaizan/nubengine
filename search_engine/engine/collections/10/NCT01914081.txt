      adults (â‰¥18 to 90 years old). Twenty (20) subjects will be included in the placebo arm, and
      20 in the treatment arm. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive placebo or
      resveratrol. After randomization, the two groups of subjects will be followed up in exactly
      the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive will be those intrinsic
      to the treatment being compared. The randomization will minimize allocation bias, balancing
      both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments.
