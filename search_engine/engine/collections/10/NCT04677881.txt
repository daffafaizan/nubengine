      double-blind cross-over study lasting for 5 weeks.

      All participants will be given bread baked with yeast for a 2 weeks run-in period. The
      participants will then be randomly assigned to either 1 week intervention with bread baked
      with yeast or sourdough, before a 1 week wash-out period with yeast bread. During the last 1
      week intervention period the participants starting with bread baked with yeast will be given
      sourdough and vice versa.

      Questionnaires (GSRS-IBS, BSC, FFQ), blood samples, and feces samples will be collected
      before and after the intervention periods.
