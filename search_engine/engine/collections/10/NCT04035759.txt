      consideration of a group of health protective variables known as 'psychosocial assets'. These
      assets include cognitive factors, such as optimism, emotional factors, such as positive
      affect, and positive social relationships. Increased psychosocial assets such as positive
      affect are associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, slower slower HIV progression,
      and reduced burden of depression symptoms. However, there has been limited translation of
      positive affect interventions to support patient self-management. In this study, we extend
      previous research on positive affect and adherence through the APPEAL program. The Affect,
      Promoting Positive Engagement, and Adherence for Life (APPEAL) program is an intervention
      that combines positive affect approaches to promote adherence in patients who have suboptimal
      adherence. We seek to implement the program, assess its feasibility, and describe
      associations with theoretically derived mechanisms of change, including positive affect.
