      but allows free movements of the wrist. This configuration allows subjects with impaired
      grasping ability to use the system. A bio-feedback system enables the subject to perform
      various functional motor tasks that are presented on the screen in front of him. The system's
      sensors detect motor errors or deviations from an optimal/proper movement trajectory or
      velocity profile. Any deviation in direction, velocity, acceleration or necessary force from
      the optimal trajectory results in applied robotic forces that enhance such errors/deviations.
      The sensors and the applied forces all work and compute in real time, so that the force
      measurements and the applied force are updated to the executed movement.
