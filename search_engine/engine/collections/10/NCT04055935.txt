      calculation. Those sides were divided into 2 groups. Group 1divided into (group 1a: 8 sides
      with FTMPF, group 1b:8 sides control). Group 2(group 2 a: 8 sides with LLLT, group 2b: 8
      sides control). Extraction of the first maxillary premolars followed by canine retraction in
      the extraction space with maximum anchorage were indicated. FTMPF was elevated from the
      mesial interdental papilla of maxillary canine to the mesial interdental papilla of second
      maxillary premolar. LLLT was applied at 3,7,14,28.56 days of retraction. During retraction
      study model for all patients were taken at 2ed, 6th, 14th,16th weeks and at the end of
      retraction (I1,I2,I3,I4,I5 or overall interval). 3D laser scanning and digital
      superimposition was done to measure the rate of canine retraction and anchorage loss.
