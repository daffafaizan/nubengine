    
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label study, with subjects allocated (1:1) to 1 of 2 study
      arms, using a stratified randomization based on:

      • Prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT): ≤ 3 months or > 3 months and ≤ 12 months.
      • Primary therapy: radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation, including brachytherapy, (XRT) or
      RP + XRT.

      Arm 1: Subjects received one infusion of sipuleucel-T every two weeks for a total of three
      infusions. Two weeks after the third sipuleucel-T infusion, subjects started ADT with 45 mg
      leuprolide acetate depot injection (Eligard® 45 mg). An additional leuprolide acetate
      injection was administered at 6 months after the first injection for a total of 2 injections
      and 12 months of ADT.

      Arm 2: Subjects started ADT with 45 mg leuprolide acetate depot injection (Eligard® 45 mg) 12
      weeks before infusion 1 of sipuleucel-T. An additional leuprolide acetate injection was
      administered at 6 months after the first injection for a total of 2 injections and 12 months
      of ADT. Twelve weeks after the initial leuprolide 45 mg depot injection, subjects began one
      infusion of sipuleucel-T every two weeks for a total of three infusions.

      Cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed for Arm 2 subjects at 12, 8, and 4 weeks
      pre infusion 1, and in all subjects (both arms) at pre-leukapheresis 1, 2, and 3, and
      post-infusion 1, 2 and 3, and at the following time points after the third infusion: Weeks 2,
      6, and 12 and Months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24.

      Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) monitoring, laboratory tests (complete blood
      count (CBC) and serum chemistry), vital signs, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
      performance status, physical examination, as well PSA and testosterone monitoring. The study
      was complete at the 27-Month visit for Arm 1 and the 24-Month visit for Arm 2.
