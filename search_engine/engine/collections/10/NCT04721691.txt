      Epilepticus of Sleep (ESES). ESES can cause various types of seizures which can fluctuate
      during sleep. Similar studies have been conducted with Epidiolex with other seizure disorders
      such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet Syndrome. Since there is no data available
      on the effect of Cannabidiol (CBD) on patients with ESES, this study hopes to fill that void.
      As such, patients that have been diagnosed with ESES will be eligible to participate in this
      study to ascertain whether or not Epidiolex can reduce the frequency or intensity of the
      seizures brought on by ESES during sleep.
