    
      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial to evaluate the safety and
      preliminary efficacy of ANS-6637 in adults with opioid use disorder with and without opioid
      agonist therapy. At screening, after providing consent, participants will be evaluated to
      ensure criteria for opioid use disorder by DSM V criteria is met, and whether the subject is
      receiving opioid agonist therapy will be determined. Participants will undergo a medical
      evaluation (including medical history, laboratory tests and EKG evaluation) to establish
      baseline medical and psychiatric diagnosis in order to ensure safety of participation. Once
      enrollment criteria are met, patients will be randomized in a blinded fashion to ANS-6637 or
      placebo, stratified by site and form of opioid agonist therapy. On Day 0, patients will be
      initiated on ANS-6637 vs. placebo according to randomization group. Subjects will be seen
      twice per week for two weeks, followed by weekly for two weeks, and then monthly for two
      months.
