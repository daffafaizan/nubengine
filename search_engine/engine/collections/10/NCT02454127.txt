    
      Objective: To assess adherence rates and the effectiveness of 4 popular diets (Atkins, Zone,
      Weight Watchers, and Ornish) for weight loss and cardiac risk factor reduction.

      Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-center randomized trial at an academic medical
      center in Boston, Mass, of overweight or obese adults with known hypertension, dyslipidemia,
      or fasting hyperglycemia. Participants were enrolled starting July 18, 2000, and randomized
      to 4 popular diet groups until January 24, 2002.

      Intervention: A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to either Atkins
      (carbohydrate restriction, n=40), Zone (macronutrient balance, n=40), Weight Watchers
      (calorie restriction, n=40), or Ornish (fat restriction, n=40) diet groups. After 2 months of
      maximum effort, participants selected their own levels of dietary adherence.

      Main Outcome Measures: One-year changes in baseline weight and cardiac risk factors, and
      self-selected dietary adherence rates per self-report. Outcome measures included body weight,
      total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, hsCRP, insulin, glucose.
