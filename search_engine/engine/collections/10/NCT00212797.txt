    
      Major depression with psychotic features (psychotic depression) is the most debilitating
      disorder in the depressive disorders spectrum. It is associated with severe symptoms,
      prolonged course, poorer response rates, more residual symptoms, more frequent relapses and
      higher mortality, as compared to major depressive disorder.

      The markedly abnormal HPA axis functioning in psychotic depression has encouraged research to
      investigate whether the HPA axis would be a target for pharmacotherapy in depression.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether subjects with psychotic major
      depression benefit from adjunctive treatment with GR antagonist Org 34517. Two doses of Org
      34517 will be compared to placebo in this international multicenter study. The duration of
      this trial is 6 weeks.
