      toxicity is unpredictable in the individual patient. Paclitaxel is removed (eliminated) from
      the organism by oxidation. CYP2C8 is the enzyme mainly responsible. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is
      an efflux transport protein natural to the human organism. Pgp is responsible for excretion
      of drugs via the bile and the kidneys and is thought to play a role in chemotherapy
      resistance. Paclitaxel is substrate for Pgp. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are possible
      causes for variation in both CYP2C8 and Pgp expression/function. We will study a possible
      role of these genetic variations as predictors of paclitaxel toxicity and effect and the
      possible implications for individual dosing in the future.

      We will use tissue from patients who participated in one of two clinical trials that are both
      closed for inclusion. Genotypic data from this tissue will be correlated with toxicity and
      survival data drawn from a research database. We expect to be able to find >300 available
      cases to study.
