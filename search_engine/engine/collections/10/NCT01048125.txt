      dysfunction predominantly affecting the apical and mid left ventricular segments. This was
      originally described in Japan but is increasingly recognized all over the world especially in
      older women. There is evidence to support that excess sympathetic activation and
      catecholamine surges are potential mechanisms that cause this temporary myocardial
      'stunning'. The amount of catecholamines in circulation of patients with SC was 2 to 3-fold
      higher when compared to subjects with acute myocardial infarction related equivalent cardiac
      dysfunction [Wittstein, et al. NEJM, 2005].

      In this institution over the last two to three years the investigators have identified more
      than a dozen patients with stress cardiomyopathy. This diagnosis has been confirmed by
      echocardiographic documentation of normalization of left ventricular function over a course
      of few days to weeks. The investigators' overarching goal is to further characterize these
      individuals with the hope of identifying risk factors and developing strategies to prevent
      the occurrence of SC in situations where the likelihood in susceptible individuals may be
      high.
