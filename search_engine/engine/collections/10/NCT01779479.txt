    
      Primary Objective To compare the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in the breast
      (ypT0/is ypN0/+) in patients with operable Triple Negative or luminal B/HER2 normal breast
      cancer treated with either cabazitaxel or weekly paclitaxel.

      Secondary Objective To assess

        -  pCR rates per arm separately for the stratified subpopulations.

        -  Objective response rate (ORR) in the breast according to WHO criteria.

        -  pCR rate defined as ypT0 ypN0.

        -  pCR rate defined as ypT0/is ypN0.

        -  pCR rate in the axillary lymph nodes (ypN0).

        -  To determine the pCR rate and local recurrence free survival (LRFS) in patients with a
           clinical complete response (cCR) and a negative core biopsy before surgery.

        -  Breast conservation surgery rate.

        -  To assess the toxicity (NCI CTCAE V4.03) and compliance in both arms.

        -  Invasive loco-regional recurrence free survival (LRRFS), distant-disease-free survival
           (DDFS), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and overall survival (OS).

        -  To explore the biomarkers and profiles potentially predicting response to treatment.
