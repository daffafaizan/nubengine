      assigned randomly into two groups. The first group will be given vancomycin intravenous only
      (15-20 mg/kg) every 8-12 hours , while the second group will take vancomycin intravenous
      (15-20 mg/kg) every 8-12 hours plus ascorbic acid 1 gram twice daily orally just before the
      vancomycin administration by half an hour. Patients will be monitored for one week where
      serum creatinine, BUN, urine output, trough level will be measured. Acute kidney injury will
      be determined according to RIFLE criteria.
