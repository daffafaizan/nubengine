      the arm or leg and advanced into the heart arteries, is the procedure that you and your
      doctor have decided to pursue to look for heart artery blockages. It is being performed as
      part of your standard care and not for research purposes. The research procedure (cardiac
      PET/CT), which will be performed at a later date is a combination of heart CT (a test that
      involves the use of x-rays to identify heart artery blockages) and heart PET (an imaging test
      that uses a radioactive drug to look at how the heart uses fuel (sugar and fats) These tests
      will be combined (PET/CT) to look for the presence and type of blockage in your heart
      arteries.

      It is important to develop a test that can determine if and what type of blockage you have in
      your heart arteries as the presence and type of heart artery blockage is a very important
      predictor of heart attack and death from heart attack.
