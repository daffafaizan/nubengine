      response rate of calcium electroporation treatment of malignant tumours of the skin and
      assessing treatment impact on quality of life. This study will investigate the response rate
      of calcium electroporation treatment of skin metastases and malignant wounds in a real-world
      setting, in three different cancer centres in Northern Europe. Each centre will treat 10
      patients with cancer in the skin of any histology. The patients will be treated once and
      followed with regular examinations for 12 months, starting from first treatment day. All
      patients will have been offered the standard of care and all available alternatives before
      entering the protocol. Calcium electroporation will not be compared to other means of
      treatment.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the clinical overall response rate of
      calcium electroporation treatment of malignant tumours of the skin after two months. A subset
      of patients will undergo MR scans after treatment and another subset of patients will be
      interviewed regarding treatment impact on quality of life.
