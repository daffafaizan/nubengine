      the mental, physical, and academic effects of obesity on child health. Data indicate that
      school-age children, particularly underserved children, experience unhealthy gains in BMI at
      a rate nearly twice as fast during the summer months. Few efforts have been directed at
      implementing evidence-based programming to prevent excess weight gain during the summer
      recess.

      Methods: Camp NERF is an 8-week, multi-component (nutrition, physical activity, and mental
      health), theory-based program for underserved school-age children in grades Kindergarten -
      5th grade coupled with the USDA Summer Food Service Program. Twelve eligible elementary
      school sites will be randomized to one of the three programming groups: 1) Active Control
      (non-nutrition, physical activity, or mental health [4H curricula]); 2) Standard Care
      (nutrition and physical activity); or 3) Enhanced Care (nutrition, physical activity, and
      mental health) programming. Anthropometric, behavioral, and psychosocial data will be
      collected from child-caregiver dyads pre- and post-intervention. Site-specific
      characteristics and process evaluation measures will also be collected.

      Discussion: This is the first, evidence-based intervention to address the issue of weight
      gain during the summer months among underserved, school-aged children. Results from this
      study will provide researchers, practitioners, and public health professionals with insight
      on evidence-based programming to aid in childhood obesity prevention during this particular
      window of risk.
