      thrice-weekly (in-center) hemodialysis (HD). After a Screening Period, there will be 12
      hemodialysis treatments on the Optiflux dialyzer (Optiflux Period), followed by 38 HD
      treatments on the dialyzer with Endexo (Endexo Period), and then a Follow-up Visit. The study
      population will consist of End-Stage Renal Disease ESRD subjects who are a minimum of 22
      years of age. The primary objective of the study is to collect data on the performance of the

      subjects.
