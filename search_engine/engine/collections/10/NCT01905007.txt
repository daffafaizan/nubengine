      primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). At the time of ICD
      implantation, ventricular fibrillation (VF) is typically induced to demonstrate effective
      arrhythmia termination by the implanted device. Although defibrillation threshold (DFT)
      testing with induction of VF at time of ICD insertion is currently considered the "standard
      of care," and instructions for usage of devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) include labeling with DFT testing, the value of defibrillation testing with modern-day
      devices has been questioned. Defibrillation testing can be associated with serious
      complications and may add to the cost of the procedure.

      It is hypothesized that patients who do not undergo defibrillation testing will have outcomes
      similar to those who do undergo defibrillation testing at the time of initial implantation.
      This pilot study is being performed to determine the feasibility of performing a larger,
      multi-center clinical trial with longer follow-up to investigate whether or not
      defibrillation testing will have any impact on overall mortality, implant complications, or
      long-term first shock efficacy during clinical follow-up.
