    
      AEZS-108 is an investigational drug, combining luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH),
      an hormone and doxorubicin (a drug approved to treat different types of cancer).

      Some tumors, such as those found in the urinary system (also called urothelial carcinomas),
      have LHRH hormone receptors to which the LHRH hormone part of AEZS-108 is attracted.

      AEZS-108 is expected to work by accumulating mostly on the surface of cancer cells that have
      LHRH hormone receptors and by delivering doxorubicin more directly into the cells to kill
      them. This would allow the use doxorubicin at lower doses and thus would cause less toxicity.

      In the first part of the study, the appropriate dose of AEZS-108 will be determined based on
      its side effects. The best dose will be the highest one without severe side effects.

      In the second part of the study, this best dose of AEZS-108 will be given to determine its
      efficacy to stop the tumor from progressing.
