    
      This prospective double-blind randomized control trial seeks to compare a single formulation
      of BoNT, aboboutlinum toxin A (Dysport), to a placebo saline group, studying the effect of
      BoNT on Raynaud's symptoms among a more diverse population to provide insight into the
      patients most likely to benefit from BoNT.
