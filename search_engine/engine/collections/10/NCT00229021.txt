      multi-center, randomized, prospective, double-blind study of doripenem versus comparator in
      the treatment of complicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI) or pyelonephritis in
      adults. After the screening, patients are randomized to receive either doripenem or
      comparator. Patients are hospitalized, but subsequently, patients may be treated as
      outpatient or through home-based therapy at the investigators' discretion. Conventional
      laboratory data are collected from all patients at specified times throughout the study. The
      primary endpoint is microbiological response measured at test of cure visit. The patients
      receive either doripenum or comparator; duration of therapy is 10 days.
