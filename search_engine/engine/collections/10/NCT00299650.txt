      investigated. It has been recently demonstrated that a systematic 48-h infusion of NMBA is
      associated with a significant improvement in oxygenation as compared with a control group
      (Gainnier et al., Crit Care Med 2004). Moreover, a trend towards a reduction in the mortality
      rate has been observed. The aim of the study is to show a reduction of the mortality rate of
      ARDS patients.
