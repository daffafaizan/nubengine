      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in
      patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      AMG 102 (rilotumumab) as assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association between a panel of biomarkers (as assayed by
      immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis) and measures of response to treatment with AMG
      102 (rilotumumab) and clinical outcome in archived tumor tissue.

      II. To evaluate circulating pre- and post-treatment levels of hepatocyte growth
      factor/scatter factor and markers of angiogenesis and their association with response to
      treatment with AMG 102 (rilotumumab) and clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rilotumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 14. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
