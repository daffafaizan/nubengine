      following patient enrollment), open-label (all people involved in the study know the identity
      of the assigned drug), Phase IIIb study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of decitabine in
      the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients are randomized (study drug assigned
      by chance) in 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with decitabine either 3-day or 5-day course of
      therapy. When a minimum of 30 patients are reached for 3-day course of therapy, the rest of
      the patients will all be enrolled into 5-day course of therapy. Each patient in the study
      treated for a minimum of 4 cycles; however, a complete or partial response may take longer
      than 4 cycles. The entire study duration for each patient will be approximately two years.
      Safety will be evaluated for each patient by monitoring of adverse events, physical
      examinations, vital signs measurements, electrocardiogram, hematology and clinical chemistry
      testing.
