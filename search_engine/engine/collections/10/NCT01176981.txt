      toxicities include myelosuppression, mucositis, nephrotoxicity, and hepatitis. In order to
      deliver HDMTX therapy safely, patients require urinary alkalinization, hydration, monitoring
      of renal function, therapeutic drug monitoring, and leucovorin rescue. Due to the required
      supportive care needs, HDMTX has historically been given as an inpatient. In some centers
      however, HDMTX is being given safely as an outpatient in order to reduce health care costs,
      improve patient quality of life and to deliver timely therapy with limited inpatient
      chemotherapy beds available.
