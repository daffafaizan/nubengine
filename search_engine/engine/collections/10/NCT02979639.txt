      age (YOA). Subjects will be asked to respond to a series of SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires
      before and after vaccination following a 2 month schedule. To estimate the impact of
      reactogenicity on an individual's physical functioning (PF) and QoL, the study will compare
      subject questionnaire responses made during two periods, i.e., pre-vaccination and
      post-vaccination. The difference will be considered to be the effect of vaccination and
      reactogenicity on the PF and QoL. To characterize the study population and determine if
      frailty may influence reactogenicity and consequently the impact on QoL scores, the subjects'
      frailty status will be assessed at the first inclusion visit. In addition to the SF-36 and
      EQ-5D questionnaires, a more complete characterization of the reactogenicity of the vaccine
      will be made by including a detailed collection of the use of healthcare resources and the
      occurrence of symptoms through diary card data collection. Impact on days of work loss, both
      for the subject or for a caregiver, as applicable, will also be assessed.

      Note that as a result of internal change in data standards terminology, the study data
      collected was converted to cDISC and the statistical analysis plan was amended accordingly.
      "Day 0" in the study design was replaced by "Day 1"; consequently, "Day n" was replaced by
      "Day n+1". Thus, the timeframes (Day 0, Day n) of Outcome Measures described in this study
      record are different to that denoted in the full protocol document posted.
