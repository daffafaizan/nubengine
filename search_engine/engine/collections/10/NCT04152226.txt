    
      Open- label, single- dose, dose escalating evaluation of the safety and tolerability of three
      dose levels of DBI-001 in patients with Tinea pedis.

      Study Objectives and Purpose The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of DBI-001 in patients with Tinea pedis. Secondly to evaluate presence or
      persistence of J. lividum of DBI-001 following a single application of DBI-001. Thirdly to
      see the effect on the abundance of T. rubrum. Lastly to see the effect of a single
      application of DBI-001 on the signs and symptoms of interdigital T. pedis.

      Tolerability will be evaluated through assessment of selected local signs and symptoms (pain
      / burning / stinging, pruritus, erythema, edema, and scabbing / crusting). Any local skin
      reaction that requires use of a concomitant therapy or study discontinuation will be reported
