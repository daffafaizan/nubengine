    
      Rationale:

      Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has been shown to cause less renal complications than tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF) while having the same virological efficacy against HIV and HBV
      infections. In a recent study from the USA and Japan, over 90% of HIV/HBV-coinfected
      individuals had a suppressed HBV viral load 48 weeks after TDF was replaced by TAF. Thus, TAF
      might be a valuable treatment option for HIV/HBV-coinfected individuals with TDF-toxicity,
      especially in the context of resistance to lamivudine and entecavir. However, the safety and
      efficacy of TAF has not been evaluated to date in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients with renal
      dysfunction.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To evaluate changes in glomerular and tubular renal function after switch from TDF to
           TAF in HIV/HBV coinfected patients with renal dysfunction

        -  To assess the HBV virological efficacy of TAF in HIV/HBV coinfected patients with renal
           dysfunction switching from TDF to TAF.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the percentage of and reasons for treatment interruptions

        -  To describe toxicity events including liver-related complications

        -  To evaluate changes in liver fibrosis

      Intervention:

      In eligible patients willing to participate and who have signed an informed consent TDF will
      be replaced by TAF on day 1 of the study.

      Products:

        -  Tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC) Dose: one tbl. once per day in addition to
           at least one third compound OR

        -  Elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF) Dose: one
           tbl. once per day

      Study Population: eligible patients from all 7 centers of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study will be
      considered.
