    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity of sargramostim (GM-CSF) and filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized
           interleukin-2(IL-2)-incubated autologous peripheral blood stem cells and sequential IL-2
           in patients with solid tumors or lymphoma.

        -  Determine the ability of cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel followed by GM-CSF and G-CSF to
           mobilize adequate numbers of CD34+ cells and immune cells in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the overall and disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 and paclitaxel IV over
      4 hours on day 2. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) alone on
      days 3-9 and GM-CSF and filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 10 and continuing until
      leukapheresis is completed.

      Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy comprising oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to
      -6, melphalan IV on days -5 and -4, and thiotepa IV on days -3 and -2. Autologous peripheral
      blood stem cells (PBSC) are treated ex vivo with interleukin-2 (IL-2) on day -1. Patients
      undergo IL-2-treated autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0.

      Beginning 4 hours after PBSC transplantation, patients receive IL-2 IV continuously for 5
      days. IL-2 therapy repeats every 7 days for 4 courses.

      Patients are followed on days 60-80, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
