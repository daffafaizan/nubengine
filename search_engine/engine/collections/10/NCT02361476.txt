      Clonidine is widely used off-label in children for several indications such as treatment
      and/or prevention of postoperative agitation when anaesthetised with Sevoflurane. However,
      the current level of evidence in support of Clonidine treatment for postoperative agitation
      in children remains limited. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous
      Clonidine in children is not well characterized for age-groups.

      METHODS/DESIGN:

      In this prospective multicentre double-blinded randomized clinical trial, the investigators
      aim to investigate the impact of intravenous (IV) Clonidine administered at the end of
      surgery, on the incidence and degree of postoperative agitation. Children will be assigned to
      either the intervention or the placebo group. The allocation will be carried out centrally
      and stratified based on age and trial-site, with152 patients allocated to each group. In the
      intervention group, 3 micrograms per kg of IV clonidine is administered approximately 20
      minutes before the expected completion of the surgery (as assessed by the surgeon). In the
      control group; Saline (placebo) is injected in equal quantity during surgery at the same
      time. The drugs are concealed in identical blinded ampoules.

      The primary outcome is postoperative agitation measured on the Watcha scale. Secondary
      outcomes include measurements of postoperative pain relief and adverse effects, including
      30-day follow-up.

      Twenty of the patients age 1-2 years and twenty age >2 years, with a peripheral venous access
      in place, will be allocated to drug assay sampling; enabling a compartmental PK analysis
      based on age group, using non-linear mixed effects models.
