      accepted that all SSc cases have a progressive and usually devastating course. Since
      vasculopathy precedes fibrosis in this disease, a focus on understanding its natural history
      and preventative measures for vascular dysfunction has profound implications. This pilot work
      suggests that measurement of endothelial dysfunction with flow mediated dilatation (FMD)
      holds promise as novel method to assess disease progression as well as the therapeutic
      efficacy of the pharmacologic compound tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in SSc. The investigators
      believe that BH4, which targets the endothelium, has great promise to reduce SSc-related
      tissue hypoxia, end organ damage, and potentially may impact underlying disease progression.
      The first aim will adopt an integrative approach and validate a novel, non-invasive
      technique, FMD to define vasculopathy in SSc. The second aim and third aim (which is reported
      in this PRS report) will examine if BH4 is effective in ameliorating vascular dysfunction in
      patients with SSc and determine the role of oxidative stress in BH4-mediated improvements in
      vascular function in patients with SSc. The overarching goal of these aims is to improve
      vasculopathy detection and management in Veterans with SSc.
