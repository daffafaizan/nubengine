      obstructive pulmonary disease patients. (COPD).

      Aspergillosis disease are very difficult to be diagnosed or treated. Isolation of aspergillus
      in sputum of patients is not always responsible of a real disease. Need of treatment is
      discussed. That is why, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate aspergillus
      rate in respiratory samples of COPD patients (GOLD stage III or IV)
