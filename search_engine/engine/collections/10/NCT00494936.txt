      successfully treated with 6 to 12 months of medication in both HIV infected and HIV
      uninfected people. Among HIV infected people, HCV infection is a common co-morbidity, and is
      more serious when it occurs in this population than others because it leads to liver damage
      more quickly. HIV is known to cause neurological deficits, and studies suggest that HCV may
      do so, as well. Knowledge about how to treat these deficits, however, is limited. More
      information about the nature of the neurological problems and their causes is needed to
      develop effective treatments. This study will determine the effects that HIV and HCV have on
      thinking abilities, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving, and whether the viruses
      affect brain chemistry.

      Participants in this 4-year, observational study will undergo a series of tests and
      interviews. Participants may choose to complete all procedures over 2 days or three
      appointments. Procedures will include a 20-minute medical interview, a 4-hour
      neuropsychological evaluation, a 5-minute functional ability questionnaire, blood and urine
      collection (approximately 15 minutes), and a 1-hour magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test of
      the head. The neuropsychological evaluation will test participants' memory, concentration,
      reasoning, and speed of thinking. All procedures will be completed over approximately 6
      hours.
