      be treated with the new DES in 2 sessions (second one approximately 3-5 weeks after the first
      one). We will assess lesions by OFDI after the implantation and at the time of 3 months
      follow-up, when we will ask patients to undergo a coronary angiography. Patients will then
      have a follow-up contact at 1 year after initial implantation.
