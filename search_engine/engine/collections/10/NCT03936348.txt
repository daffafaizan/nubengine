      situations and is a nasal ventilatory flow restriction device made by a strip of
      hypoallergenic material (3M Spain, S.A. Medical Specialties / O.E.M.) that is placed and
      adhered under the nostrils impairing the free pass of air through the nose by producing
      resistance to flow. Depend on the size or/and porosity of the device, the inspiratory process
      is more or less difficult. It can be used while performing dynamic exercise or doing daily
      living activities. The Feelbreathe® device (FB) has been authorized by the Spanish Agency for
      Medicines and Health Products for application on COPD patients (Expedient 521/15/EC.
      AEMPS-Madrid-Spain-Patent Nº: P200902402).
