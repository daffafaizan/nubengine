      leukemia and other hematologic malignancies. However, a major limitation of this therapy is
      that for a significant number of patients no fully HLA-matched donor can be found. The
      application of partially HLA-matched (haploidentical) family donors, who are virtually always
      available, has some complications. If there is no T-cell add-back it increases the risk for
      life-threatening infections and disease relapse, while in case of T-cell add-back the risk
      for graft-versus-host disease is raised.

      Kiadis Pharma has developed a method to selectively deplete host alloreactive T-cells through
      photodynamic therapy, using TH9402 ex vivo. The donor lymphocyte preparation depleted of
      functional host alloreactive T-cells (ATIR) is administered to the patient 28-42 days after
      the stem cell transplant.
