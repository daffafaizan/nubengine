      relapse and initial diagnosis. This drug appears to have less adverse effects compared to
      other drugs used against brain tumors. Therefore, temozolomide is often better tolerated in
      brain tumor patients compared to other brain tumor drugs. The current study builds on
      previous research to test the efficacy of chemotherapy alone in patients with anaplastic
      oligodendroglioma and mixed oligoastrocytoma.

      Purpose:

      This study will evaluate response rate, or how the disease size changes in patients, and
      survival without disease growth, in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma and mixed
      oligoastrocytoma treated with temozolomide. Quality of life will also be assessed in this
      patient population treated with the study regimen.

      Treatment:

      Study participants will be treated with the drug temozolomide. This drug will be administered
      in oral pills. Temozolomide will be taken for seven consecutive days followed by seven days
      without the drug. This treatment schedule of seven days on temozolomide followed by seven
      days off will continue throughout the study. Several tests and exams will be given to closely
      monitor patients. MRI scans will be performed every 8 weeks to measure disease response.
      Temozolomide as a study drug will be given to study participants for a total of 8 week four
      cycles. However, treatments will be discontinued due to disease growth or unacceptable
      adverse events.
