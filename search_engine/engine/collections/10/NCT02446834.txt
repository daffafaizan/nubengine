    
      We designed a non randomized control study to compare the efficacy between intensive
      lifestyle intervention and drugs (GLP-1 Receptor Agonists, metformin and acarbose) for PCOS
      patients with early onset diabetes in their metabolic and reproductive abnormalities
      treatment We planed to enroll 48 patients.Overweight and obese PCOS patients with newly
      diagnosed IGT; PCOS diagnosis based on 1990 NIH criteria. Overweight / obesity diagnostic
      criteria according to WHO-WPR. IGT diagnostic criteria according to 1998 WHO diagnostic
      criteria. Except for serious complications (cardiovascular events and recent significant
      kidney or lung disease within 3 months), and had high blood pressure (>160/100mmHg), blood
      sugar and high blood lipids (glycated hemoglobin> 11%, triglycerides >600 mg/dl).

      Then we devided the 48 patients into 4 groups: intensive lifestyle intervention group, GLP-1
      group, metformin group and acarbose group, and each group 12 samples. Each group use specific
      treatment(showed as the group name) 3 months. Before and after the intervention, the blood
      samples would be collected to Glucose, Insulin, GLP-1, Glucagon, sex hormones, Blood
      chemistry for liver and kidney function ect, as well as the image examinations.

      We will compare the data of each patient, finally identify the treatment effect and mechanism
      of intensive lifestyle intervention to PCOS.
