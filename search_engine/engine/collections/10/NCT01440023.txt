      program as an adjunctive intervention for the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics
      (CBIT). Our central hypothesis is that cognitive training designed to enhance RI will
      potentiate treatment outcomes of CBIT. To this end, the investigators will conduct a two-arm
      placebo-controlled double-blind trial, in which 20 children with TS will be randomly assigned
      to CBIT with computerized RI training (CBIT+RIT; n=10) or CBIT with placebo computer training
      (CBIT +PLT; n=10). CBIT consists of eight weekly sessions that present awareness training,
      competing response training, relaxation training and functional contingency management in a
      manualized format. The adjunctive computer training (RIT or PLT) will be delivered during the
      first 4 weeks of CBIT/HRT (i.e. 8 twice-weekly 40-min sessions). Tic symptoms and RI
      capabilities will be assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 1 month
      follow-up. This project is expected to increase our understanding about the nature of
      response inhibition deficits in TS and generate knowledge that will guide the development of
      effective cognitive interventions for TS.
