      will be randomly divided into Group-A and B through the envelope method of simple random
      sampling. Patients in Group-A will be receiving VR based motor priming intervention while
      Group-B patients will be receiving Motor-Relearning Program as conventional therapy. Whereas,
      both the groups will be given 16 sessions of their respective protocol, comprising of 45
      minutes, 4 times/week for the duration of 4 weeks. Pre and post assessment will be performed
      for each patient on all three quantitative outcome measures i.e. FMA-UE, CAHAI-13, and MoCA.
      A trial will be terminated, if the patient reported fatigue of >8 out of 10 on the Visual
      Analogue Scale, unable to execute movements, reports pain, eye strain, or signs of volitional
      fatigue in hemiplegic or non-hemiplegic extremities.
