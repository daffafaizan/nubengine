      heart failure and progressive left ventricular dysfunction One of the proposed mechanisms
      responsible for this observation is reduction in myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density
      due to elevated cell membrane protein G - protein coupled receptor kinase -2 (GRK2).

      It is known that exercise training preserves heart function in patients who have suffered a
      myocardial infarction. The mechanism for this is not clear.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of exercise training on myocardial
      function and GRK2 levels in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, with the
      hypothesis that exercise training in this population reduces GRK2 levels and preserves or
      improves myocardial function.
