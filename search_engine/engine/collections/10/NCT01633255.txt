    
      BACKGROUND:

        -  Fluciclatide is a small cyclic peptide containing the RGD tri-peptide, which
           preferentially binds with high affinity to Alpha(v)Beta(3) integrins, which are
           up-regulated in and may regulate angiogenesis.

        -  Alpha(v)Beta(3) integrins are also expressed on certain types of tumor cells, such as
           renal cell cancer.

        -  [18F] Fluciclatide (previously known as 18F-AH111585) is a new radiopharmaceutical
           developed for PET imaging, which targets Alpha(v)Beta(3) receptors.

        -  Initial and ongoing clinical studies performed in Europe and an ongoing multicenter
           phase 2 proof-of-concept study (which is currently open at the NIH Clinical Center);
           demonstrate to date that [18F] Fluciclatide is safe and well tolerated.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      - To determine tumor uptake and retention of [18F] Fluciclatide before and after 1 cycle of
      treatment with targeted anti-angiogenic therapy in renal cell cancer.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Adult subjects (greater than or equal to18 years old), with documented renal or
           metastatic renal cancer, with at least one tumor greater than or equal to1 cm in
           diameter outside of the liver, who are scheduled to enroll in a therapy protocol using
           an anti-angiogenic agent.

        -  The subject has a platelet count of >100,000 times 10(6)/L, hemoglobin value of >9 g/dL,
           prothrombin time (PT) and an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) within <2
           times normal limits.

        -  The subject has not received any targeted anti-angiogenic agents within 60 days prior to
           pre-treatment (baseline) [18F] Fluciclatide PET imaging.

      DESIGN:

      This will be a pilot, open-label, proof-of-concept study to assess the magnitude of changes
      in [18F] Fluciclatide PET tumor uptake following treatment with an anti-angiogenic therapy.
      We expect to enroll 30 evaluable patients in this single center study. When possible, the
      data analysis will be stratified based on the anti-angiogenic agent received. Subjects will
      undergo at least two [18F] Fluciclatide PET/CT imaging studies, one pre-therapy and one
      following completion of 1 cycle of therapy. An optional early post-therapy (2-7 days post
      therapy commencement) [18F] Fluciclatide PET/CT may be performed. The magnitude of [18F]
      Fluciclatide uptake on the preand post- treatment PET/CT studies will be evaluated to
      determine if there is a measureable difference in uptake. Subjects may also undergo standard
      of care imaging studies as part of routine tumor assessments specified in referring protocols
      (e.g. diagnostic CT, FDG-PET/CT, etc). Data from the subject s referring therapy protocol
      will be reviewed for up to one year after anti-angiogenic therapy initiation to assess for
      tumor response or progression and its relationship to [18F] Fluciclatide PET/CT imaging. Some
      patients will also undergo optional DCE-MRI scans of the target lesion and in those subjects
      a comparison between MR parameters and [18F]

      Fluciclatide parameters will be made.
