      to 15%. Vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the child,
      post-concussion dizziness as a result of cranial trauma, and viral vestibular neuritis are
      the most common causes. However, these disorders are often undiagnosed in children as many
      doctors may attribute these symptoms to behavioural disorders or clumsiness. This is probably
      because of the difficulty children may have in expressing or describing their dizziness
      symptoms without specific questioning, but also because of the tendency of children to accept
      the terminology that an adult offers them or even tend to cling to their parents when they
      experience a balance disorder or vertigo. Vestibular disorders can also have secondary
      psychological symptoms with an impact on school learning and quality of life. A precise
      interrogation to check the symptoms, to look for the triggers and to trace the installation
      of the symptoms is fundamental to diagnose and make a therapeutic decision. Thus, it is very
      important to help the child express his or her feelings by proposing different descriptions
      and formulations to determine the etiology and diagnosis. While a number of international
      questionnaires validated and translated into French exist in the adult to assess the
      presence, severity and impact of vestibular symptoms, there is currently no score in French
      for evaluating disorders of the child's balance. Only one questionnaire was validated in the
      child in English in 2016, the " Pediatric Vestibular Symptom Questionnaire ". The objective
      of the research is to validate the French translation of this questionnaire.
