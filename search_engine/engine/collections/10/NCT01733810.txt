      causing injury. Newer data suggest that reflux of gastric juice into the esophagus stimulates
      HIF-2a, which increases production of inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are thought to
      lead to reflux esophagitis. The investigators plan to study the relationship of HIF-2a to
      inflammatory cytokines in patients with known gastroesophageal reflux disease and reflux
      esophagitis.
