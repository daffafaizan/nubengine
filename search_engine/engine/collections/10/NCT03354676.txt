      recent years. Currently, adipose tissue is considered to be a true endocrine gland that
      fulfills multiple roles in regulating different biological functions. Communication between
      adipose tissue and the rest of the systems is accomplished through bioactive mediators
      (adipokines) Adipokines control energy homeostasis and are involved in metabolic, endocrine
      and immunological processes.This study aimed to investigate the relationship between markers
      of adiposity like leptin, adiponectin and high sensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP) in obese
      children, and to determine whether these adipokines are significant markers in defining
      metabolic syndrome in pediatric population.The current retrospective observational study was
      conducted at the "Louis Turcanu" Emergency Hospital Timisoara over a period of one year, from
      July 2013 and June 2014. All inborn patient files were analyzed as anonymised limited data
      sets from archived records of the Endocrinology, Diabetology and Cardiology department.
