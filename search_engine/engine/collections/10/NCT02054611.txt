    
      In this LUNG-SAFE sub-study, the investigators will evaluate the effect of a brief online
      educational module on correctly identifying patients (i.e., standardized cases) with ARDS
      according to the Berlin Definition.

      The investigators hypothesize that the training from the educational module will allow more
      accurate diagnosis of ARDS according to the Berlin Definition by participating data
      collectors/study coordinators.

      Data collectors and study coordinators from ICUs participating in LUNG-SAFE would be
      randomized (by simple random number generator) to one of the following online educational
      streams:

        1. Educational module completion followed by evaluation

        2. Evaluation followed by educational module completion

      Limited demographic data will be collected from the respondents, along with their responses
      to the 15 multiple choice test questions. Time spent viewing the educational module will also
      be collected.
