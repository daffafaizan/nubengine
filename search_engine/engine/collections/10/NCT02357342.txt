      treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Over the course of the six month trial plus a 6 month optional
      extension, subjects will be evaluated monthly. Treatment with Sirolimus will be given at
      baseline, month 2 and month 4 with sham injections given at months 1, 3 and 5. For subjects
      in the extension Sirolimus will also be given at months 6, 8 and 10 with sham at month 7, 9,
      and 11. Subjects in the standard of care group will receive anti-VEGF injections or sham
      monthly. Retreatment criteria will be based upon continued subretinal edema, intraretinal
      edema or active chorioretinal neovascularization (CNV)
