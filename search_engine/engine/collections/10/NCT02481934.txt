      disease after induction therapy. Peripheral blood from patients will be collected every cycle
      (n=4) to produce NKAEs under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell (PBMCs) will be co-cultured with a genetically modified cell line
      (K562-mb15-41BBL) and 100 IU/ml interleukin-2.

      Treatment consists of 4 cycles of anti-myeloma consolidation treatment with two infusions of
      NKAEs every day 1 and 8 of each cycle. Usually, chosen treatment regime will be bortezomib
      (Velcade) or lenalidomide (Revlimid). These treatments are used to be combined with
      corticosteroid medications which needs to be suspended before NKAEs infusions. A washout
      period of 2 weeks is required.

      NKAEs dose of cells will be constant, 7.5x106/kg. There will be an interim analysis
      intra-cohort one week after the first batch of two infusions. If at the analysis no grade IV
      adverse effect is observed we will proceed to the second cycle and the inclusion of other
      patients.
