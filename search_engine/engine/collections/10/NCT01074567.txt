    
      The modern treatment of IC is a multi-modal treatment which includes behavioural treatment,
      physiotherapy of the pelvic floor musculature, oral medication (e.g. Amitryptiline) and
      intra-vesical instillation (e.g. DMSO, steroids, heparin). These treatments were found to be
      effective in a number of studies and are approved by the FDA. However, the optimal duration
      of intra-vesical instilation is not known.

      All patients with IC (according to the international continence society criteria) will
      receive 12 weekly intra-vesical instillation of DMSO. All patients will fill an O'leary-Sant
      questionaire and a urination diary before treatment, after 3, 6, 9 and 12 treatments and at 6
      weeks, 3, 6 and 12 month after the end to the treatment.
