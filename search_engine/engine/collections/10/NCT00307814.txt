      Disease (CKD). Epoetin alfa has been shown to increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels by an average
      of 1.5 g/dL to 2 g/dL in these patients over 12 weeks (Data on file Ortho Biotech Products,
      L.P.). This improvement in Hb levels is maintained while the patient is receiving Epoetin
      alfa and is associated with significant improvements in survival, exercise tolerance, and
      quality of life. Literature has suggested that epoetin alfa can be given less frequently and
      still maintain an optimal hemoglobin while also allowing patient's greater convenience. This
      study will further confirm that less frequent dosing of epoetin alfa is safe and effective.
      This is an open-label, randomized multicenter study in patients with CKD. CKD patients who
      are currently receiving PROCRIT therapy for at least 2 months or more and with a stable Hb
      (>= 11g/dL) will be randomized to one of four treatment groups. A stable Hemoglobin will be
      defined as a value that is Â± 10% for 3 consecutive laboratory values.

      This study is designed to demonstrate that there is no meaningful difference in hemoglobin
      level with more extended dosing regimens as compared to once weekly. A clinically meaningful
      difference is defined as a difference that is less than 10%. Patients will be randomized to
      one of 4 treatment groups: All will receive subcutaneous (under the skin) Epoetin alfa for a
      period of 16 weeks.

      Group 1: 10,000 units every week Group 2: 20,000 units every two weeks Group 3: 30,000 units
      every three weeks Group 4: 40,000 units every four weeks
