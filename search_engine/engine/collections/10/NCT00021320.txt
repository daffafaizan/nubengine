        -  Determine the median and two-year disease-free and overall survival of patients with
           resectable esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant paclitaxel, cisplatin, and
           fluorouracil with concurrent radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the complete and partial responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the optimal dose of paclitaxel when administered in this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the effect of tumor tubulin isoform expression on chemosensitivity and overall
           survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses.

      Beginning 3 weeks after completion of initial chemotherapy, patients receive concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days
      1, 8, 15, 22, and 29; fluorouracil IV continuously for 5 weeks; and radiotherapy daily 5 days
      a week for 5 weeks.

      At 4-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients may undergo surgical resection.
      Patients with local progressive disease after 2 courses of initial chemotherapy undergo
      surgical resection instead of receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients are followed within 6 weeks, every 3 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
