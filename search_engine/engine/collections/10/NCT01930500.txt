      employment. High quality research on the best and most cost-effective rehabilitation methods
      is needed.

      Objective: To study whether neuropsychological rehabilitation improves the psychosocial
      wellbeing and perceived cognitive deficits in dyslexic young adults and to evaluate potential
      differences between individual and group based neuropsychological rehabilitation.

      Methods: Altogether 120 young adults diagnosed with dyslexia are randomized either to one of
      the intervention groups (individual neuropsychological rehabilitation / group
      neuropsychological rehabilitation) or to a control group which will receive either one of the
      interventions after a 5 month waiting period. All the study subjects are assessed with a
      short neuropsychological test battery as well as self-rating questionnaires evaluating mood,
      QoL, perceived cognitive deficits, and the impact of the learning disability at baseline,
      after five months (immediately after interventions or control period) and after 10 months.
      After 20 months a shorter follow-up using only self-ratings will be done via mail. Subjects
      in the intervention groups are offered neuropsychological rehabilitation in 12 sessions
      conducted once a week or once in two weeks during five months. Subjects in the control group
      do not receive any intervention for the first five months.

      Results: The effects of interventions on psychosocial wellbeing and perceived cognitive
      deficits are evaluated using appropriate statistical procedures and comparing the differences
      between the interventions groups and the control group.

      The present status: All the interventions are completed, follow-up data is still beeing
      collected
