      Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease
      characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation
      that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and
      deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and
      respiratory failure. There are limited data available on the natural course of this disease
      over time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form.
