      Chase Cancer Center. These patients will have already undergone Low Anterior Resection with a
      diverting stoma (colostomy or ileostomy) and will be planning on undergoing reversal of their
      stoma in the near future. Subjects will be recruited over a period of 1 year. Such clinic
      patients' medical records will be reviewed to determine whether they are possible candidates
      for inclusion in the study. They will be identified based on their diagnosis of either Stage
      II or III rectal cancer as stated in prior clinic notes, pathology reports, or radiologic
      image reports. Participants must have previously undergone Low Anterior Resection with a
      diverting stoma and the surgical plan must be for them to undergo ostomy reversal. They will
      be approached during a clinic visit by either a co-investigator or a member of the surgery
      team (fellow or surgeon) or a research coordinator delegate and asked to participate in the
      research study. They will be given a document for informed consent that will describe the
      study and potential risks and benefits to the patient. The investigators plan to enroll 10
      patients at Fox Chase Cancer Center. Subjects will receive no monetary compensation
