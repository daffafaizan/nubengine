      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to evaluate the relationship between platelet counts, blood
      levels of a hormone called thrombopoietin that controls platelet production by the bone
      marrow, and blood levels of antibodies against thrombopoietin that could interfere with the
      action of this hormone. Blood samples will also be stored if separately agreed to by the
      patient for analysis of genes that might affect platelet production. At a single outpatient
      clinic visit, patients will have a medical history taken, and blood samples drawn for
      testing. Results from this study may help further understand the control of platelet
      production in patients with ITP, and suggest new therapeutic approaches.
