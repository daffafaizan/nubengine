      maternal abdomen. Our null hypothesis is that there is a correlation between fetal heart rate
      changes and pressure exerted on the fetus through the maternal abdomen.

      Women at term pregnancy coming for a routine cardiotocography monitor, will undergo 5 minutes
      of quantified pressure on their abdomen, using the electronic pressure sensor. The amount of
      pressure will be recorded as well as the fetal heartbeat baseline and changes to the heart
      rate following the application of pressure.
