      cancer (NSCLC). In a phase III study for patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC, the
      efficacy of single-agent pemetrexed, as determined by overall survival, was similar to that
      of docetaxel. (Hanna et al, 2004) The combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed has been of
      particular interest because it has demonstrated both good efficacy and a tolerable side
      effect profile. Phase I studies evaluated pemetrexed plus carboplatin in patients with
      malignant pleural mesothelioma, showed the regimen was efficacious and well tolerated.
      (Hughes et al, 2002) The combination of oxaliplatin and pemetrexed was compared with
      carboplatin and pemetrexed as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC in a randomized phase II
      study. Response rates were 27 and 33%, respectively, and not statistically different.
      Toxicity in the carboplatin/pemetrexed arm was low, this doublet can be delivered easily and
      is well tolerated. Dose reductions occur only in 3.7% cycles. (Scagliotti et al, 2005)
      Therefore, it seems reasonable to test a less toxic regimen in patients with NSCLC after
      complete (R0) resection of the tumor, where reduced toxicities might improve the feasibility
      of drug delivery, compliance and the convenience of treatment for the patient and hence
      perhaps improve survival. The main purpose of this randomized phase II trial is to evaluate
      the clinical feasibility and activity of administering adjuvant chemotherapy of
      pemetrexed/carboplatin compared with vinorelbine/carboplatin in patients with completely
      resected NSCLC.
