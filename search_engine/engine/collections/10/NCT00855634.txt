      operating procedures in patients with pancreatic cancer and minimal metastatic disease or
      venous infiltration. Patients will be randomized intraoperatively after fulfilling all
      inclusion criteria (in particular: suspicion of cancer of the pancreas and an intraoperative
      histologically proven diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma; intraoperative assessment of
      tumor as potentially locally respectable). If no metastases and no infiltration of the portal
      vein are detected during the operation, the standard resection will be performed (for tumors
      of the pancreatic head: (pylorus-preserving) pancreaticoduodenectomy; for tumors of the
      pancreatic body/tail: distal (left) pancreatic resections; for tumors of the head and
      body/tail: total pancreatectomy). In the case of tumor infiltration of the pyloric region or
      the distal stomach, a classical pancreaticoduodenectomy will be performed.

      If the patient has pancreatic cancer with minimal metastatic disease (COHORT 1) and fulfills
      all inclusion criteria, she/he will be randomized into one of the following arms:

        -  Arm 1 (intervention): resection of the primary tumor, followed by resection of the liver
           metastasis/metastases

        -  Arm 2 (control): exploration and/or gastroenterostomy and/or
           hepaticojejunostomy/choledochojejunostomy

      If there are no liver metastases, following mobilization (and potentially also the dissection
      of the pancreas at the pancreatic head), the extension of the tumor towards the superior
      mesenteric/splenic/portal vein is examined. If there is venous infiltration (COHORT 2) and
      the patient fulfills the inclusion criteria, she/he will be randomized into one of the
      following arms:

        -  Arm 1 (intervention): resection of the primary tumor with resection of the portal vein
           (and/or superior mesenteric vein/splenic vein (SMV/SV)

        -  Arm 2 (control): resection of the primary tumor with dissection of the portal vein
           (and/or superior mesenteric vein/splenic vein (SMV/SV) plus tumor masses adjacent to
           these veins; no venous resection The aim of this study is to demonstrate that an
           extension of the resectability criteria in patients with pancreatic cancer and 1)
           minimal metastatic disease OR 2) venous infiltration improves overall survival. A
           secondary aim of the study is to prove that resection in these patient cohorts improves
           quality of life.
