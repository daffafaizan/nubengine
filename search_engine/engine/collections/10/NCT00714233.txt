    
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition associated with irregular menstrual cycles,
      (due to lack of regular ovulation), and evidence of elevated androgen (male hormone) levels,
      such as unwanted hair growth or acne. This condition often becomes recognized at the time of
      puberty. The standard treatment for this condition is oral contraceptive pills, which are
      used not for contraception, but to cause a regular, monthly bleeding pattern.

      Many adolescents with PCOS have increased levels of insulin, a hormone that controls the
      body's sugar balance. These increased insulin levels may play a role in the development of
      polycystic ovary syndrome. There are several medications now available, which can decrease
      the insulin levels by improving the action of insulin in the body. Metformin is one of these
      drugs. Metformin is a drug currently used in the management of diabetes to control blood
      sugar. It is hoped that by lowering the insulin levels some of the symptoms of polycystic
      ovary syndrome, such as the lack of regular periods and unwanted hair growth, can be reversed
      or diminished.
