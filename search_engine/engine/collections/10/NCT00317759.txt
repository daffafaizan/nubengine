      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of adoptive immunotherapy comprising autologous CD8+
           antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones after fludarabine in patients with
           stage IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of these CTL clones in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor effect of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis or weekly phlebotomy for the collection of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells from which autologous antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)
      clones are generated. Patients receive autologous antigen-specific CD8+ CTL clones IV over
      30-60 minutes on days 0 and 21 in the absence of rapid disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients also receive fludarabine IV once daily on days 14-18.

      Patients are followed for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
