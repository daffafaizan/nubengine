      obstruction (pancreas cancer, duodenal cancer, gastric cancer and metastasis) in patients not
      fit for surgical bypass. The technical success in placing these stents approaches ~100% and
      many of these procedures can be performed in an outpatient setting. However the functional
      success (patient's ability to eat) is much lower than the technical success. One of the major
      reasons for this discrepancy is these patients are on narcotics, which are known to be
      associated with poor gastric motility. At the discretion of the gastroenterologist, FDA
      approved enteral stents are placed either completely within the duodenum bridging the
      obstruction or placed across the pyloric opening besides bridging the duodenal obstruction.
      The significance of this study is to determine if trans-pyloric extension of an
      intra-duodenal stent facilitates better gastric emptying compared to an intra-duodenal stent
      without trans-pyloric extension.
