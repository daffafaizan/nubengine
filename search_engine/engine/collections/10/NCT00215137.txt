    
      OCD is a chronic and disabling disorder for which Selective Serotonin Reuptake
      Inhibitor(SSRI) drugs can be effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects
      of an SSRI, escitalopram, in OCD patients.

      This study will last 16 weeks and will comprise 2 phases. Phase 1 is an open label in which
      all participants will receive daily escitalopram for 8 weeks. Those who have responded to
      treatment at the end of the 8 weeks will be randomly assigned to either continue or
      discontinue their treatment for an additional 8 weeks. Those who do not respond to treatment
      at the end of Phase 1 will discontinue the study and be offered three free visits with a
      study clinician or referred elsewhere for treatment, based on the their preference. Study
      visits are made at baseline, and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 in Phase 1 and Weeks 12 and 16 in
      Phase 2.
