    
      Study AT1001-041 was an open-label, noncomparative, multicenter, long-term extension study
      for participants with Fabry disease who completed treatment in one of three previous trials
      of migalastat (AT1001-011 [NCT00925301], AT1001-012 [NCT01218659], or FAB-CL-205
      [NCT00526071]). In these trials, migalastat was given as monotherapy. This was an extension
      study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of migalastat for the treatment
      of Fabry disease. Study visits occurred every 6 months (m). Visit evaluations included
      physical examinations, clinical laboratory parameters, adverse events, and participant
      reported outcomes.

      The study consisted of a Baseline Visit, which was performed at the time of the final visit
      of the previous study, followed by clinic visits every 6 m for each year of the study. Study
      assessments included a physical examination, echocardiography, laboratory parameters, and
      participant-reported outcomes. Since participants enrolled in the study at varying time
      points based on the completion of the preceding migalastat study, treatment duration varied
      among participants. No maximum treatment duration was defined. There were no control groups
      in this study; all participants received migalastat as a 150-mg capsule taken orally once
      every other day (QOD) and inactive reminder capsules on alternate days.

      The sponsor (Amicus Therapeutics) discontinued Study AT1001-041 for logistical reasons and
      not due to either safety concerns or lack of efficacy. For participants who were ongoing in
      Study AT1001-041 at the time of discontinuation, the investigators were offered participation
      in a similar open-label, long-term migalastat treatment study (AT1001-042 [NCT02194985]) for
      participants ongoing at discontinuation.
