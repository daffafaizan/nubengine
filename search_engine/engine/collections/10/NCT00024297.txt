        -  Determine the utility of warfarin in reducing thrombosis rates in cancer patients with
           central venous catheters.

        -  Compare the thrombosis rates in patients treated with different warfarin dosing
           schedules.

        -  Compare the adverse events and survival of patients receiving or not receiving this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      sclerosant potential of cytotoxic regimen (low vs high), site of placement of catheter
      (peripheral vs central), and duration of drug administration (brief infusion (under 24 hours)
      vs prolonged infusion (24 hours and over)). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive no warfarin.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral warfarin daily beginning 3 days before placement of
           central venous catheter (CVC) and continuing until CVC is removed or thrombosis occurs.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral warfarin as in arm II, with dose adjustment after CVC
           placement to achieve and maintain INR level.

      Patients are followed at 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,400 patients (400 in arm I, 700 in arm II, and 300 in arm
      III) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
