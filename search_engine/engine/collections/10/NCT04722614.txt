      assistance during intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations. This trial will be conducted in
      five general intensive care unit. One hundred and twenty patients will be enrolled in this
      study divided into three equal groups (40 patients in each group). Group A is the control
      group. Group B is music group. Group C is essential oil group. Agitated mechanically
      ventilated patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Each group will be
      subjected to its specific intervention and they will be monitored for seven days. Agitation
      score and frequency outcome will be assessed at the end of the study.
