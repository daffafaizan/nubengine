      surgery will be randomly selected to receive either a symbiotic formulation or placebo during
      the perioperative period. The researchers will compare incidence of surgical site infection,
      detected by clinical examination and complementary tests (CT scans, X-rays, microbiological
      and hematological tests) between the study groups.
