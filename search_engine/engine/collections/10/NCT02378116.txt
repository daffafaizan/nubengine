    
      Patients are included prior to surgery. An MRI is performed at baseline. At the day of
      surgery, patients is randomized to closure/left open left atrial appendage.

      During surgery, a maximum of 15 ml blood and a right atrium biopsy are taken for further
      analyses. Additionally, a biopsy of the left atrium appendage is collected from the group of
      patients randomized for closure.

      The study group recommend a double closure. After discharge a second MRI is performed and the
      final MRI is performed after a minimum of six months.

      The final contact with the patient is done one year after surgery at the earliest. Where a
      clinical interview is done over the phone and the patients clinical records are screened for
      cerebral ischaemic events and atrial fibrillation.

      During the study period, some patients are elected for a bicycle stress test to test for
      levels of neurohormones, and some are elected for monitoring with Holter.

      There will also be performed transesophageal echocardiography on interested patients in order
      to test for the quality of surgical closure.
