      Trachea-skin distance at the level of the thyroid isthmus; Trachea-skin distance at the
      jugular level Front commissure-skin distance; Distance from skin to the thyroid membrane
      Distance between hyoid bone and skin. Comparison of this measurement with HAN-scale for
      prediction of difficult mask ventilation during general anesthesia
