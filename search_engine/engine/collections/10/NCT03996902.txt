      evidence that smokers in pain may represent an important and large subgroup who experience
      unique barriers and greater difficulty quitting. Smoking has been identified as a risk factor
      in the onset and exacerbation of chronic pain, and smokers experience greater levels of pain
      intensity and disability, relative to non-smokers. Initial evidence indicates that quitting
      smoking may improve pain outcomes (e.g., lower pain intensity) and supports the notion that
      smoking cessation may be an essential behavior change for smokers in pain. However, the vast
      majority of smokers are not yet ready to engage a serious quit attempt, and evidence-based
      treatments for smoking cessation remain dramatically underutilized. Therefore, the goal of
      this study is to develop and pilot test a brief intervention that will address smoking in the
      context of pain in order to increase motivation to quit smoking and engagement of available
      smoking cessation treatment. Participants will be randomized to either the adapted brief
      motivational intervention or an intervention consistent with standard clinical practice
