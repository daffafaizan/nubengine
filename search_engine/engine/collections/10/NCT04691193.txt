      period of their life. 10% of low back pain becomes chronic and can affect the quality of life
      negatively and lead to disability. The STarT-Back-Tool was developed to identify people with
      poor prognosis, such as difficulty returning to work, loss of work force, disability. It has
      been reported that it would be beneficial to categorize patients according to their risk
      levels with this tool and plan treatment in primary care treatment centers. Being able to
      identify patients with a high probability of becoming chronic in the early period is very
      important to reduce or prevent disability that may occur. The aim of this study is to examine
      the effectiveness of StArt Back Tool test in determining prognosis and loss of workforce in
      patients presenting with low back pain complaints in the acute-subacute period and to examine
      the relationship between StArt Back Tool test and kinesophobia.
