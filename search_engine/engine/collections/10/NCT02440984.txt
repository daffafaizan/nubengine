      embryonic period. This malformation results in a variety of clinical disorders (neurologic,
      urologic, orthopedic, anorectal), depending on the level of the spinal cord lesion. Anorectal
      functional disorders remain underestimated and unknown from a pathophysiological point of
      view with subsequent uncodified therapeutic strategy.

      Patients with Spina Bifida always present autonomic neuropathy that contributes partially to
      the anorectal disorders. These disorders may be related to a closed relationship between
      autonomic and enteric nervous system. Both nervous systems play a key role in anorectal
      disorders during others neurological disaeses have a common and simultaneous development from
      neural crest and induce colonic epithelial changes related to the closed connection between
      epithelial barrier and enteric nervous system. All of this remains hypothetic because no data
      regarding the impairment of enteric nervous system and epithelial barrier are available and
      no study are ongoing on this topic.
