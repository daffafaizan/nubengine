      Despite a low incidence rate, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer
      mortality in both men and women. Today is the only potentially curative option of these
      patients complete surgical resection. However, a majority of the patients (up to 80%) are not
      eligible for surgery for different reasons.

      Today is gemcitabine the accepted first-line treatment for these patients. Recent advances in
      the management of pancreatic cancer suggest that gemcitabine may be improved by combining it
      with other anticancer drugs.

      One attractive therapeutic option is genistein. Genistein appears to sensitize tumors to
      chemotherapy both by targeting the tumor cells and also by targeting components of the tumor
      microenvironment.

      However, the limited bioavailability of genistein in its known crystalline form has led to
      difficulties in attaining adequate plasma concentration, resulting in limited application and
      dissemination in the clinical setting. To overcome this limitation, a novel crystalline form
      of genistein with improved pharmaceutical properties is being used. AXP107-11, a crystalline
      salt of genistein has improved physiochemical properties (solubility, dissolution rate,
      bioavailability) as compared to the known crystalline form of genistein.

      In this study, AXP107-11, will be investigated alone and in combination with gemcitabine in
      patients with pancreatic cancer.
