    
      Compared to the earlier study, this RCT will include:

        1. A focused program targeting supervisors and employees

        2. An active control group

        3. An evaluation of the effects on both supervisor and employee

        4. Knowledge on the mechanisms involved

        5. Replication and extension of earlier findings

      The project will produce knowledge about:

      A procedure for identifying individuals at risk for sick-leave. The effects of a program
      targeting both workplace and individual to prevent problems with stress and pain.

      The role of the supervisor in preventing sick-leave. Mechanisms linked to decreased levels of
      sick-leave.
