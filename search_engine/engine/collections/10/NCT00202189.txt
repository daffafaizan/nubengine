      study that will be conducted at this centre. Subjects will be required to complete four (4)
      visits to the laboratory over a one-month period.

      At Visit 1, subjects who meet all study inclusion and exclusion criteria, will have a full
      set of pulmonary function tests (PFT) done and complete a symptom-limited incremental cycle
      exercise test. At Visit 2, subjects will have a partial set of pulmonary function tests (PFT)
      done and complete a symptom-limited constant load cycle exercise test. On the third and
      fourth visit subjects will be randomized to treatment with either nebulized saline or
      nebulized PulmicortÂ® in a double blinded, cross-over design, subsequent to which they will
      have their PFT's and symptom limited constant load exercise testing done.
