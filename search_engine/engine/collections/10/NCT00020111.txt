        -  Determine the toxic effects of arsenic trioxide in pediatric patients with refractory
           leukemia or lymphoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease (acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL] vs non-APL).

        -  Stratum I (APL patients): Patients receive standard-dose arsenic trioxide IV over 2
           hours daily 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for up to 3
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Stratum II (Non-APL patients): Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
           arsenic trioxide (according to the stratum 1 schedule above) until the maximum tolerated
           dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
           least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
           determined, additional patients are accrued to receive treatment with arsenic trioxide
           at the recommended phase II dose.

      Leukemia patients in both strata without progressive disease who have not achieved complete
      remission after the first 20 doses may continue to receive arsenic trioxide for 2 additional
      weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for stratum I of this study
      within 2-3 years. A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for stratum II of this study
      within 1-2 years.
