      implantations in Sweden in 2008 all procedures have been added to a national database, which
      now contains 4500+ procedures. At the same time, all admissions to the hospital is also
      recorded with diagnosis in a separate database. We intend to make a nation-wide complete
      follow up of all TAVR/TAVI patients in swede that has received the diagnosis of infective
      endocarditis after the implantation. In addition data will also be collected from the
      national endocarditis database for detailed information of the cases.
