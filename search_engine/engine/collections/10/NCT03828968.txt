      the aged, the secondary ones are to evaluate the risk factors and complications of CUR.

      We will carry out this prevalence study in 5 centres whit a draw of 40 residents per centre.
      Following an information and a non-opposition of the patients, we will collect datas in their
      medical file (age, medical history and comorbidities, current treatments, anticholinergic
      score according to the ADS (Anticholinergic Drug Scale), GIR score according to the AGGIR
      scale (Autonomie GÃ©rontologique Groupes Iso Ressources), FAC modified score (Functional
      Ambulation Classification modified), MMSE score (Mini Mental State Examination),
      communicative capacity, notion of fall and date of last fall, knowledge of urinary
      incontinence, knowledge of constipation, knowledge of previous urinary screening by bladder
      scan and previous urological consulting, last urinalysis and its results, last analysis of
      creatinemia and creatinine clearance according to CKD-EPI) and we will perform up to 3
      measurements of vesical volume by bladder scan.

      The expected results are a prevalence of CUR between 10 and 20 % among people living in homes
      for the aged with more urinary tract infections, renal insufficiency and falls in the CUR
      group showing the interest of screening for CUR by bladder scan in elderly people living in
      nursing homes according to risk groups based on the risk factors found.
