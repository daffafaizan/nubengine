      demonstrating the superiority of the radial access over the femoral arterial approach, the
      radial artery puncture has become the first choice for elective and emergency coronary
      interventions. In addition to the often chosen access on the inside of the forearm, the
      course of the radial artery also allows a puncture further distal on the back of the hand. In
      the anatomical snuffbox, the diameter is still sufficient for the introduction of the usual
      sheath, however, the thrombogenic puncture at the proximal radial segment is avoided and a
      hemostasis by compression over the scaphoid is simplified.

      This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter study to systematically
      compare primary success rates and potential complications after distal transradial coronary
      angiography or coronary intervention versus proximal radial artery puncture over the wrist.
      Both puncture routes are well established in clinical routine and are used in both elective
      and emergency cardiac catheterization in the centers involved and worldwide. Systematic
      comparisons exist so far only in small series, but randomized and prospective data would be
      urgently needed in the frequent application. Both puncture sites are only 4-8 cm apart, so
      that many risks of a transradial examination (vascular injury and / or closure, perforation,
      spasm) are in principle common to both access sites.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the potential benefits of radial artery puncture
      in the back of the hand due to a reduced rate of chronic vascular occlusion compared to over
      the wrist, as well as complications (bleeding or nerve damage) and subjective tolerability (
      Pain) systematically.
