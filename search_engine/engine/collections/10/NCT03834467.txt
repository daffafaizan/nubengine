    
      Hypotheses and Specific Aims:

      Aim 1: Examine the similarities and differences in behaviors on the AlAn's Short Game v.2
      seen with the two Active Trial (AT) types (where Red Cross donation will be reduced and
      subject will gain money (AT1) vs. where the Red Cross donation will increase and study
      participants will lose money (AT2).

      Hypothesis 1: Number of accepted trials of AT1 and AT2 from session 1 will significantly
      correlate.

      Aim 2: Test the effects of Elevation vs. Nature video on change in AlAn's Short Game v.2
      behavior between sessions 1 and 2.

      Hypothesis 2: Subjects who view the Elevation stimulus video (study Arm 1) will show
      increases in prosocial behavior while those watching the Nature video will not.

      Aim 3: Test the association between psychopathic traits and Costly Helping and determine
      whether the influence of Elevation on Costly Helping dissipates with increasing levels of
      psychopathic traits.

      Hypothesis 3: Psychopathic traits, as measured by the Levenson Self Report Psychopathy Scale,
      will significantly and negatively correlate with the amount of prosocial behavior in session
      1.

      Hypothesis 4: Using subjects from study Arm 1, change in AlAn's Short game v.2 behavior
      (session 2 minus session 1) will be negatively correlated with psychopathic trait scores.
