      mouth after the birth. It is a noble practice in Islam, with which the newborn is greeted
      upon entering into life, usually before milk feeds. It is done by rubbing a softened date on
      the palate of the new-born just after the birth. The tahneek also exercises the muscles of
      the mouth and helps with the circulation of blood in the mouth - this may help the baby to be
      able to suck and take mother's milk. Neonatal hypoglycemia is common in the first few days
      after birth. Up to 15 % but the incidence in babies with risk factors is much greater upto 50
      % in infants of diabetic mothers, large and small babies and 66 % in preterm babies. Neonatal
      hypoglycemia is associated with brain damage, death and developmental delay in later life.
      Treatment of neonatal hypoglycemia with oral dextrose gel was more effective than feeding
      alone in reversing hypoglycemia, and thus reducing the rate of NICU admission for
      hypoglycemia. investigators study is using dates to asses its effect on hypoglycemia in
      infant at risk.
