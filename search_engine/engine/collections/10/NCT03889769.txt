      originates from follicular cells of thyroid gland, and represents over 80% of thyroid tumors.
      The incidence of PTC has progressively been increasing in the last decades, doubling since
      the 1970s, due to the diffusion of screening ultrasound. Although PTCs are considered
      slow-growing tumors, the incidence of node metastases is high, ranging from 20% to 90%. The
      real impact of node metastases on prognosis is still a matter of debate: reports in
      literature demonstrate a reduction of disease-free survival but are divergent on overall
      survival. Diagnostic tools have poor accuracy for central lymph node compartment, which is
      the most frequent site of metastases.

      The last guidelines suggest a prophylactic central lymph node compartment dissection (CLND)
      in patients with high-risk PTC; nevertheless, this indication meets resistance due to the
      higher incidence of postoperative complications, especially hypoparathyroidism and recurrent
      laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy.

      Recently, new molecular biologic techniques have spread widely, mainly in diagnosis of node
      metastases in breast carcinoma; these assays allow to quickly isolate, amplify and quantify
      mRNA encoding for proteins selectively present in neoplastic cells, as Cytokeratine-19
      (CK-19). One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) is routinely used in diagnosis of node
      metastasis in sentinel lymph node (SNL) of patients affected from breast cancer. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate if application of OSNA to intraoperative diagnosis of node
      metastases of PTC is possible.
