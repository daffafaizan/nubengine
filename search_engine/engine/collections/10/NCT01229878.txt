      study and consented. Those who meet the exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment or
      placebo. Enrolled participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive vitamin D (n=20) or placebo
      (n=10) for 6 months. All participants will be tested twice over two weeks to establish
      baseline values. Following baseline testing, the treatment group will receive 50,000 IU
      (standard replacement therapy) of oral cholecalciferol or placebo. The initial dose of
      cholecalciferol will be 50,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks. Vitamin D levels will then be measured.
      Participants who still have Vitamin D insufficiency ( 35 ng/ml) will remain on 50,000 IU of
      cholecalciferol for another 6 weeks, at which point Vitamin D levels will be measured again.
      Participants who reach 25-OH levels > 35 ng/ml will have their dosing regimen lessened to
      10,000 IU weekly (maintenance dose) for the remainder of the 6 months. Participants receiving
      placebo will start taking the placebo maintenance dose after the first 6 weeks. For safety
      monitoring, 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels will also be re-measured at monthly intervals and
      followed by an independent medical monitor. In patients who have serum vitamin D levels
      60ng/ml, the frequency of administration will be reduced to once a month. The participants
      will receive supplementation for a total of 6 months. At this time, vitamin D levels will be
      reassessed and participants will undergo follow-up functional assessments, and cognitive and
      immune testing.
