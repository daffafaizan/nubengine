      efficacy of the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline in the control of
      the Night Eating Syndrome (NES) and the unprecedented elevation in the level of serotonin
      transporter (SERT) binding in the midbrain of persons with NES. Our overall theory is that
      NES is associated with a syndrome-specific increase in SERT derived from a genetic
      vulnerability which is affected by life stress. This increased SERT activity produces a fall
      in post-synaptic serotonin levels. The investigators hypothesize that these decreased
      serotonin levels result in a significant phase delay in circadian food intake manifested by
      evening hyperphagia, nighttime ingestions and morning anorexia. SSRIs that block this
      increased SERT activity increase synaptic serotonin levels and restore the circadian rhythm
      of food intake.
