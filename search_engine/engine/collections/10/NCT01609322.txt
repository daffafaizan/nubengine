      than 5% of those who have never experienced a fall, experience moderate to severe fear of
      falling. Fear of falling leads to decreased physical activity, disability, loss of
      independence, depression, anxiety, reduced social engagement, and poor quality of life. It is
      also a major independent risk factor for falls.

      Interventions targeting fear of falling, typically delivered in groups and incorporating
      cognitive restructuring, education, and exercise, have been shown to increase fall-related
      self-efficacy. Avoidance is resistant to treatment, however, and more than one-third of
      patients enrolled in these interventions drop out. Factors associated with attrition include
      high levels of fear and avoidance, indicating that the individuals most in need of such
      programs are those most likely to withdraw prematurely. These data suggest that avoidance
      should be targeted in treatment, and that interventions should be designed to reach very
      fearful individuals who are most likely to drop out of traditional fear of falling programs.

      Participation in this study will last up to 8 months. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to receive either the ABLE intervention or an education control condition. The control
      condition will consist of in-person education about falls to control for the time and
      attention provided in the ABLE arm.
