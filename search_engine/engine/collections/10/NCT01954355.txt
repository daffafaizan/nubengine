    
      This is a multicenter, open label phase I dose-escalation trial of LDE225 administered once
      daily (OD) with Paclitaxel administered weekly for three weeks (days 1, 8, 15) in 28-day
      cycles in adult patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard
      therapy.

      The trial will consist of three parts. In Part A (dose escalation following a standard 3+3
      design), patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors will receive escalating doses
      of LDE225 in combination with standard Paclitaxel doses, to define the MTD and the RP2D of
      LED225 OD that can be given in combination with standard doses of Paclitaxel. Once the MTD
      and RP2D is established in 6 patients, then part B will start.

      Part B and C are expansion cohorts in patients with advanced platinum-resistant ovarian
      cancer (6 patients each) to further evaluate the safety of the combination and to assess for
      any preliminary antitumor activity.

      In Part B, any prior taxane therapy must have been administered on a 3-week schedule. In Part
      C, prior taxane therapy must have been administered on weekly schedule and has to be followed
      by a wash-out period of at least 6 months.
