      smokers will have two 4-day treatment periods, in which they will be randomized to
      varenicline (1 mg/day) or placebo. During the first 3 days of each treatment period, smokers
      will have daily clinic visits and receive their study medication. On Day 4, subjects will
      come to the laboratory, where they will receive ascending doses of intravenous (IV) nicotine
      (0.1, 0.4, and 0.7 mg per 70kg). This procedure will allow accurate assessment of varenicline
      effects on the subjective, physiological and cognitive responses to nicotine. Following a
      washout period, subjects will be crossed over to the alternative treatment.
