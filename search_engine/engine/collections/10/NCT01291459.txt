        -  To establish the ability of a Maraviroc-Raltegravir combination to maintain HIV-1 viral
           load < 50 copies/ml at week 48 in naive patients infected by CCR5 HIV-1, following an
           initial 6 month phase of Maraviroc-Raltegravir-Tenofovir-Emtricitabine combination
           (Intent to treat and strategy analysis)

        -  To study CD4 progression from baseline to week 48

        -  To study the time to virological failure during the simplification phase of the study
           (from week 24 to week 48)

        -  To study the proportion of patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies/ml at each time point

        -  To study the kinetics of viral load decrease from baseline to week 12

        -  To study the kinetics of proviral DNA decrease from baseline to week 12, 24, 36 and 48

        -  To study the clinical and biological tolerance of Maraviroc-Raltegravir combination
           through week 48

      Study Design/ Clinical Plan

      Pilot, multicenter, national, uncontrolled study
