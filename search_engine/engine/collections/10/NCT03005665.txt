      either sex in adult age group undergoing laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy. After getting
      approval from institutes ethical committee and written informed consent, Donors were randomly
      allocated to either of two group. Anaesthesia was induced with injection morphine 0.1 mg/kg,
      injection propofol 1-2 mg/kg and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Maintenance of anaesthesia was done
      with isoflurane and oxygen. After induction donors were placed into modified flank position
      with left side upward. Donors in Group A received Acetazolamide 5 mg/kg via orogastric tube
      soon after the induction of anaesthesia. Group S received saline as a placebo. investigator
      and subjects were blinded till the statistical analysis. Optic nerve sheath diameter was
      measured six times during perioperative periods by using high frequency ultrasound probe.
      Intra operative monitoring was done for Heart rate, Blood Pressure, pulse oximetry(Spo2), End
      Tidal Carbon Dioxide(ETCO2), Train Of Four(TOF) and Bi spectral index(BIS). Post operatively
      donors were reversed with injection neostigmine and glycopyrrolate.

      once return of spontaneous ventilation was well established and patient becomes conscious
      oriented trachea was extubated and donors were shifted to post anaesthetic care unit(PACU).
      Postoperatively donors were monitored for Heart rate, Blood Pressure, Spo2, Comfort Score,
      Visual analog score for incisional site pain and shoulder tip pain, and Post operative nausea
      vomiting. Rescue analgesia was given to patients having comfort score less than 6.

      After completion of study Optic nerve sheath diameter, pain scores and comfort scores was
      compared between both groups.
