      particularly vulnerable: they are ignored by health prevention measures; they are embedded in
      a stream of contradictory information ( medicine, media, internet); they may feel concerned
      by surgical prevention issues at a key moment of there identity construction (self,
      relationship, sexuality). A special psychoeducational intervention was designed to help these
      women to better cope with these difficulties.

      Methods/design: the study consists in a prospective randomized trial including childless
      young female counselees (18-40 years) of CCC Jean Perrin oncogenetics department, belonging
      to HBOC families either BRCA-mutated or not. They will be invited to attend a weekend group
      session in a SPA resort and participate to a series of short expert conferences and to focus
      group activities (group sharing, Moreno role game) supervised by a psychotherapist. Two
      sessions separated by a 6-month delay (waiting list) will enable us to evaluate the
      intervention effect, by comparing the evolution of questionnaires scores between inclusion
      and 6-month post-intervention. Main end-point is an increase of the Hert Hope Inventory of at
      least one standard deviation. Secondary endpoints investigate self-esteem, anxiety-trait,
      anxiety-state, ways of coping and quality of life. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the
      first or the second session so that groups are comparable. Session will be cost-free for
      participants.
