      morbidity and mortality in many countries. Dyslipidemia is the main risk factor of
      cardiovascular events. Despite the invention of many conventional hypolipidemic drugs, the
      use of traditional medicine remains high, especially in elderly patients. However, evidence
      of the effectiveness of many herbs or other traditional drugs is lacking. Nigella sativa or
      black seeds are traditional herbs used for years in Middle East and India. They are believed
      to cure many diseases, including dyslipidemia. Therefore, a study is needed to prove their
      effectiveness as their use might improve our strategy to improve patients' compliance.
