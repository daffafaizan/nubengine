      important to provide evidence that it can be introduced concurrently with other routine
      pediatric vaccines without significantly impairing the immune response to any vaccine while
      maximizing coverage and minimizing cost. This non-inferiority study aims to compare CD-JEV
      and MMR responses in a population of children in a country where MMR introduction is ongoing
      or planned. This information will help the ministries of health evaluate the addition of
      CD-JEV into routine EPI.
