    
      EN (enteral nutrition) or PN (parenteral nutrition) artificial nutrition will be launched at
      D1-D2 of the transplantation (D0 being the day of the transplantation),without taking into
      account the oral intake. This helps in particular to launch the EN after the stage of
      significant digestive problems related to the conditioning and before the mucositis
      appearance.

      EN group: According to the HAS and SFNEP (Societe francophone nutrition clinique)
      recommendations and the good practice rules, a polyurethane or silicone NGT(Naso gastric
      tube), 8 to 10 French units, will be inserted and its positioning will be controlled by
      radiography before the EN beginning. Polyurethane and silicone are very well tolerated by
      nasal and oesophagus mucosa and have a long life duration allowing keeping the same tube
      during 2 to 3 months.

      PN group: PN will be administrated by a central venous catheter, which is usually inserted in
      allo-HSCT patients to allow the administration of chemotherapy and of the different
      parenteral treatments.
