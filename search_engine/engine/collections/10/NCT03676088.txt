      healthy, satisfying the determined inclusion criteria. Patients with at least two or more
      teeth having Miller's class I , II or combination of class I and II mandibular recession
      defects were included in the study. A detailed, thorough medical and dental history was
      obtained and each patient was subjected to comprehensive clinical and radiological
      examination. All patients were informed about the nature of the study, surgical procedure
      involved, potential benefits and risks associated with the surgical procedure and a written
      informed consent was obtained from all patients.

      The patients were assigned into two treatment groups (test and control). The test group was
      treated with recombinant human Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB and Modified Coronally
      Advanced Tunnel +Connective Tissue Graft whereas the control group was treated by Modified
      Coronally Advanced Tunnel +Connective Tissue Graft alone.
