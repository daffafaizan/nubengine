      comparing two approaches among 864 enrolled AF(atrial fibrillation) or DVT(deep venous
      thrombosis) patients for guiding warfarin initial anticoagulation in Chinese elderly
      patients: the intervention group using the algorithm of International Warfarin
      Pharmacogenetic Consortium and its dose revision, and the control group using a standard
      initiation dose (2.25 mg).The study hypothesis is that the intervention group relative to the
      control group will increase the percentage of time in therapeutic INR (international
      normalized ratio) range during the first 3 months.This trial is the first prospective
      large-scale randomized controlled trial for elders in China. It is of great significance for
      promoting special crowd individualization of anticoagulants at home and abroad.
