    
      Multicentre, randomized, double blind, parallel group comparison of an DPP-4 inhibitor,
      linagliptin 5 mg od, versus placebo (1:1) in patients with T2DM and a documented baseline
      concentric LV geometry and LV systolic dysfunction.

      The management of glycemia will be left to the Investigator's judgment informed by clinical
      guidelines. The Investigator will therefore be allowed to undertake appropriate action, i.e.:

        -  Adjust the background antidiabetic treatment.

        -  Prescribe an additional antidiabetic medication according to its labeling (with the
           exclusion of other DPP-4 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist).

      The enrollment period will last 12 months. The patients will be followed up for 48 weeks from
      randomization.

      After the randomization the patients will have a control visit after 2 weeks (Visit 3) and at
      3 months from randomization (Visit 4, week 12). At Visit 4 blood samples will be collected.

      Afterwards the patients will have one control visit at 24 weeks from randomization (Visit 5)
      and a final visit at 48 weeks from randomization (Visit 6) with echocardiogram and ECG
      performed and blood samples collected.

      Patients still on study treatment at the time of final visit (Visit 6) will have a post
      treatment safety follow up (clinical visit or phone contact) 30 days after the study
      treatment discontinuation.
