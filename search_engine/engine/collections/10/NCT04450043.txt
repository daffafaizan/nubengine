      psychoeducational intervention for participants with cancer who are transitioning from active
      treatment to surveillance.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility.

      This study consists of 2 parts. It is expected that about 45 people will take part in this
      research study.

        -  In the first part of this study, about 5 participants will complete survey questions and
           receive a 5-session program.

        -  In the second part of this study, about 40 participants will complete survey questions
           and the first session, and then will be randomly assigned to receive the rest of the
           sessions or to not receive the rest of the sessions.

        -  These sessions will focus on providing targeted support related to life after cancer
           treatment. The sessions will focus on skills for coping with uncertainty, managing
           symptoms, improving social support, and other topics important to the individual.
