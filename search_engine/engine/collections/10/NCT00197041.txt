      malaria vaccine or the control vaccine which has been selected because of its benefit to the
      children in preventing important childhood diseases. The control vaccines include the
      following:

        -  If the child is of 24 months or older, he/she may receive 3 doses of a vaccine, called
           Engerix-B™, which protects against hepatitis B.

        -  If the child is less than 24 months, he/she may receive: two doses of a vaccine called
           Prevnar® and one dose of a vaccine called Hiberix™. Prevnar® prevents pneumonia and
           meningitis caused by some Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. Hiberix™ prevents severe
           infections such as pneumonia and meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b
           bacteria (Hib). All children will be monitored for the development of malaria disease
           over an 18-month period extending from the third vaccination. All participants will also
           be monitored for vaccine safety from first vaccination to study close.
