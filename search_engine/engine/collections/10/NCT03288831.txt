      bowel and causes abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. This process takes 24-72 hours to
      occur. Some people without celiac disease develop similar symptoms when they eat gluten or
      wheat. Doctors and scientists do not know what causes this sensitivity to gluten. People with
      celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity report symptoms within hours of being
      exposed to gluten. This study evaluates why this occurs by looking at changes in blood,
      urine, stool, and the bowel after being given gluten.
