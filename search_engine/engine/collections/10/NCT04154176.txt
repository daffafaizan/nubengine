      limited by the need for a translation of standardized tools that were investigated for their
      inter-rater reliability/agreement.

      Our primary aim is to validate the Greek version of the CAM Diagnostic Algorithm and Nu-DESC
      in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. Our secondary aim is to estimate the
      diagnostic accuracy of NuDESK in our population.

      This study will provide the first official Greek translation of CAM and Nu-DESC, according to
      the ISPOR guidelines, and the first evaluation of their inter-rater agreement.
