    
      Proposal Steps

        1. Approval will be obtained from Research Ethics Committee of Faculty of Pharmacy,
           Damanhour University.

        2. All participants agreed to take part in this clinical study and provide informed
           consent.

        3. Patients will be enrolled if they present with clinical signs of trauma, from Emergency
           department at Tanta University Hospital

        4. Complete physical, laboratory, radiological assessment will be done for all patients

        5. Serum samples will be collected for measuring the biomarkers.

        6. All enrolled 50 patients will be divided into two groups; Group I are patients who will
           receive amantadine as added on therapy. Group II are patients who will be managed with
           the standard regimen.

        7. All patients will be followed up during 6 weeks period.

        8. At the end of 6 weeks, prognosis biomarkers will be withdrawn.

        9. Statistical tests appropriate to the study design will be conducted to evaluate the
           significance of the results.

       10. Measuring outcome: The primary outcome is to compare the effect of adding amantadine on
           recovery rate and neurological complications in trauma patients.

       11. Results, conclusion, discussion and recommendations will be given.

      Methodology

        -  50 Patients will be randomized equally to the assigned study groups

        -  Prognosis biomarkers (IL-18, NSE and Neurotensin) will be measured using ELISA

        -  Conventional routine tests (including renal function tests) will be assessed

        -  Patients will be evaluated clinically (such as Glasgow scoreâ€¦) for recovery rate for
           neurological complications.
