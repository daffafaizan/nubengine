      laryngeal mask device with an added dorsal cuff to improve the seal and a drainage tube to
      prevent aspiration and gastric insufflations(Brain, Verghese et al. 2000).Despite its
      utility, there are complications associated with PLMA insertion such as sore throat and
      mucosal injury including oropharyngeal blood.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to determine if size 3 PLMA would induce
      less mucosal damage indicated by blood on the cuff than size 4 in non-paralyzed female
      patients. The secondary objective of this study is to compare insertion time, number of
      attempts, oropharyngeal leak pressure, hemodynamic variables, and incidence of complications
      with size 3 and 4 PLMA.
