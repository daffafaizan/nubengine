      influences on quality of life. Faecal incontinence affects 2,2 to 5 % of the adult
      population. The magnitude of the problem is probably underestimated, because most patients
      don't discuss this affliction with their general practitioner. A new treatment, SNS has over
      the last decade given new hope to these patients. But a group of these patients has minor
      effect of the treatment - despite a satisfactory test-stimulation period. This study aims to
      identify optimal stimulation parameters that will improve patient continence and quality of
      life. Four different stimulation parameters will be tested through a double blind, randomized
      crossover study - standard stimulation parameters (frequency: 14 Hz, pulse width 210
      microsec.) will serve as control stimulation.

      The study includes five arms that will be tested in a randomized order. Each arm will be
      tested for four weeks in which the patient fill in bowel habit diaries and standardized
      questionnaires. The first week in each period will not be evaluated - is serves as a wash-out
      period.

      Before any pacemaker changes anorectal manometry and rectal filling tests will be performed.
