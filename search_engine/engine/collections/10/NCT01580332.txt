      discriminating between benign and malignant SPNs for each of the biomarkers in the specific
      high risk cohort under the NLST screening protocol. To help identify and quantify these
      signatures, we will evaluate specifically the volatile signature in the exhaled breath, the
      accuracy of LuCED sputum detection, the profile of tumor markers and the specifications of
      auto-antibodies through immunoassays and Orbitrap technology, and the PET/CT in patients
      already diagnosed with lung cancer.
