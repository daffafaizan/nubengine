      within 6 days of birth) is two times that of the United States. Causes of perinatal mortality
      include, but are not limited to, low birth weight and preterm delivery. Anemia (low
      hemoglobin) among pregnant women is associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery and
      also is elevated in the project area. Supplements of iron, folic acid, and other vitamins and
      minerals can prevent anemia among pregnant women, but the effects of these supplements on
      other maternal and infant health outcomes are unclear.

      Since 1993, the People's Republic of China has recommended that newly married women, and
      those who plan pregnancy, take 400μg of folic acid daily through the first trimester of
      pregnancy. Although WHO recommends that pregnant women take iron and folic acid supplements,
      there is currently no national recommendation that pregnant women in China take iron or other
      vitamin or mineral supplements (other than folic acid). UNICEF is now testing a prenatal
      vitamin and mineral supplement in programs to prevent low birth weight. Our study will
      provide additional information about the health impact of the UNICEF prenatal supplement
      versus an iron and folic acid supplement versus folic acid alone.

      Comparisons:

        -  Infants of women who receive daily prenatal supplements that contain 400μg folic acid
           alone, will be compared with infants of women who receive daily supplements that contain
           30 mg iron and 400 μg folic acid.

        -  Infants of women who receive daily supplements that contain 30 mg iron and 400 μg folic
           acid will be compared with infants of women who receive a daily supplement containing 30
           mg iron, 400μg folic acid and other vitamins and minerals (UNICEF formulation).
