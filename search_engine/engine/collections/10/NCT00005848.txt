      progressive, metastatic, hormone refractory prostate cancer. II. Determine the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-16
      months.
