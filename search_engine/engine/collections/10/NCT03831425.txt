      double-blind, controlled, cross-over study. Primary outcome will include determination of
      muscle function based on a 3 minute step test which showed good sensitivity in the
      investigators' pilot study. Secondary outcomes will determine effects on muscle power
      (maximal vertical jump), strength (hand grip), endurance (6 Minute Walk Test), fatigue
      (PedsQL quality of life scale), physical activity level (3DPAR), attention (ADHDT), cognition
      (MOCA), and physical function (CHAQ). The investigators' subaim is to elucidate the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms by which clinical improvements are mediated through interrogation
      of underlying mitochondrial dysfunction to optimize therapies. This will include
      determination of total aerobic capacity (maximal graded cycle ergometry), muscle metabolic
      function (31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of muscle to evaluate high energy
      phosphagen, anaerobic and aerobic exercise metabolism), mitochondrial function (serum
      lactate, carnitine, acylcarnitines, lactate/pyruvate ratio), and blood and urine oxidative
      stress markers of lipid, protein and DNA peroxidation. Investigators hypothesize that CoQ10
      will lead to a clinically significant improvement in motor function, power, fatigue, habitual
      activity, attention span & thereby quality of life in PWS.
