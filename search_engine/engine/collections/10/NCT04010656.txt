      CIC) preoperatively; after surgery, the investigators will collect a range of voiding
      parameters used during different TOV protocols (including minimum voided volume [MVV],
      post-void residual via bladder scanner [PVR], subjective force of urinary stream [sFOS]).
      Patients will discharge home to perform CIC until two sequential post-void residuals of less
      than half the volume voided have been achieved. The rate of voiding dysfunction and resulting
      PVRs will be used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the perioperative voiding parameters
      to predict need to perform CIC and post-operative urinary retention.
