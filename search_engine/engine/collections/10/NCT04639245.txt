    
      OUTLINE:

      This is a phase I, dose escalation study of FH-MagIC TCR-T cells followed by a phase II
      study.

      LYMPHODEPLETION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and fludarabine IV on
      days -4, -3, and -2 before each T-cell infusion.

      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive FH-MagIC TCR-T cells IV over 15-20 minutes. Six to twelve
      weeks after first T-cell infusion, patients with progressive disease and non-persisting
      transgenic TCR T cells may receive a second T-cell infusion.

      In the Phase 2 portion of the study, atezolizumab will be administered as standard of care
      beginning 24-72 hours after T-cell infusion. Atezolizumab will be given IV every 3 weeks for
      at least 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If an
      alternative PD1 inhibitor is instead available for a patient, it may be substituted instead.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 15 years after
      final infusion of FH-MagIC TCR-T.
