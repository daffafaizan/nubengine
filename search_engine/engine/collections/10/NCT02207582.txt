      of the brain which was shown to be superior effective in contrast to other electric
      stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). These studies
      investigated mainly healthy controls and specific tasks. Only one case report is available
      for depression. Here we stimulate patients with depression with tRNS in a placebo-controlled
      two-arm design. Stimulation will be done as add-on to standard therapy. Electrodes will be
      applied over both dorsolateral prefrontal cortices which are standard target points of tDCS
      and also transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression.
