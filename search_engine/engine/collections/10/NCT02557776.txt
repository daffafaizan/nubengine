      All patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in southern Sweden are offered inclusion in
      the SCAN-B study at the time of diagnosis pre-surgery. If they consent to that, a part of the
      tumor is sent to a lab in Lund, Sweden, for research purposes (RNA sequencing etc.). Patients
      that are included in the SCAN-B study are eligible for inclusion in BRCAsearch, see inclusion
      and exclusion criteria.

      Study procedure (summary):

        1. An envelope with written information is given to the patient at the visit to the surgeon
           the week after surgery. This envelope contains a written genetic counseling, information
           about the study, an informed consent form, psychosocial questionnaires and our contact
           information (telephone, e-mail). The patient can contact a genetic counselor for
           pre-test telephone genetic counseling if she wishes to.

        2. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are analyzed by full sequencing.

        3. Non-carriers are informed about the test result with a letter. Mutation carriers and VUS
           (variants of uncertain significance) are telephoned and given a time for an appointment
           at the Department of Clinical Genetics within a week.

        4. Psychosocial self-reported questionnaires (HAD scale, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23) are
           delivered at 3 times: At invitation to the study, one month after information about test
           result, and one year after information about test result.
