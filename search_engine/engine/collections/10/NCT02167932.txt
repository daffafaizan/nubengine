      dramatically during chemotherapy and that p16 levels among patients of similar age are lower
      among those who exercise. We hypothesize that engagement in physical activity during
      chemotherapy will have a moderating effect on increases in p16 levels during chemotherapy. To
      test this hypothesis, we propose to enroll 48 patients age 21-64 with a Stage I-III breast
      cancer diagnosis who are about to start adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a physical
      activity intervention program. Our primary objective is to compare the change in p16 from
      baseline to end of chemotherapy for participants in this study (who are engaged in a physical
      activity intervention) to the mean change in p16 seen in a previous study of similar patients
      who did not participate in a physical activity intervention. As secondary objectives, we
      propose to evaluate (1) changes in treatment-related toxicity, physical function, fatigue,
      and quality of life between baseline, end of chemotherapy and 6 months post-chemotherapy, (2)
      the association of changes in p16 levels with changes in measures of treatment-related
      toxicity, physical function, fatigue, and quality of life, and (3) the association of changes
      in physical activity levels with changes in measures of treatment-related toxicity, physical
      function, fatigue, and quality of life.
