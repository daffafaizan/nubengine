      treatment with OnabotulinumtoxinA versus Saline. Additionally, CGRP levels in saliva will be
      correlated with a reduction in headache attacks.

      At Visit 1, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive injections of
      OnabotulinumtoxinA or Saline in an identical manner. Subjects will collect 3 saliva samples
      during each month of the 7 month study: 1 collection at Baseline headache level, 1 collection
      at onset of headache that is one degree worse than Baseline level that will be treated with
      acute therapy, and 1 collection at 2 hours following treatment. Subjects will document
      headache and headache symptoms in a daily diary and return to the clinic with diary and
      saliva samples at monthly visits.

      Following 4 months (including a 1 month washout after Visit 4), subjects will return at Visit
      5 and receive cross-over injections. Subjects randomized to OnabotulinumtoxinA at Visit 1
      will receive injections of Saline. Subjects randomized to saline at Visit 1 will receive
      injections of OnabotulinumtoxinA. Subjects will document headache and headache symptoms in a
      daily diary and return to the clinic with diary and saliva samples at monthly visits.

      At Visit 8, 3 months following re-injection at Visit 5, subjects will exit the study.
