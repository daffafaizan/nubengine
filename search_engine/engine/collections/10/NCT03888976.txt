    
      A cholecystoenteric fistula is an uncommon complication of gallstone disease, although most
      studies in the English literature concern biliary-enteric fistulas. The aim of this study was
      to present a case series of patients with a cholecystoduodenal fistula (CDF), with or without
      gallstone ileus, along with the surgical outcomes.

      From 2015 to 2018, 3245 consecutive patients underwent cholecystectomy for gallbladder
      disease at our institution, of whom 10 were diagnosed with a CDF. All electronic medical
      records were retrospectively reviewed.
