      all healthy children aged 6 through 59 months receive influenza vaccine. Because of the
      growing emphasis on influenza immunization of infants and young children, Center for
      Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) has expressed interest in receiving sera from
      children who have been vaccinated with the current formulation of Fluzone® vaccine. These
      sera will be tested to evaluate each individual's immune response to the current formulation
      of Fluzone® vaccine and will also be used to evaluate circulating influenza strains in order
      to support formulation recommendations for the subsequent year (particularly for influenza B
      strains, which predominantly affect the young).
