    
      Bronchiectasis not related to cystic fibrosis (non-CF bronchiectasis) is a chronic
      respiratory condition characterised by permanent dilatation of the airways arising from
      bronchial inflammation and infection. Predominant symptoms include daily productive cough,
      dyspnoea and generalised fatigue. This profile is associated with diminished health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) and reduced exercise tolerance.

      Available medical treatments for bronchiectasis include antibiotic and inhalation therapy. To
      date, there is no evidence that these treatments can reduce the exacerbation rate or modify
      the rate of disease progression. While international guidelines for pulmonary rehabilitation
      recommend the inclusion of patients with bronchiectasis, there is a deficiency in evidence
      supporting exercise training in this population. It is proposed that a standard exercise
      training program conducted according to Australian guidelines for pulmonary rehabilitation
      will improve both exercise capacity, quality of life and reduce the number of acute
      infections in both the short and long term in people with bronchiectasis.
