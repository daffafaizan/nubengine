      various musculoskeletal disorders including plantar fasciopathy, achilles tendinopathy,
      shoulder calcific tendinopathy, and lateral epicondylitis. Although there are some negative
      trials, there are now many randomized, double-blinded, clinical trials that support the use
      of SWT for the above conditions. Acknowledging the unpredictable response and frequent
      recurrences associated with traditional non operative treatment, the risks and prolonged
      rehabilitation associated with surgery, the recognition of gluteal tendinopathy as a
      potential source of pain, and the favorable results from prior studies involving radial
      pressure waves as a treatment for GTPS, the aim of this study is to investigate the
      dose-related effect of shockwave treatment at different total energy by adjusting the energy
      flux density (EFD) in patients with chronic GTPS. The shockwave has been widely recognized in
      literature as a biological regulator, currently the biological effects of shockwaves can be
      obtained using lower energy than in the past.

      While the intensity or delivered energy is considered by some researchers to be a key factor
      for successful treatment, in current literature reviews, debate continues over the
      appropriate energy intensity and the total delivered energy that should be applied to the
      tissue.

      Therefore, higher intensity treatments usually require local anesthesia, which is known to
      reduce the efficacy of the treatment. Furthermore, some animal tests reported that an influx
      of energy of over 0.60 mJ/mm2 can cause permanent damage on the tendon. On the other hand,
      low-intensity energy is safer but has the disadvantage of lower treatment effects.

      The investigators hypothesize that a very low intensity protocol of ESWT has different
      effects on pain and function than a conventional protocol in a patient with GTPS syndrome.
