      All patients were treated with 1.25 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab followed by RF-PDT (25
      J/cmÂ²), 2 days later. All patients were previously treated with IVB monotherapy and active
      leaking of CNV occurred 90 to 120 days after the treatment.

      Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA-ETDRS), foveal thickness (FT) on optical coherence
      tomography (OCT), and fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographic (FA; ICG) findings were
      recorded. Follow-up evaluations were carried out for 12 months.
