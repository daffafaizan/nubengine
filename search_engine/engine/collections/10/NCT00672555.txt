    
      1. Patients, that come to our clinic with problems caused by a pilonidal sinus are informed
           about the different treatment options of the illness.

             -  If the patient suffers of a recurrence of the illness, a complete excision,
                followed by a covering of the defect with a Limberg-flap is recommended.

             -  If the patient has the first time problems by a pilonidal sinus, we recommend an
                open limited excision of the fistulas.

             -  In cases with acute infected situation, we first conduct a very limited
                incision/excision and treat them with antibiotics. The treatments mentioned before
                are in such cases offered 3 to 4 Weeks after the fist little operation.

        2. All Patients, that wish their pilonidal sinus treated with a complete excision followed
           by a covering of the defect with a Limberg-flap, are asked if they are willing to
           participate in the observational study.

        3. Patients, who gave their informed consent for the operation and the study are included.

        4. Preoperative data are recorded.

        5. The patients are operated on and intraoperative data (e.g. how big was the flap) are
           recorded.

        6. After 3 Weeks the patients are checked and complications, happiness and duration of the
           time off work are recorded.

        7. After a year the patients are contacted by sending them a postal questionnaire, which
           they send back to us. Additionally the are contacted by phone. Recurrence, other
           complications and their opinion concerning the treatment and its consequences are
           recorded.
