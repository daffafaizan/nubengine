      determined. Once a patient is eligible and provides informed consent, he or she will be in
      the study for up to 50 years, or until his or her OCD lesion is healed successfully.

      At the initial visit, a subject will complete a basic medical history form, and three
      questionnaires: the IKDC Subjective questionnaire (ages over 18) or the PEDI-IKDC Subjective
      questionnaire (ages under 18); the KOOS questionnaire; and the Marx Activity Scale (adult) or
      Pedi-FABS Scale (pediatric). Patients will then continue with their normal course of care as
      determined by their surgeon and care team.

      Mandatory surveys (same as above) will be collected from patients at 2 years, 5 years, 10
      years, and 25 years. Patients who cannot return to clinic will have the option to complete
      the assessments and return in pre-stamped and addressed return envelopes provided by the
      clinical site the subject is a patient at. Any other follow-up visits between these time
      intervals will also be options for patients to complete these assessments, however patients
      will not complete them any closer than intervals 12 weeks apart in order to prevent
      redundancy.

      Additionally, at the initial visit, the surgeon will complete a routine patient history and
      physical exam, which will be collected. Any surgical procedures or physical therapy a patient
      undergoes for treatment of his or her OCD lesion will also be documented and collected. At
      follow-up visits, surgeons will complete their own physical exam follow-up assessment forms,
      which will be collected.
