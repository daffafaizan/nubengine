      of oral CK-101 administered daily in ascending doses in patients with advanced solid tumor
      cancer, followed by a Phase 2 portion at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in previously
      treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have documented evidence of EGFR
      T790M mutation and have failed treatment with a first-line EGFR inhibitor.
