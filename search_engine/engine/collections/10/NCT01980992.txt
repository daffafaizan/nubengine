      most common foods inducing allergic reactions in the US. Current treatment for food allergy
      is complete avoidance of the food and to carry antihistamines and self-injectable epinephrine
      if an accidental reaction occurs. However, accidental exposure to allergens in processed
      foods may be difficult to avoid. Currently, several therapeutic strategies are being
      investigated to prevent and treat food allergies. Since immunotherapy injections for food
      allergy are associated with a high rate of allergic reactions, alternate approaches to
      treatment are needed. Oral (by mouth) immunotherapy (OIT) is one approach that has been tried
      in some studies in the treatment of food allergies. The intent of the study is to examine the
      clinical effects and safety of wheat OIT. This study will last 2 years. All eligible subjects
      will receive a wheat oral food challenge (OFC). Those who react to 1923mg or less of vital
      wheat gluten will be randomized to Wheat OIT or a placebo. All eligible and enrolled subjects
      will have a 1-year and 2-year OFC. Placebo subjects will crossover to Wheat OIT at the 1-year
      time point. At selected visits, blood and urine collection, physical examination, prick skin
      tests, and atopic dermatitis and asthma evaluations will occur.
