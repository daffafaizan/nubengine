    
      Parkinson´s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease which is characterized by a
      pathological aggregation of α-synuclein. This pathological α-synuclein aggregation results in
      the formation of Lewy bodies which are used for the histopathological diagnosis of PD.
      Neuropathological post mortem studies showed that pathological aggregations of α-synuclein
      may occur also outside the central nervous system in PD, for example in the cardiac plexus,
      in the major salivary glands and the innervating cervical superior ganglion, in the minor
      salivary glands, in the adrenal glands and in the mesenteric and pelvic plexus. The finding
      of pathologically aggregated α-synuclein in the major salivary glands offers the possibility
      to prove PD intra vitam by means of a small transcutaneous biopsy.

      A recent post mortem study in the local Department of Neuropathology found, that there was
      pathologically aggregated α-synuclein in 12 of 14 patients with diagnosed and
      neuropathologically confirmed PD, whereas there was no pathologically aggregated α-synuclein
      in 13 persons without PD.

      The present study includes 35 PD patients who underwent submandibular gland needle biopsy. 25
      neurologically healthy patients of the local otolaryngological clinic, in whom submandibular
      gland needle biopsy was performed due to a clinical indication, serve as controls.
      Immediately after the biopsy, the obtained submandibular gland tissue is transported to the
      local Department of Neuropathology for histopathological analysis.
