    
      This is a Phase I-II study evaluating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of swallowed
      MnSOD plasmid/liposome (PL) transgene given as protection against radiation-induced
      esophagitis during concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy with thoracic radiation
      in subjects with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase I of the study
      will assess the feasibility and safety of MnSOD PL by dose escalation in 3 cohorts of 3
      chemoradiotherapy subjects each (Cohort1 = 0.3 mg/dose, Cohort2 = 3 mg/dose, Cohort3 = 30
      mg/dose). The highest dose completed (as determined by toxicity monitoring for 8 weeks from
      initial treatment) will be the starting dose for Phase II. Phase II will examine the efficacy
      of MnSOD PL by assessing the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 esophagitis in 27 additional
      chemoradiotherapy subjects. Incidence of esophageal toxicity, as well as clinical response to
      the combination of chemoradiotherapy with MnSOD PL are the outcomes of interest.
