      found to have a tubular adenoma between the years of 2004-2008. We will compare the rate and
      timing of completion of repeat colonoscopies pre and post establishment of a polyp registry
      (tracking system) in 2006. Each group will be composed of 380-500 subjects consecutively
      identified from all the patients who underwent colonoscopy and were found to have a tubular
      adenoma (Group 1-2004 to 2006, Group 2 2007-2008).
