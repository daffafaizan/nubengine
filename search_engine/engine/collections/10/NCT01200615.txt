      to the patient as part of informed consent has an effect on the prevalence of side-effects.
      The study will take place in the out-patient clinic at the Shalvata Mental health Center.
      Three arms are included:

        1. 50 patients started on SSRI's will be updated about its common side effects

        2. 50 patients started on SSRI's will be updated about its common side effects and will
           receive an explenation on the nocebo effect

        3. 50 patients started on SSRI's will receive an explenation on the nocebo effect, but will
           not be updated about common side-effects. Nonetheless, they will be informed of severe
           side-effects.

      Following the prescription of an SSRI the subjects will we enter the follow-up phase of the
      study. They will attend two follow-up meetings: 3 days after the initiation point and one
      month after the starting point. During each meeting they will be asked to fill the
      Antidepressant Side-Effect Checklist (ASEC)and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).
