      (Ipq-FMUSP). Subjects: patients seeking for Social Phobia treatment at IPq-FMUSP ( before and
      under treatment). Controls: Hospital staff at the HC-FMUSP or volunteers from a list of other
      studies conducted at the Ipq-FMUSP. Methods: Dental evaluation: probing depth, clinical
      attachment level and bleeding on probing will be recorded at 6 sites per tooth, as well as
      the plaque and/or calculus indexes. The number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT
      index) will be also assessed. The visual analogue scale (VAS) will be applied for the
      assessment of pain after probing after the probing recording. Patients will receive a
      clinical evaluation for halitosis using a HalimeterÂ® to verify the concentration of the
      volatile sulfur compounds (before and after periodontal treatment). Main psychiatric
      assessment: Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for DSM-IV-TR adapted for DSM-5, the
      Liebowitz Social Anxiety (LSAs). Duration and frequency: after the initial clinical
      assessment (dental and psychiatric) patients will be randomized into three groups. Two groups
      (experimental- social phobia with no psychiatric treatment and control) will receive
      periodontal treatment after the initial psychiatric evaluation. One group will receive
      periodontal treatment after the improvement of psychiatric condition (3 months after the
      initial assessment). The non-surgical periodontal treatment will be performed preferably
      within 24 h. Patients will be reevaluated 3 and 6 months after the end of nonsurgical
      periodontal treatment.
