      recovery and reintegration by incorporating approaches in the field of positive psychology
      for soldiers with chronic PTSD. This program was organized for a group of 10 veterans for 10
      days. Each morning, from 9 am to 12 pm, participants had sporting activities: mountain
      walking, mountain biking, climbing, canyoning and collective orienteering running. From 3 pm,
      they had individual and collective practical workshops based on PTSD psychoeducation, human
      resources competences and coaching, including a curriculum vitae workshop.

      The investigators aims to compare this program included multisport practice with the same
      praogram included diving instead of multi-sport to evaluate the impact to recovery at one
      year
