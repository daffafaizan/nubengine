      increasing PrEP adoption in young men of color who have sex with men (YMCSM). While prior
      efficacy trials have included YMCSM 18-29, we will focus on PrEP in YMCSM outside clinical
      trial settings. Rather than an alternative medium for implementation of existing
      interventions designed for in-person contact, social media may be a true 'game changer' to
      engage hard to reach individuals. While many online behavioral interventions exist, including
      some that use social media, this will be one of the few studies to use and test social media
      to facilitate uptake of a biomedical intervention. E-PrEP will connect the target population
      (YMCSM) to a new prevention tool (PrEP) through rapid linkage to medical care, accelerating
      diffusion of PrEP. Given the paucity of data regarding social media-based interventions to
      change health-related behavior, E-PrEP may have a marked impact on future bio-behavioral
      interventions, especially those that include diffusion of innovation. Social media offers the
      power of scale and efficiency for large potential impact, even with relatively low-intensity
      interventions. Similarly, PrEP, if widely adopted in high-risk populations and offered with
      behavioral interventions, could markedly decrease HIV infection rates. Social media-based,
      peer-led approaches like E-PrEP could be used to enhance efforts by community-based and other
      organizations that employ internet-assisted or peer-outreach strategies to improve health.

      Primary Aim: To test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of E-PrEP for increasing PrEP
      adoption in a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
