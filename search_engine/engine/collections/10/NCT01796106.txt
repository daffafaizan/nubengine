    
      Objective: The hypothesis to be tested is that Icon performs similarly to an established
      prevention strategy for early caries (Oral hygiene instruction and topical fluoridation) for
      caries arrest; and caries progression may be imaged through a SFE laser optical device.

      Materials and Methods: The investigators propose a pilot study of Icon vs. control including
      Oral Hygiene Instructions (OHI) and topical fluoridation for early caries arrest in primary
      molars. Lesion depth will be performed through standard-of care methods, i.e. radiographs and
      visual exams, plus a novel optical device based on scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) technology
      for laser light imaging for early caries detection in pediatric populations. The
      investigators will utilize SFE laser optical device prototypes developed by the University of
      Washington's Human Photonics Lab (HPL), a device already in human use for other applications,
      including imaging and cancer screening.

      Clinical Significance: This controlled trial will assess the positive effects of white spot
      infiltration by ICON and may open a new therapeutic strategy in paediatric dentistry.
      Additionally, this study would be one of the first in vivo dental applications of the SFE
      optical device, and would add a novel early caries visualization technique to the
      armamentarium for detecting caries progression.
