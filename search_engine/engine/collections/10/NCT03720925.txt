      clinical trials, and studies evaluating the outcomes of preventive and therapeutic program.
      In the literature it is observed efficacy on OHRQoL outcomes focused on oral health education
      (OHE) associated to: atraumatic restorative treatment (ART), dental caries, gingivitis.

      In the literature it is also seen that the presence of TDI is associated to negative impact
      on OHRQoL)that affects physical and psychosocial consequences for children and their
      families. The treatment of TDI is a challenge, that it is related to an improvement on famil
      and on children from 8 to 14 years and attended in a center of surveillance for TDI.

      For a broader understanding of the consequences of outcomes of preventive and therapeutic
      program for TDI, it is important to expand the assessment of its performance using an OHRQoL
      measure for other ages of children.
