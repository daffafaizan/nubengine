      recent standard laid down by 'WHO', anemia is present when the Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration
      in the peripheral blood is 11 gm/dl or less. The most common cause of anemia in pregnancy is
      lack of iron. This study is done to compare the efficacy and tolerability of iron amino acid
      chelate and that of iron salts (ferrous fumarat).
