      primary tumor and any involved adjacent lymph nodes, minimize the risk of distant recurrence,
      and, when possible, preserve anal sphincter function. Standard treatment consists of surgery,
      concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (RT) and adjuvant chemotherapy. As the present time,
      the chemoradiation portion of the treatment is often administered before, as opposed to
      following, surgical resection. This approach has been associated with tumor down-staging,
      leading to higher rates of tumor resectability and an increase in the ability to perform
      sphincter-saving surgeries. (1). However, while advances in treatment of the primary tumor
      and regional nodes, specifically administration of preoperative chemoradiation and more
      aggressive surgical approaches, such as total mesorectal excision (TME), have been shown to
      improve locoregional disease control, toxicities and complications of these treatments may
      result in delay or omission of adjuvant chemotherapy, which could increase the risk of
      distant recurrence. In this pilot study, standard adjuvant chemotherapy (8 cycles of modified
      FOLFOX6) will be administered prior to chemoradiation and definitive surgery, eliminating the
      need for post-operative systemic therapy. The investigators will evaluate the ability of
      patients to tolerate this treatment and its impact on achievement of pathologic complete
      responses (pCRs), negative surgical margins and sphincter preservation.
