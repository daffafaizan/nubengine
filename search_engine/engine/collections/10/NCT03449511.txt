      jojoba) to reduce the severity of seven chemotherapy-induced symptoms (nausea, vomiting,
      pain, anxiety/distress, fatigue, sleep difficulties, and lack of appetite). Subjects will
      participate in the study for two or three chemotherapy cycles. The first cycle is a
      non-intervention baseline cycle during which subjects rate the severity of the seven
      different symptoms from 0 to 10 for seven consecutive days during their first chemotherapy
      study cycle. The next one or two cycles are intervention cycle(s) using the assigned
      randomized aromatherapy. The subjects will rate the severity of seven different symptoms from
      0 to 10 each day the aromatherapy inhaler during one or two chemotherapy cycles (i.e., 7
      consecutive days during each chemotherapy cycle) and report if they felt the aromatherapy was
      helping with symptoms compared to the previous cycle. At the end of the study, the
      participants will be asked about his/her satisfaction with the aromatherapy used during the
      study. All of these measurements will provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of
      aromatherapy for symptom management.
