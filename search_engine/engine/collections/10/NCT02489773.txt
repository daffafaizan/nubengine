      (preceding 2-3 weeks) monitoring of glycemic control in patients with diabetes, subjects with
      Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes will be enrolled whose HbA1c values range from 7.5% to 12% (or
      higher) in Group 1 and <7.5% in Group 2 at Visit 1, and the comparison of glycated albumin
      (GA) and other glycemic control indices will be performed during 6 months in 8 clinical sites
      in US. Group 1 will consist of 90 evaluable subjects who have a change in diabetes management
      to improve glycemic control; this therapy can include oral agents, insulin, or noninsulin
      injectable anti-diabetic medications. Group 2 will consist of 40 evaluable subjects already
      on a stable diabetic management program, who have had no change in treatment in the last 3
      months and for whom there is no plan to make a change during the study period.
