      college students in Shanghai, China from November to December, 2015. These students lived in
      dormitories that were randomized into two groups and alternated the use of true or sham air
      purifiers for 9 consecutive days with a 2-week wash-out interval. All participants and
      research staffs were blinded to the group assignment. All participants were required to stay
      in their dormitory with the windows/doors closed for at least 50% of the time on weekdays and
      for 80% on weekends throughout the 9-day intervention period. All interventions started at 7
      a.m. to avoid issues related to diurnal variation. Health endpoints, including blood
      pressure, fractional exhaled nitric oxide were evaluated and biological samples such as
      morning urine, fast blood and buccal cells were collected at baseline and immediately after
      the completion of each intervention period.
