      surgery (RYGB). 8 with type 2 diabetes (DM2), 8 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 8
      with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) before, within the first week and 3 month after RYGB
      using a liquid mixed meal test (MMT) and an insulin modified frequently sampled intravenous
      glucose tolerance test (IM-FSIGT). Furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be
      performed before and after 3 months. Blood will be sampled in fasting and during the tests
      measuring plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptid (OGTT, MMT and IM-FSIGT) and GLP-1, glucagon,
      GIP and GLP-2 (MMT). Beta-cell function will be assessed from the MMT (insulinogenic index -
      IGI), OGTT (IGI) and the IM-FSIGT (Acute insulin response, AIR) in order to examine whether
      changes in beta-cell function after RYGB depend on an oral stimulus. Insulin sensitivity will
      be assessed in fasting (HOMA-IR), during the IM-FSIGT (minimal model: Si) and from MMT/OGTT
      (Matsuda index). Insulin clearance/hepatic extraction of insulin will be assessed in fasting
      and during the intravenous and oral test.
