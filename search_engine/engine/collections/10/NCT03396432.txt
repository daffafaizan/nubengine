        -  Primary Objective To compare the tracheal intubation (TI) first attempt success rate
           using VL vs. DL in children ≤ 12 months old.

        -  Secondary Objectives To compare the lowest oxygen saturation during tracheal intubation
           with VL vs. DL.

      Study Design:

      Prospective, randomized, multi-center parallel group trial

      Setting/Participants:

      This will be a multi-center study with a minimum of four participating centers. The target
      population will be children ≤ 12 months age scheduled for elective surgery requiring general
      anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.

      Study Interventions and Measures:

      The study intervention will be a 1:1 randomization to perform tracheal intubation with the
      Storz C-Mac Miller 1 (VL) or the conventional Miller laryngoscope (DL).

      Main study outcome measures are as follows:

        -  The first intubation attempt success rate with each device

        -  The number of attempts for successful intubation with each device

        -  Complications associated with intubation
