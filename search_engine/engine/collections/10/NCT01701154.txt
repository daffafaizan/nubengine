      with almost all forms of neuromuscular disease (NMD), including both the infantile and adult
      phenotypes of Pompe disease. Although individual patterns of involvement vary, respiratory
      weakness in Pompe disease typically affects both the inspiratory and expiratory muscle
      systems. Our pilot data in two individuals with late-onset Pompe disease suggest that RMST
      may be a treatment for the progressive respiratory weakness encountered in this condition.

      Purpose of the Study

        -  Determine the effect of respiratory muscle strength training on maximum inspiratory
           pressure, maximum expiratory pressure, upright % predicted forced vital capacity, and
           aspects of cough function.

        -  Determine the effect of RMST on functional outcome measures of gross motor function
           appropriate for individual participants in terms of age and motor skills.
