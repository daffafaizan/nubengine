    
      Patients 5 years or older with a total body surface area (TBSA) thermal burn injury between 5
      and 50% (inclusive) who require autografting will be considered for participation in this
      study. RES (Regenerative Epithelial Suspension) derived from the use of the ReCellÂ® device
      will be applied over skin grafts meshed more widely than conventional autografting. Healing,
      scar outcomes, pain and treatment-related adverse events will be evaluated at follow-up
      visits. Data concerning the clinical performance and safety of the ReCell device will be
      collected. Safety will be evaluated in terms of treatment and serious related adverse events.

      Each subject will participate in up to 7 total visits (treatment visit and 6 follow-up study
      visits) over a period of 24 weeks. Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled and treated within this
      study at up to 15 institutions.

      It is anticipated that enrollment will continue until PMA approval. Subject follow-up will
      continue until the last enrolled subject completes the 24-week visit.
