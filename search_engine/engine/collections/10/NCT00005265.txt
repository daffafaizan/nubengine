      In January 1990, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute issued a Program Announcement
      establishing a Small Grants Program to provide limited support to extend analyses of research
      data generated by clinical trials, population research, and demonstration and education
      studies. This study used data collected in two completed clinical trials, the BHAT and AMIS.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Study endpoints included all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality such as sudden death,
      recurrent and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and incident congestive heart failure.
      Univariate and multivariate analyses of baseline data variables from BHAT were conducted to
      determine which were predictive of study endpoints. Baseline variables included
      sociodemograhic characteristics, medical history, medication use, physical examination finds,
      and electrocardiographic characteristics. Baseline characteristics found to be predictive of
      study endpoints in the BHAT placebo group were examined in the AMIS placebo group. Long- and
      short-term prognoses for patients suffering a transmural myocardial infarction were compared
      for those suffering a subendocardial infarction.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
