      the physiology, especially when food intake with proportional dose calculation to the amount
      of carbohydrates ingested by the use of ratios. This method of adaptation, increasingly used
      in France, is an extension in the use of subcutaneous insulin pump with a more precise
      determination of bolus doses with meals, and use of aids dose calculations (assistant wizard
      for instance). In practice every day, some patients perform their bolus immediately after
      eating, not just before, allowing them to know exactly the amount of ingested carbohydrates
      and not the one provided in advance.

      This study is very interesting because it allows to compare the injection of an analogous
      bolus of fast insulin before and after the meal.
