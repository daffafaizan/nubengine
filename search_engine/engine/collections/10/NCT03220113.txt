      pattern of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve signaling at the level vasa nervorum. These
      changes may down-regulate the hyperexcitable sympathetic signals at the level of adventitia
      and consequently the medial layer of vasa nervorum and providing long term relief from
      migraine headaches. However, a bilateral and simultaneous treatment of trigeminal and
      occipital nerves in migraine and craniofacial neuralgia using a combination of dexamethasone,
      thiamine and lidocaine has been rarely studied.

      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of concomitant
      administration of dexamethasone, lidocaine, and thiamine compounds into the trigeminal nerve
      branches, the greater and lesser occipital nerve for the treatment of chronic migraine, and
      craniofacial neuralgia.
