      most beneficial feeding option for infants born to HIV-infected women in low-resourced
      settings. This recommendation contradicts previous recommendations to avoid breastfeeding to
      prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. South Africa, a high HIV prevalent country,
      recently phased out access to free formula milk in the public sector in support of
      breastfeeding for HIV-infected women. The investigators previously found that few
      HIV-infected South African women choose breastfeeding and among those who did, many stop
      breastfeeding early. This study involves text messaging breastfeeding advice encouraging
      women to exclusively breastfeed, and inquire if they have any breastfeeding related problems,
      and motivational interviews exploring and supporting woman's commitment to continue
      breastfeeding.Participants meeting inclusion criteria who consent participation will be
      enrolled by a research nurse and immediately randomly assigned to text messaging plus
      motivational interviewing group or usual standard of care group.

      The investigators propose a randomized, parallel group, standard of care-controlled pilot
      trial which will be conducted among HIV-infected women of low socio-economic background,
      giving birth at a primary healthcare clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. The pilot trial will
      assess the feasibility of conducting a larger trial on communication and support approaches
      that may improve HIV-infected woman's adherence to exclusive and continued breastfeeding.
