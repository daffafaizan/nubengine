      physicians perform the pelvic exam, describe and compare self-reported comfort during each
      section of the pelvic exam and how comfort during the examinations related to quality of
      life, self-esteem, and sexual function in English speaking females at least 18 years of age
      with chronic vulvovaginal conditions.
