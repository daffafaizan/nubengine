      and malignant lesions in the pancreatic body and tail.Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy
      (LDP) are reported to have lower blood loss, fewer postoperative complications and a shorter
      length of stay without a substantial increase in the operative time. Pancreatic fistula (PF)
      is the major source of postoperative morbidity and is associated with numerous further
      complications, suffering, longer hospital stay, higher costs and sometimes death. Frequencies
      range from 5% to 64%. Several procedures have been proposed to reduce the rate of PF. stapler
      closure is considered to be safe and approved particularly in LDP. Numerous predictive
      factors for PF have been reported in previous studies. Among these risk factors, the most
      important might be the texture and thickness of the remnant pancreas. However, the judgment
      of pancreatic texture has been based on the surgeon's observation and there still exists no
      objective method of assessing pancreatic texture. Furthermore there is no strict guideline on
      which type of cartridge to use according to pancreatic stump texture and thickness.
      Therefore, this single blind randomized controlled trial is designed to establish an
      objective criterion for assessing pancreatic stump texture, and unify stapler cartridge
      according to pancreatic stump texture and thickness. Patients were stratified
      intraoperatively by gland texture-hard (fibrotic) or soft (normal) and subsequently
      randomized according to different stapler cartridge. Pancreatic fibrosis is accessed by
      histopathology and pancreatic stellate cell.
