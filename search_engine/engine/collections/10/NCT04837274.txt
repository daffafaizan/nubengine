      that form crystals in the joints. Ingestion of food and/or beverages containing high purine
      levels (e.g., beef, game meats, liver, shellfish, herring, mackerel, anchovies, sardines,
      mushrooms, dried beans and peas, sweetbreads, excessive alcohol, etc.) increase uric acid
      levels and thereby can complicate the management of uric acid levels in individuals with
      hyeruricemia and/or gout. Prior research has shown that ingestion of a chrysanthemum flower
      oil containing a high level of polyphenols significantly reduced the uricemic response to
      ingesting a meal high in purines. Additionally, black cherry and grape juice extracts are
      purported to have uric acid lowering properties. We have previoulsy reported that tart cherry
      powder, another naturally occuriring source of phlyphenols, lessens exercise-induced
      inflammation. This study will examine if tart cherry can also reduce the uricemic response to
      ingesting a high purine containing meal. If so, this may provide another dietary approach to
      help individuals manage their uric acid levels.
