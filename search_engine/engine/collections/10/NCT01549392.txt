      determine using standard diagnostic imaging ie CT/MRI especially following previous treatment
      with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Hemorrhage, edema, inflammation and vascular
      necrosis.

      Both MR spectroscopy and DECT have been reported as being able to define areas of recurrent
      tumour as opposed to treatment-related effects. We wish to investigate the correlation
      between MR spectroscopy and DECT in assessing tumour progression or response to Avastin in
      comparison with patients not receiving Avastin.

      Health Canada has approved Avastin for clinical use in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      who have previously received temozolomide and radiotherapy. We propose to perform a DECT scan
      at baseline at presumed tumour progression and again 3 months to determine the effects of
      tumour progression/response on blood brain barrier permeability and vascular volume. The
      group of 15 patients will be compared to a group of 15 patients who do not receive Avastin at
      recurrence involving DECT scanning and MR spectroscopy at the time of the radiological
      progression and 3 months later.
