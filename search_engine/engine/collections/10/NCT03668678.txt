      changing diet and physical activity knowledge among preschool-aged children. The secondary
      objective of this study was to better understand the relationship between diet and physical
      activity related outcome variables in preschool aged children and their primary caregivers.

      iGrow Readers was created to support literacy development among preschoolers, while promoting
      nutrition and physical activity messages. This program utilizes the social cognitive theory
      because it focuses on different environments influencing individual's behaviors and knowledge
      acquisitions, primarily through observing others within the context of social interactions
      and experiences. Developmentally appropriate preschool-aged children books, including
      relevant Native American books, facilitate the themes of healthy physical activity and
      nutrition practices. The program, a 6-8-week educational curriculum, helps young children
      understand the benefits of making healthy decisions involving nutrition and physical
      activity.
