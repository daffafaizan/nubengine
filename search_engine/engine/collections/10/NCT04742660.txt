      anesthesia with 30-50% of incidence, increased up to 80% in high risk group. The risk factors
      of PONV include women population, the previous history of PONV, motion sickness in usual
      life, non-smoker, exposure to inhalants, perioperative opioid and laparoscopic surgery. Women
      population is a strong risk factor of PONV. Although perioperative management of PONV based
      on a guideline has been done in a lot of medical centers worldwide, the incidence of PONV is
      still reported relatively high.

      The main ingredient of Glycyrrhizin is liquorice which has been used as antispasmodics,
      antiemetics or treatment for gastric ulcer in oriental medicine. Utilizing these effects of
      liquorice, we investigate whether the addition of glycyrrhzin to conventional antiemetics is
      effective to decrease the incidence of PONV and improvement of severity of PONV.
