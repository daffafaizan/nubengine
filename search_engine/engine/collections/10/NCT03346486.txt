      of the measurements and logistics for the BRAVE intervention study (N=10), 2) a pre-screening
      phase to select volunteers for the intervention study based on metabolite analyses (N=600),
      3) the BRAVE intervention study as a controlled non-randomized open-label fixed sequence diet
      switch trial (N=88)and 4) a non-interventional reference group to estimate the learning
      effect due to repeated cognitive testing (N=30).

      The Brainfood dietary regime is planned optimal for metabolism and cognitive function; having
      focus on regular meal frequency (breakfast, lunch and afternoon snack) and well-balanced
      light lunch at work -according to the so-called plate model and optimized recipes- will be
      provided.
