      dental implants in case of soft tissue augmentation and in comparison, to normal healing.

      An innovative and comprehensive geometric/thermal imaging analysis will be employed that is
      non-contact and non-invasive to patients and will allow to characterize the healing process
      in a 2D-3D dimensional and volumetric way.

      This approach, combined with LSCI and clinical and radiographic outcomes, will provide new
      data on the biology and critical phases of soft tissue healing around implants, as well as on
      the stability and aesthetics of the peri-implant tissues with different grafts.

      Patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs) will also be used to assess the level of pain
      and discomfort associated with soft tissue augmentation procedures.
