    
      Approximately 500 eligible participants will be enrolled into 1 of 2 cohorts (250
      participants in each cohorts) according to the presence or absence of BM at baseline.

      After study intervention discontinuation, all participants will undergo an end-of-treatment
      visit (within 7 days of discontinuation) and will be followed up for safety assessments
      (which is 40

      + up to 7 days after the discontinuation of all study interventions).

      All participants will be followed up for survival status and duration of treatment on
      subsequent therapies after intervention discontinuation every 3 months (Â± 14 days) from the
      date of the safety follow-up until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, as
      per defined in the protocol.
