      Trans-Perineal Laser ablation (TPLA) in the treatment of patients with symptomatic benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Methods: Patients with urinary
      symptoms secondary to BPH underwent TPLA under local anaesthesia in four centers. Under US
      guidance, up to four 21G applicators were inserted in the prostatic tissue. Each treatment
      was performed with diode laser operating at 1064 nm changing the illumination time according
      to prostate size.
