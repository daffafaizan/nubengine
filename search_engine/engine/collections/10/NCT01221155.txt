           upright postures and muscular activation.

           - Refine motion tracking and stabilization of manual elastography, used in preliminary
           study, to evaluate layered tissue strain patterns during clinical continuous passive
           motion (flexion, extension and lateral bending) and standardized weight bearing (stance,
           flexion to 15 degrees and arm-extended weight holding).

        2. Relative muscle activity is significantly related to muscle strain ratio.

           - Evaluate the biceps as a simple model, in parallel, for displacement and elastography
           changes.

        3. Displacement and strain decrease monotonically as depth of paraspinal tissue from the
           surface increases.

           - Evaluate the timing relationship of total passive loads, myoelectric paraspinal
           behavior displacement/strain characteristics at the l4/l5 level for the longissimus,
           intermuscular fascia and multifidus at baseline and during standardize weight bearing
           tasks as well as at recumbent baseline, during and return to neutral for prone and
           lateral recumbent continuous passive motion maneuvers.

        4. Change in tissue displacement and strains differ between healthy and unhealthy
           individuals when change in muscle activity and tissue layer are taken into account.

             -  Assess any differences in displacement and strain characteristics of the layered
                longissimus, intermuscular fascia and multifidus between healthy and chronic low
                back patients in the timing relationship to movement, total passive load amplitudes
                and myoelectric activity.
