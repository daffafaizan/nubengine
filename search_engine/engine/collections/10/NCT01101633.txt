      Study I: A randomised controled meal test study aimed at studying the acute effect of the
      alginate-containing beverage on appetite sensation and spontaneous calorie intake (and safety
      i.e. nausea, well-being etc) in normal to overweight healthy subjects. Here, a placebo
      beverage or the alginate-containing beverage will be administered as a pre-load before a
      standardised breakfast meal. Subjective appetite sensation will be measured with Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) every 30 minutes four up to 5 hours. An additional beverage will be
      administered prior to an ad libitum lunch meal, where spontaneous water and energy intake
      will be registered.

      Study II: Secondly the aim is to study the effects of a daily intake of a placebo or
      alginate-containing beverage on body weight and composition in a randomised parallel
      intervention study of 12 weeks duration. A total of app. 50 obese healthy adults will receive
      a hypocaloric diet and be randomised to consume either placebo or alginate-containing
      beverage before each of the three main meals every day. The development in body weight and
      composition and blood pressure will be monitored and blood samples will be analysed for
      markers related to the risk of CVD and type 2 diabetes.
