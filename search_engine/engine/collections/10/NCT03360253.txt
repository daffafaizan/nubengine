    
      RCT to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 administrated for
      21 days to significantly reduce the duration of crying time and fussines in infants from
      15days to 4 months of age with colic. 66 infants feed with human milk and 180 infant feed
      with infant formula will be included. As primary outcome we will measure the difference
      between children receiving L. reuteri DSM 17938, 108 CFU vs children receiving placebo
      regarding average daily crying duration (minutes per day, from average of crying from days 19
      to 21 after randomization), measured by Barr diary. Secondary/exploratory outcomes will be
      average of crying time on day 7 and 14 (Barr diary) of L. reuteri groups vs placebo group;
      average of crying and fussing time on day 7, 14 and average from days 19 to 21 after
      randomization (Barr diary) of L. reuteri groups vs placebo group; responders percentage on
      day 7, 14 and 21, decrease in daily average crying time of 50% during the study; QoL
      (PedsQL-2.0-Family Impact Module AU2.0 spa-MX) changes from baseline to days 7, 14 and 21 and
      Edinburg postnatal depression scale for mothers from baseline to days 7, 14 and 21
