      compression to accomplish a right posterior sectionectomy is described. Dissection or
      encirclement of the sectional pedicles for resection area demarcation is thus avoided. Ten
      patients underwent this technique successfully without mortality or major morbidity.
      IOUS-guided finger compression of sectional portal pedicle feeding the right posterior
      section is a feasible, safe, and effective method.
