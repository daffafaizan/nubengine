      symptoms but causes serious mortality in the world population. In addition to the routine
      changes due to the pandemic, face-to-face education has been switched to online education.
      The integration of online education and more technology into the curriculum than ever before
      has increased students' anxiety towards learning. It was also found to cause high levels of
      anxiety and stress, characterized by feelings of risk, insecurity, and unhappiness. Studies
      show that high levels of anxiety negatively affect students' adaptation to daily life and
      their life satisfaction levels. In recent years, non-pharmacological techniques have been
      widely used in reducing anxiety and stress. One of them is laughter therapy. Laughter therapy
      reduces feelings of negative stress, anxiety, and depression by increasing the body's
      readiness to deal with different types of problems. The aim of this study is to examine the
      effects of online laughter therapy on anxiety, life satisfaction and psychological well-being
      levels of nursing students, who have switched to online education during the pandemic
      process.
