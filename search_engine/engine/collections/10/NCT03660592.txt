      always present in conditions that are ideal for immediate diagnosis, which sometimes
      compromises outcome. Physical examination, laboratory findings and radiography are imperfect,
      resulting in a need for sophisticated test results that delay management.

      Lung ultrasonography is becoming a standard tool in critical cases in the ED.

      the investigators aim to perform ultrasonography on consecutive patients admitted to the ICU
      with dyspnea, comparing lung ultrasonography results on initial presentation with the final
      diagnosis by the ICU team.

      Three items were assessed: artifacts (horizontal A lines or vertical B lines indicating
      interstitial syndrome), lung sliding, and alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion,
      these items were grouped to assess ultrasound profiles.

      This study assesses the potential of lung ultrasonography to diagnose heart failure.The
      second aim of this study was to evaluate the inter-observer reproducibility of LUS performed
      by ED residents in the evaluation of cardiac causes of acute dyspnea.

      Patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnea will be prospectively enrolled in this
      study. In each patient, LUS was performed by two ED residents blinded to clinical diagnoses.

      AHF was determined on the base of clinical exam, chest x-ray , brain natriuretic peptide
      (BNP) and echocardiographic findings.

      A patient lung comet score (LCS) was obtained by summing the number of comets in each of the
      scanned spaces.

      Then the probability of AHF was defined as :

      low probability (LCS<15) intermediate probability (15 <LCS<30), and high probability (LCS>30
      ).
