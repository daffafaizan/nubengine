      cancer and early death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1997). More recently,
      smoking has become a global problem among youth and it is imperative that research puts an
      emphasis on prevention and intervention particularly in this age group (World Health
      Organization, 2009). Over the past few years, research has shown that internet-based
      interventions are more cost effective, cater to individuals who are unable/unwilling to
      attend weekly treatment sessions with a therapist, and are promising in terms of improving
      attrition rates, a major problem with most treatment trials. Moreover, internet-based
      interventions use technology often utilized to attract youth (interactive games, animation,
      video clips etc.) and thus may reach and engage a wider range of individuals than traditional
      face-to-face interventions. ACT is an empirically-based intervention that uses acceptance and
      mindfulness strategies and has been shown to increase psychological flexibility. The aim of
      the present study is to investigate the usefulness and effectiveness of an Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) internet-based smoking cessation intervention program for college,
      high school and vocational school student smokers. Findings are expected to show that a
      digitalized program designed to engage youth in smoking cessation can result in quitting
      smoking and has a high applicability potential especially among the hard-to-reach population
      of youth.
