    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine cross-sectionally in SLE subjects the effects of valve
      vegetations detected by TEE on the presence of active cerebral microemboli, altered
      perfusion, ischemic brain lesions, and NPSLE. Findings in SLE patients will be compared to
      those in controls.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine longitudinally in patients with new or recurrent NPSLE and
      during remission whether valve vegetations, active cerebral microemboli, and abnormal
      cerebral perfusion improve, or normalize when compared to baseline data in patients without
      NPSLE or matched controls.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine cross-sectionally in SLE subjects the presence of active
      cerebral microemboli, altered brain perfusion, brain injury, and NPSLE in relation to other
      valve abnormalities, such as valve thickening or valve regurgitation, in addition to or
      independently of valve vegetations; and to determine longitudinally these relationships in
      patients with NPSLE. Findings in SLE patients will be compared to baseline data in patients
      without NPSLE or matched controls.

      Our SLE/NPSLE cohort of >400 subjects and our extensive cardiac and neuroimaging experience
      with TEE and MR-based techniques are essential resources for this study. We will integrate
      inflammatory and hemostatic parameters with multiple imaging modalities to investigate the
      causal connection between valve vegetations and the generation of microemboli and perfusion
      abnormalities, which then result in brain injury and NPSLE. A causal connection of valve
      vegetations to brain injury and NPSLE would result in a fundamental shift in the
      understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy of Libman-Sacks endocarditis and
      NPSLE. These findings may extend to other inflammatory diseases associated with valve disease
      and complicated with central nervous system disease.
