    
      Study design Multicenter, phase IIb, non randomized, open-label trial involving 3 groups of
      HCV-mono infected or HCV-HIV co-infected patients: group G1 (patients infected with HCV
      genotype 1), group G2 (patients infected with HCV genotype 2), and group G4 (patients
      infected with HCV genotype 4).

      Number of Subjects A sample size of 40 patients per group will allow to demonstrate that the
      SVR12 is >70% ("expected efficacy" in difficult-to-treat patients, according to SPARE interim
      results), with the lower bound of the confidence interval being >50% ("unacceptable"
      efficacy). The overall sample size is 3x40=120 patients.

      Participating Countries 3 countries from West Africa (Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire) and Central
      Africa (Cameroon) Number of Sites 5 clinical sites:

        -  Côte d'Ivoire: Hepatology Departementat the Yopougon University Teaching Hospital, ,
           Abidjan; and Blood Donors clinic (CMSDS) at the National Blood Bank (CNTS), Abidjan

        -  Senegal: CRCF (Centre Régional de Recherche et de Formation), and Fann University
           Teaching Hospital

        -  Cameroon: Clinique de la Cathédrale

      Duration of Recruitment : 6 months

      Duration of Treatment : 12 weeks

      Duration of follow-up : 36 weeks

      Anticipated Start Date / Anticipated End Date: November 2015 - October 2016

      Target Population /Demographics : Patients >18 years, living with chronic hepatitis C
      genotype 1, 2 or 4, in West and Central Africa. In each genotype group approx. 50% of
      patients will be HCV-HIV co-infected, and 50% of patients will be mono-infected with HCV

      This study will enable us to assess the feasibility, tolerance and efficacy of such a
      strategy in resource-constrained settings with considerable treatment needs.
