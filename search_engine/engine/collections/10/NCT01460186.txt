      decipher the genetic risk of breast cancer displaying amplification of the HER2 gene as well
      as resistance or toxicity to adjuvant treatments. SIGNAL study is in the process of
      recruiting 6000 localized breast cancer patients.

      The purpose of the StoRM trial is to create a cohort of 1500 patients with metastatic breast
      cancer including detailed epidemiologic and treatment data. Using germ line polymorphisms in
      these patients and comparing them to patients with localized cancer from the SIGNAL study,
      the investigators will answer questions specific to the genetic influence on the prognosis of
      breast cancer and its response to treatments in the metastatic phase.

      Blood samples will be collected in one 6 ml EDTA and one 6 ml ACD tube after informed consent
      and inclusion in the study. To simplify the evolution of the study and to avoid all
      confusion, the sample collection procedures followed will be identical to those used in the
      SIGNAL study.

      As the samples are received at the biological resource center, the plasma will be aliquoted
      into a 500 µl tube and frozen at -80° C. DNA will be extracted using standard protocols.
      Plasma and DNA will be stored in anticipation of genetic analyses. An aliquot of the DNA
      sample will be genotyped for a panel of high-density genetic markers covering the whole
      genome, for genome-wide association studies.

      The collected plasma may also be used for analyses to determine the expression profile of
      proteins, alone or combined with genetic factors that allow distinguishing between groups of
      patients.
