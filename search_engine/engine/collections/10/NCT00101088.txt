      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of temsirolimus when administered with imatinib
      mesylate in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Determine potential dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine, preliminarily, hematologic and cytogenetic response rates in patients treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22 and oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients receive 2 additional
      courses beyond maximal response. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      temsirolimus until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.
