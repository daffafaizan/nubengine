      trial of a specially designed health behaviour change intervention delivered in a secondary
      care outpatient clinic to improve the primary clinical outcome of functional walking ability
      This feasibility study, based on the MRC framework for assessing feasibility and piloting
      methods, will assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of the intervention and study
      design, as well as pave the way for a larger and more definitive trial.
