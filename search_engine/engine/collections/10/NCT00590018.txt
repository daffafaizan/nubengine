      corticosteroids versus placebo. Randomization will take into account biventricular versus
      univentricular repairs/palliations and whether the patients received intraoperative steroids.
      Patients will be compared with matched controls based on: diagnosis, +/- intraoperative
      steroids/phenoxybenzamine, cardiopulmonary bypass/cross clamp/circulatory arrest times and
      inotrope requirements. Those in the treatment arm will be dosed with hydrocortisone - stress
      dose (100mg/m2/dose daily x2, then taper with two days at half the original dose and one day
      at one quarter of the original dose) and then the steroids will be discontinued. Outcome data
      will include: heart rate, blood pressure, mixed venous oxygen saturation to assess cardiac
      output, blood cultures/infection/antibiotics (antibiotics as deemed necessary by the primary
      cardiologist), +/- gastrointestinal bleeding, time to discontinuing inotropic agents, time to
      extubation, length of intensive care unit admission and survival. Laboratory studies will be
      assessed before and 24 hours after the institution of steroids. The following labs are
      standard of care in the unit and will be assessed: glucose, electrolytes, blood urea
      nitrogen/creatinine, complete blood counts, lactate, arterial blood gases, cultures and stool
      guaiac. The following labs will be assessed in addition to regular monitoring: cortisol,
      adrenocorticotropin hormone and C reactive protein.
