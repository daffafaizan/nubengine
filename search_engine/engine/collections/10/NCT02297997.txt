      groups by randomization. They take the medication for two weeks under double-blind. Four
      study groups take cetylpyridinium chloride of 1.5mg, 3mg, 4.5mg and 6mg daily for two weeks.
      Control group takes the placebo for the same period. The main outcome variables are measured
      and compared respectively in baseline, immediately after dosing end and two weeks after the
      end of administration. Finally cetylpyridinium chloride is verified whether it has a
      preventive effect on sarcopenia and set an appropriate dose.
