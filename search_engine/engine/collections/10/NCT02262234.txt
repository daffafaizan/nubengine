      (SCI). Unfortunately, current pain treatments offer incomplete relief, produce side effects,
      and/or involve significant cost. Low-risk, low-cost treatments capable of addressing residual
      pain and pain-related disability are greatly needed. A number of research studies have
      associated educational interventions with improvements in pain-related outcomes.

      The overall goal of the proposed pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,
      and potential benefits of two types of educational programs for people with chronic pain and
      spinal cord injury. This study aims to identify a low-cost, low-risk treatment option that
      empowers people with pain and SCI to improve their functioning and quality of life.
