    
      This study is a two-site, prospective, parallel group, observer-blinded randomized controlled
      trial (RCT). The objective of this study is to determine the relative clinical effectiveness
      of 1) chiropractic care and supervised exercise; and 2) supervised exercise in adolescents
      with sub-acute recurrent LBP (2-12 weeks duration) or chronic LBP (>12 weeks duration ).

      A total of 184 participants 12-18 years of age will be recruited from the Twin Cities of
      Minneapolis/St.Paul and Portland metropolitan areas to the research clinics at Northwestern
      Health Sciences University (NWHSU) and the University of Western States Portland(UWS). Data
      collection measures and study protocols will be standardized across sites. The Office of Data
      Management at NWHSU will serve as the central data coordinating center, with a web-based
      interface for centralized data handling and treatment assignment.

      Self-reported outcome measures assessing pain and disability, will be collected at baseline,
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. In addition, quality of life,
      improvement, and satisfaction will be measured at months 3, 6 and 12. Objective outcome
      measures including lumbar dynamic motion and trunk muscle endurance will be assessed by
      blinded examiners at baseline and post-treatment phase (3 and 6 months). Patients will wear
      accelerometers for the 7 days preceding follow up visits for months 3 and 6. Qualitative
      patient interviews assessing patient and care-giver perceptions of care will be also be
      conducted at 3 and 6 months.
