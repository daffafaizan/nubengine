           establish a fistula between the anterior chamber and the subconjunctival space to permit
           the aqueous humour to exit the eye.

        -  Subscleral trabeculectomy has remained the most commonly performed glaucoma surgery to
           which the newer operations are compared.Although this procedure is very effective in
           reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) immediately, surgical failure has often been
           observed over time due to fibrosis of the surgical site and resultant non-filtering
           bleb. -Improvement of the complication profile and the efficacy of glaucoma filtering
           surgery is still a major concern for glaucoma surgeons.Therefore, several modifications,
           combinations, and new techniques of subscleral trabeculectomy have been described.

        -  In the current study, a fornix-based conjunctival flap will be fashioned in an attempt
           to encourage more posterior drainage. In this modified trabeculectomy technique, an
           additional small perpendicular strip of sclera is removed extending from the AC to 2 mm
           beyond the edge of the scleral flap thus creating an extended subscleral trabeculectomy
           facilitating aqueous passage into the posterior subconjunctival space.
