      endothermal ablation) is beneficial for venous ulcer healing. This randomized controlled
      trial is conducted to assess the effects of immediate foam sclerotherapy in the first visit
      to vascular outpatient clinic (immediate intervention). Patients in control group will
      receive foam sclerotherapy at four weeks (early intervention). Endothermal ablation is
      performed in early setting in both groups when truncal vein anatomy is suitable. The primary
      outcome for this study is the reduction of venous ulcer area at four weeks.
