      stiffness, peripheral and aortic blood pressures, wave reflection, endothelial function, and
      muscle strength in overweight/obese women.

      The specific aims of the study were:

        1. To examine whether 6 weeks of loaded-WBVT was more beneficial than unloaded-WBVT in
           decreasing cardiovascular risk factors by assessing arterial stiffness (aortic, leg, and
           systemic), aortic blood pressures and wave reflection, brachial blood pressures,
           autonomic function, endothelial function, and blood flow (leg and arm).

        2. To determine the extent to which 6 weeks of loaded-WBVT improved body composition
           measured by changes in fat and lean mass utilizing dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and
           waist circumference.

        3. To evaluate the effect of 6 wees of loaded-WBVT on muscle strength by using the
           one-repetition maximum test (leg press and chest press exercises).
