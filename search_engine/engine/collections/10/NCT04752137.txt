      pre-operative unit via IV injection at the time that they present to the pre-operative unit,
      which is approximately 4 hours before surgery. The patient will be monitored during and after
      ICG dosing.

      During surgery ICG fluorescence using a near-infrared imager will be performed at the time of
      and immediately following primary tumor resection. The imager will evaluate the primary tumor
      to ensure appropriate tumor fluorescence. Once the primary resection is complete and the
      surgeon believes that he/she has achieved negative or planned positive margins, fluorescence
      measurements of the tumor bed will be performed. If areas of positive signal remain, these
      areas will be resected if possible and sent to pathology for histologic evaluation. It will
      be recorded if the surgeon perceived negative margins but the device detected positive
      margins.

      Tumor specimens and residual fluorescence positive samples will be evaluated using fresh
      frozen and permanent histology. Permanent samples will be evaluated for tumor and local
      fluorescence using confocal microscopy with an ICG cube. Positive fluorescence signal and its
      correspondence with neoplasm will be noted, a will tumor that does not fluoresce.

      Tissue being removed is 1-2 mm from non-structurally important tissue that either has or does
      not have signal positivity for additional pathologic assessment. It should have no impact on
      patient outcome, does not represent intervention on sensitive areas (such as neurovascular
      structures), and can further be used as potential margin around the tumor.
