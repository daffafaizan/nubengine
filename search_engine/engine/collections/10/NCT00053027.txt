        -  Determine whether rituximab and cladribine will increase the complete remission rate and
           the unconfirmed complete remission rate in patients with mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      An initial cohort of 6 patients at Mayo Clinic receives rituximab IV over 4-8 hours on day 1
      and cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 4-8. If 2 or more patients experience unacceptable
      toxicity during the first course, the study is discontinued; otherwise, the study is opened
      for enrollment at all NCCTG sites. (The phase II study is open for enrollment as of 5/14/04.)

      Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 2-6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.
