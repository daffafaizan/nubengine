      irisin in obese subjects of both sexes who had different classes of obesity and evaluating
      their sexual dimorphism and secondly evaluate the association of IL-6, clusterin and irisin
      with insulin resistance.

      Method: This study was conducted on 176 non-diabetic subjects of both sexes. Participants
      were classified according to their sex into two groups; the male and female groups. The male
      group (88 men) was classified according to BMI into; group 1 (22 lean men), group 2 (22 class
      I obese men), group 3 (22 class II obese men), and group 4 (22 class III obese men). The
      female group (88 women) was also classified according to BMI exactly as the male group.
      Fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, lipid panel, serum IL-6, clusterin and irisin levels
      were measured. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's as post hoc test was used for
      comparison of variables.
