    
      A blind randomized study of celecoxib in women at high risk of developing breast cancer.
      Subjects are to take twelve months of drug/placebo. At baseline and after twelve months
      subjects will have a random periareolar fine needle breast aspiration that will be assessed
      for epithelial cell growth and other markers of risk. Baseline and twelve month serum samples
      will also be assessed for hormones and growth factors which may be associated with breast
      cancer risk. Mammograms at baseline and twelve months will also be assessed for breast
      density changes.
