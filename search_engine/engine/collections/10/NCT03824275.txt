      prostate cancer with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Upon enrollment, subjects will
      undergo standard of care imaging (defined as a CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis,
      and 99mTc bone scans) if not obtained within 45 days of enrollment. Subjects will have
      standard of care laboratory evaluations and undergo 18F- DCFPyL PET/CT.

      [18F]DCFPyL will be used for study imaging.
