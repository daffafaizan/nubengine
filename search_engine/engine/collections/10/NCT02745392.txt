    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel group study designed to compare
      the safety and efficacy of a range of doses of ZP-Zolmitriptan intracutaneous microneedle
      systems to placebo. Subjects who have consented and meet the entry criteria will be
      randomized to one of four blinded treatment groups. There will be a screening period of up to
      1 week, followed by a run-in period to record migraine activity. The run-in period is to
      determine eligibility for randomization, and is planned to be 4 weeks in duration but may be
      extended up to an additional 4 weeks to accommodate scheduling. Qualified subjects will
      randomize to the double-blind treatment period at Day 0 and will have up to 8 weeks to
      confirm and treat a qualifying migraine. Using the eDiary to confirm they are experiencing a
      qualified migraine, subjects will self-administer the patch or patches and continue to
      respond to questions in the eDiary for 48 hours post treatment administration.
