      report ongoing abdominal pain during remission or why people with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) develop abdominal pain. One theory is that people with chronic pain have somehow grown
      more sensitive.

      It is assumed that such heightened sensitivity depends both on bottom-up processing and
      top-down processing. Bottom-up processing refers to information that is relayed to the brain
      along so-called afferent fibres. Top-down processing refers to feedback provided by the brain
      to lower areas along efferent fibres.

      The investigators will (1) measure the capacity of people to inhibit pain through top-down
      processing, (2) test if the human pain experience is enhanced due to sustained activation of
      certain afferents, and (3) assess to what extent people are impacted by psychosocial
      inhibition and activation factors. Results of people with IBS in remission will be compared
      with the results of two groups of people with IBD (those with pain and those without) and the
      investigators will explore if their measurements differentiate between groups.

      It is hypothesized that (1) IBS patients and IBD patients with abdominal pain will be less
      able to inhibit their pain compared to IBD patients without abdominal pain (2) IBS patients
      and IBD patients with abdominal pain will score higher on psychosocial inhibition factors and
      lower on psychosocial activation factors when compared to IBD patients without abdominal
      pain. (3) In the total cohort, laboratory measures of pain inhibition will correlate with
      self-reported psychosocial inhibition and activation factors. (4) IBS patients and IBD
      patients with abdominal pain will show more temporal summation compared to IBD patients
      without abdominal pain.
