      for a duration of two weeks. In Group 1, subjects will participate in daily sessions of
      sham-rTMS followed by supervised aerobic exercise (Sham rTMS+Aerobic); in Group 2, subjects
      will participate in a combination of rTMS and supervised aerobic exercise (Real
      rTMS+Aerobic). Serum BDNF-TrkB signaling in lymphocytes and TMS-based electrophysiological
      measures of LTP-like plasticity will be measured. A comparison of such measures in a group of
      patients with PD and in a group of age-matched controls (n=12) will be analyzed to establish
      the effect of the disease on indices of plasticity.
