      VAS between oral and vaginal misoprostol for cervical ripening before office hysteroscopy. As
      reported in previous publication (Sordia-Herna'ndez et al., 2011), the mean ±SD of VAS in
      oral misoprostol group was approximately 6.04 ± 1.5, while in vaginal misoprostol group was
      approximately 2.8 ± 1.2. Accordingly, we calculated that the minimum proper sample size was
      23 women in each arm to be able to detect a real difference of 1 unit with 80% power at α =
      0.05 level using Student's t test for independent samples. Sample size calculation was done
      using Stats Direct statistical software version 2.7.2 for MS Windows, StatsDirect Ltd.,
      Cheshire, UK

      However, the study population consists of 100 patients in reproductive age that requires
      diagnostic hysteroscopy for investigation of infertility or AUB.

      The patients will be recruited from Office hysteroscopy clinic of the Obstetrics and
      Gynecology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University from October 2017 to march 2018.

      The Patients will be allocated equally into 2 groups ( each group contain 50 patients)

      Groups will be as follows:

        1. Group A: 50 patients receive 200 mg oral misoprostol (Misotac; Sigma Pharm) 3h before
           the procedure.

        2. Group B: 50 patients receive 200 mg misoprostol (Misotac; Sigma Pharm) 3h before the
           procedure moistened with saline solution will be inserted in posterior fornix of vagina.
