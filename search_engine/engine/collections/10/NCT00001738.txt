      growth factor (VEGF) is associated with new vessel growth in the eye, such as diabetic
      retinopathy. Recent work using immunopathologic techniques have shown that VEGF is
      upregulated in both experimentally induced uveitis and in uveitic eyes as well, with no
      evidence of neovascularization. This pilot study will evaluate the level of VEGF in the blood
      of uveitic patients with and without macular edema. This level will be determined also in the
      ocular fluid of those patients that are undergoing ocular surgery. These levels will be
      compared with age and sex matched controls.
