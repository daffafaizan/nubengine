      for a switch from enfuvirtide to raltegravir. At baseline, enfuvirtide was switched to
      raltegravir without additional changes to the antiretroviral regimen allowed. Viral load,
      T-cells, and toxicity were evaluated at baseline, 2, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. Adherence and
      injection site reactions were evaluated at baseline, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. The single-copy
      assay was used to measure HIV RNA levels at screening, baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks.
