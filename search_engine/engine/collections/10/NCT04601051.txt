    
      This 2-part first in human (FIH) study consists of an open-label, single ascending dose Part
      1, which may identify the optimal biologically active dose (OBD) of NTLA-2001, followed by
      Part 2, if applicable, an open-label, single-dose expansion at the OBD to further
      characterize activity of NTLA-2001, provide an initial assessment of the effect of NTLA-2001
      on clinical measures of neuropathy and neurologic function, and obtain additional safety data
      at the OBD.
