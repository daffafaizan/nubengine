    
      The proposed trial is intended to test the effectiveness of a proven, manual driven,
      five-session safer sexual skills building group (SSB) intervention (Schilling et al., 1991;
      El Bassel and Schilling, 1992) for female patients in MMTP or in drug-free outpatient
      treatment. The effects of SSB will be compared to a standard group HIV education session
      (HE).

      This study uses a 2-group, randomized, parallel-group design to compare a five-session safer
      sexual skills building group to a single 60-min HIV education session (control condition).
      The control condition is designed to standardize and simulate the usual care at community
      clinics.
