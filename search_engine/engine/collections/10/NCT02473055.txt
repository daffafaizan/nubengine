      sleep in incubators is fragmented. Sleep contributes to brain maturation so interventions to
      foster sleep are needed. During Kangaroo Care (KC) behavioral indicators of Quiet Sleep have
      been observed but, not confirmed by objective electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis.The
      purpose was to determine the effects of Kangaroo Care (KC) on EEG-based sleep using Nihon
      Koden polysomnography and cardiorespiratory patterns by comparing KC sleep to incubator
      sleep.. A randomized controlled study with 90 preterms (KC = 50; control = 40) in which KC
      infants received 2-3 hours of KC between feeds after a comparable pretest period in an
      incubator and control infants remained in an incubator during the 2-3 hour pretest and test
      periods. In the incubator infants were inclined, prone, and nested; in KC infants were
      inclined, prone, and chest-to-chest underneath a blanket. The medically stable preterm
      infants were a mean 32 weeks postmenstrual age.
