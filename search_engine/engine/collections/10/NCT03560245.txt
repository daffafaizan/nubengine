      10-15 and will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms: 20µg bryostatin or placebo for
      twelve weeks. The first two doses of study drug will be a loading dose 20% higher (i.e.,
      24µg) than the assigned dose and will be administered one week apart. Thereafter, the
      assigned dose of 20µg will commence with the third dose and be administered every other week.
      Drug is administered IV by continuous infusion over 45(±5) minutes. Subjects are scheduled to
      receive seven doses over 12 weeks.
