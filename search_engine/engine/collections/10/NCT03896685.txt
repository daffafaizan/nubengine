    
      This is a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-country trial evaluating the
      efficacy of new combination regimens for treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR-TB.

      Regimens examined combine newly approved drugs bedaquiline and delamanid with existing drugs
      known to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (linezolid and clofazimine). The study
      will enroll in parallel across 1 experimental and 1 standard-of-care control arms, in a 2:1
      ratio. Randomization will be stratified by extent-of-TB-disease phenotype. In the
      experimental arm, treatment will be for 24 or 39 weeks; duration will be assigned according
      to extent-of-TB-diseasephenotype. In the control arm, treatment will be delivered according
      to WHO guidelines (and local practice); duration will be variable. Trial participation in
      both arms will last at least until Week 73, and up to Week 104.

      Non-inferiority will be established for the experimental arm if the lower bound of the
      one-sided 97.5% confidence interval around the difference in favorable outcome between the
      control and experimental arms is greater than or equal to -12%.
