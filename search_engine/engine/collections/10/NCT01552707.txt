    
      Prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel, single-dose phase I-II clinical trial in which
      62 patients affected with L4-L5 degenerative spondylolisthesis grade I-II according to
      Meyerding and/or with L4-L5 degenerative discopathy needing spinal fusion will enter the
      trial with the primary objective of assessing the feasibility and safety of "ex-vivo"
      expanded autologous mesenchymal stem cells fixed in allogenic bone tissue in spinal fusion.
      Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of the implantation by imaging (computerized
      helicoidal tomography and X-ray) and clinical questionnaires (pain by visual analogue scale,
      quality of life by SF-36 and Oswestry Disability Index).

      Patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (instrumented spinal fusion and
      the tissue engineering product composed by "ex-vivo" expanded autologous mesenchymal stem
      cells fixed in allogenic bone tissue in spinal fusion or the standard treatment of
      instrumented spinal fusion and patient's bone iliac crest). Thereafter, patients will be
      followed for 12 months.

      Imaging assessment will be done by an independent blinded radiologist.
