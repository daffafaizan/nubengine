      between 10% and 30%. This state can produce negative effects on the fetus as:

        -  Affect cerebral development

        -  Increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight

        -  Increase the risk of childhood overweight problems

        -  Adverse impact on the cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioural development of
           infants

      Due to the possible side effect of antidepressants on mother and fetus, its necessary to
      examine alternative solutions to this state.
