      cannabis' (CNB's) acute effects on cognition and simulated driving performance, the
      persistence of these deficits over the hours after use, and the influence of prior experience
      with CNB on these effects. The project also will link an extensive literature on CNB's
      effects on laboratory cognitive tests to simulated driving performance for the first time,
      providing a crucial validation of CNB's neurofunctional effects identifying maximally
      relevant candidate measures for field sobriety tests. To this goal, the proposed study was
      based upon a careful and thorough review of the scientific literature describing CNB effects
      on cognitive test performance and driving, as well as current state-of-knowledge on the
      sensitivity of biological assays for identifying recent CNB use. The study will carefully
      characterize the persistence of CNB's acute effects on cognitive test performance and driving
      over a several-hour time span. This will allow us to identify the point at which any effects
      of CNB intoxication on cognitive tests and driving performance cannot be distinguished from
      normal, i.e., the first step towards establishing standards for legal and social policy. The
      data obtained from simulated driving, cognitive tests, and biological assays of THC will be
      used in analyses aimed at identifying what tests or combination of tests predict both recent
      use and driving impairment risk.
