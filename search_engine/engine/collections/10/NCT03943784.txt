    
      Endoscopic Variceal Ligation group; Inclusion criteria From January 2014 to April 2017, a
      study group was created, including all paediatric patients with a known chronic liver disease
      with suspicion of portal hypertension and grade 2 or 3 OV or red spots, regardless of the
      grade of the OV diagnosed by endoscopy.

      Propanolol group Patients in the Endoscopic Variceal Ligation study group were compared with
      an historical cohort of 30 consecutive patients with portal hypertension and grade 2 or 3
      esophageal varices or red spots, regardless of the grade of the esophageal varices in the
      upper endoscopy, who received propranolol as primary prophylaxis from January 2009 to
      December 2013.

      Ligation sessions were performed every 6 weeks until varices eradication. When eradication
      was achieved, upper endoscopy was performed at 2 and 6 months to assess the efficacy of the
      treatment. If no varices were observed, upper endoscopies were performed once a year
      thereafter.

      Eradication was defined as disappearance of all varices or reduction to grade 1 small varices
      without reddish spots and no gastric varices.
