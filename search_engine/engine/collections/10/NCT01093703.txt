      allograft function and survival. Loss of the circadian blood pressure pattern is common in
      kidney transplant recipients and is associated with poor allograft kidney function.
      Nevertheless, it is unclear if restoring the normal day-night BP pattern will translate into
      better allograft outcome. Although studies in patients with and without chronic kidney
      disease indicate that restoration of the normal nocturnal dipping in BP is possible by
      changing the timing of the BP medications to cover the overnight period (chronotherapy), this
      has not been tested in kidney transplant patients. This exploratory study is driven by the
      hypothesis that chronotherapy will restore the normal circadian BP pattern and will translate
      into better allograft function and into lower LVM 1-year from transplantation.
