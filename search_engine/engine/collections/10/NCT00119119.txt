      pentoxyphilline (400 mg, twice a day) and tocopherol (500 mg, twice a day), given during 12
      months on the fibrosis related to HCV chronic hepatitis in 100 patients who are non-long-term
      responders, or with contra-indication or intolerance to the current treatment of reference
      (combination with interferon-alfa and ribavirin). It is a therapeutic, national,
      multicentric, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial. The patients included had
      histological liver injuries with a Metavir score of A 0 to 2, F 2 or 3 and no other etiology
      of liver disease. The primary objective is to analyse the variation of the liver fibrosis
      evaluated by morphometric analysis between the 2 liver biopsies performed at the end of the
      trial and within 3 years before the treatment. The secondary objectives are the variation of
      the Metavir fibrosis and activity scores, of serum markers of fibrosis (hyaluronate, PIIIP,
      TNF-alfa, fibrotest) and ALT between the end and the beginning of the treatment.
