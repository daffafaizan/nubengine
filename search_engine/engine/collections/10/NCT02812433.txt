      investigators need to run a phase Ib pilot trial to ensure the feasibility and safety of
      using sildenafil in this population of newborns. Thus, for this phase Ib study, the
      investigators hypothesize that sildenafil can be safely used with term asphyxiated newborns
      treated with hypothermia. The investigators will test this hypothesis with the following
      specific aims:

        1. Safety (primary): ensure that sildenafil can be safely used in asphyxiated newborns
           treated with hypothermia;

        2. Tolerability (secondary): study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sildenafil
           in these newborns;

        3. Efficacy (exploratory): determine whether sildenafil improves neurodevelopment at 2
           years of age, decreases brain injury on day 30 of life and decreases neuroinflammation.
