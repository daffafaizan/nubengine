      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in early childhood is essential for children's cognitive and
      visual development. DHA can either be supplied preformed in the diet (e.g. via fatty fish) or
      synthesised by conversion of its essential precursor alpha-linolenic acid (e.g. via rapeseed
      oil). The study examines the effect of two different approaches to optimise infants´ fatty
      acid status.

      The study sample consists of healthy newborns and their mothers (3 x 57 infants according to
      a priori power calculation) who are enrolled in delivery hospitals in the region of Dortmund,
      Germany. In total, the individual study program covers the first 10 months of infant's life.
      Biomarkers of fatty acid status from the mother are collected 8 weeks pp for the estimation
      of pre- and perinatal fatty acid supply. Additionally, information on maternal diet during
      pregnancy and after delivery is assessed. The intervention covers the period of complementary
      feeding (from 4 to 6 months of age until 10 months of age). In all groups the specific study
      food is given 5 to 7 times a week, whereas 2 of these are fish meals in the fatty fish group.
      At the age of 4 and 10 months blood samples are collected from the infants to examine the
      effect on blood fatty acid status. Parameters of visual and cognitive development are also
      assessed at the age of 4 and 10 months using VEP examinations and Bayley scales. Infants´
      dietary intake is assessed from the end of the 2 months until 10 months of age using
      continuous weighed dietary records.
