      effective anaesthesia techniques. Presently, this procedure is usually performed under
      general or local anaesthesia. General anaesthesia provides an effective sedation; however,
      for minor procedures, general anaesthesia is resource-intensive and postoperative
      complications, such as nausea, vomiting or extended time to ambulation, are more likely.
      Local anaesthesia alone may be uncomfortable or uncooperative for patients. Therefore, an
      efficient drug regimen is required that reduces analgesic consumption, minimises
      opioid-related side effects and shortens post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) stay following
      surgery.

      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective Î±2 adrenoreceptor agonist that provides sedation
      without respiratory depression. Its sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic and haemodynamic effects
      have made it a useful adjunct to anaesthesia and sedation. DEX may provide a conscious
      sedation under monitored anaesthesia care (MAC) that is a logical middle ground between
      general anaesthesia and local anaesthesia. Intranasal DEX was recently shown to provide
      satisfactory anaesthesia and premedication sedation in healthy volunteers and paediatric
      patients. The intranasal route is not only effective, but also well-tolerated and convenient
      This trial is going to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of intranasal
      DEX(dexmedetomidine) in breast lumpectomy under local anaesthesia, and to investigate the
      optimal dose of intranasal DEX in breast lumpectomy.
