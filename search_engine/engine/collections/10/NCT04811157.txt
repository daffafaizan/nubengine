      goal of this study is to investigate the effect of the dietary fibers in an unsweetened
      yoghurt. Fermented dairy products have naturally a very low dietary fiber content, but such
      products can be supplemented with variety of dietary fibers and promote the growth of
      beneficial gut bacteria. Also, as fermented milk products contain live bacteria, it is
      possible that prebiotic fibers could support the growth of the starter-culture based strains
      in the human gut.
