    
      This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-surgeon, single-center post-market
      clinical follow up study whereby patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will have
      bilateral implantation of trifocal intraocular lenses. The patients will either be implanted
      with the hydrophobic IOL FineVision POD F GF or the hydrophilic IOL FineVision Pod F.

      The primary and secondary effectiveness data for visual acuity, contrast sensitivity,
      halometry, aberrometry, questionnaire outcomes and any adverse events will be collected.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 10 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 7 postoperative) over a period of 3 months. Subjects would have the option for
      unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary endpoint data will be collected at the 3 months follow up visit. Data analyses will
      be done after the last patient finished the final examination to support the study
      publication plan.
