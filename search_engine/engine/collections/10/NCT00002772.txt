      breast cancer and at least 4 positive axillary lymph nodes treated with intensive sequential
      chemotherapy with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide versus standard dose
      doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by high dose STAMP I (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin,
      and carmustine) or STAMP V (cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and thiotepa) and autologous stem
      cell rescue. II. Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in this patient population. III.
      Measure the breast cancer cell content of the peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC)
      fractions from patients randomized to the PBPC supported arm and correlate the results with
      the disease free survival, survival, and pattern of relapse in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, primary
      treatment (mastectomy alone vs mastectomy plus radiotherapy following chemotherapy vs breast
      conserving surgery plus radiotherapy following chemotherapy), menopausal status
      (premenopausal vs postmenopausal), estrogen and/or progesterone receptor status (positive vs
      negative vs unknown), N2 disease (yes vs no), T3 disease (yes vs no), myeloablative
      chemotherapy regimen (STAMP I vs STAMP V), and source of progenitor cells (marrow vs
      peripheral blood vs both). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients
      receive doxorubicin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29, paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on days
      43, 57, and 71, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 85, 99, and 113. Patients receive
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 3-10, 17-24, 31-38, 45-52, 59-66, 73-80, 87-94,
      101-108, and 115-122. Arm II: Mobilization chemotherapy: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over
      1 hour and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Harvest: Patients
      undergo harvest of autologous bone marrow and/or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Patients
      who undergo harvest of PBSC alone do not receive mobilization chemotherapy but receive
      hematopoietic growth factors prior to harvest. High dose myeloablative chemotherapy: Patients
      receive STAMP I OR STAMP V: STAMP I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and
      cisplatin IV over 24 hours on days -6 to -4 and carmustine IV over 2 hour on day -3. STAMP V:
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 24 hours, carboplatin IV over 24 hours, and
      thiotepa IV over 24 hours on days -7 to -4. Transplantation: Autologous bone marrow and/or
      PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Both arms: Patients who are postmenopausal or who have hormone
      receptor positive disease receive oral tamoxifen daily beginning 4 weeks after the completion
      of chemotherapy and continuing for 5 years. Patients who underwent breast conserving surgery
      receive locoregional radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4.5-5.5 weeks beginning 4-6 weeks after
      the completion of chemotherapy. Patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy may
      receive locoregional radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks at the discretion of their
      physician. Patients are followed every 4 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients (500 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 5 years.
