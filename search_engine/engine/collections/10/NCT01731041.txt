      anti-thrombotic therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Previous observations have
      shown that in patients on clopidogrel therapy undergoing percutanoues coronary intervention
      who get re-loaded with clopidogrel obtain enhanced platelet inhibition. Ticagrelor represents
      a new class of nonthienopyridine platelet inhibitors designed to address the limitations of
      current oral antiplatelet therapy, which has been recently approved for clinical use.
      However, to date it is unknown if greater inhibition of platelet aggregation can be achieved
      by adding a ticagrelor loading dose in patients already on maintenance ticagrelor therapy (90
      mg twice daily). In addition, how to manage patients undergoing coronary interventions
      already on chronic ticagrelor therapy with regards to ticagrelor loading is an emerging
      clinical question which has yet to be explored. Therefore, understanding the pharmacodynamic
      implications of a ticagrelor re-load strategy in patients on already on chronic ticagrelor
      therapy is warranted. The scope of the present study is to evaluate the impact of ticagrelor
      re-load in patients on chronic ticagrelor therapy. A total of 60 patients will be randomized
      into one of the following two arms of treatment: 1) 90 mg of ticagrelor; 2) 180 mg of
      ticagrelor. Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed at baseline, 1-hour and 4-hour
      after dosing administration. Comparison between baseline and 4-hour values in term of
      platelet P2Y12 reactivity index determined by whole blood vasodilator-stimulated
      phosphoprotein will be the primary end-point of the study. Secondary endpoints will include
      other pharmacodynamic measures.
