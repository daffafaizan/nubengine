      use of bisphosphonates increases the risk for AFFs in older women, according to the results
      of a population-based, nested case-control study. Unique radiographic pattern of AFF is
      reported, such as simple transverse or short oblique fracture with breaking of medial cortex
      and cortical thickness. But radiographic evaluation were performed for fracture patients in
      previous reports and the femoral condition of long-term bisphosphonate treatment patients
      before fracture is not known.

      The main objective of this study is to reveal the effects of long-term bisphosphonate
      treatment on femur.
