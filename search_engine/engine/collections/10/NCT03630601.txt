      I. To define the feasibility of the current photoacoustic imaging (PAI) technology in various
      groups of human subjects.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the utility of the current PAI on various groups of human subjects.

      II. When possible, via means of an existing data review, PAI will be correlated with standard
      imaging modalities performed on patients as routine part of clinical care or on protocol.

      III. When possible, via means of an existing data review, PAI will be compared to pathologic
      specimens.

      IV. When possible, via means of an existing data review, PAI data will be correlated with
      outcomes of patients to therapies they receive.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo PAI on different parts of the body over 20 minutes for up to 5 imaging
      sessions for 6 months.
