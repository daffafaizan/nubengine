      in vitro after multiple passages, and since prolonged post infectious effects occur in vitro,
      comparison of two formulations, an elixir and a self-emulsifying drug delivery system
      (SEDDS), is needed to determine the appropriate dose formulation for Phase II studies.

      Patients are randomized to four treatment arms to receive SC-52151 elixir or SEDDS
      formulation at 1 of 2 doses for 2 weeks, with follow-up for 14 days.
