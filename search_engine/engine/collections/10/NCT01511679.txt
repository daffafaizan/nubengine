    
      The overall specific aims of this study are to: 1) assess the short and long-term
      consequences of alcohol exposure on brain, cognitive, and emotional/regulatory development
      during preadolescence and adolescence; 2) determine the effects of timing, dose, and duration
      of alcohol on brain and cognitive development; 3) assess recovery of neural and behavioral
      function to determine if the plasticity of the adolescent brain makes it more or less
      vulnerable to alcohol's acute and chronic effects; 4) understand how other key covariates
      (e.g., existing or emerging psychopathology, family history of alcoholism, demographics,
      pubertal development) factor into alcohol's effects on the brain; and 5) identify early
      neural, cognitive, and affective markers that may predict alcohol abuse and dependence during
      adolescence and/or adulthood.
