    
      In this pilot, randomized, sham-controlled open-label RCT, hospital rooms will be fitted with
      Aranet4 Home CO2 sensors.

      Each device will continuously measure indoor CO2 concentrations at 1-minute intervals during
      4 time periods:

      1. Baseline: staff blinded to CO2 levels displayed on sensor

      2-3. Sham/Intervention period: sensors on the same ward will be randomized to placebo (sensor
      not showing CO2 levels to staff) or Intervention (sensor displaying CO2 levels to staff) in a
      cross-over design

      4. Post-intervention phase (3 weeks post-intervention): staff blinded to CO2 levels

      Each measurement period will consist of 7 days with no washout period.

      Our primary hypothesis is that CO2 sensors will record less time (minutes) with elevated CO2
      levels during the intervention period, compared to the Sham periods. However, carry-over
      effects will be investigated by comparing the Intervention periods to the Baseline and
      Post-intervention phases.

      Note [February 27, 2021]: due to technical problems with the Aranet4 device Bluetooth
      connection, outcome data will be analyzed according to measurement data at 2-5 minute
      intervals (measurements can be made every minute, but data cannot be downloaded with the
      current version of the app due to technical problems).
