      minimally invasive alternative for the replacement of missing central and lateral incisors,
      offering several advantages to orthodontic space closure or tooth replacement with
      implant-supported restorations. Debonding of the zirconia RBFDPs represents the main
      technical complication since clinically established airborne particle abrasion (APA) of an
      inert zirconia surface does not always provide sufficient resin-bond strength. Further, APA
      can also impair the mechanical properties of zirconia restoration affecting its long-term
      success. Nano-structured alumina coating (NAC) presents an alternative non-invasive zirconia
      surface pretreatment. The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to study the
      effect of NAC coated bonding surface of zirconia RBFDPs affecting its debonding and clinical
      survival rate.

      The study adopts a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind design contrasting the
      use of NAC to air-borne particle abrasion (APA) as a surface pretreatment method of zirconia
      RBFDPs. Healthy patients in need of a missing central or lateral incisor replacement are
      screened and rated to be eligible by two calibrated dentists. RBFDPs are randomly allocated
      into two groups and inserted by the same operator. The first group, where the bonding surface
      is pretreated with APA serves a control group. In the second group the restorations are
      pretreated with NAC. The participants and the operator are blinded to the group assignment in
      a double-blinded trial design. The primary outcome evaluated is the retention/survival of the
      RBFDP. Non-parametric tests and Kaplan-Meyer analysis will be used to determine differences
      between both study groups.
