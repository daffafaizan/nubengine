      safety follow-up. Site visits take place At -30 days, -7 days, Day 0, Week 3, 6, 9 and 12/end
      of study [EOS]. There is also a Week 14 phone call for a safety review with the subject. The
      purpose of this early phase 2 trial is to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of
      both the active topical solution and the placebo also called the 'vehicle' formulated as a
      topical solution that penetrates the skin of the lower legs and tops of the feet. There are
      also secondary and exploratory objectives to determine if this active has efficacy properties
      during the 12-week treatment period as hypothesized. Even though pirenzepine is approved and
      used for another indication systemically, the sponsor believes the active in a topical
      solution to be effective in treating painful peripheral neuropathy commonly found in diabetic
      patients.

      There are both objective and subjective tests being introduced in this trial due to the
      unique nature of the study, and lack of defined and standardized efficacy parameters.
