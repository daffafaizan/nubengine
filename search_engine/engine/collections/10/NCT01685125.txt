      I. To compare the progression-free survival of men with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer treated with abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) plus dasatinib to that of men
      treated with abiraterone alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profile of the combination, as well as the rate of
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, objective responses, and changes in circulating
      tumor cell (CTC) numbers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive
      abiraterone acetate 1000 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) and prednisone 5 mg PO twice daily
      (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone as patients in arm A. Patients
      also receive dasatinib 100 mg PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
