      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) as a disease process characterized by progressive airflow
      limitation associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to particles or
      harmful gases and is not fully reversible. This restriction generates an expiratory flow of
      air entrapment resulting hyperinflation, coupled with the effects that systemic, structural
      changes occur in skeletal muscles which leads to greater fatigue causing dyspnea.
      Consequently, patients with COPD require participation of accessory muscles of respiration,
      which should have a dual function during activities involving the upper limbs, to supply the
      ventilatory requirements and movements of the shoulder girdle, which increases dyspnea
      carrying the patient to stop their activities, leading to physical deconditioning and
      progressively decreasing aerobic capacity. This demonstrates the need to improve the
      resistance of the upper limb muscles in these patients, thus contributing to a reduction in
      the degree of dyspnea and improved their aerobic capacity. The investigators propose a study
      aimed at determining the effectiveness of muscle training in the degree of dyspnea and
      aerobic capacity in COPD.
