      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dexmedetomidine in pediatric subjects. The study
      population consists of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated pediatric subjects,
      ages ≥2 through <17 years old, that require sedation in an intensive care setting for a
      minimum of 6 hours. Subjects will be divided into two groups based on age: Group I will
      consist of subjects ages ≥2 through <6 years old and Group II subjects age ≥6 through <17
      years old. Within each group there will be four escalating dosing levels. Both groups can
      enroll simultaneously; however within each group, the next dose level cannot begin to enroll
      until all subjects have completed the previous dose level and the Data Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB) has approved enrollment to the next level. The level of sedation will be
      assessed using the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS). Based on these scores, and clinical judgment,
      additional sedation with midazolam will be administered according to the label. Pain will be
      assessed using the Faces, Legs, Arms, Cry & Consolability (FLACC) scale. Venous blood samples
      for pharmacokinetic analysis will be obtained at designated times. The pharmacodynamic and
      safety measures that will be monitored and the pharmacodynamic impact of dexmedetomidine on
      tracheal extubation will also be explored if subject is extubated within 24 hours.
