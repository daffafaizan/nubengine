      healthcare-related and nosocomial infections in humans. It lives as a commensal organism but
      can also provoke very severe diseases. Identifying markers of the 'colonization/disease'
      transition is of paramount importance. We recently found that an association of two
      regulatory RNAs was associated with S. aureus infection rather than colonization and with the
      severity of infection. Those preliminary results have to be confirmed with a more important
      prospective cohort.
