      I. To obtain results from a high throughput drug sensitivity assay within 10 days, procure
      drug within 14 days and initiate treatment within 21 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To achieve a response (cytoreduction or at least partial response) greater that than
      expected for comparable refractory patient populations with other salvage regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      A patient receives a drug intervention based on the results of a high throughput sensitivity
      assay. This assay best matches a drug to the patient's disease.
