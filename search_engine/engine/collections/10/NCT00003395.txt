      suitable for outpatient therapy in patients with advanced hematologic cancers. II. Determine
      the pattern of clinical adverse experience in patients treated with this drug. III. Evaluate
      evidence of clinical responsiveness that may provide leads for further testing in patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours
      on days 1-25. Courses repeat every 3-5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of arsenic trioxide
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which
      no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for 1
      month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
