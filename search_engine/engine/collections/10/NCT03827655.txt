      administered presurgery to evaluate if it can enhance the recovery of GI function postsurgery
      in participants undergoing open or laparoscopic-assisted partial small- or large-bowel
      resection. In addition, some participants will also receive TAK-954 postoperatively to
      evaluate if there is an additional benefit when this drug is administered both pre and
      post-surgery.

      The study will enroll approximately 375 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      in 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the five treatment arms- which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need).

      All participants will be given intravenous infusion preoperation and daily postoperation
      until return of upper and lower GI function or for up to 10 days.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Belgium, Germany, and
      Hungary. The overall time to participate in this study is up to 100 days. Participants will
      be treated with the study drug for up to 10 days after surgery or after return of GI function
      post-surgery (whichever occurs first).
