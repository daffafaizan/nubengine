      yolk-free egg will result in differences in the HDL composition and profile of lipids and
      proteins (lipidome and proteome), which will be associated with changes in HDL functionality.
      It is further hypothesized that it will be possible to discriminate between responders and
      non-responders to eggs in terms of increasing both apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-I) content in the
      plasma, corresponding with more protective HDL particles; and increasing HDL functionality
      (cholesterol efflux and anti-oxidant capacity).

      Subjects will consume an egg free diet during study protocols, except for the egg meal
      provided by the study. The study is comprised of two 4-week feeding periods with a 4-week
      washout between testing periods. While on the study, subjects will consume the equivalent of
      two eggs for breakfast, either whole egg or yolk-free egg. Following a 2-week low-egg lead-in
      period, subjects will be randomly selected to start on either arm and cross over to the other
      arm after the 4-week washout period.

      Measured results will be compared between the baseline and the 4-week end point for each arm.
      Additional comparisons may be made between 4-week endpoints.
