      Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) is charged with prospectively assessing the effects
      of renal-risk variants (RRVs) in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) on outcomes for kidneys
      from donors with recent African ancestry and the recipients of their kidneys, after deceased-
      and living-donor renal transplantation. For the purposes of APOLLO, recent African ancestry
      is defined as individuals with similar genetic make-up to those currently residing in Africa.
      APOLLO will also study the impact of APOL1 RRVs on the health of living kidney donors with
      recent African ancestry.
