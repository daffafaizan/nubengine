      for effective biopsy. Patient discomfort and pain frequently occurs with manipulation of
      probe during transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy and this situation may qualify of
      the achievement of this procedure.

      In this study, we aimed to describe the impact of different two local anesthesia types on
      cancer detection rate in transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.
