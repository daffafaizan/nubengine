      criteria were all patients in the Internal Medicine clinic at NMCSD who were sent to the lab
      to obtain routine chemistry panels for follow up by their primary care providers. The primary
      outcome is increased referral to nephrology in accordance with NKF K/DOQI guidelines if GFR
      values are reported on routine chemistry panels. Key secondary outcomes are Primary Care
      Provider knowledge of NKF K/DOQI guidelines, specifically when patients with chronic kidney
      disease need to be referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation.
