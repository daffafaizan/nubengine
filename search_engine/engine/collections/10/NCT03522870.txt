    
      Subjects with Type 1 diabetes who meet criteria will be enrolled at up to eight clinical
      research sites in China. Subjects will be randomized to either flash glucose monitoring
      system(Freestyle Libre®;Abbott Diabetes Care,Witney, Oxon,UK) or conventional Self
      Measurement of Blood Glucose (Bayer®)alone at least three times per day. Primary outcome
      variable is the difference in HbA1c which will be analyzed in a central laboratory between
      baseline and the 26weeks follow-up. Secondary outcome variables such as time-in-range,
      frequency and duration of and hyperglycemic episodes etc. will be assessed at baseline (Week
      0 to 2), Week 12-14 and Week 24-26 via professional continuous glucose system (Ipro2®;
      Medtronic). At the same time, demographic factors, clinical data, patient reported outcome
      (PROs) will be collected. Assessment of Adverse Events will occur via self-reporting at each
      visit and/or phone call. All patients will receive same ordinary diabetes education.
