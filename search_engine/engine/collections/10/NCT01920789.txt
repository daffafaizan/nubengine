    
      This is a multicenter Scandinavian randomized phase II study of stereotactic hypofractionated
      radiotherapy with body frame versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for stage I
      medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer patients. There is a 1:1 randomization
      between arm A: Stereotactic radiotherapy to a dose of 66 Gy with 22 Gy per fraction at the
      isocenter (45 Gy covers the PTV) in 3 fractions during one week with body frame fixation and
      a planning target volume with a 5 mm margin around the macroscopic tumour, and arm B:
      Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy to a dose of 70 Gy with 2 Gy per fraction in 35
      fractions during 7 weeks with fixation in a vacuum pillow and a planning target volume with a
      2 cm margin around the macroscopic tumour.
