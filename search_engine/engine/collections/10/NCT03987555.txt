    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ Determine the feasibility of monitoring paclitaxel serum drug levels in patients with a
      solid tumor (e.g. lung, breast, and gynecologic cancers) for which Paclitaxel is the standard
      of care.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Compare Paclitaxel serum drug levels among patients with differing degrees of
           chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.

        -  Compare mitochondrial function within circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells
           among patients with differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy at
           the end of Paclitaxel treatment.

        -  Compare the ability of pulsed electromagnetic field to modulate immune cells of
           individuals experiencing differing degrees of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
           at the end of Paclitaxel treatment.
