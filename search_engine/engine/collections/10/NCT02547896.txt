      association with Codeine 50mg (opioid) administered in 50 patients aged less than 18 and
      requiring extraction of two third molars (with very similar positions, whose degree of
      difficulty is high). It will be assessed the following parameters: 1) onset and duration of
      surgery after administration of local anesthetic, 2) open mouth prior to surgery, on the 2nd
      day after the operation and on the 7th day after surgery (removal points), 3) subjective
      assessment of pain using a visual analog scale, 4) measurement of facial edema in the second
      day after the operation and on the 7th day after surgery (as compared with the measurements
      obtained before surgery) and 5) the incidence, type and severity of adverse reactions. The
      analysis comparative data, along with the proper application of statistical tests, provide
      the basis for an evaluation of both efficiency medications used.
