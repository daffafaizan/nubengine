    
      Patients who have achieved PR or better on a bortezomib- and lenalidomide-containing
      combination therapy will be randomized to receive maintenance therapy with 28-day cycles of
      either ixazomib alone or the combination of ixazomib and lenalidomide. If steroids were part
      of the patient's qualifying regimen, steroids will be administered using the same drug(s),
      schedule(s) and dose(s) as those of the last treatment cycle of the bortezomib-,
      lenalidomide- and steroid-containing regimen. Ixazomib will be administered per orem (PO) at
      3 mg on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28-day cycles. Lenalidomide will be taken PO, once daily at the
      same dose as the last treatment on days 1 through 28 of the 28-day cycles. Patients will
      start the randomized maintenance therapy after receiving a minimum of 6 cycles of a
      bortezomib- and lenalidomide-containing combination treatment but may have received up to 8
      cycles if they continued to show improvement in their response after the first 6 cycles.
      During cycle 1, patients will have clinical laboratory tests weekly (days 1, 8, 15 and 22)
      and MM disease assessments on day 22 to monitor for efficacy and potential toxicity.
      Beginning with cycle 2, patients will have clinical laboratory tests performed twice a month
      and MM disease assessments once a month. Patients will be treated until documentation of PD
      or if subject meets any of the treatment discontinuation criteria.
