      between the distal carpal row and the radius. Wrist injury is a common presentation to the
      Emergency Department (ED) in the UK. Amongst these patients, the scaphoid is the most
      commonly fractured carpal bone, accounting for 51-90% of carpal fractures and between 2-7% of
      all fractures.

      Given that: 1) various clinical complications may arise from a misdiagnosed scaphoid
      fracture; and 2) clinical and radiographic diagnosis of scaphoid fracture is often
      challenging, particularly at the time of presentation, this study aims to evaluate whether
      the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the investigation of patients presenting with
      a suspected scaphoid fracture, with negative findings from the initial conventional
      radiography (4-view plain x-ray), leads to improved levels of efficiency, quality of care and
      patient experience.

      This study is a single centre randomised, non-blinded, prospective study. Participants will
      be randomised, following the initial negative conventional radiography, to either: no further
      imaging at A&E (consistent with current clinical practice); or 2) wrist MRI. The study
      considers a follow-up period of 6 months.
