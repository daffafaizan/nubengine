    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in up to approximately 51
      non-diabetic obese subjects with a body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 35 kg/m2. Subjects will be
      blinded, but investigators/site staff and sponsor will be unblinded for Cohort 1. In Cohort 2
      and 3 subjects, investigators, and contract research organization personnel are blinded to
      investigational product and sponsor is unblinded. The subjects will participate in the study
      for up to approximately 27 weeks, including a screening period (including a run-in),
      treatment period, and safety follow-up.

      Subjects will be randomized 4:1 to MEDI0382 (n=12) or placebo (n=3) for Cohort 1 and
      randomized 2:1 to MEDI0382 (n=12) or placebo (n=6) for Cohort 2 and 3. In Cohort 1 those
      subjects randomized to MEDI0382 or placebo will be dosed daily with a weekly titration
      schedule until the highest clinically tolerated dose (CTD) is established. In Cohort 2
      subjects randomized to MEDI0382 or placebo will be dosed daily with a 2 week titration
      schedule up to the highest CTD is established In Cohort 1. In Cohort 3 subjects randomized to
      MEDI0382 or placebo will be dosed daily with a 4 week titration schedule up to the highest
      CTD established in Cohort 1. Once the highest CTD is identified, subjects will continue on
      the highest CTD for an additional 2 weeks of treatment for Cohort 1 and 3 and additional 4
      weeks treatment for Cohort 2. All subjects will return 28 days post last dose for a safety
      follow-up visit.
