      persisting patient complaints are poorly understood. Conversion efficiency and impaired T3/T4
      ratios in athyreotic patients may play a major role. We hypothesised that the extent of
      ablation either by surgery or radioiodine treatment may result in biochemical disequilibria
      between FT3, FT4 and TSH and those may be, in turn, associated with persisting
      symptomatology.

      The study follows patients after radioiodine therapy as well as a control group over half a
      year, assessing thyroid status, set points, conversion rates, thyroid volume, LT4
      administration and dosing, demographic characteristics and quality of life measures. The
      treatment mode is not part of the study, and determined by criteria and procedures of best
      standard care. For that reason, a randomised or blinded design is not possible.

      Changes and interrelationships between thyroid parameters and QoL measures are analysed
      within-subjects and between treatment groups.
