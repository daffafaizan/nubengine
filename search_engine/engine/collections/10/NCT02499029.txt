      Iraq diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there is a high vulnerability of
      these individuals to develop a substance use disorder (SUD). While there have been a host of
      studies focused largely on dopaminergic mechanisms of drug reward, they have not led to the
      development of adequate treatments for either preventing people diagnosed with PTSD from
      developing SUD or for treating comorbid PTSD/SUD. Based on extensive work with addictive
      drugs and preliminary data from our group, the investigators propose that stress impairs
      prefrontal cortex regulation of the basal ganglia habit circuitry and this pathology renders
      PTSD patients susceptible to developing SUD. Moreover, the known effects of addictive drugs
      to further impair prefrontal regulation are synergistic with this pathology, thereby making
      treatment of comorbid PTSD/SUD particularly difficult. Preclinical studies have revealed that
      glutamate levels within the nucleus accumbens have been implicated in drug seeking behavior
      in the animal model of relapse. The amino acid precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) appears to
      restore glutamate to normal levels and may also prevent glutamate levels from spiking
      following subsequent stimulant use. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in preventing relapse in drug dependent individuals
      with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD. Veterans with substance use disorders who have achieved at
      lease one week of abstinence will be randomized to either placebo or NAC (2400-3600mg/day)
      for 8 weeks.
