      stress related to inflammation. In this Phase I study, patients with active ulcerative
      colitis will be receive TUDCA for six weeks. Safety and tolerability will be assessed.
      Efficacy will be assessed using ulcerative colitis disease activity measurements as well as
      markers of intestinal inflammation before and after treatment. The overall goal of this
      project is to determine TUDCA can provide a new therapeutic option with a desirable safety
      profile for patients with ulcerative colitis focused on the inflamed intestinal epithelium.
