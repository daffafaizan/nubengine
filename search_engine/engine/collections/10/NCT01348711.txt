      perinatal morbidity and mortality. Routine antenatal care is focused on the detection of
      women at increased risk to apply this population a program of careful monitoring and
      appropriate intervention.

      Uterine artery Doppler during anomaly scan at 12 to 14 weeks in selected women at increased
      risk, has proved to be accurate to detect those who will develop PE or IUGR during the second
      half of pregnancy.

      A variety of angiogenic proteins have been studied as potential markers for pre-eclampsia.
      Among these protein Plgf and sflt-1 have respectively demonstrated higher and lower levels in
      pregnant women who will subsequently develop pre-eclampsia.

      Our study is aimed to evaluate the performance of serum Plgf and sflt-1 measurement in
      association with uterine artery Doppler as a screening for placental insufficiency.
