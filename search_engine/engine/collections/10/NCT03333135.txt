      intervals: Baseline (at 72-24h prior to each event), immediately post (within 2h of race
      completion) and during recovery (within 24-48h of race completion). Each assessment will
      consist of 1)lung function tests; 2) a saliva and blood sample; 3) a lung and cardiac
      ultrasound. Subjects will be recruited from a range of age groups and fitness levels, before
      being divided into a sham or treatment group. Both groups will use a commercially available
      Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy device (50% of devices will not produce
      electromagnetic fields - i.e., sham device) before the event and during recovery.
