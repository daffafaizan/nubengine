      clinical event versus delayed treatment results in the prolongation of time to Clinically
      Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) conversion up to Month 36 and up to Month 60 since
      randomization in Study 27025 (REFLEX). Furthermore, the study is intended to explore whether
      RNF treatment initiated after the first clinical event versus delayed treatment delays
      disability (including development of secondary progressive MS) and reduces disease activity
      (including the annual relapse rate [ARR]) in the long term (up to Month 36 and up to Month 60
      since randomization in Study 27025 (REFLEX). The study will also assess the long-term safety
      profile of RNF (up to Month 36 and up to Month 60 since randomization in Study 27025
      (REFLEX).
