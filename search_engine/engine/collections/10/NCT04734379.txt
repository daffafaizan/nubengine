      course of up to 6 weeks. Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into
      the study and complete baseline evaluations. Dosing with study drug will begin on Day 1 and
      continue for 48 weeks. Participants will return to the clinic at Week 1 (7 Â± 2 days after the
      first study drug administration) and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 for study evaluations, and
      at Week 52 for post-treatment follow-up evaluations. Plasma biomarker collection will occur
      at baseline, and Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Biomarker collection
      will occur at screening, Week 24 and Week 48. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will
      occur at screening, and Weeks 24 and 48. Safety labs will be collected at each study visit as
      well as during Week 4.

      Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed at all visits and subjects will be contacted one day
      after the start of treatment (that is, one day after Visit 1), and monthly thereafter
      including at each visit. Subject will also be contacted one day after Visit 6/last day of
      dosing with study drug for subjects who discontinue early.

      Subjects/caregivers will be queried for study drug compliance one day after the start of
      treatment (that is, one day after Visit 1), and monthly thereafter.
