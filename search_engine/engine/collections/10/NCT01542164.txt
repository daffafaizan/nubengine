      intervention studies have shown that a high calcium diet resulted in a greater body weight
      loss than a low calcium diet. The mechanism is not clear, but one possible explanation is
      reduced absorption of fat in the gut, due to formation of insoluble calcium fatty acid soaps
      or binding of bile acids which impairs the formation of micelles.

      The aim of this study is to examined for an association between habitual calcium intake and
      fecal energy and fat excretion, concentrations of substrates involved in energy metabolism,
      blood pressure and body weight
