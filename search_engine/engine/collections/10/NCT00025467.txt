      I. Determine the antitumor cytostatic activity of thalidomide, in terms of 6-month
      progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. III.
      Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with
      this drug.

      V. Determine the effect of this drug on initial performance status and histological grade in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
