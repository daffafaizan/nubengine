    
      Target subject population Male and female patients with PCNSL who have failed to achieve a
      response or who have relapsed after prior therapy (R/R) or who are treatment na√Øve but are
      not candidates of standard high-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy. Patients are
      not to have been previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors or Bruton tyrosine
      kinase (BTK) inhibitors; prior treatment with rituximab is allowed.

      Duration of treatment Rituximab will be administered for up to 8 cycles or until intolerance
      or excessive toxicities relevant to the trial therapy, or withdrawal of consents;
      acalabrutinib and durvalumab will be continued until disease progression, intolerance, or
      excessive toxicities relevant to the trial therapy, or withdrawal of consents.

      Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration Dose level 1 Rituximab 375mg/m2
      infusion once every 4 weeks for 8 cycles Acalabrutinib 100mg PO once every day Durvalumab
      1500mg infusion once every 4 weeks Dose level 2 Rituximab 375mg/m2 infusion once every 4
      weeks for 8 cycles Acalabrutinib 100mg PO twice every day Durvalumab 1500mg infusion once
      every 4 weeks Expansion Determined by the result of the dose escalation phase Statistical
      methods

      This study will use the 3+3 design in the dose escalation phase. Analyses will be primarily
      descriptive in nature; no formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. The
      populations used for analysis will include the following:

      Safety analysis set: patients who receive at least 1 dose of anyone of the study drugs will
      be used for safety analyses.
