      at 1 and 7-10 years post-operatively. Our central question is whether we can reduce the rate
      of rate of anterior compartment prolapse recurrence after surgical repair, is the recurrence
      rate reduced with allograft use, and does this benefit hold up over time?

      Methods: Patient will be randomized by computer generated block randomization to native
      tissue (suture based) anterior colporrhaphy or colporrhaphy with graft (ARCUS) usage. Neither
      patients nor surgeons will be blinded due to the nature of the surgery. Patients will be
      followed for 7-10 years post-operatively. Participants will complete a POPQ exam and the PFDI
      (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory) questionnaire pre-operatively. Patients will return for a
      POPQ exam at 1 year post-operatively and complete the PFDI (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory)
      and PISQ (Sexual Function for Women with: POP, Urinary Incontinence and/or Fecal
      Incontinence) questionnaires. Patients will be asked to return to the office for a research
      visit 7-10 years post-operatively for a POPQ exam and to complete quality of life
      questionnaires including PFDI 20 (Pelvic floor distress inventory), PISQ-R (Sexual Function
      for Women with: POP, Urinary Incontinence and/or Fecal Incontinence, Revised), and PGI
      (Patient global assessment of improvement).
