      safe and effective method, indicated for healthy individuals or with cardio-respiratory
      diseases, in the prevention of atrophy due to disuse, within the post rehabilitation
      approach. -surgical intervention and to improve the performance of athletes. Several studies
      evaluated the use of blood flow restriction prior to aerobic and anaerobic exercises, with
      heterogeneous results, without consensus. With this, our research proposal is a pioneer, as
      there is no other study that has investigated the use of upper limb vascular occlusion during
      anaerobic activity in an arm ergometer cycle. This could benefit individuals who need to
      maintain their anaerobic conditioning and who, for some reason, are unable to use the lower
      limbs. In addition, it could benefit in the performance and improvement of the physical
      fitness of athletes in wheelchairs of various modalities, which have their functions
      preserved in the upper limbs. Only a similar study showed the efficacy of this intervention
      model, but in lower limbs. The prevalence of men in published studies of anaerobic capacity
      with the WinGate test, with few studies recruiting women, indicates the need to perform the
      study with a female sample.
