           events in ischemic stroke survivors, but

        -  Current guideline (JNC VIII) has omitted or only partially covered a number of practical
           and important issues as follow;

             -  When and how we measure blood pressure?

             -  Is it justifiable to apply the same blood pressure threshold for office BP and home
                BP?

             -  Should stroke survivors be treated by the same BP goal for non-stroke subjects?

             -  Is it justifiable to apply the universal BP threshold for different mechanisms of
                ischemic stroke?

             -  Is it really about only blood pressure or might it really be "beyond blood
                pressure?"

        -  Lifestyle modification should accompany all the pharmacological intervention but is
           usually in adequate to initiate behavioral changes.

        -  Frequent BP measurement at home will provide more detailed and reliable information than
           occasional office BP's.
