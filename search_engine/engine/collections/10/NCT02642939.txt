    
      This is a non-randomized, multicenter, single-stage phase II study of mifepristone in
      patients with Stage IIIB or Stage IV NSCLC who have failed two or more previous chemotherapy
      regimens.

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the utility of mifepristone as a salvage
      therapy in patients with Stage IIIB or Stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma who have failed
      at least two previous chemotherapy regimens. Efficacy will be measured by improvement in
      progression-free survival and life span; and overall response as compared to historical
      controls.

      Plan to enroll 18 evaluable patients in Stage 1 and up to 22 evaluable patients in Stage 2
      for a total of 40 evaluable patients. Anticipated duration of the study is approximately up
      to 36 months.

      Patients who tolerate treatment in the first cycle are eligible to continue to receive
      treatment until they experience unacceptable toxicity, until they meet any of the withdrawal
      criteria, or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor.

      Patient may continue treatment despite evidence of tumor progression if they feel better,
      i.e. improved quality of life.We will follow all patients for overall survival.

      Current salvage therapy in advanced NSCLC achieves a median progression free survival time of
      10 weeks and overall survival of 10 months. We would like to provide evidence that
      mifepristone will increase the median progression-free survival time to 15 weeks and overall
      survival time of 16 months.
