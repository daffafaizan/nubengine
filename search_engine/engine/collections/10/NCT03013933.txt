    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of brentuximab vedotin (BV) plus
      MDR1 inhibitors cyclosporine (CsA)/verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil [VRP]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain estimates of overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, and response
      duration in patients treated with the combination of BV plus CsA/VRP.

      II. Estimate overall and progression-free survival in patients treated with the combination
      of BV plus CsA/VRP.

      III. Characterize pharmacokinetics of plasma monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) in cycle 1 (for
      expansion cohort only).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin and cyclosporine.

      Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, verapamil
      hydrochloride PO four times daily (QID) on days 1-5, and brentuximab vedotin intravenously
      (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients who have not progressed are followed up every 6
      months until disease progression, start of a new lymphoma therapy, 2 years post treatment, or
      study completion, whichever is earlier. Patients who progress are followed up periodically.
