      injuries. Young females are more vulnerable as they are 3 to 5 times more likely to sustain
      an ACL rupture compare to males.

      Several anatomical, biomechanical and sensorimotor risk factors have been clearly identified,
      however the implication of the central nervous system was recently highlighted. Indeed, it
      has been shown that individuals who will suffer of ACL ruptures exhibited a decreased
      functional connectivity between brain regions responsible for postural control and
      sensorimotor processing. Due to the unanticipated situations that occurred during game
      situations, the role of the brain (i.e neural control) is now advocated to explain
      sensorimotor errors leading to injuries during complex tasks such as faking an opponent.
      Muscle vibration is a reliable tool to assess proprioceptive integration during postural
      control. The ability to shift from one proprioceptive cue to another when postural conditions
      are changing is crucial. This dynamic reweighting process allow to obtain an optimal postural
      control. However, recent investigations revealed that this process is altered among
      symptomatic populations, elderly patients or even under fatigue conditions. More precisely,
      some individuals seem able to shift proprioceptive reliance while other doesn't. To our
      knowledge, no studies have investigated the link between proprioceptive reweighting and
      biomechanical determinants of ACL loads during functional tasks. Thus, the aim of this study
      is to compare lower-limb biomechanics during unanticipated side cutting manoeuvres and single
      leg drop vertical jump among young handball players according to their ability to reweight
      proprioceptive signals.
