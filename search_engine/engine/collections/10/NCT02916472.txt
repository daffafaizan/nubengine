      tolerance, enjoyment and motivation) of performing an adaptive, moderate intensity, aerobic
      exercise program on a 'cybercycle' compared to control (stretching/resistance bands) in
      adolescent and young adults (AYA) with cancer.

      (Exploratory) Aim 2: To explore the effects of an adaptive, moderate intensity aerobic
      exercise program using a 'cybercycle' compared to control (stretching/resistance bands) on
      changes in fitness, body composition, quality of life (QoL), fatigue, sleep and cognition.

      Study Design/Overview:

      This study is a randomized trial in 20 adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors
      (15-30 years old) which will comparing two intervention arms: 1) aerobic exercise on a
      'cybercycle' (stationary cycling with exergaming/videogaming); and, 2) a
      stretching/resistance band 'control' condition.
