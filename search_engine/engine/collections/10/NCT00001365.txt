      modify psychomotor function safely in patients with neurodegenerative disease will be
      evaluated using a modified double-blind placebo-controlled design. Therapeutic activity will
      be rated at various doses by means of standard motor and cognitive performance scales. Safety
      will be assessed at frequent intervals by clinical observation and laboratory tests.
