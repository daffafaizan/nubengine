      performed using the ablation index technology, which has been introduced as a tool predicting
      ablation lesion depth. The index incorporates the following characteristics of radiofrequency
      point-by-point ablation: radiofrequency energy power, contact force, duration of ablation.
      Since the ablation index is calculated for every individual operator depending on his(her)
      personal skills, there is no a strict indication on the safe and effective range of the
      index. This registry aims to evaluate ablation index values used in different centers by
      different operators. Prospective information on arrhythmia recurrence rate and type,
      characteristics of redo ablations, characteristics of reconduction ablated areas will be
      gathered.
