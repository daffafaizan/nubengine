        1. Compare the effectiveness of two primary care management strategies for patients with a
           recent onset of combat-related LBP. We hypothesize early physical therapy access for
           these Soldiers will result in greater improvements in function and quality of life over
           1 year as compared to a stepped care strategy.

        2. Compare the subsequent healthcare utilization associated with two management strategies
           for patients with a recent onset combat-related LBP. We hypothesize early physical
           therapy access will result in decreased healthcare utilization over 1 year as compared
           to a stepped care strategy.

        3. Evaluate the importance of psychosocial factors on outcomes within both groups of
           treatment.
