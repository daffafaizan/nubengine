      treatment at diagnosis is surgery followed by high dose radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
      Despite initial treatment nearly all patients will experience recurrence of the tumor with a
      dismal prognosis. There is no consensus on standard of care at recurrence. Reoperation is
      associated with a high risk of complications and further conventional radiation therapy is
      often not possible as the maximum tolerated dose to the normal brain has already been given.
      In addition most tumors have developed resistance towards chemotherapy. Stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS) may be administered despite prior initial radiation treatment but in order
      to avoid radiation induced complications only limited doses to limited tumor volumes can be
      applied.

      Developing new strategies to improve the effect of radiation selectively on tumor cells
      without simultaneously increase the radiation induced damage of normal brain would be
      valuable.

      The investigators have shown in experimental studies that the drug sulfasalazine enhances the
      number of cancer cells that dies as result of radiation therapy and thereby improves survival
      in combination with SRS in animals with glioblastoma. Sulfasalazine inhibits the production
      of an antioxidant that normally protects the tumor against radiation. Hopefully the trial
      will result in a new and more effective treatment option for patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma.
