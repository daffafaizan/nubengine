      instructions during peri-procedure and procedural day visits to improve the experience of
      gastroenterology procedures. This study would seek to show that through this alternative
      educational measure, there would be an increased show rate to colonoscopy appointments, an
      increased preparation quality, and an increase in patient understanding and satisfaction with
      the colonoscopy procedure. The investigators will attempt to track procedure completion rate
      and polyp detection rate for individual providers.

      The e-intervention would be multimodal. In the pre-procedure setting, ipad would be able to
      provide a viewpoint for the video education, a template for the patients (or caregivers) to
      send themselves links to appropriate instructions to remind them of their obligations by
      secure email. This e-intervention would supplement traditional printed and website accessible
      instructions.
