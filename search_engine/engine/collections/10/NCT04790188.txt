    
      Cognitive decline is a worrisome consequence of normal or pathologic ageing, having a high
      personal, eco- nomic and societal burden; also, it could herald the onset of dementia which
      is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

      However, with a general increase in life expectancy and a corresponding increase in the
      prevalence of age-related cognitive impairment, there have been concerted efforts towards the
      development and adoption of preventive strategies that would minimize the risk of developing
      dementia, or reduce the rate of cognitive decline with ageing. In the last few decades,
      certain compounds have been found useful in the management of cognitive decline.

      The term 'nootropic' has been used to define such substances with the capacity to enhance
      cognition. While research has led to the synthesis of several drugs with nootropic effects,
      attention is now being shifted to the discovery, characterization and utilization of
      nootropics from natural sources for the prevention and management of age-related cognitive
      decline.

      25 young adults will be randomized into two conditions (nootropic and placebo conditions)
      with 48 hours of separation between conditions. 48h previous to the randomization the
      participants will perform a familiarization to avoid the learning effects.

      Each evaluation day will conform to the following tests:

        -  Simple and multiple reaction time

        -  Inhibitory control

        -  Cognitive flexibility

        -  Working memory

        -  Creative intelligence

        -  Verbal fluidity

        -  Motivation

        -  Mood

        -  Positive and negative emotions

        -  Adverse effects
