    
      Introduction: This is a follow-up protocol to an earlier study entitled "A phase I study of
      docetaxel with ketoconazole modulation in solid tumors" (PH14/01) which showed 2-fold
      reduction in docetaxel clearance and a clear correlation with renal function.

      Aims: The aim of this study is to confirm that ketoconazole inhibition of CYP3A activity
      changes the urinary excretion profile of docetaxel.

      Methodology: This is a single-centre, crossover study. Ten patients (calculated sample size
      =5, α=0.05, β=0.8, difference in means=5%, within group standard deviation=3) will be accrued
      and randomly assigned to receive docetaxel at either 75mg/m2 q3w x 1 dose or 70mg q3w x 1
      dose with ketoconazole 200mg bid x q3d at cycle 1 of chemotherapy. This will be followed by a
      20-day washout period before receiving the other regimen of docetaxel at cycle 2. Blood
      samples of 5mls each will be drawn at times 0, 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h and 24h after the
      onset of docetaxel infusion for pharmacokinetics analysis. A 24-hour urine collection
      commencing on the same day as docetaxel infusion will be required of the patients. All urine
      over the next 24 hours must be collected and returned to the study coordinator on Day 2 of
      each study cycle for docetaxel analysis and creatinine clearance determination. The amount of
      docetaxel excreted by each patient with and without ketoconazole modulation will be
      determined by a LCMSMS method and compared.

      Clinical Relevance: This is to ensure the safe advocation of a dose-sparing strategy
      established in an earlier study for the costly agent docetaxel by confirming if changes in
      excretion profile occurs once its major route of hepatic metabolism is blocked.
