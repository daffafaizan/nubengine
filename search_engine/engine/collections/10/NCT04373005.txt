      virus, it is important to study whether asymptomatic shedders of virus are playing a role in
      propagating the pandemic. There is currently little data available regarding cancer patients,
      yet, this population may be particularly susceptible to the COVID-19 infection.

      Despite the cancer patient population being at higher risk of COVID-19, no systematic
      screening has been established and no biomarkers have been identified to determine which
      patient is at higher risk.

      This study will screen patients on active cancer therapy for COVID-19 as a standard of care
      or a research nasopharyngeal test. Blood samples may also be taken to assess any patient
      response to the virus and optional saliva samples may also be taken to assess the feasibility
      of using patient saliva for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in patients with impaired saliva
      production (eg. secondary to cancer treatments such as radiation, chemotherapy, and/or
      surgery).
