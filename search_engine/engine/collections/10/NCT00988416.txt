      (particularly involving the main duct) incidence of malignancy. Current guidelines recommend
      pancreatic resection for fit patients with main or branch duct involved IPMN. Pancreatic
      resection can be associated with morbidity and mortality. Reliable tests or biomarkers
      accurately differentiating non-malignant from malignant duct involved IPMN are non-existent.
      Test or biomarkers differentiating duct involved from duct uninvolved IPMN are also
      inaccurate. Patients with suspected duct IPMN with symptoms have a higher chance of
      associated malignancy. These findings are not specific for malignant IPMN so, if relied on,
      they would results in missed malignancies as well as potentially unnecessary operations in a
      significant percentage of patients. PET scanning has been studied retrospectively and
      purported to be a highly reliable indicator og high grade dysplasia and/or invasive cancer in
      patients with IPMN. Thus, PET could represent a future standard of care by some authorities
      in the work-up of patients with IPMN. This proposal seeks to prove the hypothesis that
      pancreas PET-CT can differentiate duct involved IPMN with malignancy from duct involved IPMN
      without malignancy.
