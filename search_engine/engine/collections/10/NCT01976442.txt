      red cell and platelet transfusions for younger patients with acute leukemia, has yielded
      improved clinical outcomes at Strong Memorial Hospital (Rochester, New York, USA). This
      standard of care was implemented based upon an earlier randomized trial (BMC Blood Disorders.
      2004 Dec 10;4(1):6) The comparator will be historical controls from the medical literature.
      Key outcomes will be treatment related mortality (deaths at 30, 60 and 100 days) and three
      year survival.
