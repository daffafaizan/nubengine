      INCB054828 (Pemigatinib) as adjuvant therapy for molecularly-selected, high-risk patients
      with urothelial carcinoma who have received radical surgery.Patients will receive Pemigatinib
      at a once-daily (QD) dose of 13.5 mg on a continuous schedule. Treatment will be continued
      until 12 months, or until the evidence of disease relapse or onset of unacceptable toxicity.

      Hyperphosphatemia can be managed with diet modification, phosphate binders, or dose
      modification. Since mineralization of the cornea and retinal changes consisting of serous
      retinal detachment have been reported in humans, ophthalmic exams are done at baseline and
      once every 12 weeks during treatment and should include a visual acuity test, slit-lamp
      examination and fundoscopy. Additional assessments (e.g. Orbital CT) should be done if
      clinically relevant retinal findings are observed on ophthalmologic exams and in participants
      with reported visual AEs or change in visual acuity, if the events or changes are suspected
      to be of retinal origin.
