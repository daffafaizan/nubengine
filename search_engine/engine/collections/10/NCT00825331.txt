      bifurcation of the common femoral artery in order to access the vascular complication rate
      compared tho those of non-marked patients.

      Concerning the removal of the guided wire, patients will be treated due to a graduated scheme
      taking care of different risk levels. This procedure should improve clinical routine, but the
      efficacy and safety have to be assessed. Depending on the risk level, the guide wire will be
      removed either by an ambulance officer or emergency medical technician, assistant personal of
      the cardiac catheterization operating room or by a physician specialist in intensive care.
      Both methods should lead to quality assurance.
