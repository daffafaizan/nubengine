    
      The primary endpoint for this study is the rate of deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) at 30
      days post-operative, following a midline sternotomy closed with SternaLock Blu. DSWI is
      defined as deep infection involving muscle, bone, and/ or mediastinum requiring operative
      intervention and has all of the following conditions:

        1. Wound opened with excision of tissue or re-exploration of mediastinum

        2. Positive culture unless patient on antibiotics at the time of culture or no culture
           obtained

        3. Treatment with antibiotics beyond perioperative prophylaxis

      Post-operative sternal wound complications occurring within 90 days post-operative.

      Outcomes will be reported up to 90 days after surgery, including data on adverse events
      associated with the use of SternaLock Blu Sternal Closure System from the moment of
      implantation to the end-of-study.
