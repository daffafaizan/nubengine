        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide and VNP40101M in patients with
           relapsed or refractory leukemias.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide twice daily on days 1-3 (for 5 doses) followed by
      VNP401010M IV over 15-60 minutes on day 3 (course 1). Patients achieving a complete or
      partial response or having â‰¥ 50% reduction in bone marrow blasts may receive a second course
      of therapy no earlier than day 43. Courses may be repeated approximately every 6 weeks at the
      discretion of the sponsor and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until a dose that depletes
      leukemic blast AGT in at least 4 of 6 patients is determined. Once this dose is determined,
      cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP401010M until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
