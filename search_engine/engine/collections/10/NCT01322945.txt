      complaints, such as crusting, sinusitis, pain, and ease of breathing, was developed by the
      anterior skull base team at the Barrow Neurological Institute. Content was validated in
      structured patient interviews by four subject-matter experts with both endonasal and control
      groups. Eligible patients for the control group included patients undergoing any
      neurosurgical procedure requiring anesthesia that did not involve the endonasal corridor,
      such as spinal decompression procedures, craniotomies for trigeminal neuralgia, and shunting
      procedures. This survey was self-administered pre- and 3 months post-surgery.
