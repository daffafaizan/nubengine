      antigen in Montanide, therefore, this study includes a 2-part design where Part I represents
      a dose-escalation part with topical resiquimod in an open-label fashion. Part II represents
      the randomized part.

      In Part I, 2 cohorts are planned: If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs by day 8 of the
      last vaccination cycle in the last patient enrolled the first cohort, 3 additional patients
      (cohort 2) will be enrolled. If no DLT occurs by day 8 of the last vaccination cycle in the
      last patient enrolled the second cohort in Part I, the trial will proceed to Part II where
      patients will be randomized.
