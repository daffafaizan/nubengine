      low in vitamins, minerals, fiber, polyphenolics and Ï‰-3 fatty acids are common in the United
      States, particularly among the obese. Insulin resistance and high levels of DNA damage
      commonly accompany obesity. There also appears to be a relationship between oxidative
      DNA-damage and biomarkers that characterize metabolic syndrome. The bioactivity of
      blueberries is usually attributed to their high content of polyphenolics which can reduce
      oxidative DNA damage. Since oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA is a suggested causal
      factor leading to increased insulin resistance, we will test if blueberry consumption can be
      an ameliorative dietary factor for insulin resistance as well. If blueberry consumption both
      shifts metabolism away from insulin resistance and reduces DNA damage, it may be a useful
      tool to assist in understanding relationships between these two obesity-associated
      conditions.
