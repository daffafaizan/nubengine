      This is a prospective, not randomized, monocentric study. Prematurity accounts for around 11%
      of births worldwide. In France, around 60,000 children (7.4%) are born each year prematurely.
      The term of gestation has a strong impact on mortality, severe neonatal morbidity, and child
      development. For this reason, premature birth represents a major public health issue. The
      means to reliably predict a premature birth are still ineffective. The medical device used in
      this research is a Mueller polarimetric colposcope which appears to be a powerful tool for
      evaluating the process of remodeling of cervical microstructure during pregnancy.

      Mueller polarimetric imaging is the only technique that enables obtaining the comprehensive
      polarimetric characterization of a sample. Two groups are considered for this study: i)
      patients at low risk of premature birth (Group 1); ii) patients at high risk of premature
      birth (Group 2).

      This study's main objective is to determine, for the two groups of patients, the best
      "polarimetric biomarkers" which make it possible to define an optimal "polarimetric score"
      reflecting the state of the cervical microstructure throughout its remodeling process during
      pregnancy.

      This "Polarimetric Score" will be able to predict the term of childbirth and used as a
      screening tool for prematurity.
