    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants with early Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD) will be tested in a double-blind crossover design with placebo, low-dose
      levetiracetam (LEV) 125 mg twice daily or high-dose LEV 500mg twice daily. These results will
      be contrasted with results from a demographically similar control group who will undergo
      baseline testing only, without any intervention, to establish a comparison norm for the AD
      group.

      Each subject will undergo four screening and baseline visits consisting of a baseline
      neurological, medical, and cognitive evaluation. If amyloid status is unknown in AD patients,
      the participant will have an amyloid PET scan. Additional baseline measures include: a high
      density electroencephalogram (EEG); a 24 hour ambulatory EEG; functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI); neuropsychological testing; and transcranial magnetic stimulation with
      electromyogram (EMG) and EEG measures to assess cortical excitability. AD participants will
      be randomized to one of six possible groups that consists of a varying order of 3 treatment
      periods (LEV 125 mg, LEV 500 mg and placebo). The group assignments will be counterbalanced
      across subjects. Each treatment period will last for 4 weeks with a 4 week washout between
      treatments. All participants will be assessed prior to initiation of a treatment period (with
      the initial assessment occurring as part of the baseline assessment) and at the end of each
      treatment period. The following measures will be repeated as done at baseline at these time
      points: fMRI; neuropsychological testing; and TMS-EMG-EEG. AD participants will be enrolled
      for approximately 5 months.
