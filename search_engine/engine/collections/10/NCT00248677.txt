    
      Project STORY (Sensible Treatment of Obesity in Rural Youth) will entail a three-arm
      randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote
      successful weight management in an important population, overweight children and their
      parents in medically underserved, rural settings. The current feasibility study will provide
      pilot data to develop and support a full-scale trial that will be implemented across multiple
      rural counties. In this pilot program, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two,
      4-month long intervention programs that will be delivered in rural communities through
      Cooperative Extension Offices, or to a Wait List Control (WLC) group. The Behavioral
      Family-Based Intervention (BFI) will involve simultaneous, but separate treatment groups for
      both the child and their parent(s). The Behavioral Parent-Based Intervention (BPI) will
      involve groups for only the parent(s). Both programs will take a behavioral lifestyle
      approach to gradually modify dietary and physical activity patterns. The aims of the trial
      and its principal hypotheses are listed below.

      AIMS:

        -  Evaluate the effects on child's standardized body mass index (BMI-z) of BPI and BFI
           delivered via group contacts to overweight children and/or their overweight parents in
           rural counties.

        -  Examine changes in children's dietary intake, physical activity, self-esteem, and body
           image.

        -  Compare the cost-effectiveness of the BPI and BFI.

        -  Evaluate the effects of the BPI and BFI on parent BMI.
