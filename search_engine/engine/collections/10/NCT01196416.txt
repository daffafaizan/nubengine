    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of daily RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) administered orally daily in combination with CVT
      (starting dose: cisplatin 25 mg/m^2 intravenous [IV] daily x 3; vinblastine 1.2 mg/m^2 IV
      daily x 3, and temozolomide [TMZ] 150 mg/m^2 orally [PO] daily x 5) administered on an every
      21 day schedule. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of RO4929097
      with CVT in patients with metastatic melanoma with correlative biomarkers for Notch pathway
      signaling and gamma secretase enzyme activity. (Phase Ib) III. Based on the MTD from the
      phase Ib study, to conduct a phase II trial and to determine the response rate and overall
      survival. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination of RO4929097 and
      temozolomide. (Phase Ib) II. To obtain tissue biopsy for correlative studies before the
      initiation of therapy and one week after treatment with RO4929097 and CVT. (Phase Ib and II)
      III. To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated at the phase II dose.
      (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is phase I dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097,
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO once daily
      (QD) on days 1-21, cisplatin IV over 30 minutes and vinblastine IV over 30 minutes on days
      1-3, and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without progressive disease
      continue to receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 and
      temozolomide as above in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 24 months.
