      obturator nerves, pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block, is an effective method for
      postoperative analgesia in hip surgeries. However, it fails to provide cutaneous analgesia on
      the anterolateral surgical incisional site. This study compares the effects of wound
      infiltration and lateral femoral nerve blocks in combination with PENG blocks for
      postoperative pain in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty for coxarthrosis.
