      giving 800 mg/day natural progesterone vaginal supplement + 4 mg/day estradiol oral

      Group A (GnRHa group) in which the luteal phase support will be continued by the same regimen
      started on the day of oocytes retrieval until 2 weeks after embryo transfer (ET) with
      subcutaneous administration of a single dose (0.2 mg) of GnRHa (Triptorelin) 6 days after
      oocyte retrieval, and (ii) Group B (control group) in which the luteal phase support will be
      continued only by the same regimen started on the day of oocytes retrieval until 2 weeks
      after ET
