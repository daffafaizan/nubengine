    
      Ascenta Therapeutics, Inc. is conducting a clinical trial of the compound Debio 1143
      (AT-406), a small molecule second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase C (Smac) mimetic.
      In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that Debio 1143 (AT-406) induces cell death in
      several tumor models by inhibiting XIAP (X linked IAP), cIAP-1 (cellular IAP-1) and cIAP-2
      (cellular IAP-2), thus releasing initiator and effector caspases to promote apoptosis. This
      protocol is a Phase I, dose-escalation, open-label, multi-center study conducted in patients
      with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacology of Debio 1143 (AT-406) in humans when administered orally.
