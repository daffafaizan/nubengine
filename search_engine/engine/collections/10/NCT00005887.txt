        -  Compare the median survival time in patients with brain metastases after receiving
           treatment with whole brain radiotherapy with or without RSR13.

        -  Compare the response rate to these treatment regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the time to progression after receiving these treatment regimens in these
           patients.

        -  Compare quality of life in these patients receiving these treatment regimens.

        -  Compare cause of death (neurologic vs nonneurologic death) in these patients after
           receiving these treatment regimens.

        -  Determine the safety of RSR13 in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of RSR13 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, comparative, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RPA Class (I vs II). Patients
      are further stratified within the RPA class II stratum according to site of primary cancer
      (non-small cell lung cancer vs breast vs other). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive whole brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for two weeks in
           conjunction with supplemental oxygen breathing.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive RSR13 IV over 30 minutes followed by whole brain radiotherapy
           and supplemental oxygen breathing as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at the first and last day of radiotherapy, at 1 month, 3 months,
      and then every 3 months until disease progression.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, 3 months, every 3 months until disease progression, and
      then for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 408 (204 per treatment arm) patients will be accrued for this
      study.
