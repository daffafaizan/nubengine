      inner-city Pediatric Emergency Department. The proposed Screening, Brief Intervention, and
      Assisted Referral to Treatment will highlight the effects of Second Hand Smoke exposure on
      the child's health. the investigators will randomize 750 caregivers who smoke who present to
      our Pediatric Emergency Department with their child who has a Second Hand Smoke exposure
      related illness to either one of two conditions: 1) Screening, Brief Intervention, and
      Assisted Referral to Treatment; or 2) Healthy Habits Control. The Screening, Brief
      Intervention, and Assisted Referral to Treatment condition will use components shown to be
      effective in the out-patient setting but not yet tested in the Pediatric Emergency Department
      setting. It will include a brief form of the Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco
      Use and Dependence, motivational interviewing, engaging and personalized materials on the
      effects of smoking and Second Hand Smoke exposure, immediate access to caregivers' choice of
      cessation resources (e.g., Quitline, smokefree.gov, or txt2quit), a 12-week supply of
      nicotine replacement therapy and weekly booster materials for 12 weeks. The Healthy Habits
      Control program has been previously developed and used in the out-patient setting, and will
      be used as an attention control in which caregivers will receive instruction on healthy
      lifestyle choices to improve their child's health. Cessation assistance will be offered at
      the study's conclusion. If effective, the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Assisted
      Referral to Treatment model could be routinely used in the Pediatric Emergency Department
      setting, which could reach at least one million smokers a year, and could result in
      significant reductions in caregivers' tobacco use, Second Hand Smoke exposure related
      pediatric illness, and costs in this population. In addition, the investigators' results will
      inform the conduct of public health research efforts aimed at adults via the Pediatric
      Emergency Department.
