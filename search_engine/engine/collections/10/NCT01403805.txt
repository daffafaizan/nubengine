      in developing countries. Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death in the elderly.

      The investigators conducted a prospective study comparing the effects of interventions
      (combined oral care and pneumococcal plus influenza vaccinations) in preventing pneumonia and
      increasing the survival rate from pneumonia in consecutive elderly patients at a nursing home
      in Yubari during one year from 2009, with the results in a non-intervention group.
