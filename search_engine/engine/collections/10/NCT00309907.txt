      I. Determine the response rate, defined as survival and complete discontinuation of
      supplemental oxygen at day 28, in pediatric patients with acute noninfectious pulmonary
      dysfunction (idiopathic pneumonia syndrome [IPS]) after undergoing allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation treated with etanercept.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the day 56 survival rate in patients treated with this drug. II. Determine the
      overall survival distribution in patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the pulmonary response, as defined as the time to discontinuation of
      supplemental oxygen, in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Evaluate the toxicity of etanercept therapy in patients with IPS. V. Evaluate levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, in both bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum, in patients
      with IPS.

      VI. Describe C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at baseline, day 7, 14, 21, and 28 and their
      association with response in patients with IPS.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive etanercept IV over 30 minutes on day 0 and subcutaneously on days 3, 7, 10,
      14, 17, 21, and 24. Treatment continues in the absence of an infectious pathogen, disease
      progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive methylprednisolone (or
      corticosteroid equivalent) IV on days 0-2 and then orally with a taper until day 56.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
