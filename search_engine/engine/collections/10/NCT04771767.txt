      (i) To introduce a previously untreated patient population with PTSD to new therapeutic
      options.

      (ii) To provide new insights into the functional role of Glutamate in affective disorders as
      well as in learning and memory.

      (iii) To explore the utility of pharmacologically-enhanced psychotherapy.

      OUTLINE

      The present study is an open label randomized control trial assessing the efficacy of a
      combined treatment of sub-anaesthetic IV Ketamine in conjunction with online CBT (eCBT). In
      the study, 20 participants with refractory PTSD will be randomly assigned either to an
      experimental group receiving a combination of Ketamine and eCBT over 14 weeks, or they will
      be assigned to a 14-week waitlist-control group (at the end of which they would receive the
      experimental treatment). Both groups will be assessed for symptoms of PTSD and comorbid
      disorders before treatment, at the 7-week halfway point, and at the end of the 14 week
      experimental period. Symptoms of PTSD and comorbid disorders for participants in the
      experimental group are expected to improve significantly more than participants in the
      waitlist-control.
