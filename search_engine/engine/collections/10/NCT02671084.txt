      in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft(CABG). These benefits involve functional
      state of the heart and reduction damage to the organ. These events are related to
      intracellular phenomena that result in intracellular calcium homeostasis giving physical and
      functional benefits to the heart. Also disclosed is a modulation of the inflammatory response
      to endothelial level with resulting protective character to the coronary bed.

      Patients submitted of coronary angioplasty procedures can release in varying degrees of
      creatine kinase, MB isoform (CK - MB), on the order of 30% of all angioplasty. Even in
      smaller increases than 3 times baseline, a criterion that defines myocardial infarction,
      clinical impact can already be found. Increase in CK-MB more than 100% of baseline can
      represents a problem to the patients. This elevation of CK - MB is associated with various
      factors such as age, characteristic of the lesion, clinical status of the patient, inferring
      that endovascular procedures of coronary, simple or complex, have associated myocardial
      damage, which depending on the intensity of the damage, results in increased morbidity and
      mortality.

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

      Check for reduction in the percentage of patients that release CK -MB at levels above the
      100% baseline in patients anesthetized with sevoflurane compared to the control group.
      Possibly patients who will receive sevoflurane experience a higher level of cardiac cell
      protection with lower incidence in the release of CK - MB values in excess of 100% baseline.
