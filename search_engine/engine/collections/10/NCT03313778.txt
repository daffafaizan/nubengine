    
      This is a multi-part, dose-escalation study of mRNA-4157 monotherapy in participants with
      resected solid tumors (Part A) and of mRNA-4157 in combination with pembrolizumab in
      participants with both unresectable (locally advanced or metastatic) solid tumors (Parts B
      and C) and resected cutaneous melanoma (Part D). Parts A and B will include a dose escalation
      phase of the study to identify doses of mRNA-4157 for the expansion phase of the study. Doses
      of mRNA-4157 will be administered to participants in a dose escalation regimen. Participants
      in Parts B, C, and D dose expansion phase will receive mRNA-4157 at a recommended dose for
      expansion.
