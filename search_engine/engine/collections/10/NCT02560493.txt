      children (aged 10 to 12 years) assigned to: 1) 3 hours/week of in-home exergaming or 2) a
      control group. An innovative aspect is the inclusion of a fitness trainer who will regularly
      video chat with the participant and virtually monitor gameplay. The study will advance the
      field by: 1) establishing the efficacy of exergaming to reduce BMIz among overweight and
      obese children and 2) demonstrating the potential of exergaming to reduce body fat and
      improve children's cardiovascular health.
