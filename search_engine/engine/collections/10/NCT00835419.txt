      common cancer diagnosed in women.Advanced melanoma has a very poor prognosis.For a vast
      majority of subjects with malignant melanoma, there are no effective therapies.Therefore, the
      development of effective therapies for this subject population remains a priority in
      oncology.In a limited study in melanomas, increased cyclin D1 protein expression, as was
      observed in 33% cases.P276-00 is a novel potent small molecule flavone derived Cyclin
      dependent kinase (Cdk) Cdk 4-D1, Cdk1-B and Cdk9-T inhibitor.P276-00 demonstrated significant
      and selective antiproliferative effect against melanoma cell lines.
