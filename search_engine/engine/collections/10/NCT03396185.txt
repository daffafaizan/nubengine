      have EGFR-mutant stage IIIA-IIIB and unresectable lung adenocarcinoma will receive Icotinib
      as consolidation therapy after synchronous or sequential chemoradiotherapy. The primary
      objective of this study is relapse free survival. The secondary objectives are overall
      survival, the frequency of adverse events and patients' quality of life.
