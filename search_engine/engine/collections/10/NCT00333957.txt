      capsule (PillCamTM SB) that acquires video images during natural propulsion through the
      digestive system.

      The video-capsule PillCamTM SB has been cleared by the FDA for use in patients over 10 years
      of age for the detection of small intestinal disorders. It has been used in patients under
      age 10 and has been placed with the use of a gastroscope in patients unable to swallow the
      capsule. In fact, a new delivery device has been introduced recently that facilitates
      placement of the video-capsule in pediatric patients.For the purposes of this study, only
      patients over age 10 years who are able to swallow the capsule would be enrolled.

      There are approximately 450 CF patients in the registry in Israel, with about 300 above the
      age of 10. Study subjects would be enrolled from this registry population and would be
      screened for the presence of the contraindications noted above. Patients would be assessed
      for symptoms of possible small bowel lesions at the time of enrollment including
      gastrointestinal bleeding, palpable abdominal mass, weight loss, diarrhea, and abdominal
      pain. Markers of inflammation including stool calprotectin will be assessed in all patients.
      These data would be recorded for further analysis.
