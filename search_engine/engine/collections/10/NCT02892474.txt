      compare with other treatments. The purpose of the study is to find out if HCR and coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure outcomes are similar. HCR is a combination of surgery
      and catheter procedures to open up clogged heart arteries. CABG is a surgical procedure to
      open up clogged heart arteries.

      This study will collect information about the medical care participants receive during their
      planned procedure. No new testing or procedures will be done. Participants will have only the
      tests or procedures already planned by their doctor. The investigators will look at how well
      participants do after the procedure by assessing the outcomes of interest 30 days after
      surgery and, potentially, one year after surgery (funding dependent).
