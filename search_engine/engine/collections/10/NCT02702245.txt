      different occasions separated by one week. At two of the occasions a green leaf extract,
      thylakoids, is added to a glucose solution; 5 gram or 10 gram in randomized order. The third
      occasion, without added thylakoids, serve as control.

      Blood samples are taken fasting and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after the glucose
      load.

      Blood samples are analysed for p-glucose, p-insulin, p-C-peptide, p-ghrelin, p-CCK and
      p-GLP-1.
