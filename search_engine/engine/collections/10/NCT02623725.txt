    
      Healthy adolescents and adults who received 3 doses of the tetravalent dengue vaccine 4 to 5
      years earlier in previous CYD dengue vaccine trials (CYD13 and CYD30) received either a
      booster dose CYD dengue vaccine or a placebo on Day 0. They were evaluated for safety and
      antibody persistence of the booster injection up to 2 years post-vaccination.
