      The systemic blood pressure, aqueous humor dynamics, choroidal blood volume, central venous
      pressure, extra-ocular muscle tone, and also conventional laryngoscopy affect the intraocular
      pressure.It was shown that the new devices for laryngoscopy, such as video laryngoscopes
      provide minimal hemodynamic changes when compared to direct laryngoscopes. However there is
      no current data about the effects of the intubation with McGrath videolaryngoscope on
      intraocular pressure. The main objective of this study to compare the effects of the McGrath
      Series 5 video laryngoscope and Macintosh laryngoscope on intraocular pressure during
      laryngoscopy.
