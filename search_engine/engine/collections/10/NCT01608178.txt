    
      Objective: To study the physiologic effects of taurine therapy in patients with succinic
      semialdehyde Dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency.

      Study Population: Eighteen children and adults with SSADH deficiency receiving taurine.

      Design: This small open label trial will evaluate the effect of taurine treatment on key
      SSADH biomarkers and neurocognitive performance. Study evaluations will include neurological
      and neuropsychological examinations, positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-flumazenil
      (FMZ), (optional and only for those over age 18), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
      (optional) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection (optional) to measure gamma-aminobutyric
      acid (GABA) levels, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure cortical
      excitation and inhibition, in patients given taurine for SSADH deficiency.

      The evaluations will be performed twice, on and off therapy.
