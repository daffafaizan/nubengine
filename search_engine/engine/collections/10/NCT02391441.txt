    
      In this study, pre-LTX and six-months post-LTX measurements will be compared with each other
      and between the primary and control group.

      Pre- and post-LTX measurements include:

      Past medical history: Including basic diagnosis; interventions, surgery and transplant
      related complications (re-operations, hospitalizations, infections) and medication history;
      These data will be collected by studying the medical files including surgical reports.

      Present medical history: Including NYHA class.

      Physical examination: Including length and weight.

      Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging:

        -  Ventricular volume, function and mass measurements

        -  Flow measurements of the pulmonary artery and aorta

        -  Disease specific measurements (e.g. septal bowing, RV trabecularisation, etc.)

        -  T1-mapping

      Transthoracic Echocardiography

      Resting ECG: Disease specific electrophysiological findings (e.g. QRS-duration, right bundle
      branch block).

      Laboratory evaluation:

        -  NT-pro-BNP

        -  eGFR

        -  Remaining serum will be stored.
