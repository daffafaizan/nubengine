      working memory, have been hypothesized to reflect dysfunction at the N-methyl-D-aspartate
      glutamate receptor (NMDAR). However, given that divergent properties of the NMDAR underlie
      its roles in plasticity versus working memory and that various aspects of NMDAR function are
      abnormal in schizophrenia, examining the effects of DCS in both healthy and patient
      populations is crucial.

      Methods: The investigators used a single dose of the partial NMDAR agonist, d-cycloserine
      (DCS) to probe the effects of enhancing NMDAR signaling on working memory and plasticity.
      Working memory was assessed using a spatial n-back task. Plasticity was assessed using two
      learning tasks, the weather prediction task and information integration task, and an EEG
      paradigm that assesses changes in visual evoked potential amplitude following high frequency
      visual stimulation. Sixty-five healthy adults and forty-five schizophrenia patients were
      randomized to receive 100 mg acute DCS (healthy adult n = 32; schizophrenia n = 24) or
      placebo (healthy adult n = 33; schizophrenia n = 21).
