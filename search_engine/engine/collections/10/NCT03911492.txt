    
      Objective 1. To determine if actively maintaining an SCPP of at least 65 mmHg with a
      combination of MAP augmentation and CSF drainage promotes better neurologic recovery than
      routine hemodynamic management that focuses solely on MAP augmentation.

      Objective 2. To determine if actively maintaining an SCPP of at least 65 mmHg with a
      combination of MAP augmentation and CSF drainage will allow for a reduction in the usage of
      vasopressors in acute SCI.

      Objective 3. To determine the feasibility of draining CSF to reduce ITP in the acute
      post-injury setting, when the cord may be swollen against the dura causing subarachnoid space
      occlusion at the injury site.

      Objective 4. To determine if there are complications associated with the installation of the
      intrathecal catheter and drainage of CSF in the acute SCI patient.
