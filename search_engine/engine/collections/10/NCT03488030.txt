      IBD. The study will have a cross-sectional evaluation on Day 1 to provide the real-world data
      of disease activity, treatment patterns, burden of disease and quality of life in
      participants with moderate to severe CD or UC.

      The study will involve an additional retrospective review of medical charts of participants
      of previous 3 years to describe the IBD treatments and use of other healthcare resources
      related with management of IBD.

      The study will enroll approximately 246 participants. All participants will be enrolled in
      one observational cohort.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Argentina. The overall time for data collection
      in the study will be approximately 3 years before the start of the study (Day 1).
