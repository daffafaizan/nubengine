      expectancy of patients with brain tumors is significant limited. Hence the reduction of time
      spent on neurorehabilitation is very important.

      Inclusion of patients that underwent brain tumor resection with a surgery-related paresis of
      the upper extremity.

      Randomized controlled and double blinded trial - 2/3 nrTMS, 1/3 sham. Fifteen minutes
      low-frequency nrTMS (1 Hz) of the uneffected hemisphere at 7 consecutive days: nrTMS group or
      sham group. Thirty minutes physical therapy of the upper extremity in both groups.

      MRI, nTMS motor mapping, assessments for motor status of upper extremity including
      Fugl-Meyer-Assessment (FMA), National Institution of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Jebsen
      Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), and Karnofsky Performance Scale
      (KPS) postoperatively, after the 7th day of intervention and after 3 months.
