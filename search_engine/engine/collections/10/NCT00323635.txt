      might be an increased frequency of need to urinate during the night. Women feel more frequent
      urges to urinate when structures that support the bladder become more lax. Tolterodine is a
      drug that can raise the threshold for volume of urine that accumulates in the bladder before
      the urge to urinate arises.

      Many factors determine how people say they sleep, such as their sleep as recorded by
      sleep-measuring instruments, how closely they notice their night's sleep, whether they are
      generally prone to make positive or negative judgments or to have a lot or a few body
      symptoms.

      In this study, women between ages 45 to 65 who are past the menopause and who are frequently
      bothered by the need to urinate during the night will take either tolterodine or placebo
      tablets for 8 weeks. During the last week they will record the hours they slept and the
      quality of their sleep each morning. They will wear a device on their wrist through the week
      that continuously records whether they are asleep or awake. During three nights of the week
      they will record the volume of urine whenever they urinate. At the end of the week they will
      complete questionnaires about their mood and take some computerized tests that measure their
      alertness. Thereafter they will repeat these procedures, taking the kind of tablets they did
      not take during the first 8-week treatment period.

      We will compare the frequency of urination, sleep, mood as adjusted for the tendency to make
      positive or negative judgments and daytime attention level to find if any of these differ
      between the two treatment periods, and to explain differences between any differences that
      may be found.
