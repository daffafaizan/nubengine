      intubations. This study is designed to evaluate the proportion of cases requiring more than
      one member of the anesthesiology team when the video feature of McGRATH速 MAC is available
      during laryngoscopy in a population of patients without a predicted difficult intubation
      (Arne's score <11).

      General anesthesia from induction until tracheal intubation is recorded on a video for
      further analysis. Analysis includes characteristics of intubation, patient's monitoring and
      cooperation between anesthesiologists in two groups. In the control group, the screen of the
      McGRATH速 MAC videolaryngoscope is hidden. In the experimental group, the McGRATH速 MAC
      videolaryngoscope is used with its video feature.
