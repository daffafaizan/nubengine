    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the progression-free rate at 8 weeks in participants with relapsed or
           refractory small cell lung cancer who have received <3 prior regimens of systemic
           chemotherapy

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the response rate using radiologic assessment according to standard RECIST
           1.1 criteria

        -  To determine median progression free survival and overall survival

        -  To characterize the toxicity profile of STA-9090 in this patient population

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To analyze levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples obtained serially
           throughout the study and assess the utility of measuring these cell subsets as a marker
           of disease burden as well as response to therapy

        -  To analyze the participant population by identification of gene expression profiles
           (measured in RNA from available tumor biopsies) associated with the efficacy and
           resistance to STA-9090
