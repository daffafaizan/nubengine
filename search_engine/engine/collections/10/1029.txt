major surgery in classic hemophilia using fraction i.  experience intwelve operations and review of the literature.a therapeutic regimen that provides hemostasis inhemophiliacs during and after major surgery without requiringlaboratory control has been established with afactor viii concentrate.  the effectiveness of this regimenof fraction i therapy was evaluated in major surgeryof 6 severely deficient and 4 moderately deficient hemophiliacs.an analysis of clinical results was made, combiningthe 12 operations of the series with the 116 majoroperative procedures on hemophiliacs recorded in theenglish literature, in which fraction i was the sole ormajor source of factor viii therapy.  dental and nondentalsurgery were analyzed separately, as was thespecial problem of blood cysts.  although the over-allmortality rate following major surgery in hemophiliacsis presently only 5 to 10% using factor viii concentrates,problems still remain.  these include the continued highincidence of abnormal postoperative hemorrhage, thevariation in factor viii potency of different lots of fractioni, the late development of serum hepatitis, hemolyticanemia due to contaminating isoantibodies and thehigh cost of adequate amounts of the product.  more efficientmethods of preparing purer and more potent factorviii concentrates could eliminate most of these difficulties.
