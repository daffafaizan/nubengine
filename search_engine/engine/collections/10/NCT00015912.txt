      I. Determine the efficacy of interferon alfa and thalidomide, in terms of response rate, time
      to progression, and overall survival, in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade
      follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in this patient
      population.

      III. Correlate ancillary biological studies with clinical endpoints in these patients treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously every 12 hours and oral thalidomide daily in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6
      months until disease progression.
