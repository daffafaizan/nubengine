      normal volunteers. These studies will be conducted in the MRI systems located at the NIH.
      These studies may involve the intravenous administration of commercially available MR
      contrast media and exercise. The results will be used to evaluate the performance of various
      pulse sequences, gradient coils, and RF coils on human subjects and will provide essential
      ground work for specific patient protocols.
