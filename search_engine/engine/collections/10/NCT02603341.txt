      study, you will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, and then you will begin
      radiation treatment according to usual medical practice. Randomly assigning you to a group
      helps makes sure that each group has a similar mix of patients and makes the study better -
      and is only done when doctors are not sure whether one treatment is better than the other.
      You have an equal chance of getting into either treatment group, like a coin flip. Both you
      and your doctor will be told which treatment you will get.

      No matter which group patients are in, doctors will work very carefully to reduce the
      radiation to healthy tissues. Both groups will followed for at least 10 years after
      completing radiation therapy. The results of this study will help decide which radiation is
      best for future patients with your type of breast cancer.
