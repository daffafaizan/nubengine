      this time was assessed to be sufficient to answer most pilot study questions, and it was
      decided to turn the internal pilot into an external pilot. Based on the results of the
      external pilot, a few adjustments on outcome measurements, inclusion criteria and extraction
      of information on usual care were applied, before initiation of the full scale trial. Hence
      ADL-I replaced ADL-Q as primary outcome measurement. Data collection for full scale trial was
      initiated August 1st 2020.
