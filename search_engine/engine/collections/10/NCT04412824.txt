      US engaged in binge drinking in the past month (SAMHSA 2014). Why some people "mature out" of
      this behavior while others persist may be due to one's physiological response to binge
      drinking. No previous study has assessed whether disrupted cortisol and neural network
      responses to alcohol cues may drive the compulsive alcohol consumption seen in binge drinking
      individuals who do not yet have an AUD.

      The investigator will recruit beer drinking, non-smoking men and women ages 21-45 (N=80,
      equal gender) who are either moderate drinkers or binge/heavy drinkers for two neuroimaging
      and neuroendocrine assessments to determine if their "real world" drinking behavior, in a
      prospective one month follow up, can be predicted based upon the cortisol and neural network
      responses to alcohol cues (with a placebo control, counter-balanced and randomized). Finally,
      the influence of genetic variation in the FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, which
      regulates cortisol activity, on the cortisol and neural network responses to alcohol cues
      will be explored.
