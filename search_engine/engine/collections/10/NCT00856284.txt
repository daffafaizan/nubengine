      therapy in addition to diet control and exercise. For those patients with inadequate glycemic
      control with metformin monotherapy or experiencing serious side effects of metformin,
      sulfonylurea is a popular choice as a second-line oral antidiabetic treatment.

      Alogliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor currently being developed by Takeda for use
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      This study is designed to further explore the durability of efficacy and safety of alogliptin
      compared to glipizide in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients whose blood sugar level is
      inadequately controlled with metformin therapy.

      The duration of this study will be approximately 2 years.
