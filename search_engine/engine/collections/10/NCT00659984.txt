    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
           (^131I-MIBG) in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  To describe toxicity following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with
           relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  To estimate radiation absorbed doses to measurable lesions and to a standard set of
           normal organs following a 0.1 mCi/kg [3.7 MBq/kg] (minimum dose of 1.0 mCi [37 MBq] but
           not to exceed 5.0 mCi [185 MBq]) intravenous administration of ^131I-MIBG in patients
           with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  To describe, within the confines of a phase IIa trial, objective tumor response
           following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory high-risk
           neuroblastoma.

        -  To explore dose-response following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients with
           relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  To explore quality of life assessment following treatment with ^131I-MIBG in patients
           with relapsed/refractory high-risk neuroblastoma.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Dosimetry: Patients receive a dosimetric dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
           (^131I-MIBG) IV over 1-3 minutes. Patients then undergo 2 or 3 MIBG scans within 5 days
           of the dosimetry dose to assess biodistribution and tumor uptake. Patients with normal
           tumor uptake and biodistribution proceed to treatment.

        -  Treatment: Within 1-4 weeks of the dosimetric dose, patients with normal tumor uptake
           and biodistribution receive a therapeutic dose of ^131I-MIBG IV over 1 hour on day 0 and
           undergo MIBG scan on day 7. Patients then proceed to autologous stem cell infusion.

        -  Autologous stem cell infusion: Patients receive an infusion of autologous stem cells
           from peripheral blood or bone marrow on day 14. Patients with an ANC of < 500/µl at any
           point after autologous stem cell infusion receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or
           subcutaneously once daily until ANC is > 2,000/µl.

      Patients complete a quality of life questionnaire at baseline and then at day 60.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 60 and periodically
      thereafter.
