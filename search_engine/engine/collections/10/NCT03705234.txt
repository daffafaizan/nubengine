      Inclisiran is a PCKS9 synthesis inhibitor which has been found to reduce LDL-cholesterol by
      about 50-60%. ORION-4 will investigate the effects of inclisiran on major adverse
      cardiovascular events.

      The study is intended to be conducted at approximately 180 clinical sites in the UK and the
      USA. Approximately 15,000 participants aged 55 years or older with pre-existing
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease will be randomized between inclisiran sodium 300 mg
      and matching placebo (given by subcutaneous injection on the day of randomization, at 3
      months and then every 6-months) in a 1:1 ratio for a planned median duration of about 5
      years.
