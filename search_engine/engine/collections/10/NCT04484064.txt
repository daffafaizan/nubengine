      patients. However, it is known that the marked interindividual variability in drug level may
      affect treatment outcomes. Several factors are known to modulate drug levels, such as weight,
      genetics host-drug and drug-drug interaction. The identification of these factors could give
      the possibility to propose better adjusted dosage regimens according to patient's individual
      characteristics. Moreover, the presence of high or low drug concentrations may partially
      explain toxicity or lack of efficacy of targeted anticancer drugs in some patients. The
      characterization of the relationship between drug levels and treatment response (efficacy and
      toxicity) would allow an optimized and a more individualized patient management with targeted
      anticancer drugs.

      Oral targeted therapies must be taken on the long term and adherence issues have been shown
      to compromise treatment efficacy. Side effects and lifestyle management are among factors
      affecting treatment adherence. The characterization of adherence over time and the
      identification of factors susceptible to improve it will represent a great benefit for
      healthcare professionals and patients.
