      afternoon or night) vaccinated against hepatitis A would have some humoral and cellular
      response impairment. Men (18 to 55 years) will be recruited through different forms of media
      (electronic, newspapers, radio and magazines). The shift workers sleep pattern will be
      recorded polysomnographically. Subsequently, the volunteers will be underwent vaccination
      against hepatitis A (2 doses) and after 30, 60 and 90 days, blood samples will be collected
      to assess the humoral response in the experimental groups. The hormones prolactin, growth
      hormone, cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline will also be evaluated. Indeed, stimulations
      in culture will be conducted to assess the cellular response profile against the vaccination
      through the production assessment of IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α.
