      throughout the world. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has the worst prognosis of any
      major malignancy in the United States and, unlike other common cancers, annual deaths from
      PDA are rising. During 2017, it is estimated that 53,670 people were diagnosed with PDA and
      approximately 43,090 people died from PDA in the U.S. Despite recent advances, cytotoxic
      chemotherapy for PDA has been disappointing with response rates of 20-30% for the most active
      regimens and little activity for targeted therapies. Even among the small subset of patients
      who are suitable for surgical resection at the time of diagnosis, complete resection is
      followed by recurrence in >90% of patients without further systemic therapy, with a median
      time to recurrence of 6.9 months. Thus all PDA patients require systemic chemotherapy and
      more effective regimens are urgently needed.
