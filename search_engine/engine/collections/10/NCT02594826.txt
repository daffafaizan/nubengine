      I. To evaluate the efficacy of a culturally-appropriate educational intervention compared to
      a general cancer health education program in increasing cervical cancer screening among
      Korean American women.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effects of a culturally-appropriate intervention on women's knowledge,
      psychosocial beliefs about cervical cancer and screening, and barriers to screening compared
      to a general cancer health education program.

      II. To examine the extent to which changes in knowledge, psychosocial beliefs, and barriers
      mediate the effects of the intervention on screening behavior.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (INTERVENTION CONDITION): Participants undergo a culturally appropriate, church-based
      intervention comprised of four components: 2-hour small group education sessions delivered at
      church sites by professional, bilingual community health educators (CHEs) that include
      culturally appropriate visual aids and print materials in Korean; navigation assistance,
      including language services, appointment scheduling, and transportation assistance from CHEs
      and church health workers (CHWs); referrals to Pap test sites; and a 6-month reminder letter
      for screening.

      ARM II (CONTROL CONDITION): Participants undergo 2-hour general health and cancer education
      by bilingual CHEs, which covers nutrition, regular check-ups, tobacco use, and cancer
      screening. Participants also receive pre-existing written material produced by the American
      Cancer Society (ACS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Centers for Disease Control
      (CDC)., and are advised to seek regular preventive health services.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up post-intervention and at 12 months.
