    
      Randomized clinical trial conducted with patients of both sexes with hemiparesis after stroke
      of 18 to 65 years. They excluded those who had less than six months of injury, with sensory
      or perceptual deficit. Patients included were randomized into two groups, a treatment group,
      which conducted rehabilitation with virtual reality associated with conventional physical
      therapy and the control group that performed only conventional physiotherapy. Randomization
      was done by a computer program in blocks, by a third person, respecting the allocation
      concealment. After selection and randomization, patients were evaluated at baseline, when
      they were collected demographic and clinical data, investigated the occurrence of falls in
      the three months prior to evaluation and rated the balance in motion using the Dynamic Gait
      Index (DGI). Patients were followed for 20 physiotherapy sessions, visits twice a week for an
      hour each. The assessment of the balance and the investigation of the occurrence of falls
      were repeated at the end of treatment, which occurred on average three months after the start
      of the intervention, by the same examiner, who remained blind to the group that the patient
      belonged.
