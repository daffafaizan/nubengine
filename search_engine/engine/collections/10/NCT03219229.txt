      metabolically active tissue components. The investigators seek to improve the understanding
      of variation in REE by developing new and improved rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      methods of quantifying some of the major heat producing organs and tissues in children and
      adults. The long-term aim is to provide an improved understanding of human energy
      requirements. Specifically, the investigators propose to test whether: 1) a portion of the
      elevated daily REE adjusted for FFM observed in young children (Tanner Stage 1) could be
      accounted for by the relative fractions of body mass as high metabolic activity tissues
      (heart, liver, kidney, brain) and low metabolic activity tissues (skeletal muscle, adipose
      tissue), 2) a portion of the age-related decline in daily REE adjusted for FFM observed in
      children could be accounted for by changes in the relative fractions of body mass as high and
      low metabolic rate tissues during growth.
