      followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Despite a number of phase II and III
      studies the issues of right dose and duration of thalidomide and subsets of patients
      benefiting from it have not yet been settled We explored the maintenance therapy after
      thalidomide, dexamethasone and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin called ThaDD protocol.
      Patients with de novo or relapsed MM obtaining at least minor response after 4 to 6 ThaDD
      courses, were randomized to receive standard maintenance therapy with IFN 3 MU 3 times a week
      or an experimental maintenance therapy such as thalidomide 100 mg per day until relapse or
      intolerable side effects. Both groups also received pulsed dexamethasone 20 mg 4 days a
      month.
