      The patient will be randomized to receive a conventionally-placed LV lead or randomized to
      receive a magnetically-placed LV lead. The magnetic group will have acute hemodynamics
      assessed during the procedure to evaluate the best response of the left ventricle during
      pacing. Patients will be followed for 6 months with a re-evaluation of the baseline tests to
      assess the change in HF symptoms. Adverse events will also be recorded during the follow-up
      period.
