      symptoms. However, active TB and TB treatment hamper glycemic control. Patients starting TB
      treatment experience rapid changes in appetite, body composition, and inflammation (which
      increases insulin resistance); inflammation is a feature of untreated TB and following an
      increase as a result of initial bacterial killing, inflammation subsides with successful
      treatment. In addition, TB medication (rifampicin) increases the metabolism of oral
      anti-diabetic drugs including the widely used sulphonylureas and thiazolidinediones, though a
      possible interaction with the antidiabetic drug metformin has not been previously examined.
      Frequent monitoring of blood glucose with adjustments in anti-diabetes medication during the
      course of TB treatment may therefore be needed. However, frequent monitoring is associated
      with additional costs, and tools and skills for glucose monitoring and diabetes treatment may
      be lacking in TB or pulmonary clinics, creating a need to refer patients to other health
      providers. As such, a less intense schedule, preferably following the established decision
      points in TB treatment after 2 and 6 months would offer significant advantage. None of these
      issues have been addressed systematically so far.
