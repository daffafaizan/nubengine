    
      In the MiDiSeq (monocentric, prospective, open-label diagnostic) project, patients with
      suspected mitochondrial disease prioritized for i) high a priori probability for a genetic
      basis (e.g. positive family history) as well as availability of (ii) fibroblast cell lines
      with a biochemically defined phenotype, (iii) parental samples, (iv) short read whole genome
      and transcriptome datasets and (v) optional additional metabolomics and proteomics data.

      The following questions will be leading the project:

      i) to systematically benchmark different sequencing technologies to detect genetic and
      epigenetic variation and their impact on gene regulation.

      (ii) to further develop algorithms for integrative analyses of different 'omics datasets.

      (iii) to expand the analysis from coding Single-Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and regulatory
      mutations to structural variants (SVs), repeat expansions and contractions, low complexity
      regions and epigenetic signatures.

      (iv) to identify novel alterations and disease mechanisms. (v) to gain fundamental new
      insights into disease mechanisms and cellular biology.

      (vi) to improve genetic diagnostics of future rare disease patients and to evaluate
      personalized therapeutic options.
