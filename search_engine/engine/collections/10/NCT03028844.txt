      non-pharmacological intervention around the time of venepuncture significantly decreases the
      stress response of a stable preterm neonate, as measured by salivary cortisol levels .

      The secondary aim of this study is to analyse the effect of music therapy on the EEG, and
      vital signs of the stable preterm neonate.
