      objective response rates. In each arm, 15 patients were planned for the first stage. If two
      or more responses were observed, an additional 13 patients were to be accrued for a total of
      28 patients. If 7 or more of the 28 patients in an arm achieved an objective response, then
      that arm was designated worthy of additional investigation.
