    
      This is a gene therapy open non randomized phase I trial for advanced and/or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer patients. The protocol is based on the administration of increasing doses
      of a plasmid DNA pre-complexed to PEI (polyethylenimine - non-viral vector) that encodes two
      genes (somatostatin receptor subtype 2 named sst2 and deoxycitidine kinase ::
      uridylmonophosphate kinase named dck::umk) which exhibit complementary therapeutic effects.
      Both transgenes induce an antitumor bystander effect and render gemcitabine treatment more
      efficient. Intratumor injections of the gene therapy product (CYL-02) will be performed by
      transgastric or transduodenal route under endoscopic ultrasound guidance. Each injection will
      be followed standard gemcitabine IV administration every week (1000 mg/m2). Two intratumor
      injections of a same dose of CYL-02 will be administered at one month interval. Four
      increasing doses (125 µg, 250 µg, 500 µg and 1 mg) will be tested by group of 6 patients. The
      primary objectives are: evaluation of local pancreatic and general tolerance; the secondary
      objectives are: possible tumor volume regression, secondary respectability, evaluation of
      transgene biodistribution.
