        -  Compare the complete response and nodular partial response of patients with relapsed or
           refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
           with or without oblimersen.

        -  Compare the overall response rate, response duration, survival, and time to progression
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the clinical benefit and safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease response to prior fludarabine-containing therapy (responsive vs
      refractory), number of prior regimens (1-2 vs 3 or more), and duration of response to last
      prior therapy (more than 6 months vs 6 months or fewer). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 via an infusion pump
           (ending on day 8) and fludarabine IV over 20-30 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over
           30-60 minutes on days 5-7. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC)
           beginning on day 11 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 20-30 minutes followed by cyclophosphamide
           IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1-3. Patients also receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 7 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

      Treatment in both arms continues every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 1 year.
