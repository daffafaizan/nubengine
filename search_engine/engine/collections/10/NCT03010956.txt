      uncontrolled type 1 diabetes and 30 patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Individuals
      should not be treated with statins, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, sartans, hormonal
      preparations, drugs that interfere with the function of platelets and hemostasis.
      Furthermore, they should not have heart failure, nephropathy and retinopathy. 10 people will
      remain uncontrolled after the expiration of 3 months after the modification of antidiabetic
      medication used as a control group .

      At 0, 3, 6 and 12 months the investigators will measure:

        1. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV, m/sec) and augmentation index (AI%) by the
           method of arteriography (Arteriograph, TensioMed) and Complior (SP ALAM).

        2. Perfused boundary region (PBR, micrometers) of the sublingual arterial microvessels
           (ranged from 5-25 micrometers) using Sideview Darkfield imaging (Microscan, Glycocheck).
           Increased PBR is considered an accurate non invasive index of reduced endothelial
           glucocalyx thickness.

        3. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery.

        4. Determination of following parameters in blood: glucose, insulin, free fatty acids,
           triglycerides, glycerol, C-reactive protein (CRP), transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b),
           Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2 (LP-LPA2), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), IL6
           and IL10 (interleukins), propeptide of type I procollagen (PIP), propeptide of
           procollagen type III (PIIINP), matrix metallopeptidases 9 and 2 (MMP), macrophage-colony
           stimulating factor (MCSF), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), N-terminal pro
           b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and galectin-3.
