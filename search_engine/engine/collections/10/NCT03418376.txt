      MS-patients suffer from significantly reduced muscle carnosine levels compared to healthy
      counterparts. The potential of β-alanine supplementation to elevate muscle carnosine content
      has been shown in healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the investigators have recently
      investigated β-alanine and carnosine supplementation in EAE animals. In MS, this has not been
      investigated yet. Therefore, the researchers' next step is to investigate the impact of
      β-alanine intake on exercise performance in MS patients. The investigators hypothesize that
      oral β-alanine supplementation improves exercise therapy outcomes in MS patients.

      So far, it is clear that β-alanine intake enhances exercise capacity of untrained, trained
      and aged individuals by improving contractile properties, maintaining higher intracellular
      energy levels and optimizing training adaptations. Because early fatigue of contracting
      musculature during rehabilitation is the predominant cause of exercise cessation, postponing
      exercise-induced fatigue by β-alanine supplementation will be clinically very relevant
      (improving exercise therapy efficiency). Consequently, the investigators aim to research the
      ergogenic potential of β-alanine intake in MS rehabilitation and hypothesize that β-alanine
      supplementation optimizes exercise therapy outcome (exercise capacity, muscle contractile
      characteristics) in this population.
