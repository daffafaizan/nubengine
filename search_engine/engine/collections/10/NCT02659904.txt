      study. Based on the remaining tissue at donor site after free gingival graft harvesting,
      individuals were divided into two groups: 1.0-1.9 millimeter (mm) remaining tissue at donor
      site after harvesting (n = 20), 2-2.9 mm remaining tissue at donor site after harvesting.
      Tissue filling in defect area from three points (mesial, central and distal) was measured at
      various time-points (baseline, post-operative 1, 3, 6 months).
