      producing cells in the pancreas. Around 80% of diagnosed patients have detectable antibodies
      to islet cell self-proteins including, insulin IA-2 and glutamic acid decarboxylase. The
      drug, BHT-3021 is being studied because an agent that stops autoimmune damage could offer
      patients benefit.

      Study Description: A Randomized, Blinded, Placebo Controlled, Safety and Pharmacodynamic
      Study of BHT-3021 with Open Label Cross-Over in Subjects with Type I Diabetes Mellitus that
      will enroll up to 72 subjects in this trial. Subjects will be randomized to BHT-3021 or
      BHT-placebo in a 2:1 ratio.

      The duration of the study is approximately 25 to 37 months depending on treatment assignment:
      4 week Screening Period; 12 month Blinded Treatment and Evaluation Period; 12 month
      Cross-over Treatment and Evaluation Period (BHT-placebo subjects only); 12 month Long Term
      Follow-Up period.
