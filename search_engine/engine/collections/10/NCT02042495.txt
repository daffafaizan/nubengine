    
      Aim 1 To determine whether, among patients with endometrial cancer, treatment with the
      currently approved insulin sensitizing drug metformin increases or decreases pathway
      activation distal to the insulin receptor in endometrial cancer tissue.

      Aim II To compare specified biomarkers in each endometrial cancer patient before and after
      receiving metformin. Our goal is to compare the following biomarkers in each patient before
      and after metformin administration: Ki-67, TUNEL assay for apoptosis level, phosphor-AMPK,
      phosphor-IGF-1R, phosphor-IRS1, phospho-Akt, phospho-S6, phosphor-mTOR, pACC.

      All patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer presenting to the Jewish General Hospital for
      surgical treatment will be invited to participate.
