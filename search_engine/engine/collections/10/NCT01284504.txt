      immunity in colon cancer patients and evaluate the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment with
      celecoxib on this response. In addition, evaluation of the effect of short-term preoperative
      administration of celecoxib on tumor immunogenicity will help us to understand how
      tumor-enhancing inflammation and anti-tumor immunity can be differentially affected by COX-2
      inhibitors. The knowledge gained as a result of this research will help us to set up the
      infrastructure for a method to monitor the immunoinflammatory status of colon cancer patients
      with a longer term goal of designing interventions to suppress tumor-enhancing inflammation
      and vitalize anti-tumor immunity in the perioperative period. The long-term objective is to
      use these novel tools in order to improve cancer-specific survival in patients with colon
      cancer after primary tumor resection.
