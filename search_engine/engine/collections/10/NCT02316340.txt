      Patients will require imaging up to 6 weeks prior to enrollment and will be assessed for
      measureable evidence of mCRC. This will be a randomized, controlled phase II clinical trial
      of patients with histological documentation of metastatic colorectal cancer, who have
      received locally and currently approved standard therapies, excluding RGF. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to RGF or VOR/HCQ (see schema below). Also, crossover is optional after first
      progression on the initial therapy, and based on physician discretion and in the best
      interest of the patient. If crossover is not done, then the patient will be off study and can
      go on to receive other treatments.
