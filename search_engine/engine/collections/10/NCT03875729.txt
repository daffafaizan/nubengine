    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multi-center
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teplizumab, a humanized, anti-CD3 monoclonal
      antibody, in children and adolescents ages 8 through 17 recently diagnosed with type 1
      diabetes (within 6 weeks of diagnosis). Approximately 300 participants will be randomized at
      a ratio of 2:1 to either the teplizumab group or the placebo group.

      Teplizumab or matching placebo will be administered in two courses 6 months apart. Each
      course of treatment will include daily infusions for 12 days. The total study duration for
      each participant will be up to 86 weeks.

      The primary objective is to determine whether two courses of teplizumab administered 6 months
      apart slows the loss of β cells and preserves β cell function over 18 months (78 weeks) in
      children and adolescents 8-17 years old who have been diagnosed with T1D in the previous 6
      weeks.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate improvements in key clinical parameters of diabetes
      management, to determine the safety and tolerability of teplizumab, and to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of teplizumab
