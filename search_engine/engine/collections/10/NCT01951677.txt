      to the target protein (e.g. hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)). Despite considerable
      research, aluminium hydroxide or phosphate compounds (collectively referred to as "alum")
      remain the dominant adjuvants used in human hepatitis B virus vaccines. There is thus an
      unmet need for new HBV vaccine adjuvants, in particular, for adjuvants capable of boosting
      cell-mediated immunity (this is a particular type of immune response where killer T cells are
      activated that are then able to attack and destroy the infection) as alum, although good at
      stimulating antibodies is very poor at stimulating cell-mediated immunity. Alum, whilst
      generally accepted as safe, can be associated with significant local vaccine reactions and
      this is another reason why newer better-tolerated vaccine adjuvants would be beneficial. This
      study will compare a range of experimental adjuvant formulations to identify those that
      provide the safest and most effective enhancement of T- and B-cell immunity against hepatitis
      B
