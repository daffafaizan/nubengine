    
      retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness changing has been reported in Alzheimer's Disease
      (AD) patients at an early stage, and has been demonstrated as a potential biomarker able to
      predict cognitive deterioration (Hinton DR et al., N Engl J Med 1986; London A et al. Nat Rev
      Neurol 2013; Chang LY et al., Alzheimers Dement 2014). However, whether RNFL thickness is
      correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) features of AD pathogenesis (e.g., AÎ² and Tau)
      remains unclear. The investigators thus conducted this observational cohort study to test the
      correlation between RNFL thickness changing and CSF, to further validate RNFL as a potential
      AD biomarker.
