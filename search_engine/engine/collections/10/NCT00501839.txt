    
      Infertile PCOS patients who had three previous ovulatory cycles under CC will be enrolled and
      randomized in three groups (groups A, B, and C). In group A, patients will receive cyclic
      progestogens for nine months; in group B, patients will continue CC treatment for further
      three cycles at the same ovulating doses followed by six months of cyclic progestogens; and
      in group C, patients will continue CC administration at the same ovulating doses for nine
      cycles. In each case, CC will be administered using a traditional incremental-doses protocol
      up to 150 mg daily.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the clinical and reproductive
      outcomes, and the adverse experience will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant. Continuous variables will be analyzed with the unpaired t
      test and general linear model for repeated measures analysis with Bonferroni test for the
      post-hoc analysis as required. For categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square and Fisher's
      exact tests will be used. Cumulative pregnancy rate, our primary end-point, will be
      calculated by the Kaplan-Maier method, and the differences between the two groups will be
      assessed with the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards model will be used to calculate the
      hazard ratio for new pregnancy in both groups.
