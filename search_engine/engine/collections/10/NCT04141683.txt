      ventricular (RV) dilatation, fibrosis and eventually failure. RV dysfunction is an important
      determinant of mortality in patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery.

      Aim of the current study is to investigate the prognostic utility of right ventricular
      contractile reserve in patients with severe TR undergoing surgical or interventional
      tricuspid valve repair or tricuspid valve replacement.

      RV contractile reserve will be assessed using semi-supine bicycle stress echocardiography.

      Echocardiographic parameters are prone to altered loading conditions, such as volume
      overload. Load independent RV contractility can only be measured using invasive
      pressure-volume-loop (PVL) analysis. Therefore RV PVL analysis will be done using conductance
      catheter in a subset of patients who undergo right heart catheterization for clinical
      evaluation of pulmonary hypertension. Aim of this sub study is the validation of
      non-invasively derived RV contractile reserve with load independent markers of intrinsic RV
      contractility.
