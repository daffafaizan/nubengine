      I. To assess the pain-reduction effects of adding venlafaxine to a regimen of gabapentin and
      methadone to control pain during and after chemoradiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine) of the rate of toxicities
      possibly or probably related to the pain control regimen.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The effect of venlafaxine on other quality of life scores, patient nutrition, hydration
      status, and opioid requirements during and after chemoradiotherapy (CRT).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive gabapentin orally (PO) daily or 3 times a day (TID). Participants
      may also receive methadone PO TID and oxycodone PO every 8 hours as needed. Treatment
      continues for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive gabapentin, methadone, and oxycodone as in Arm I and venlafaxine
      PO twice daily (BID) or venlafaxine hydrochloride extended release daily for up to 12 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months, and then every 6 months for up to 24 months.
