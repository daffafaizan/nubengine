      Influenza is likely also an important cause of illness in India, but published data on
      influenza infections in India are limited, especially for children. Although influenza
      vaccines are used routinely in the United States, including in young children, influenza
      vaccines have not seen widespread use in India. This is likely due to the lack of information
      from India about disease burden due to influenza and because the influenza vaccines have
      never been tested for efficacy in India. In addition, because young children are thought to
      be important in the spread of influenza in families, it is possible immunization of children
      against influenza will reduce influenza infections among older children and adults in the
      home.
