    
      This is a 28-day prospective study to evaluate the acceptability of Ketoflo, in terms of GI
      tolerance, adherence to recommended intakes and palatability. The product's nutritional
      suitability for use in a ketogenic diet will also be evaluated by recording ketone levels and
      seizure frequency measured as part of usual clinical care.

      Ketoflo is nutritionally complete liquid feed for use in the dietary management of epilepsy
      or other neurometabolic conditions requiring a ketogenic diet. It is designed to be
      nutritionally complete from 3-18 years and can be used as a supplementary feed thereafter.

      Ketoflo has been designed in liaison with Key Opinion Leaders and will offer an additional
      choice of prescribe-able feeds for use in the ketogenic diet.

      The study will involve 15 participants, aged between three and eighteen years of age
      (inclusive), who are already established on a ketogenic diet for at least three months before
      the study begins.

      Participants will self-report data in Daily Study Diaries over the course of the study. Data
      will also be collected by the Investigators in Baseline CRFs and End of Study CRFs for all
      participants. Any data collected for the study will be anonymised before being relayed to the
      sponsor.

      The data generated by the trial will be used to support a submission by Vitaflo
      (International) Ltd. to the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) for Ketoflo to
      become reimbursable on prescription in the UK. The data will also be used in a submission to
      the General Medical Services in the Republic of Ireland.
