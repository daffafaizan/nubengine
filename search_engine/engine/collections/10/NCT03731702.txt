      has been observed to be associated with numerous health conditions, but current
      methodological studies suggest that collection method, laboratory handling, bioinformatic
      processing of the data, and other factors can greatly affect microbiome study findings. In
      cohort studies, samples should be collected using validated methods that can be analyzed
      using multiple technologies, however these technologies and methods are regularly changing
      and being modified. Therefore, we need to test multiple collection methods for new
      technologies or test new collection methods to assess the comparability of the results. We
      will evaluate the effect of several collection methods for oral and/or fecal samples from 100
      individuals who work at the NCI on microbial characteristics. Once the samples are collected,
      we will create aliquots and store the samples for further processing. We will then test the
      effect of new DNA extraction methods, sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics pipelines
      using these samples. Any remaining aliquots will remain in the -80 degrees Celsius freezer
      for other future studies. This study will be essential to understand the impact of collection
      methods for oral and fecal samples for future epidemiologic studies.
