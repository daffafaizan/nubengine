      I. To assess the toxicity of dose regimen using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version
      4.0).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantify the relationship between the measured intra-tumor light dose and the pathological
      tumor response.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Simulate light dose distribution within the treated tumor. II. Immune markers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temoporfin intravenously (IV) over at least 6 minutes on day 1 and undergo
      interstitial photodynamic therapy on day 3. Within 4-6 weeks, patients undergo surgical
      resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 3 years.
