      I. Estimate the rates of objective response observed prior to disease progression during the
      first four courses of treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride in pediatric
      patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory malignant glioma (Stratum A [closed to
      accrual as of 4/21/2009]) or recurrent/progressive/refractory intrinsic brain stem glioma
      (Stratum B [closed to accrual as of 4/21/2009]).

      II. Estimate the rates of objective response observed prior to disease progression during the
      first four courses of treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride in patients
      with recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma (Stratum C [closed to accrual as of
      10/27/2009]) or recurrent or progressive ependymoma (Stratum D [closed to accrual as of
      7/29/2010]).

      III. Estimate the sustained disease stabilization rate associated with bevacizumab and
      irinotecan in patients with recurrent or progressive low grade glioma (Stratum E [closed to
      accrual as of 7/29/2010]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the rate of treatment-related toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      II. Estimate the cumulative incidence of sustained objective responses as a function of this
      regimen in these patients.

      III. Estimate the distributions of survival and event-free survival of these patients.

      IV. Correlate functional changes in tumor with progression-free survival and response using
      MR perfusion/diffusion imaging and fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type
      (high-grade glioma [closed to accrual as of 4/21/2009] vs intrinsic brain stem tumor [closed
      to accrual as of 4/21/2009] vs medulloblastoma [closed to accrual as of 10/27/2010] vs
      ependymoma [closed to accrual as of 7/29/2010] vs low grade glioma [closed to accrual as of
      7/29/2010]).

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 16 or 17 for course 1. Patients receive bevacizumab
      and irinotecan hydrochloride on days 1 and 15 for all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo MRIs of the brain, magnetic resonance perfusion/diffusion, and
      fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography at baseline and periodically during
      treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 2 years.
