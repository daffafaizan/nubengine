      stimulus, which can provoke untoward response in the cardiovascular, respiratory and other
      physiological systems .Amantadine is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, and compared
      to ketamine, it is well tolerated with fewer side effects (mainly dizziness, sedation, and
      dry mouth). Amantadine's formulation permits the oral route for drug delivery, as well as the
      IV route. The side-effects profile of amantadine via all routes seems not to be harmful in
      appropriate dosages.. Amantadine has been clinically used as an antiviral drug, for dementia,
      and in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and spasticity. It is a non-competitive NMDA
      receptor antagonist, and compared to ketamine, it is well tolerated with fewer side effects
      (mainly dizziness, sedation, and dry mouth). Amantadine's formulation permits the oral route
      for drug delivery, as well as the IV route. The side-effects profile of amantadine via all
      routes seems not to be harmful in appropriate dosages.

      In the central nervous system, beta-endorphins bind mu-opioid receptors and exert their
      primary action at presynaptic nerve terminals. However, instead of inhibiting substance P,
      they exert their analgesic effect by inhibiting the release of GABA, an inhibitory
      neurotransmitter, resulting in excess production of dopamine.

      this study will be undertaken-to evaluate the effect of oral amantadine versus IV amantadine
      premedication on the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy ,tracheal intubation and surgical
      incision and their effect on Î²-endorphins.
