      surgery at our department between July 2012 and December 2014. The patients were indicated
      for the surgical procedure due to structural heart disease, and suffered from paroxysmal,
      persistent, or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. In all cases, left atrial
      cryoablation was performed in the extent of isolation of pulmonary veins, box lesion,
      connecting lesion with mitral annulus, amputation of the left atrial appendage and connecting
      lesion of the appendage base with left pulmonary veins. Furthermore, thirty-five of the
      patients underwent mapping and radiofrequency ablation of ganglionated plexi, together with
      decision and ablation of the ligament of Marshall.
