      controlled trial of PCSK9 inhibition in intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) patients,
      designed to show a reduction in the primary endpoint of ischemic stroke recurrence. Such a
      trial would provide evidence for the utility of alirocumab to prevent recurrent stroke in
      ICAD. While we are proposing future studies to reduce recurrent ICAD stroke risk, it should
      be noted that, in the long term, our research may lead to effective primary ICAD stroke risk
      reduction through PCSK9 inhibition in patients at high risk of stroke identified through
      asymptomatic stenosis, post-contrast plaque enhancement (PPE) or intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH)
      on vwMRI.
