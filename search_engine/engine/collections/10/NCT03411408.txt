    
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of hypofractionated image- guided helical
      tomotherapy after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) for treatment of recurrent malignant high -
      grade gliomas The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the disease control rate
      (DCR) of treated patients.

      The secondary Objectives are:

        -  Safety assessment (acute and late toxicity).

        -  Overall Survival (OS),

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS).

        -  Evaluation of predictive score of disease, radionecrosis and pseudoprogression using
           perfusion DSC and DCE MRI

      Patients will receive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy using tomotherapy combined with
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy.

      Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy (the maximum period of time from completion of decompression
      to RT is 60 min) followed by tomotherapy (3-5 consecutive sessions- one fraction per day, 5
      Gy / die).

      The overall duration of treatment will be max 5 days.
