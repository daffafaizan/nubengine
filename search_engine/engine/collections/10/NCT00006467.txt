      advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine and ISIS 2503.
      II. Determine the response rate of these patients treated with this regimen. III. Assess the
      toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8 and ISIS 2503 IV continuously on days 1-14. Treatment continues every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
