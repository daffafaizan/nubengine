      that have previously undergone total hip arthroplasties with ceramic on metal and metal on
      metal bearing surfaces. Secondary goals include an assessment of osteolysis on radiographs,
      potential long term analysis of implant survivability, and cancer rates in the two patient
      populations.

      Increased metal ion production has been documented in metal-on-metal arthroplasty
      articulations. There are several concerns over metal ion production. First, even though there
      is a decreased histiocytic response to metallic debris, a dose dependent cytotoxic response
      with Interleukin 6, Prostaglandin E2, and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha persists and may cause
      osteolysis in the long term. Second, increased levels of cobalt, chromium and nickel has been
      shown to correlate with increased cancer rates in several animal models, and the carcinogenic
      risk in humans has not been fully elucidated as yet. Third, hypersensitivity reactions to
      metal ion develop in up to 25% of these patients, and 60% of patients with poorly functioning
      hip.

      Ceramic on metal avoids many of these problems due to the improved wear characteristics. If
      the level of metal ion production is significantly reduced and the implant survivability is
      proven in long term studies, this articulation may become the preferred method.
