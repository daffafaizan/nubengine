      cooptation of families, patients, family practitioners and other partners.

      After checking the inclusion criteria and obtaining the signatures of consents, patients will
      be assessed using the functional status (SMAF) and the Global Geriatric Assessment (GGA).

      Patients included in the "specific intervention" group will benefit from a personalized
      action plan presented in a multidisciplinary staff that will be established according to the
      detected frailties. In follow up visits, a new evaluation will be done and the action plan
      reviewed.

      Every month, patients of this group will receive a Unit for Prevention, Monitoring and
      Analysis of Aging (UPSAV) phone call in order to complete the secondary assessment criteria
      of the trial. Therefore, every patient will be re-evaluated according to the intervention
      plan of the study.

      The quality of life of the patient will be estimated by the scale EQ-5D. In every visit, will
      be collected in a forward-looking way the medical direct costs (ambulatory, hospital care and
      medicines) and the non medical costs (transport, helpers, arrangements of the place of
      residence).
