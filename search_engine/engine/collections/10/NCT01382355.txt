      Preventing rejection of transplanted organs remains the premier challenge. According to the
      humoral theory, donor specific antibodies (DSA) are the major cause of chronic rejection and
      allograft loss. Despite this, and evidence that links human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      antibodies to allograft dysfunction and loss, doubt remains about the cause-and-effect
      relationship and confirmation of this evidence is necessary to help facilitate change in
      transplant practice. Prospective monitoring for de novo DSA in the serum of patients who have
      received a transplant may allow for earlier detection, evaluation, and characterization of
      factors leading to the development of antibodies prior to the development of clinical
      manifestations of graft dysfunction.

      The contribution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and Class II
      antibodies to transplant outcomes is well documented. However, there is emerging evidence
      that antibody mediated rejection and the severity of outcomes may involve proteins and
      antibodies that go beyond HLA Class I and II. A number of assays are available for testing
      for these additional antibodies and proteins but they are currently not used for widespread
      patient monitoring in part due to lack of data justifying their commercial use. This pilot
      study will prospectively evaluate for the presence and/or emergence of these unique
      antibodies, (I.E. MICA antigen, IgG3 and C1Q) in serial samples of serum, and confirm or
      reject the utility of incorporating these assays into routine patient monitoring which might
      provide earlier evidence of emerging rejection. Serum samples will be stored indefinitely for
      future kidney transplant research projects.
