    
      Randomized phase 3 trial evaluating niraparib plus dostarlimab vs chemotherapy at physician's
      choice in the treatment of recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer
      patients for which platinum is not an option.

      The patients must have received no more than 2 previous chemotherapy lines. Stratification
      factors will include HRD status, previous treatment with parp and anti PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors,
      Bevacizumab treatment and PDL1 expression.

      Patients will continue to receive niraparib until disease progression (determined using
      RECIST v.1.1 criteria and clinical criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of
      consent, or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first. Patients will continue to receive
      dostarlimab for a maximum of 2 years, or until disease progression (determined using RECIST
      v1.1 criteria and clinical criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent,
      lost to follow-up, whichever may come first. Dose interruption and/or reduction may be
      implemented at any time for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by the patient.
