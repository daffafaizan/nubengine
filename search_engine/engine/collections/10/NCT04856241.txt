    
      Primary Aim: To compare the impact of supported and unsupported implementation strategies on
      the use of an IP program (Prep-to-Play) in female community Australian Football.

      Secondary aims are to:

        1. Evaluate the effects of supported implementation of Prep-to-Play on injury risk
           reduction.

        2. Identify barriers and enablers to sustainability of the Prep-to-Play implementation
           model, and develop clear recommendations for a future, sustainable national roll out of
           Prep-to-Play.

        3. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Prep-to-Play.

      Primary hypothesis

      The primary hypothesis is that supported implementation will result in increased use of
      Prep-to-Play in female community Australian Football compared to unsupported implementation.

      Secondary hypotheses

      The secondary hypotheses are that the supported implementation of Prep-to-Play will:

        -  result in a reduction of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in females
           participating in community Australian Football;

        -  result in a reduction of other musculoskeletal injuries and concussion among females
           participating in community Australian Football;

        -  be more cost-effective than the unsupported implementation.
