    
      The rationale for performing the C-TRACT Trial is based upon:

        1. the debilitating life impact of DIO-PTS upon patients, as cited in the U.S. Surgeon
           General's 2008 Call to Action on DVT (95);

        2. the inability of existing therapies to prevent or alleviate most cases of DIO-PTS;

        3. the role of iliac vein obstruction and saphenous reflux in causing the severe
           manifestations of DIO-PTS;

        4. the ability of stent placement and endovenous ablation to eliminate obstruction and
           reflux, respectively, to reduce PTS severity, and to improve QOL in preliminary studies;

        5. the risks, costs, and uncertainties of this novel but invasive strategy;

        6. the lack of consensus on whether EVT should be used for DIO-PTS;

        7. the motivation of our established investigator team to answer this critical clinical
           question.

      We will determine if EVT should be routinely used to treat DIO-PTS. If so, this finding will
      fundamentally change DIO-PTS practice towards more frequent use of EVT. If EVT proves
      ineffective or unsafe, this finding will reduce or eliminate the use of potentially risky and
      expensive procedures.

      374 subjects with established DIO-PTS will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either EVT or
      No-EVT treatment groups. All participants will receive standard PTS therapy. Subjects will be
      enrolled over approximately 36 months in 20-40 U.S. Clinical Centers, and followed for 24
      months. The study will take approximately 6 years to complete.
