    
      As part of our growing clinical tracking EMR system the investigators plan to collect
      preoperative and postoperative Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) on all patients with
      degenerative hip and knee disease. The investigators will collect PROMS along with implant
      device specific revision rates. This will be used for implant surveillance, clinical outcome
      tracking, return to work outcome metrics and failure modes and rates of various hip and knee
      implants. Information generated during regular hospital and clinic visits will be entered
      into the database. For example, x-ray findings done before surgery will be entered into the
      database. Surgery information will be entered into the database. The investigators will also
      enter demographic information into the database such as name, email, birthdate, gender,
      height, and weight. Medical co-morbidities such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and prior
      surgeries will also be entered.

      The investigators will collect this information before surgery, during the operation, and at
      annual follow-up visits. The investigators will also contact patients via email with short
      outcome score surveys (known as Patient Reported Outcome Measures or PROM's). This will save
      many hours of return visits if scores indicate the joint replacements are doing well. Also
      this will trigger additional follow-up measures if PROMS scores drop off.
