      two groups; quadratus lumborum block and epidural. Non-invasive blood pressure monitor,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), and pulse-oxymetry were set on the subjects in the operation room.
      General anesthesia induction was done by fentanyl 2 mcg/kg and propofol 1-2 mg/kg.
      Endotracheal tube (ETT) intubation was facilitated with Atracurium 0.5mg/kg as muscle
      relaxant. Maintenance was done by sevoflurane, oxygen, and compressed air. On quadratus
      lumborum block group, bilateral block using ultrasound will be performed with stimuplex 100mm
      needle with 20 cc of bupivacaine 0.25% as regimen. On epidural group, epidural catheter was
      inserted under general anaesthesia on left lateral decubitus position (5 cm depth inside the
      epidural space) at level Th10-Th11. The catheter insertion was confirmed with vacuum
      aspiration and negative test-dose. Before first incision, patient will be given continuous
      epidural Bupivacaine 0.25% 6 mL/hour. Blood sample was drawn for interleukin-6, blood
      glucose, and c-reactive protein as baseline data. After surgery, patient were extubated until
      fully conscious and can follow command verbally. Patient will be transported in recovery room
      post operation.
