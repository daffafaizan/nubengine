      nociception and allows early detection of a defect in analgesia. Orotracheal intubation is
      responsible for a sometimes deleterious hemodynamic reaction. The Analgesia Nociception Index
      could allow an individual adjustment of the investigator's anesthetic inductions during this
      period.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate if there is a correlation between
      variations in the ANI following a standardized nociceptive stimulus and the occurrence of
      hemodynamic or somatic reactions during orotracheal intubation without muscle relaxation.

      Materials and Methods: Prospective, interventional, analytical, monocentric, piloted study
      carried out in the operating theatre after obtaining patient's informed consent between
      January 2014 and November 2014. Under steady state total intravenous anaesthesia with
      propofol and remifentanil at constant dosage (entropy between 40 and 60) tetanus stimulation
      of the ulnar nerve was performed followed by orotracheal intubation. The variation of ANI and
      hemodynamic parameters as well as the somatic response associated with both maneuvers were
      collected.
