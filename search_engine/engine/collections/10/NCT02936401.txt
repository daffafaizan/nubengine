      HIV infection, are on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with suppressed viral loads,
      and yet continue to experience behavioral and cognitive symptoms of HIV-associated
      neurocognitive disorders (HAND). It is increasingly relevant that HAND persists despite cART,
      impacting between 30-50% of elders living with HIV. Patients suffer symptoms that are
      pervasive in their impact on everyday functioning and quality of life; yet these patients are
      currently left with a dearth of treatment options. In this study, the investigators employ a
      randomized controlled evaluation of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to target
      attention, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among patients who have HAND and have
      maximized treatment options. The investigators will employ intrinsic connectivity network
      (ICN) analyses of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate
      increased strength of brain networks corresponding to improved symptoms. The investigators
      will quantify social networks and perceived strength of social networks to determine if they
      moderate the main findings. Together this work employs geriatric, neuroscience and
      complementary medicine disciplines to reduce the symptom burden in aging HIV-infected
      patients.
