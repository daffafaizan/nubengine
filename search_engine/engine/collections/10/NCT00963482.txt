    
      The study is designed as a randomised, controlled trial conducted in an inpatient alcohol
      treatment institution. Shortly after alcohol detoxification, smokers are offered to
      voluntarily participate in a smoking cessation program. Participation is possible if patients
      either want to stop smoking or to reduce their consumption for at least 50%. Patients are
      asked about their smoking behaviour at the following time points: at admission (T0), after
      finishing the smoking cessation program or the control condition (T1), one month later by
      phone (T2) and six months later in a closing meeting (T3). Urine samples and CO-breath
      controls are taken to check both nicotine and alcohol abstinence.
