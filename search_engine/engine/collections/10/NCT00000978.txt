      of reducing the toxicity of each while maintaining antiviral effects. In addition, AZT and
      ddC may work together in a way that both drugs can be taken at lower doses or less frequent
      intervals when given together. If the doses can be reduced, then toxicity associated with
      long-term use of one drug may be reduced. Combination of AZT and ddC might reduce the
      likelihood of the emergence of resistant mutants. Recent studies indicate a reduced
      sensitivity of HIV isolated from patients after prolonged AZT therapy. Although the clinical
      significance of this finding is not clear, it would indicate that these combination studies
      are all the more important. HIV strains with decreased sensitivity to AZT are still sensitive
      to ddC.

      Patients are randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups of various dose combinations of
      AZT and ddC. Patients are evaluated every week for the first 10 weeks and biweekly
      thereafter.
