      radiation therapy and concomitant TMZ are more satisfied with ondansetron or granisetron
      patch for the prevention of nausea and vomiting. The secondary objectives are 1) to compare
      the efficacy and compliance of granisetron patch and ondansetron in the prevention of nausea
      and vomiting during the 6 weeks of RT and concomitant TMZ, and 2) to assess the safety of the
      granisetron patch in preventing radiation induced nausea and vomiting in primary glioma
      patients receiving RT and TMZ.

      All eligible subjects should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 GY of radiation and 75
      mg/m2 of temozolomide daily for a total of six weeks. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      one of two treatment sequences of antiemetic therapy for the prevention of nausea and
      vomiting associated with RT and concomitant TMZ. Sequence #1 involves administration of
      ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by the use of granisetron patch for 3 weeks; whereas
      sequence #2 involves the use of the granisetron patch for 3 weeks followed by 3 weeks of
      ondansetron. Toxicity will be assessed each week of radiation therapy based on the Common
      Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. The subject will be asked to
      complete the modified MASCC Antiemesis Tool (MAT) questionnaire at baseline, and on days 2,
      4, and 7 of each week of radiation therapy, as well as to record the use of all study
      medication and any antiemetic rescue medication taken daily. At the end of the weeks 3 & 6,
      the subject will be asked to fill out a Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication
      and will be asked at the end of week 6 to choose which antiemetic they prefer.
