      tidal variations of airway pressure subtracted by tidal variations in esophageal pressure
      divided by the tidal volume (Method 1). This requires the presence of a esophageal balloon
      catheter which is cumbersome and costly.

      In this study values obtained as described in Method 1 above are compared to values obtained
      with a new method in which a PEEP-step is performed with a size which corresponds to the
      tidal volume which the patient is ventilated with. Measurements using Method 1 and 2 are
      performed in anesthetized patients prior to major surgery.
