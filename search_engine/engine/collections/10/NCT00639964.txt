    
      Plan of study:

      Longitudinal study on 3 groups: 70 type 1 diabetic women, 70 type 2 diabetic women and 70
      women with normal glucose tolerance during pregnancy. Recruitment in the department of
      Diabetology and Obstetrics of CHRU of Amiens and Lille.

      Nutritional survey and sampling of blood in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy and
      at 6 weeks post partum.

      Collection of cord blood and placental tissues. Histological and molecular analysis of
      placenta will be realized both in the departments of Anatomopathology of Lille and Amiens and
      in Biochemistry Molecular Biology of CHRU of Lille.

      Homocysteine and folate assays on cord blood will be centralized in Paris (Hospital St
      Louis).

      Main criteria of judgment

      Fetal weight corrected by the gestational age.

      Expected results:

        -  An inverse correlation between maternal and fetal blood fatty acids ratios
           (polyunsaturated fatty acids/ monounsaturated fatty acids + saturated) and birth weight
           in the diabetic groups.

        -  Differences of distribution of fatty acids of maternal and foetal erythrocytic
           phospholipids correlated with the fetal weight.

        -  Qualitative and quantitative variations of expression of placental genes such as lipases
           and genes submitted to parental imprinting.

      The biologic parameters will be confronted with the data of the nutritional survey and with
      glycemic control during pregnancy.
