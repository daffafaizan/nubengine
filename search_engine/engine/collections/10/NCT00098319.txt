      impact of birth defects on fetal and neonatal health directly and maternal health indirectly.
      Craniofacial anomalies comprise a significant component of morbid human birth defects. The
      primary hypothesis is that folic acid supplementation of 4mg/day at preconception and during
      the first three months of pregnancy will decrease the recurrence of nonsyndromic cleft lip
      with or without clef palate (NSCL/P) in a high-risk group of women when compared to women
      taking 0.4 mg per day of folic acid. The total sample will include 2,000 women (that either
      have NSCL/P or that have at least one child with NSCL/P) randomly assigned to the 4 mg versus
      the 0.4 mg folic acid study groups. The study will also compare the recurrence rates of
      NSCL/P in the total sample of subjects as well as the two study groups (4mg, 0.4 mg) to that
      of a historical control group.

      The primary outcome assessed is the rate of recurrences of NSCL/P in offspring of the trial
      mothers in each of the two study groups. Secondary outcomes include recurrence of NSCL/P
      compared to a historical control group; serum and red cell folate levels; severity of NSCL/P
      in offspring of trial mothers; twinning rate; miscarriage rate; preeclampsia; rates of other
      birth defects; birth weight; and gestational age. The sample size was based on historic
      tables of birth rates and the rates of cleft occurrences. The study hypothesizes that a total
      of 2000 subjects will be enrolled during a 2.5 year period; a dropout rate of 10%; birth rate
      for group A (women with NSCL/P) of 10% and a rate of 12% for group B (women with at least one
      child with NSCL/P); risk of cleft for group A is 7% and for group B is 4%; one-sided test
      with continuity correction.
