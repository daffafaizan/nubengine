      reversing undesirable phenomena underlying autoimmune vitiligo pathogenesis. A study has been
      designed as a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study with
      the enrollment of at least 20 active non-segmental vitiligo patients presenting with
      vitiligous lesions on both upper and lower limbs. Clinical effects of ointments containing 1%
      simvastatin-acid sodium salt or 1% atorvastatin calcium salt applied on a preselected limb
      will be assessed in comparison with vehicle ointment applied on the opposite limb. All study
      participants will undergo clinical evaluation using Body Surface Area (BSA) and Vitiligo Area
      Scoring Index (VASI) scales at baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12 time points. Precise
      assessment of skin lesions will be performed using photographic documentation obtained during
      each study visit and processed with NIS-Elements software.
