    
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 trial to determine the effects of
      aNK in combination with ALT-803 in patients with stage III (IIIB) or stage IV MCC. The study
      will use an adaptive Simon optimal two-stage design, which detects efficacy signals, allows
      for early assessment, and avoids enrolling larger numbers of patients in case of inefficacy.

      In the original protocol, an initial cohort of up to 12 patients with stage III (IIIB) or
      stage IV MCC were to be enrolled and treated with aNK monotherapy (first stage). If the
      treatment in the first stage improved the 4-month progression free survival (PFS) rate from
      4% to 20% (e.g. at least 1 patient out of 12 patients has PFS ≥ 16 weeks [4 months]), then
      the study would proceed to the second stage, in which 12 more patients were planned to be
      enrolled and treated. As of July 2016, the trial has met the required efficacy signal defined
      for the first stage and will continue to enroll a planned total of 24 patients who will
      receive the combination of aNK and ALT-803. Any patients who are already receiving aNK cells
      as monotherapy will receive aNK cells in combination with ALT-803 in subsequent cycles.

      aNK will be given via IV infusion at a dose of 2 x 10^9 cells/m^2 on two consecutive days (=
      1 cycle) every 2 weeks. In addition, ALT-803 will be administered SC at 10 μg/kg on the first
      day of every aNK infusion (before the aNK infusion) every 2 weeks.
