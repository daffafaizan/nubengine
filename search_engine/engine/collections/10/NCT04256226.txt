      tract, mesentery, or omentum. They took up about 3% of gastrointestinal malignancies.
      Although rarely, the clinical presentation of non-gastric GIST might mimick ovarian cancer,
      and would be managed by gynecologists. Therefore, retrospective review of female non-gastric
      GIST cases will be performed to investigate the clinical outcome of non-gastric GIST. The
      result of this study might be used as an important reference for gynecologists.
