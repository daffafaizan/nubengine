      rebleeding . However, Our previous study showed that combination of EVL and nadolol do not
      have enhanced effect in the prophylaxis of 1st variceal bleeding as compared with nadolol
      alone . One of the drawbacks of EVL is esophageal ulcer. On the other hand ,carvedilol, an
      anti-α beta-blocker, has been proven to be more effective than propranolol in the reduction
      of portal pressure. Carvedilol has been proven to be more effective than EVL in the
      prevention of 1st variceal bleeding. The investigators thus conduct a multicenter trial to
      evaluate whether combination of EVL and carvedilol could be more effective than carvedilol
      alone in the prophylaxis of 1st esophageal variceal bleeding . The goal of patients receiving
      EVL is to reduce variceal size, not variceal obliteration, in anticipation for fewer sessions
      required for each patient and fewer possibility of esophageal ulcer bleeding.
