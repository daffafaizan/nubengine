      investigational drug combination and also tries to better understand how the investigational
      intervention affects the body.

      "Investigational" means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      the combination of PVX-410 and pembrolizumab as a treatment regimen for this specific
      disease.

      The FDA has not approved PVX-410 as a treatment for any disease. PVX-410 is a type of vaccine
      that may help the immune system stimulate immunity against the cancer cells.

      The FDA has not approved pembrolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved in
      the United Sates for other types of cancer.

      Pembrolizumab is a drug that may treat cancer by working with the immune system. The immune
      system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system sends types of cells
      throughout the body to detect and fight infections and diseases, including cancer. For some
      types of cancer, the immune cells do not work as they should and are prevented from attacking
      the tumors. Pembrolizumab is thought to work by blocking a protein in the cells called
      Programmed Death-1 (PD-1), which then allows these cells and other parts of the immune system
      to attack tumors.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the body's immune response to the
      PVX-410 study vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab. This study will help researchers
      understand if the vaccine and pembrolizumab can work together to help the body's immune
      system recognize and treat triple negative breast cancer. The investigators are also studying
      the safety of the PVX-410 together with the pembrolizumab
