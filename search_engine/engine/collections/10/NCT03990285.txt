      who have completed chemoradiation and now have new contrast enhancing lesions or lesions
      showing increased enhancement ( 25% increase) who are recommended for a clinical surgical
      resection. Subjects may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years of age, most
      participants will be receiving care at the clinical practices of the University of
      Pennsylvania. Subjects who come to the University of Pennsylvania for diagnosis and/or
      treatment of GB and who meet the study inclusion criteria may be approached by study
      personnel for recruitment into this study. Subjects will be approached about study
      participation regardless of race or ethnic background. Investigators anticipate enrolling up
      to 30 participants. Subjects who consent but do not complete the study imaging will be
      considered not evaluable and will be replaced. Accrual will likely occur over approximately
      1-2 years. After undergoing screening assessments and verifying eligibility for study
      participation subjects will undergo a research 18FFluciclovine PET/CT scan of the brain and a
      clinical brain MRI with and without gadolinium contrast, all baseline imaging will be done
      prior to (within 1 week) of the surgical procedure. The PET-CT and MRI can be performed in
      any order.
