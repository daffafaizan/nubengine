      McKenzie method or Placebo (detuned ultrasound and short wave therapy) for 5 weeks (total of
      10 sessions of 30 minutes each).

      The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of treatment (5 weeks) and at 3, 6,
      and 12 months after randomization. The data will be collected by a blinded assessor. The
      statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principles and the between-group
      differences will be calculated by constructing mixed linear models.
