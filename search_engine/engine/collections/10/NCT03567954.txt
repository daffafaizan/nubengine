      injuries in the musculotendinous insertion regions of the rotator cuff musculature may also
      need attention in the treatment. Ultrasound is a painless and non-invasive screening modality
      in patients with a suspected rotator cuff tear. It is a user-dependent modality and health
      professionals must possess the competence and training before using it. To the investigators
      knowledge, no studies have investigated the accuracy of ultrasound in detecting rotator cuff
      tears, in patients who sustained a proximal humerus fracture.
