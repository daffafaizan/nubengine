    
      18 healthy participants (body mass index [BMI] <25 kg/m2) between 25-50 years of age were
      recruited, of which 13 subjects (male [n=5]) and female [n=8]) completed the study. The
      participants were allocated randomly either control group (n= 7) or honey group (n= 6).
      Subjects of honey group consumed 25 g of honey each day for 4 weeks. Participants of both
      groups did not undergo a special diet regimen, drug therapy, or change in their lifestyle,
      such as physical exercise, during the period of study. A 3- day food record including two
      weekdays and one weekend day was used to assess the habitual food intake of the participants
      prior to initiation of the trial and repeated each week of intervention. Also, dietary intake
      was calculated using the database Food ProcessorÂ® (Version. 10.3.0.), including nutritional
      information of Mexican foods when they weren't on the list.
