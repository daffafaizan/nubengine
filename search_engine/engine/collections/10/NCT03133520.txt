      patients. Usual oxygen therapy involves administering low-to-medium oxygen flows through a
      nasal cannula or mask to achieve SpO2â‰¥95%.

      High-flow nasal oxygen [HFNO] therapy is a focus of growing attention as an alternative to
      standard oxygen therapy. By providing warmed and humidified gas, HFNO allows the delivery of
      higher flow rates [of up to 60 L/min] via nasal cannula devices, with fraction of inspired
      oxygen (FiO2) values of nearly 100%. Physiological benefits of HFNO consist of higher and
      constant FiO2 values, decreased work of breathing, nasopharyngeal washout leading to improved
      breathing-effort efficiency, and higher positive airway pressures associated with better lung
      recruitment.

      Clinical consequences of these physiological benefits include alleviation of dyspnea and
      discomfort, decreases in tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress, a diminished need for
      intubation in patients with severe hypoxemia, and decreased mortality in unselected patients
      with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure However, although preliminary data establish the
      feasibility and safety of this technique, HFNO has never been properly evaluated in
      immunocompromised patients.

      Thus, this project aims at demonstrating that HFNO is superior to low/medium-flow (standard)
      oxygen, minimizing the need for endotracheal intubation
