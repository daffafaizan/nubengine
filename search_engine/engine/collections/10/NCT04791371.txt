      restores insulin-mediated perfusion to the heart and to skeletal muscle, leading to improved
      cardiac function and exercise performance. Data from our two research teams suggest that the
      cardiac and skeletal muscle microvascular dysfunction present in people with type 2 diabetes
      contributes to limitations in cardiac and skeletal muscle function associated with impaired
      functional exercise capacity (a major predictor of CV and all-cause mortality). Insulin
      action is a potent predictor of the functional exercise capacity impairment in type 2
      diabetes. The exact relationship between insulin action, cardiac and muscle dysfunction,
      cardiac and skeletal muscle perfusion and decreased functional exercise capacity in type 2
      diabetes remains unclear.
