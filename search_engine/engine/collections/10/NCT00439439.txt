      to alleviation of chronic globus sensation or sore throat. Acid reflux or its treatment is
      unlikely to influence these results (Meining et al. Argon plasma ablation of gastric inlet
      patches in the cervical esophagus may alleviate globus sensation: a pilot trial. Endoscopy.
      2006 Jun;38(6):566-70). Within the present study we will perform a randomized,
      sham-controlled and blinded trial, where patients with heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) of
      the cervical esophagus and globus sensations (a chronic or intermittent lump in the throat
      for at least 3 months) are going to be randomized after histological verification of HGM in
      the study center (Technical University Clinic Munich). Either a beamer ablation of HGM or a
      sham-therapy will be performed after patients complete a validated questionnaire. Patients
      are blinded for 3 months, then after completing another questionnaire endoscopy is repeated.
