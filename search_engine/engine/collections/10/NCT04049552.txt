      petrolatum vehicle to treat established keloid lesions in 5 persons with at least 2 chronic
      keloids in similar body regions (greater than 1-year duration). Treatment will be applied
      once daily for 6 months. One keloid will receive 8% RAPA ointment and the other keloid will
      receive petrolatum-only ointment as a control. Surface areas and height of keloids will be
      monitored pre- and post-treatment to evaluate responses.

      Keloid surface area and height changes will be measured pre-treatment and thereafter on a
      monthly basis using standardized digital photography with a tripod-mounted 8MP Canon S5is
      camera and calipers to measure keloid height (37).

      Surface areas of all photographed lesions will be measured with Image J
      (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html), a public image-processing program that was used to
      analyze preliminary data and this study will use the same approach.
