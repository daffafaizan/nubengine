      patients. The investigators are measuring the differences in pain processing between subject
      groups in the presence and absence of different music and distraction conditions. The
      investigators will be using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) in order to induce varying
      pain conditions on the participants. The investigators will also have participants complete
      sets of psychosocial questionnaires. Patients with Fibromyalgia tend to have a higher pain
      sensitivity. Additionally, patients with an HIV diagnosis tend to be prescribed opioid
      medications. The investigators would like to find out if music can modulate pain, and in turn
      help reduce the amount of opioid medications those with a chronic pain diagnosis take.
