      of 2 sets. The registry set is designed as a prospective real-world registry. The trial set
      is designed as a prospective pragmatic clinical trial, specifically for the patients with
      perforating arterial feeders. The two sets share a common grouping: the traditional operation
      group and the one-staged hybrid operation group. The assignment is based on the clinical
      condition in the registry set and is randomized in the trial set. End points will be
      evaluated at scheduled time points. The safety and efficiency of one-staged hybrid operation
      in treating complex bAVMs will be validated.
