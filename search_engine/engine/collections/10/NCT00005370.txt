      It was hoped that the study would provide important insights into the pathogenesis of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease with potential implications for prevention and early
      therapeutic intervention.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      All subjects participating in the Normative Aging Study were recruited for the study at the
      time of their next scheduled examination. Twenty-four hour urinary excretion of free
      cortisol, morning serum cortisol concentration, and pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometric
      indices were measured. For the 700 subjects who were recruited during years one and two of
      the study, these measurements were repeated when subjects returned for their next triennial
      examination in years four and five of the study. Respiratory illness and smoking
      questionnaire data, total and differential leukocyte counts, and methacholine inhalation
      challenge test data were also available at both time points. The specific aims of the study
      were to examine: (1) the cross-sectional relationship between level of pulmonary function and
      both morning serum cortisol concentration and 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion; (2)
      the relationship between the rate of decline of pulmonary function during the follow-up
      interval and these measurements of cortisol concentration and excretion; (3) whether these
      relationships were modified by smoking history, blood total leukocyte count, methacholine
      airway responsiveness, or other characteristics; and (4) the stability over time of serum
      cortisol concentration and urinary cortisol excretion in this aging population.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
