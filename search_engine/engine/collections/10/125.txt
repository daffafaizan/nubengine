the effect of hypothermia on circulatory reflexes in the human .total circulatory occlusion and release result in hemodynamicphenomena which provide an index of integrity of some cardiovascularreflexes . these include carotid sinus and aortic baroceptors,arteriolar vasomotor tone, and venomotor reactivity .baroceptor depression appears at a more moderate level of cooling thandoes the sympathetic, vasomotor, depression . below 28 degrees c. bothare significantly depressed, although probably not totally abolished .the level of 28 degrees c. is a critical physiological level and mayrepresent an important limit in the clinical use of hypothermia .
