      lidocaine / 2,5% prilocaine cream in reducing self-reported pain during a single laser
      procedure in the treatment of acne keloidalis nuchae and tattoo removal. Patients will be
      asked to fill in questionnaires to:

        -  assess the severity of pain experienced (VAS score) during laser treatment,

        -  evaluate whether the pain relief is adequate and,

        -  evaluate the amount of money patients would be willing to pay for the cream that
           provided the 'best' pain relief.

      One week after the visit the patient will have a telephone consultation. The patients will be
      asked if they experienced any symptoms, which will be recorded as adverse events.
