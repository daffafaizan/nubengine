      Response to insulin is frequently unpredictable during postreperfusion period with no
      consensus or guidelines on glycemic control. The primary aim of this mixed
      retrospective/prospective study is to investigate the optimal insulin dose to treat
      hyperglycemia during the postreperfusion period of liver transplantation.

      In the retrospective study, adult liver recipients (>18 years old) who underwent liver
      transplantation between 2004 and 2016 are reviewed. Delta glucose is the primary outcome
      variable defined as the difference in blood glucose levels before and after insulin
      administration. The relationship between the insulin dose and delta glucose is analyzed with
      a linear mixed effects analysis to find the optimal insulin dose to treat postreperfusion
      hyperglycemia.

      In the prospective trial, the proposed insulin dose is administered to the patient who showed
      hyperglycemia after graft reperfusion. The frequency and magnitude of glucose reduction is
      the primary outcome. The secondary outcome is the incidence and degree of hypoglycemia.
