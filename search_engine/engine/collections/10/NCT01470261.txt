    
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental
      disorders in children, affecting approximately 5% children in Europe. Methylphenidate (MPH,
      trade name ritalin) is the most-commonly prescribed medication for ADHD children; it is also
      increasingly used in ADHD adults. In 2007, the European Commission requested a referral to
      the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) under Article 31 of Directive
      2001/83/EC, as amended, for MPH because of safety concerns. The CHMP concluded that study of
      the long-term effects of MPH on growth, sexual development, neurological system, psychiatric
      states and cardiovascular system is needed. In response to the CHMP s concerns, the ADDUCE
      (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Drugs Use Chronic Effects) research team has been
      formed by a consortium of experts in the fields of ADHD, drug safety,
      neuro-psychopharmacology and cardiovascular research.

      The ADDUCE project aims to investigate the long-term adverse effects of MPH on growth,
      neurological system, psychiatric states and cardiovascular system in children and adults.

      Furthermore the ADDUCE team will develop research tools for the evaluation of adverse effects
      of MPH on cognition and motivation.
