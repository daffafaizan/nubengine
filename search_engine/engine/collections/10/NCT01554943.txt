      as asymptomatic systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 50%, asymptomatic NYHA I) or symptomatic heart
      failure NYHA class II-IV either by Echo and/or by clinical exam (LVEF < 50% and heart failure
      symptoms)] between anthracycline and non-anthracycline chemotherapy treated node-positive
      breast cancer patients in a long-term follow-up. We will define a binary status for each
      patient: no cardiac event / one or more cardiac events. Analysis of the primary endpoint will
      involve a comparison of the CMF-treated patients versus the pooled anthracycline treated
      patients (EC and HEC). If a significant difference is detected, all paired comparisons will
      also be performed for the primary endpoint (CMF versus EC, CMF versus HEC, EC versus HEC).
