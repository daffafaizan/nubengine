      management after infraumbilical surgical procedures.However, in a significant proportion of
      patients, despite good initial analgesia from a caudal block with local anesthetic, pain
      develops after the block resolves.

      Dexmedetomidine is used increasingly in pediatric anesthesia practice to prolong the duration
      of action of caudal block with a local anesthetic agent.But which route of administration of
      clonidine is the most beneficial remains unknown.

      The investigators performed prospective randomized double-blind study to compare the effects
      of caudal dexmedetomidine with intravenous dexmedetomidine on postoperative analgesia after
      caudal levobupivacaine for inguinal herniorrhaphy or orchidopexy surgery.

      90 children (ASAⅠorⅡ,aged 2-5 yr) undergoing unilateral orchiopexy or inguinal herniorrhaphy
      were included in this study. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane via a facemask, followed
      by placement of a laryngeal mask airway. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-3% in
      oxygen-air.Then,caudal block was applied. Patients were randomly assigned in three groups.
      Group Cau-DEX (n = 30): Caudal Levobupivacaine 0.25% 1ml/kg plus dexmedetomidine 1µg/kg and
      10 ml normal saline i.v.;Group IV-DEX(n = 30): Levobupivacaine 0.25% 1ml/kg and
      dexmedetomidine 1µg/kg(10 ml)i.v.;Group Placebo(n = 30): Levobupivacaine 0.25% and 10 ml
      normal saline intravenous.
