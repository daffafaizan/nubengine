      cervical cancer are eligible for our study. They will receive paclitaxel +
      cisplatin(TP)/carboplatin(TC) regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) 3 cycles followed by
      radical surgery (RS) (type III to V radical hysterectomy plus systematic pelvic
      lymphadenectomy) (arm A) or directly radical surgery (arm B). Postoperative pelvic
      radiotherapy will be started within 6 weeks after surgery if the patients have pelvic lymph
      node metastasis, parametrial involvement, deep stromal invasion or positive margin.
      Extended-field external beam therapy, delivering a dose of 4500cGy by a four-field technique,
      will be administered to patients with positive para-aortic nodes. High-dose rate
      brachytherapy will be delivered to the vaginal stump if patients have positive surgical
      margins. The primary end point is 2-years progression-free survival, The secondary end points
      is overall survival , rate of response to TP or TC regimen chemotherapy and the quality of
      life.
