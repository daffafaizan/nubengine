      hair follicle and subsequent hair loss. Despite its high prevalence, research into the
      pathogenesis and the development of innovative therapies in AA has lagged far behind other
      autoimmune diseases. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs for AA. Ruxolitinib (Incyte)
      is an intervention known to effectively treat myelofibrosis and also rheumatoid arthritis by
      modulating the inflammatory response of the interferon response pathway by inhibition of
      Jak1/Jak2. Rheumatoid arthritis shares several susceptibility genes in common with AA. All
      three diseases share the central role of the interferon-gamma response pathway, which is the
      rationale for selecting Ruxolitinib for evaluation in this clinical trial. Both systemic and
      topical Ruxolitinib have been shown to prevent the onset of AA in the C3H-HeJ animal model of
      AA, demonstrating preclinical proof-of-concept data in AA. To test the safety and efficacy of
      Ruxolitinib in patients with moderate to severe AA, we propose this open-label, single arm
      pilot study with a total of 12 patients, treated for a minimum of 3 months up to 6 months.
      Efficacy will be measured by changes in hair re-growth as determined by physical exam and
      photography, as well as by patient and physician global evaluation scores. Patients will be
      followed for another 3 months to evaluate durability of response following the treatment
      phase. Punch biopsies and peripheral blood will be obtained at baseline prior to treatment
      and then after 12 and possibly 24 weeks for immune monitoring and for molecular studies.
