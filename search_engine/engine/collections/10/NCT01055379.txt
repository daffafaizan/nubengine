    
      ACCORDO is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study conducted in
      12 Italian centres. Subjects are screened by means of the BDI-IA (cut-off 15) and randomised
      to treatment with rasagiline or placebo for 12 weeks.

      Subjects have to be on stable treatment with dopaminergic agents at least 4 weeks before
      baseline, and maintained so during the course of the study.

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether rasagiline compared to placebo improves
      depressive symptoms as evaluated by the BDI-IA total score.
