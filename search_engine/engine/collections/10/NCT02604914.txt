      in 24 subjects that will receive the ND0612L or ND0612H regimens. Part of the subjects will
      also participate in Part 2 of the study. Within each study arm, subjects will receive 3 doses
      of the investigational LD/CD solution for subcutaneous (SC) infusion. Study drug will be
      administered for 24 -30 hours as a subcutaneous (SC) infusion to the lower abdomen. Then
      subjects will be readmitted for Part 2. Part 2: This is a single centre, open-label design
      with 3 treatment arms to which 15 subjects who completed the ND0612H arm of Part 1
      ND0612-005a will be allocated in a randomised manner. Within each treatment arm subjects will
      receive 2 out of 3 doses of LCIG infused for 16 hours directly to the jejunum. Subjects will
      be discharged from the clinic 24 hours after the end of the last infusion
