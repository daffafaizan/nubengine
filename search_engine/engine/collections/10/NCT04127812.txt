      efficacy of the "Savor the Flavor" intervention. The goal of this curriculum is to teach
      children how to savor foods and slow down while eating by focusing on the sensory experience
      of eating. The intervention will also teach children attention control techniques so that
      they are better able to delay consumption of high energy, low nutrition foods, when
      appropriate.The study will also evaluate a modified version of the Eating in the Absence of
      Hunger task for use in a preschool classroom setting.
