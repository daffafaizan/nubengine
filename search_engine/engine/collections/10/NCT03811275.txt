      palsy, and having one functional arm and one poorly functioning arm by phone. Those who meet
      the basic criteria will be scheduled for an Intake Evaluation consisting of obtaining
      voluntary informed consent, complete a demographic survey, visual field testing, cognitive
      screening, perceptual testing, and an arm/hand function test. Participants who meet the
      inclusion criteria will be scheduled for a Preliminary Evaluation.

      The Preliminary Evaluation will measure the current motor control ability, perception of
      level of disability, and amount of active and passive motion in the involved arm.

      Participants will participate in the first form of intervention (randomly assigned) for three
      30 minute sessions per week for 3 weeks (total of 9 sessions) and be re-evaluated using the
      same tests conducted during the Preliminary Evaluation with the addition of the arm/hand
      function test conducted during the initial screening.

      Participants will participate in the second form of intervention for three 30 minute sessions
      per week for 3 weeks (total of 9 sessions) and be re-evaluated using the same tests conducted
      following the first intervention.

      One month after completing the second form of intervention, participants will be re-evaluated
      using the same tests used following the second intervention and will also receive a
      semi-structured interview regarding their thoughts and experiences during the study and their
      perceptions of the outcomes.
