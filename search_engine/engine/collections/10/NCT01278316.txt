      stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the current Afghanistan and Iraq wars. TBI occurs when
      a sudden force causes the brain to move, causing damage to brain cells. PTSD is an anxiety
      disorder associated with serious traumatic events. Blast explosions can lead to TBI. People
      who experience TBI as a result of a blast injury are more likely to experience PTSD than
      people who have TBI not due to blast. TBI and PTSD may be associated with memory problems in
      some patients. Because therapy for PTSD sometimes requires learning new ways to think about
      things and making new responses, being able to remember the new information being learned is
      important. It is possible that improving memory may also improve PTSD treatment.

      This is a prospective study of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom
      (Afghanistan and Iraq wars; OEF/OIF) veterans who will undergo two neuropsychological and
      psychiatric assessments prior and subsequent to a cognitive training intervention. This is a
      feasibility study to ascertain whether OEF/OIF veterans diagnosed with mild TBI and comorbid
      PTSD and who live in rural locations will adhere to the schedule demands required of a
      computer-based cognitive training protocol.
