      I. To assess the pathological complete response rate following olaparib when administered as
      neoadjuvant therapy prior to prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer
      containing homozygous or complementary deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] repair deficiency.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the rate of positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, positive
      seminal vesicles and lymph nodes at the time of prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive olaparib orally twice daily for 90 days in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. Beginning 1 day after last olaparib dose, participants undergo radical
      prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days.
