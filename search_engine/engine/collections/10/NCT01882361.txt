      Primary outcomes are:

      1) Opiate positive urine tests; 2) HIV injecting risk.

      Secondary outcomes are:

      1) Time to relapse; 2) HIV sex risk; 3) Proportion of appointments kept; 6) Psychiatric
      symptoms; 7) Opioid craving; 8) Self-reported drug use; 9) Money spent for drugs; 10)
      Employment; 11) Arrests; 12) Overall adjustment; 12) Adverse events.

      Hypotheses are that:

        1. Primary outcomes will significantly favor the 48-week Vivitrol condition;

        2. Five or more secondary outcomes will favor the 48-week condition; none will favor the
           24-week condition.
