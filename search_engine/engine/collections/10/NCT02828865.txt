      ablate tumor by fenestrating the cancer cell membrane by electric pulse. The anti-tumor
      effect does not result from thermotherapy, so is also not diminished by adjacent vessels.
      Several pre-clinical studies have already demonstrated IRE is a safe and effective treatment
      for live cancers. The system has been approved as safe by the European Union (EU) in 2008 and
      received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2010. However, there are still few
      experiences in using IRE for tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this study, the investigators will
      perform IRE for 40 inoperable patients with liver cancers adjacent to vessels who are
      suitable to receive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the investigators hospital. The
      investigators will evaluate the potential side effect and ablate effect of tumors by
      abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the investigators
      will also follow-up this patients for 2 years to evaluate the overall survival and local
      recurrence rate. The investigators will appraisal the clinical feasibility and advantage of
      the system by this study.
