      being automated, and more time is spent in front of a computer, playing video games and
      watching television.Current studies suggest that sedentary behaviour is an independent risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease. Increasing time spent in sedentary behaviour has been
      linked to all-cause mortality, markers of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.
      However, the data is mainly from cross-sectional studies and based on self-recall, limiting
      the ability to draw definitive conclusions.

      Current exercise guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity
      exercise per week. It may be difficult for some elderly people to meet these guidelines.
      Older adults with diabetes are already at a higher risk fo conditions that are affected by
      sedentary behaviour and may stand to benefit the most from intervention.

      This study proposes to study the effects of breaking up sedentary activity with moderate
      intensity exercise on multiple metabolic parameters in older adults with diabetes.
