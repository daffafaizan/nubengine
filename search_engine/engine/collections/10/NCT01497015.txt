      millions of breast cancer survivors (BCS). Evidence-based treatment is difficult because
      there has been little intervention research in this area. Memory training may be a viable
      treatment option for BCS in need. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the
      acceptability, usefulness, and preliminary efficacy of the memory training intervention from
      the Advanced Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) trial, the largest controlled trial
      of cognitive interventions in the behavioral sciences. The memory training intervention will
      be compared to attention control and no-contact control groups. Specific aims are to (1)
      evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the memory intervention in BCS and (2) establish
      preliminary efficacy of the ACTIVE memory training intervention relative to attention control
      and no-contact control conditions. Acceptability and usefulness will be assessed through
      self-report. Memory will be assessed through objective neuropsychological tests. A total of
      108 eligible BCS will be randomized to memory training, attention control, or no-contact
      control. A blinded and trained tester will perform data collection and neuropsychological
      testing at three time points: baseline prior to the intervention, immediately
      post-intervention, and 2 months post-intervention. Findings will provide information about
      the acceptability, usefulness, and preliminary efficacy of the ACTIVE memory training
      intervention on memory performance in BCS. Positive results will lead to a larger, full-scale
      study to determine efficacy of memory training interventions for BCS. Nursing interventional
      research in this area is vital to the development of evidence-based interventions to address
      memory deficits in BCS.
