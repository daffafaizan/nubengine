      Movicol or matching Placebo for two (2) weeks. Following the treatment phase, patients
      underwent a two (2)-week placebo washout period prior to crossing over to receive the
      alternative treatment e.g. those patients who took Movicol were given the matching Placebo or
      vice versa on completion of the washout period for two (2) weeks.

      On completion of the double blind treatment phase, patients were given the option to
      participate in the eight (8) week open label post study follow-up. Patients who participated
      in the post study follow-up received Movicol.
