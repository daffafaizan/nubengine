    
      The main dependent variables and instruments will be:

        1. Tensyomiography: neuromuscular properties of the vastus lateral (VL), rectus femoris
           (RF) and vastus medialis (VM) from the dominant leg.

        2. Force platform: kinetic variables in relation to a countermovement jump.

        3. Near-infrared spectrography: oxygen saturation in the VL and VM.

        4. Termographic camera: low limbs temperatura.

        5. Linear encoder: mean propulsive velocity from each repetition

        6. Electromyography: amplitude and frequency parameters related to a knee extension maximum
           voluntary contraction test.

        7. Strain gauge: maximum isometric force.
