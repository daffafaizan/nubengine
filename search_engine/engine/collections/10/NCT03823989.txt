      the current dose-escalation study will begin with a dose of 1.25 mg/kg, to be followed by an
      increase (1.5 mg/kg) in Cohort 2 and a further increase 1.8 mg/kg in Cohort 3 in the absence
      of DLTs after two treatment cycles, with an interluding 10-fraction course of radiotherapy.

      PROMITIL will be intravenously delivered on Day 1 of each of the two 21-day cycles.

      Cohort 1: The first 6 patients recruited to the study will receive 1.25 mg/kg PROMITIL.

      Cohort 2: If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are recorded by day 43 of the study, the
      second cohort of 6 patients will begin treatment at a dose level of 1.5 mg/kg PROMITIL.
      However, if 1 DLT is recorded, the second cohort of 6 patients will receive the same dose of
      1.25 mg/kg PROMITIL. If 2 DLTs are recorded in Cohort 1, the second cohort of 6 patients will
      receive 1.0 mg/kg PROMITIL.

      Cohort 3: If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are recorded by day 43 of the study of the
      first 3 patients of Cohort 2, a third cohort will enroll 6 patients to receive treatment at a
      dose level of 1.8 mg/kg PROMITIL. If none or 1 DLT is recorded, the dose of 1.8 mg/kg will be
      cleared as recommended dose for phase 2. If 2 DLT are recorded, the study will be terminated
      as soon as the 2nd DLT is recorded, and the prior dose level of 1.5 mg/kg will be cleared as
      recommended dose for phase 2
