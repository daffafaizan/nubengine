      across the US and Canada. In this study, we are comparing 10 mg of Isradipine to Placebo for
      treatment of newly diagnosed PD patients. Isradipine has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat high blood pressure but is considered investigational in this
      study, as it has not been approved for use in patients with PD.Isradipine can affect the
      function of specialized channels that are present in the types of brain cells that are
      affected in PD patient. These cells are usually responsible for making dopamine, which is
      depleted in patients with PD. Isradipine may block the damage caused by the flow of certain
      chemicals through these channels. Laboratory data has showed that Isradipine may prevent the
      development of Parkinson-like symptoms in animal studies. Isradipine has been evaluated in
      some patients with PD. The first study with isradipine controlled release (CR) in patients
      with early PD and normal blood pressure found that the drug was reasonably well tolerated and
      safe. The controlled release formulation of isradipine is not available for use and therefore
      this study is using the immediate release formulation. Eligible participants will be followed
      for up to 36 months and will be expected to complete 12 in-person visits and 4 telephone
      visits. The study visits will include clinical assessment of motor, neuropsychiatric and
      cognitive testing as well as collection of blood and urine samples. Study drug will taken
      twice daily, in the morning and in the evening with or without food. Prior to taking study
      drug, study participants will be required to take their blood pressure with a home blood
      pressure device provided to them for use in this study.
