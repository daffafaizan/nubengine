      during general anesthesia, is inserted into the trachea either through the nose or mouth. In
      children, different formulae exist to determine the approximate size of the tube according to
      age, and how far it should be advanced into the airway. Once a tracheal tube is inserted, its
      position is routinely checked to make sure both lungs are ventilated. To prevent
      displacement, the tube is taped to the lip, chin or at the nose. However, head movement could
      cause alteration of the tube position, and risk selective endobronchial intubation or
      inadvertent extubation. Knowledge of how the different tracheal tubes move with head position
      can help determine the best tube selection to reduce the risk of accidental tube advancement
      or removal, in cases where certain head positions are required for surgical access.

      The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of the formulae commonly used in our
      institution for depth of breathing tube placement, and to measure the degree of tube
      displacement on head movement with different types of tube. Testing the formulae will enable
      us to be more aware of how frequently inaccurate tube placement may occur. Knowledge of how
      the different breathing tubes move with head position can help determine the best tube
      selection to reduce the risk of the tube going in too far or coming out accidentally, for
      cases were certain head positions are required for surgery.
