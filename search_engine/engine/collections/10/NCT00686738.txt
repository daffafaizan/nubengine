      NF-kB, PET/CT, and MRS for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma
      patients. We assume that changes in plasma TGF-b1 levels, PET/CT and magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) findings during the period of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as well as the
      initial nuclear NF-kB expression status of tumor biopsy specimen either alone or in
      combination may predict a chemotherapeutic response determined by histopathologic necrosis
      fractions of tumors removed. To test this, we will obtain TGF-b1 levels, PET/CT and MRS
      findings at diagnosis and at follow-up (after first and second/third chemotherapy cycle).
      Tumor will then be removed. Chemotherapy regimen comprised of various combination of
      cisplatin, adriamycin, and high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, and etoposide. Indices derived
      from TGF-b1, PET/CT, MRS predicting greater than 90% necrosis fractions will be sought
      utilizing statistical methods.
