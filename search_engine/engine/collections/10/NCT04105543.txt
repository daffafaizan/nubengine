    
      Following informed consent, all participants will receive a dosimetry test dose of 15 mCi CLR
      131 to establish drug uptake by the tumor and enable Monte Carlo dose estimation based on CLR
      131 SPECT/CT imaging evaluation.

      Participants who have uptake of the CLR 131 dosimetry test dose at their disease site as
      determined by the study radiologist will be eligible to participate on the treatment portion
      of this clinical trial. Participants showing uptake will receive a cumulative tumor dose of
      60-70 Gy using personalized dose calculation of CLR 131 (via Monte Carlo) combined with
      external beam radiation. In this study, we are also studying a subset of up to 6 patients who
      do not uptake after the CLR 131 test dose, who will still proceed with treatment with CLR
      131.

      This clinical trial involves two cohorts of subjects: (a) dose escalation and (b) dose
      expansion. In the dose escalation phase, an mTPI-2 design, an extension of modified toxicity
      probability interval (mTPI-2), will be used to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      using cohorts of 4 participants and up to 3 dose levels of CLR 131. Participants in the dose
      escalation phase will receive 2 doses of CLR 131 with the first dose on day 1 followed by the
      second dose on day 8.

      Treatment with CLR 131 on the dose escalation cohort will begin at dose level 1 (15.6
      mCi/m2). Participants at dose level 1 will receive an intravenous infusion of CLR 131 at 15.6
      mCi/m2 on day 1 followed by a second dose on day 8. Participants at dose level 2 will receive
      an intravenous infusion of CLR 131 at 18.75 mCi/m2 on day 1 followed by a second dose on day
      8.

      Once the MTD is determined by the dose escalation phase, participants will be enrolled on the
      dose expansion cohort. Participants on the dose expansion cohort will receive 2 doses of CLR
      131 with the first dose on day 1 followed by the second dose on day 8, with the dose
      determined by the dose escalation phase.

      SPECT/CT imaging will be performed on days 2, 3, 4-6, and 7-8 of the treatment period to
      visualize and quantitate the biodistribution of CLR 131. Based on these SPECT/CT imaging
      scans, the Bednarz lab will utilize the Monte Carlo method to predict absorbed dose of CLR
      131 to tumors and normal structures.

      All participants will start thyroid-protection medication the day prior to the CLR 131
      dosimetry test dose and will continue to take thyroid protection medication for 14 days after
      the last CLR 131 dose.

      Based on the calculated absorbed dose of CLR 131 to the specific targeted tissue, the
      participant will undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to complete the designated
      radiation dose outlined in the re-irradiation plan, as per standard of care. Prior to CLR 131
      administration and at 3 and 6 months post EBRT, participants will be assessed for changes to
      swallow function. Prior to CLR 131 administration and at 3, 6 and 12 months post EBRT,
      quality of life measures and salivary characteristics will be assessed. The investigators
      anticipate the total study (baseline, CLR 131 administration, EBRT and 3, 6, 12 and 24 month
      follow up assessments) to take 27 months per participant.
