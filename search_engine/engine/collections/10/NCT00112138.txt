      replacement therapy and those who prefer an alternative treatment, there is presently no
      standard treatment for hot flashes. Women and health care providers have few options other
      than hormone replacement therapy as evidenced-based trials of alternatives have not shown
      many effective options. Many non-hormonal agents have been studied including antidepressants,
      antihypertensives, vitamin E, soy products, black cohosh, acupuncture, and belladonna and
      ergotamine combinations. Preliminary studies using the antiseizure medication, gabapentin
      (Neurontin), has demonstrated a substantial reduction in hot flashes. This agent may provide
      an effective treatment for hot flashes in postmenopausal women.
