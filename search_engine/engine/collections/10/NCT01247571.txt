      I. To assess the activity of pazopanib in patients with persistent or recurrent
      carcinosarcoma of the uterus as measured by the proportion of patients who survive
      progression-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective
      tumor response (complete or partial).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0).

      II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
