      brain stem stroke will be enrolled. Both 24 hemispheric and 24 brain stem stroke patients
      will be divided into 3 groups. General swallowing therapy, oropharyngeal neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation (NMES), and combined general and NMES therapies will be randomly
      provided for the 3 groups. Each patient will receive clinical assessment of food oral intake
      scale, functional dysphagia scale of videofluoroscopy, and brain neuroactivity in fMRI.

      The investigators hope to find the benefit of the swallowing therapies both in clinical
      swallowing function and in brain functional neuroactivity/reorganization after acute stroke.
      While comparing the 3 swallowing therapies, different functional neuroactivity may be
      facilitated by different swallowing therapies. Finally, the investigators could also find out
      the most effective swallowing therapy among the 3 therapies in acute stroke patients with
      dysphagia according to the findings of videofluoroscopy and fMRI.
