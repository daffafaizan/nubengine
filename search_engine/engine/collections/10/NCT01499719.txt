      and reviewed by research personnel (T.L.S, J.C.) within the Oregon Sinus Center, located
      within the Center for Health and Healing on the South Waterfront Campus of OHSU, under the
      direction of Timothy L. Smith, MD, MPH (PI). The first 100 surgical cases will be evaluated
      as "pre-intervention" cases by research personnel while the second 100 surgical cases will be
      evaluated as "post-intervention" cases after the introduction and discussion of the surgical
      checklist to operating room staff.
