      incidence ranges from 1 loop in 21% to 3 loops in 0.2%. In this study we wish to assessed the
      practice of severing the cord, which was encircled once around the neck of the fetus, after
      delivery of the anterior shoulder and prior to extraction of the body. The study and the
      control groups will include 30 women, each one. After diagnosis of cord around the neck
      during labor by ultrasound, the women will inter a randomization process. After delivery of
      the head, it will be cut intentionally in the study group and left intact in the control
      group. Neonatal outcome will be assessed.
