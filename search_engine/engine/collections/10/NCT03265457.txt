      thickness, and transparency.

      In patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome , quantitative and qualitative morphological
      changes of the corneal endothelium have been demonstrated in specular and electron
      microscopic studies.

      Specular microscopy is a non-invasive technique to access the structure and function of the
      corneal endothelium.

      Our research question is to study Endothelial cell count in patients with pseudoexfoliation
      syndrome & compare it to age matched group.
