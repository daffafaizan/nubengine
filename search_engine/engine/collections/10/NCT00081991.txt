      called Dynamic Light Scattering Device (DLS), has recently been developed. Preliminary
      studies have shown its potential to detect the earliest changes in cataract, at the stage
      where anti-cataract treatment would be most effective in reversing, delaying or preventing
      cataracts. A new miniaturized version of this device has been developed by NASA using lower
      energy lasers, and under a NASA-NEI Inter Agency Agreement, has been successfully developed
      into a clinical device at the NEI. We recently conducted pilot studies to evaluate the
      usefulness and reproducibility of this instrument for quantitating human lens changes, and
      found good reproducibility. We also derived a useful parameter to use with this new
      technique, the log mean particle size, derived from particle size distribution data.
      Preliminary studies have also shown that the NASA-NEI DLS device can be used to detect and
      monitor molecular changes in early cataract formation as well as in normal aging. We
      therefore propose to conduct a larger cross sectional clinical study to detect and monitor
      molecular changes in the lens in early cataract formation and in normal aging.
