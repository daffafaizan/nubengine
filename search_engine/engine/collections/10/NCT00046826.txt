        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with hormone-refractory prostate
           cancer treated with docetaxel, estramustine, and thalidomide.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen for pain control in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine on days 1-3 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2
      for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients also receive oral thalidomide once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing for 1
      year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
