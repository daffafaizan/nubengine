    
      Aim:

      Primary objective:To evaluate the efficiency and safety of low dose intracoronary
      unfractioned heparin (UFH) on elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      Secondary objective:

        -  To evaluate the effect of low dose intracoronary UFH on myocardial ischemia after PCI.

        -  To evaluate the effect of low dose intracoronary UFH on bleeding complications after
           PCI.

        -  To evaluate the cost-effectivity of low dose intracoronary UFH on elective PCI

      Study central:

        -  Bursa Postgraduate Hospital, Cardiology Clinic

      Study population:

        -  we planned to enrol 200 patients.

        -  Patients will randomise in two groups (control group:100 patients, study group:100
           patients)

      Study works:-Write case report form for all patients

        -  Control for inclusion criteria

        -  Demographic data (age, gender)

        -  Height, weight, BMI and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

        -  Risk factors

        -  laboratory data (biochemical and hematologic)

        -  Medication history

        -  Echocardiographic data

        -  Angiographic data

        -  Procedure time

        -  PCI data(vessel diameter, stent diameter, lesion and stent length, performed
           percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or not, etc)

        -  Before and after procedure (activated clotting time) ACT value

        -  Before and after procedure troponin I (TnI) and Creatine kinase MB (CKMB) levels

        -  Note complication (MACE, bleeding, hematoma etc)

        -  Note femoral compression time.

           4 weeks later note the first control data.

      Six months later note the second control data.
