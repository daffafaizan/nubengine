      using evening amber glasses to block evening light combined with a stable wake time in
      adolescents (14-17 years) with DSWPD (International Classification of Sleep Disorders
      [ICSD-3] criteria).3 After 1 week of baseline measurements, subjects will be instructed to
      wear glasses (which allow 14% entry of ambient light exposure) starting 7 h before
      individually calculated midsleep time measured during the preceding week. This corresponds to
      the time when adolescents are most sensitive to phase delaying light according to Co-I
      Crowley's recently published phase response curve (PRC) to light in adolescents (Figure 1).22
      This "amber glasses + stable wake time" group will be compared to a control group: adolescent
      DSWPD patients who will wear clear-lensed glasses (which allow 100% of ambient light to reach
      the eyes, otherwise identical in appearance) in the evening at the same times as the
      alternate group, but without scheduled wake times. Outcome measures will include TST and
      sleep onset time derived from wrist actigraphy, daytime subjective sleepiness, salivary DLMO,
      and assessments of acceptance and compliance.
