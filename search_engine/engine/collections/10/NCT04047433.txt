      related to POP has been reported in biochemical and molecular studies. OASIS are considered a
      severe complication of vaginal delivery that may lead to a great deal of morbidity. Familial
      history is known as a risk factor for OASIS. Currently, there is no established genetic link
      between connective tissue components and OASIS. Therefore, the investigators assume that
      studying the genetic predisposition factors of women who experience OASIS, might generate a
      stronger tool to predict severe occurrence of vaginal laceration. It may also help to consult
      women before vaginal delivery about the risk of OASIS.

      The aim of this study is to find an association between genetic variation and increased risk
      for OASIS.
