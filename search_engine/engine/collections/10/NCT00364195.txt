    
      Primary Objective:

      1. To evaluate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene (5.3 mg/kg) with
      a standard dose of docetaxel (100 mg/m2) alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of docetaxel
      compared to the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel when given alone.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To correlate plasma tesmilifene levels during and following the infusion with the acute
           tesmilifene-related adverse events observed during and after the infusion.

        2. To collect safety information for tesmilifene when administered in combination with
           docetaxel.

        3. To evaluate response rate, duration of response and overall survival in metastatic
           breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel plus tesmilifene.
