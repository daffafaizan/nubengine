      needs but there is a paucity of such information of caregivers in Singapore. As this study is
      exploratory, no a priori hylothesis has been made. The theoretical framework guiding this
      research is Fulfillment Theory in which the existence and perception of needs and need
      fulfillment are hypothesized to be antecedents to the experience of satisfaction about care.

      A cross-sectional questionnaire methodology will be used to answer the research questions.
      Caregivers in this study are defined as: a family member who lends physical, emotional or
      other support to someone at any time during the cancer journey. A power calculation was not
      done, instead the sample size of 510 was based on what may be practically achievable and
      feasible for the duration of the short-term quantitative study. Descriptive statistics will
      be used to characterize the distribution of socio-demographic characteristics and
      caregiver-related information. Regression analysis will be used to evaluate difference in
      overall and domain specific needs across selected characteristics. Problems identified by
      caregivers will be dichotomized as present or absent and chi-square tests will be used to
      evaluate associations with selected characteristics.
