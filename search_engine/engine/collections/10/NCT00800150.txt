    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of intensity-modulated total marrow and lymph
           node irradiation (TMLI) using helical tomotherapy in combination with a
           reduced-intensity preparative regimen comprising fludarabine phosphate and melphalan in
           patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for advanced,
           relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies.

        -  To describe the toxicities of escalating doses of TMLI in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the frequency of clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To describe the frequency of primary and secondary engraftment failure in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  To describe the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  To describe the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  To describe the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To describe the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of intensity-modulated total marrow and lymph node
      irradiation (TMLI).

        -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy: Patients undergo TMLI to skeletal bone/marrow,
           major lymph node chains, spleen, and liver using helical tomotherapy twice daily on days
           -6 to -3.

        -  Reduced-intensity preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days
           -6 to -2 and melphalan IV on day -1.

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): Patients undergo allogeneic HSCT on day
           0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
