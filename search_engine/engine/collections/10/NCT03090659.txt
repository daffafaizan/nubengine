      for multiple myeloma often cause remissions, but nearly all patients eventually relapse and
      die, an clear unmet clinical needs. As early as mid-2014, the investigators have started to
      develop a series of proprietary CAR-T products to target B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a
      cell surface molecule which the investigator believes to be a desirable target antigen for
      multiple myeloma. All pre-clinical data and CMC data for LCAR-B38M CAR-T cell technology has
      been established by mid-2015 and a phase I proof-of-concept clinical trial has been planned
      since then.
