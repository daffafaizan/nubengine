      slowly progressing acute myeloid leukemia with limited bone marrow blastosis either in first
      relapse after autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, or with
      more advanced disease (i.e., refractory to chemotherapy regimens). II. Characterize the acute
      side effects of IL-2 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      into two categories of prior failed treatments (first relapse after autologous bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation vs first or subsequent relapse either refractory
      to or not eligible for further conventional treatment). Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is administered
      as a continuous intravenous infusion on 5 consecutive days at daily escalating doses for the
      first cycle. When the individual maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined, 3 more
      cycles are given at the MTD. There are 3 days of rest between each treatment cycle. After the
      induction phase, maintenance cycles of IL-2 are administered starting 4 weeks after the last
      induction treatment. Maintenance cycles of IL-2 are administered subcutaneously on 5
      consecutive days every 4 weeks for 2 years, and subsequently every other month for a maximum
      of 3 years. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a
      maximum of 5 years. Patients are followed every 4 weeks during the first 2 years, then every
      8 weeks during the next 3 years or until documented progression, and then every 3 months
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 86 (57 transplanted; 29 patients nontransplanted) patients
      will be accrued into this study within 2 years.
