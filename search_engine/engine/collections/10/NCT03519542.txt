      Identificaction of novel biomarkers is required to select those patients who would most
      benefit from a particular therapeutic strategy:

      C-Met is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in cellular growth and vascular develoment, also
      identify as a proto-oncogene.

      Chemiokines: an increase in pro-angiogenic chemokines such as IL-6 & IL-8 has been also
      suggested as a tumor dependent possible mechanism influencing invasion and metastasis after
      anti-VEGF therapy.

      PBRM1 (BAF 180) mutation: Second major involved gene in clear cell RCC with truncating
      mutations in 41% (92/227) of cases. Mutations appear to inactive a protein that plays role in
      remodeling the structure of genetic material.PBRM1 mutations could be (partially) involved in
      about 40% of clear cell RCC. PBRM1 may affect the processes of cell divsion in renal cells
      and could consequently be another target for new drugs.
