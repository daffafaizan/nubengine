      assigned into probiotic group and control group. Patients in probiotic group receive
      probiotic(Micro V Probiotics) combined UDCA for 6 months and then continue to take UDCA
      alone. Patients in control group continue to take UDCA alone. Biochemical indicators,
      immunological indicators, liver stiffness, and ultrasound of the two groups of patients were
      collected. GLOBE and UK-PBC scoring system are used to assesse prognosis.The feces and serum
      of all patients are collected to observe the differences in fecal microbial polymorphisms in
      the two groups of patients. Metabolomics are used to study the differences in the bile acids
      and short chain fatty acid metabolites of the serum and feces of the two groups of PBC
      patients.
