    
      Study HS-CA102N-101 is a phase 1, two part (dose escalation, dose expansion), multicenter,
      non-randomized, open-label, multiple dose, first-in-human study of CA102N monotherapy and of
      CA102N combined with trifluridine/tipiracil (LONSURF) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      Part 1 (dose escalation) will determine the safety and tolerability of three dose levels of
      CA102N as monotherapy and the safety, tolerability and preliminary recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) of CA102N in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (LONSURF) in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Part 2 (dose expansion) will further investigate the safety and tolerability of the
      combination of CA102N and trifluridine/tipiracil (LONSURF) at the preliminary RP2D in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer that has relapsed after or is
      refractory to oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) biological therapy, and if RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer,
      an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy..

      Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated in Parts 1 and 2 of the study as an exploratory
      endpoint.
