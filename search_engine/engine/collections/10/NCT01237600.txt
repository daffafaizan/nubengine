      chemical burn or Stevens-Johnson syndrome result in corneal epithelial defect, corneal
      vascularization, corneal conjunctivalization and loss of transparency. Corneal limbal stem
      cell transplantation has been demonstrated to improve the outcome of ocular surface
      reconstruction. However, the conventional management of allograft limbal transplantation
      generally has unsatisfactory outcome because of high risk of rejection and requires long-life
      immunosuppressive medications.
