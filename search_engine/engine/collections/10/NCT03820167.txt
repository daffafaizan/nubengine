      of PCOS patients undergoing IVF (no= 45) and Group B: frozen samples of PCOS patients
      undergoing IVF (no= 45). Morphologically good embryos will be cultured in a culture dish and
      the supernatants will be collected freshly from culture system at day 3 and stored at -20 ̊ c
      until being tested. Morphologically good embryos scheduled for freezing will be cryopreserved
      for less than one year and thawed, the supernatant will be collected and stored at -20 ̊ c
      until being tested. Quantification of mtDNA in fresh and frozen culture media using qPCR
      technique.The template DNA prepared and the dilution standards prepared will be used for qPCR
      to determine the amount of MtDNA and nuclear DNA in the sample using QuantiTect SYBR Green
      PCR Kit (Qiagen)
