      heart surgery in SMN1+/- genotype population. Real-time PCR is used to detect copy number
      variations in the peripheral blood SMN gene on 1206 patients with heart surgery. This study
      also aims to analysis the effect of SMN1+/- genotype on postoperative AKI and the development
      of chronic kidney disease, as well as dose-compensating effect of different copy number of
      SMN2 gene on SMN1 +/- genotype.
