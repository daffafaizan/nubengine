        -  To evaluate the association between the 21-gene Recurrence Score and risk of
           local-regional recurrence (LRR) in node-positive, estrogen receptor- (ER) positive (+)
           patients treated with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride (AC) with or
           without paclitaxel in the NSABP-B-28 trial.

        -  To evaluate the potential for combining the 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) with
           traditional clinico-pathologic factors in order to derive an improved algorithm for
           prediction of LRR risk and in order to identify subgroups of ER-positive patients with
           1-3 or 4 or more positive nodes who do/do not need post mastectomy chest wall
           radiotherapy (XRT) or regional nodal XRT (irrespective of surgical procedure).

        -  To evaluate whether the 21-gene RS predicts benefit from adding paclitaxel to AC
           chemotherapy in reducing risk of LRR, and improving disease-free survival (DFS) and
           overall survival (OS) in node-positive, ER-positive patients from NSABP-B-28.

      OUTLINE: RNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression
      profile by Ribogreen assay and RT-PCR. Results are then compared and analyzed with each
      patient clinical-pathologic factors, including tumor size, patient age, number of positive
      nodes (1-3, 4+), tumor grade, and surgery type (mastectomy or lumpectomy).
