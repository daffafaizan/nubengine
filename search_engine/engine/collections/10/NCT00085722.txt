      Prolotherapy (PrT) is an injection-based therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain in which an
      irritant solution is injected at painful ligaments and tendons to produce stronger connective
      tissue and decrease pain. Although limited studies suggest PrT is effective may be effective
      for low back pain, its use has not been rigorously studied in human clinical trials for
      osteoarthritis.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments:
      standard PrT, injections with a saline placebo, or a pamphlet with recommendations for home
      knee physical therapy. Injections will be given at Weeks 1, 5, and 9; injection group
      subjects will have the option to receive an additional 2 sets of injections. All participants
      will be assessed for a total of 1 year. A set of disease-specific and general quality-of-life
      questionnaires will be used to assess participants' outcomes . A randomized subset of
      participants (N=38)will receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)of the knee at baseline and
      52 weeks. At study completion, participants who did not receive PrT will have the option to
      receive up to five sessions of PrT at no cost. Data will be collected for this group (minus
      MRI) and will be analyzed separately. Enrollment is limited to residents of Southern
      Wisconsin.
