      adherence among hypertensive patients in the community. A 2-arm parallel randomized control
      trial will be conducted. 148 participants will be recruited and divided into control and
      intervention group in a ration of 1:1. The intervention group will receive the theory-guided
      educational program, while the control group will receive the usual care. The study will last
      for 12 weeks. Data will be collected at baseline, week 8 and week 12. SPSS and generalized
      estimating equations model will be employed for data analysis. The results will inform
      community healthcare professionals about the effective way for health promotion, to enhance
