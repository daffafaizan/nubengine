      T-lymphocytes (EBVSTs) in the lab. Investigators will make the cells by first growing a
      special type of cells called dendritic cells (DCs) or monocytes to stimulate the T cells.
      Then they will add specially produced mixtures of proteins that included the LMP, EBNA1, and
      BARF proteins. These are used to stimulate T cells. As the T cells grow, investigators add
      some of the subject's cells expressing these proteins to stimulate them. They also add a cell
      called K562 that has had new genes put inside it so it expresses proteins that stimulate the
      immune system to encourage the T cells to grow. This stimulation trains the EBVSTs to kill
      cells with EBV proteins on their surface. These cells will be grown and frozen.

      The cells grown in the lab will be thawed and injected into the subject's vein over 2-10
      minutes. Initially, one dose of the drug nivolumab is given one day before the EBVST cells
      are infused (on day 0) and then every 2 weeks for a total of four doses of nivolumab.
      Subjects will receive two infusions of the EBVST cells. The first infusion will be given on
      Day 1 and a second infusion of T cells on Day 15.

      If eligible, subjects may receive up to three additional doses of the T cells 6-12 weeks
      apart and each additional T cell infusion would be preceded by one dose of nivolumab a day
      prior.

      Subjects will have medical and blood tests at predetermined time points. Investigators will
      follow subjects closely after treatment for any side effects for at least for 1 year after
      the subject's last infusion.
