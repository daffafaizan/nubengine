      disorder and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Chronic PTSD is often treated with
      antidepressants, in fact there are only two FDA-approved treatments for PTSD. Yet many
      chronic PTSD patients, especially male combat veterans, have a limited response to
      antidepressant treatment (Baker et al, 1995; Ca√±ive et al, 1998; Hertzsberg et al 2000) and
      new pharmacotherapies should be investigated.
