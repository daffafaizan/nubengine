      scan and intraoperative measurements of the pancreas parenchyma to predict the onset of
      diabetes mellitus after a pancreatectomy. The investigators will also monitor patients with
      pre-existing diabetes to see if their diabetes worsens or improves. Patients will be followed
      up to one year to track their diabetes status, postoperative outcomes and quality of life.
