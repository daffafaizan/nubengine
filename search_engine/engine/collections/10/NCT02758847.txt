      could not be clearly linked to the use of antiproliferative agents, the findings of
      paclitaxel crystals downstream of the treated lesions, although in small amounts, has raised
      concerns about the safety of such therapy in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and
      tissue loss.

      These concerns, however, may not translate to patients with femoropopliteal occlusive disease
      as the amount of paclitaxel reaching the foot may be even smaller after being filtered by the
      calf musculature.

      Since the use of DCB angioplasty in the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and popliteal has
      been shown to deliver significantly more durable outcomes compared to standard angioplasty
      alone, with reported primary patency rates of almost 90% at one year, this therapy may even
      be more needed in patients with tissue loss where prolonged patency is essential for wound
      healing.
