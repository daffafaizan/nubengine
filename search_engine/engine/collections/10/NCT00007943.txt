        -  Determine the response rate in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with
           gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
