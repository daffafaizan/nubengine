      and requires considerable resources, including a very high cost is likely to increase with
      new antivirals.

      A precise knowledge of the situation in each hospital would facilitate adequate provision of
      personal and material resources needed to adequately address this disease in each center and
      in the Community as a whole. Because all or the vast majority of patients coinfected HIV /
      HCV are staffed by specialists who are part of Hepavir group and / or Sociedad Andaluza de
      Enfermedades Infecciosas (SAEI), they are ideal for carrying out this study.
