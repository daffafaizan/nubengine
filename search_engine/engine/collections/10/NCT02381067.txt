      promoting bone growth and fusion rate when used in cervical fusion in patients with one, two
      or three-level diseases of the cervical spine. Sixty subjects will participate in the study
      at a single clinical site. Participants will be at least 21 years of age. All subjects will
      have been established with cervical spine disease at one, two or three levels of the cervical
      spine that requires cervical interbody fusion per the opinion of the treating surgeon. The
      primary objective is to demonstrate that NuCel® is comparable to autograft bone graft in
      producing a successful, contiguous fusion at 6 months ±4 weeks post-operative when used in
      cervical fusion surgery. Success based on findings of cervical CT scan and plain radiographs.
      Additionally, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI) and patient satisfaction
      will be used as secondary outcome measures.
