      montelukast in addition to standard therapy will have at least 12% greater FEV1 improvement
      in three hours than those receiving standard therapy alone.

      In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, we enrolled emergency patients aged
      6-14 years with moderate acute asthma exacerbations (initial PEFR 40-70% predicted). Subjects
      received montelukast 5-mg or placebo orally then standard therapy consisting of weight-based
      doses of nebulized albuterol, nebulized ipratropium bromide, and oral corticosteroids. We
      measured FEV1 before study medication administration and hourly for three hours.

      We conducted a planned an interim analysis after approximately one-half of the estimated
      sample had been enrolled.
