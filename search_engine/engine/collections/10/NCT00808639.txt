           treatment cycle lasts three weeks. The infusion of methotrexate will take place on the
           first day of each cycle. Infusions of vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin will take
           place on the second day and an injection of pegfilgrastim will be given on the third
           day.

        -  During all treatment cycles participants will have a physical exam and will be asked
           questions about their general health and any problems they might be having and any
           medications they may be taking.

        -  Following completion of study treatment, but before surgery, participants will have an
           assessment of their tumor by CT scan of the chest and and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis.

        -  Following the participants surgery, we would like to keep track of their medical
           condition indefinitely, or until this study is officially completed. We would like to do
           this by calling the participants on the telephone once a year to see how they are doing.
