      crucial points for the appropriate treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.

      In all patients an accurate pre-treatment staging was performed, including: physical
      examination, complete blood tests and tumor markers, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with
      fine needle aspiration biopsy, multilayer CT scan, PET-CT (positron emission computed
      tomography) with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) and laparoscopy with peritoneal
      washing. Jaundiced patients before or during treatment underwent endoscopic biliary stenting.

      Patients with the evidence of metastatic disease were excluded, and thus only a small number
      of patients was consequently enrolled with this neoadjuvant approach.

      The induction phase of the treatment plan was designed to administer gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq
      and oxaliplatin 100 mg/mq every 14 days for four doses.

      In the combined phase of the treatment all patients underwent simulation by using a Siemens
      16-CT simulator (Siemens Medical System). Radiotherapy target volumes were established by CT
      scan and PET-CT scan.

      Four weeks after the completion of radiochemotherapy, restaging, consisting of clinical
      examination, laboratory test, tumor markers, CT scan and PET-CT scan, was performed. Tumor
      response was defined in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) definition
      through CT scan and PET-CT scan. Surgery was considered in patients whose tumors were
      technically resectable.

      After resection, patients were evaluated every three months by means of a standard
      surveillance protocol that included history and physical examination, cross-sectional imaging
      and measurement of serum markers, and the intervals were extended to six months after two
      years
