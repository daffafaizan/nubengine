    
      Objective:

      To compare the effect of a sevoflurane based anaesthesia versus a propofol based anaesthesia
      on the incidence of delayed graft function in recipients of DCD and DBD donor kidneys.

      Study design:

      Prospective randomized controlled European multicentre clinical trial with two parallel
      groups

      Study population:

      Patients â‰¥18 years scheduled for kidney transplantation with a kidney from a DBD or DCD donor

      Intervention:

      Patients will be included and randomised to one of the following groups:

      Group 1 PROP (control): Propofol: a propofol-remifentanil based anaesthesia. Group 2 SEVO
      (intervention): Sevoflurane: a sevoflurane-remifentanil based anaesthesia.

      Main study parameters:

      DGF defined as need of dialysis the first week after transplantation excluding one time
      dialysis for hyperkalemia Acute rejection episodes within the first year after
      transplantation Graft and patient survival GFR at 3 and 12 months PNF defined as a permanent
      lack of function of the allograft Length of hospital stay Postoperative complications of all
      kind kidney biomarkers (urine/plasma) mechanisms of protection/immunomodulation with
      anestheticanaesthetic agents
