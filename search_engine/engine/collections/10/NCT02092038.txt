    
      Prior to any definitive treatment and after enrollment, the patient will undergo stereotactic
      biopsy of the lesion to confirm the histology of the lesion and to determine methylated
      methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) status. Standard image-guided stereotactic technique
      will be used. Patients will be treated with conformal radiation therapy. Temozolomide will be
      given from the day prior to radiation therapy through the last day of radiation therapy. 4-6
      weeks after radiation therapy the patient will undergo craniotomy and maximal safe resection.
      Temozolomide will continue beginning 4 weeks after surgery.

      Imaging:

      MRI within 2 weeks prior to the start of the protocol. MRI at 4 weeks after chemoradiation
      therapy and prior to surgery. MRI within 48 hours after surgery.

      MRI after every 2 cycles of chemotherapy and then every 2 months until progression, up to 2
      years.
