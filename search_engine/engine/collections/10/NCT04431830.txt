      symptom. In this population, higher pain levels often predict worse physical, emotional, and
      existential/spiritual well-being. Psychosocial interventions show promise for improving
      cancer-related pain; however, no interventions address existential concerns (e.g., a loss of
      meaning in life) that are common among those facing pain from advanced illness. To address
      this need, an intervention called Meaning-Centered Pain Coping Skills Training (MCPC) was
      developed. MCPC seeks to teach patients cognitive and behavioral skills for managing pain
      (e.g., guided imagery) in order to help them engage with what gives their life a sense of
      meaning, purpose, and significance.

      This pilot study is being conducted to prepare for a large-scale clinical trial that will
      test the efficacy of MCPC for improving patients' pain and pain-related outcomes.
