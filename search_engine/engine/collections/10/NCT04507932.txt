      and Crohn's disease(CD).CD is an autoimmune condition resulting in chronic gut inflammation
      that can be complicated by intestinal fibrosis and stricture formation. Ulcerative colitis is
      characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation limited to the mucosal layer of the
      colon. It commonly involves the rectum and may extend in a proximal and continuous fashion to
      involve other parts of the colon. Studies identified FAP to be overexpressed in uninflamed
      strictures compared with nonstrictured colonic regions in biopsies taken from Crohn's disease
      patients. But preliminary studies showed FAP was not overexpressed in colonic biopsies taken
      from healthy individuals or individuals with ulcerative colitis.68Ga-FAPI has been developed
      as a tumor-targeting agent as fibroblast activation protein is overexpressed in
      cancer-associated fibroblasts and inflammation. Recently we have published an article of the
      application of 68Ga-FAPI in IgG4-related disease which showed it was more sensitive than FDG
      in detecting a certain type of inflammations. Thus this prospective study is going to
      investigate whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be superior for diagnosis, therapy response
      assessment and follow-up of IBD than 18F-FDG PET/CT.
