    
      Objective: To investigate the neurocircuitry cognitive and affective processing relevant to
      nicotine addiction using repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). Specifically,
      we will examine insula neurocircuitry using a unilateral H-coil to deliver rTMS to the Right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R DLPFC) and insula. We will examine the effect of various
      stimulation parameters on behavior as well as on task based activation and resting state
      functional connectivity (rsFC) during fMRI scanning.

      Study population: Up to 60 healthy adults who are non-smokers will be enrolled to achieve 28
      completers.

      Design: Within subject design with each subject completing 4 sessions: rTMS at two different
      stimulation frequencies and 2 sham sessions.

      Outcome measures: Behavior on a decision making task and task based and resting state blood
      oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation in neural circuits relevant to nicotine addiction
      during fMRI scanning.
