        -  To analyze the effects of changes in levels of dietary folate intake on damage to DNA
           and repair capacity, mRNA expression, and DNA uracil incorporation in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cell and rectal biopsy cell samples from patients at increased risk for
           developing colorectal neoplasia.

      OUTLINE: Patients are enrolled into 1 of 2 intervention groups..

        -  Group I (folate depletion [in-patient]): Patients consume a weight-maintaining, average
           folate diet with no high folate-containing foods for 8 weeks. Patients are then admitted
           to The Rockefeller University Hospital and placed on a weight-maintaining, low-folate
           diet for 12 weeks. During the last 4 weeks of the in-patient period, patients receive
           oral folic acid supplementation once daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Group II (folate supplementation [out-patient]): Patients consume a weight-maintaining,
           average folate diet with no high folate-containing foods for 16 weeks as an out-patient.
           After the first 8 weeks of the diet, patients also receive oral folic acid
           supplementation once daily for 8 weeks.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for biomarker correlative studies.
      Samples are analyzed for serum and red cell folate and homocystine levels to assess folate
      depletion; methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism to test for inherited
      alterations of folate metabolism; serum and plasma biomarkers; and DNA studies. Patients also
      undergo tissue sample collection by sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy periodically. Tissue
      samples are assessed for mucosal folate concentration and mucosal folic acid metabolites; DNA
      methylation; and gene assays by microarray analysis.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
