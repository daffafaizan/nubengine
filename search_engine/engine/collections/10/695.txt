the use and mode of action of ethacrynic acidin nephrogenic diabetes insipidusthe use of diuretic agents in the treatmentof nephrogenic diabetes insipidus had been re-ported to result in decreased urine volumeand decreased clearance of free water.  astudy of the use of ethacrynic acid, a potentsaluretic agent, was instituted in patientswith nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in anattempt to achieve a significant antidiureticresponse while allowing a liberal sodium diet.intravenous ethacrynic acid resulted in de-creased urine volume, decreased clearance offree water and decreased rpf and gfr.prolonged oral administration of ethacrynicacid promoted a significant antidiuretic re-sponse when the daily sodium intake waslimited to 60 meq.  the effect of ethacrynicacid on renal function, potassium and chlo-ride excretion, and uric acid metabolism arediscussed.
