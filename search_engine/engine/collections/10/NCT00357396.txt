    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate disease-free and overall survival of patients with high-risk tumors of the
           Ewing's family treated with unmodified T-cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem
           cell transplantation after cytoreduction comprising busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa.

        -  Determine the regimen-related morbidity and mortality in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the biologic response of minimal residual disease in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

        -  Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 2 hours every 6
           hours on days -8 to -6, melphalan IV over 20 minutes on days -5 to -3, and thiotepa IV
           over 4 hours on day -2.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow
           or T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive treatment according to
           institutional guidelines and are given treatment against infection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 3 years.
