    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison study in
      subjects with mild to moderate AD. Following a 2-week screening period, subjects will be
      randomly assigned into one of four treatment arms. Placebo or HL-009 study treatments will be
      administrated to subjects twice daily for 8 consecutive weeks. After the randomization at
      Week 0 (Visit 2), subjects will visit their respective trial sites at Weeks 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6,
      8, and 10 (Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). All study drugs will be in identical laminated
      tubes to preserve double-blinding of the study.
