    
      This single-center prospective pre-post interventional study was conducted between January
      2014 and April 2018 with 65 women (44 SUI, 21 MUI). Quality of life was evaluated with the
      Incontinence Quality of Life Scale (I-QoL) and the lower urinary tract symptoms of women were
      evaluated with the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Female Lower
      Urinary Tract Symptoms Modules (ICIQ-FLUTS). Incontinence status was assessed via the Stamey
      Incontinence Grade scale. Patients with MUI also were evaluated using the Urinary Distress
      Inventory-6 (UDI-6). The need for additional treatment (re-injection, other surgical
      approaches, etc.) was recorded.

      Participants were followed up to 24 months after intervention. All outcomes of interest and
      complications were evaluated/recorded at six preplanned visits (postoperative 1st, 3rd, 6th,
      12th, 18th, 24th months).
