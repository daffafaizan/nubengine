    
      Three different doses of GnRH agonist (0.1mg, 0.2mg or 0.4 mg) will be used randomly to
      trigger final oocyte maturation. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of mature
      oocytes retrieved.

      Secondary outcomes will include: number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte recovery rate (number of
      oocytes retrieved/ number of follicles >11mm in diameter on the day of triggering),
      fertilization rates and OHSS occurrence.

      Serum LH, FSH, E2, PRG levels will be assessed at 8-36 hours following agonist administration
      and on days 3-4-7-10 after triggering final oocyte maturation.
