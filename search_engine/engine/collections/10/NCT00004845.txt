      along with a number of epidemiological studies suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) may slow the rate of cognitive deterioration. We have selected two such drugs
      for a therapeutic trial: rofecoxib and naproxen. The trial employs a double-blind parallel
      design with three primary treatment groups: rofecoxib, naproxen and placebo. A total of 320
      patients will be enrolled in the trial and randomized to the three groups. Stable use of
      cholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, low dose aspirin, and vitamin E will be allowed.
      Patients with inflammatory diseases that might respond to the study medications will be
      excluded.

      The primary outcome measure will be the one year change in the cognitive subscale of the
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAScog). The attainment of significant endpoints will
      be examined as a secondary outcome measure. Other secondary measures include the CDR
      sum-of-boxes, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Quality of Life-AD and the ADCS
      pharmacoeconomic scale. The influence of HLA-DR (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genotype on
      clinical progression and response to treatment will also be examined.
