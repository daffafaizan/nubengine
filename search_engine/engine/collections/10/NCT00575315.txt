      is now the leading co-morbid disease in co-infected individuals. The histologic severity and
      natural history of HCV has been reported to be accelerated in those co-infected with HIV. It
      is hypothesized that 1) the severity and progression of HCV disease is related to the immune
      competence of the individual, 2) immune restoration associated with HIV therapy may further
      accelerate the progression of HCV disease which may explain the marked increase in HCV
      related morbidity and mortality observed in recent years, and 3) the virologic response to
      anti-HCV treatment is directly related to the degree of immunologic competence. The specific
      aims of the proposal are: 1) To obtain, through multi-disciplinary didactic teaching, the
      necessary skills of clinical research design, data collection, data analysis, and
      biostatistical methods and 2) To study the impact of HIV disease on HCV, the effect of the
      immune function and immune restoration during HIV therapy on the natural history of HCV, and
      the efficacy of HCV treatment in HIV co-infection.
