      narrow-band noise matched with tinnitus frequency (Tf).

      CAABT was an innovative tinnitus intervention which based on neural science and cochlear
      plastic research and aimed to reprogram the central auditory system to neutralize the
      discordant responses of the dysfunctioning cochlea via acoustic beaming stimuli.
