      docetaxel followed by epidermal factor-antibody (EGFR-AB) cetuximab on patients with
      previously treated recurrent /metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Head
      and neck tissue will also be tested to determine if the protein Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor is present in the cancer cells.
