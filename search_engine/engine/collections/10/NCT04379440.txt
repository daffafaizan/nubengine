    
      Older adults (≥ 65 years) and pre-geriatric population (≥60 years and <65 years) are the ones
      most at risk from complications of COVID-19, including increased mortality, possibly in
      relationship with their comorbidity and frailty status.

      The GeroCovid e-registry is intended to track Covid-19 pandemic impact on the general
      geriatric population and on age/care-setting related sub-populations.

      The analysis of results is expected to facilitate the adoption of optimal standard of
      geriatric care during the pandemic.
