      stimulation Group 2 receive five days of upper limb occupational therapy in combination with
      sham stimulation The intervention takes place at patients' home address. Assessment tool:
      Patients complete the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test at baseline, post-intervention and at
      7 days follow-up.
