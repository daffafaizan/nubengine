      continue, particularly in Asia, where the majority of HBV infection is acquired at birth by
      vertical transmission from mother to baby. HBV vertical transmission has been hypothesized to
      cause immune tolerance to HBV and thus promoting the subsequent HBV chronicity. Such
      hypothesis has never been tested and nothing is known about HBV-specific adaptive immune
      response occurring before birth in baby born form HBV chronically infected mothers. This
      study aims to gain an understanding of the key components of the immune response to hepatitis
      B present in cord blood of HBV infected mothers. The characterization of the HBV immune
      response in utero will provide informations about the cause of HBV chronicity in Asian
      patients in the management of baby born from HBsAg+ mothers.
