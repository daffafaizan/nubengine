    
      This is a single center, open label, phase 1/2 study in which two to thirty three patients
      with Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, or High risk MDS will receive ON 01910.Na as a
      intravenous continuous infusion (IVCI) over 24 hours for 5 consecutive days every 2 weeks.

      In the phase 1 component of this trial the maximum tolerated dose of ON1910.Na in patients
      with Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2 or High Risk myelodysplastic syndromes will be
      determined. A standard "3+3" dose escalation scheme will be followed with up to six patients
      treated at the 800 mg/m2/day dose level. Patients will be observed for 2 cycles before dose
      escalation occurs. If none of the initial three patients in the 800 mg/m2/day cohort
      experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), during the first two cycles, then a new cohort of
      three patients will be treated at the 1500 mg/m2/day dose level. If none of the initial three
      patients in the 1500 mg/m2/day cohort experience DLT during the first two cycles, three
      additional patients will be treated at the 1500 mg/m2/day level. If no more than one of the
      six patients at the 1500 mg/m2/day dose level experiences a DLT, then that dose level will be
      confirmed as the MTD and no further dose escalation will occur.

      If one of the three patients in the 800 mg/m2/day cohort experiences DLT during the first two
      cycles, then up to three additional patients will be treated at the same dose level.
      Escalation to 1500 mg/m2/day will proceed if only one of the six patients experiences DLT at
      the 800 mg/m2/day dose level. If two or more patients in the 800 mg/m2/day cohort experience
      DLT during the first two cycles, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have been
      exceeded, no further dose escalation will occur, and a full safety review will determine if
      further enrollment of patients will proceed.

      If the 800 mg/m2/day dose level is under consideration as the MTD (i.e. if â‰¥ 2 patients
      experience DLT at the 1500 mg/m2/day dose level), and only three patients were treated before
      escalation to 1500 mg/m2/day, then three additional patients will be accrued. If no more than
      one of the six patients at the 800 mg/m2/day dose level experiences a DLT, then that dose
      level will be confirmed as the MTD.

      Once the phase 1 portion of the study is completed, accrual to the phase 2 portion will
      begin. Patients treated at the MTD during the phase 1 portion will be included in the phase 2
      component and will be evaluated for response and secondary end points.

      The total study duration is 29 weeks, which includes a 2-week screening phase, a 23-week
      dosing phase, and a 4-week follow-up phase that begins after the last dose of ON 01910.Na.
      Patients will be assessed for response and will undergo follow up.

      Patients who drop out for any reason will not be replaced. Patients who achieve a complete or
      partial response or stabilization of their disease by week 25 are eligible to receive an
      additional 24 weeks of ON 01910.Na at the same dose they received during the first 24 weeks
      of treatment(800 or 1500 mg/m2/day IVCI for 5 days Q2W).
