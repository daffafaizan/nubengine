      trained in the therapy session as well as generalization to untrained exemplars and contexts.
      Phonomotor treatment (PMT) has shown such effects but has not yet been compared to a commonly
      used lexical/semantic based treatment (semantic feature analysis; SFA).

      Methods: In a between group randomized controlled trial, 58 persons with aphasia
      characterized by anomia and phonological dysfunction were randomized to receive 56-60 hours
      of intensively delivered treatment over 6 weeks with testing pre-, post- and three-months
      post treatment termination.
