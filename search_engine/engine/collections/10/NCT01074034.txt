      ventricular tachyarrhythmia therapy features. The REASSURE AV study is a clinical evaluation
      to support approval of these features. This clinical study is intended to provide adequate
      performance data on two atrial tachyarrhythmia management features, namely the ATS and atrial
      ATP. In addition data will be collected to verify that the ventricular tachyarrhythmia rescue
      shock feature performs as intended in the clinical setting in combination with other
      pacemaker functions.
