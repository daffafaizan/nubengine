      assessing whether or not nitroprusside gel helps with IUD insertion process. Only healthy,
      nulliparous women between the ages of 18 and 45 will be recruited. Nulliparous women report
      much more pain associated with IUD insertion than parous women so the possibility of being
      able to measure the effect of nitroprusside vs placebo is more likely. The primary outcome,
      pain with IUD insertion, and the secondary outcomes, such as satisfaction and provider ease
      of IUD insertion, will be compared between the study groups as well.
