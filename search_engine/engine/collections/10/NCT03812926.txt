      having had a standardized learning module on epidural anatomy and technique, each trainee
      practiced the epidural and the CompufloÂ®-assisted LORT on the simulator for a maximum of 5
      attemps. Trainees were asked to stop the needle entrance whenever they felt a sensation of an
      increase of resistance due to the penetration of the needle in the LF. The correct position
      of the needle was verified by an expert instructor. The number of attempts was noted. The
      power analysis required a sample size of 60 observations to set 80% test power and a 95%
      significance. Unpaired T-test was used to evaluate the differences in the number of epidural
      attempts. A logistic regression model was used to correlate the "success at the first attempt
      ratio" and the technique used.
