      about 2 hours. During this visit V1, the subjects will perform a medical exam in order to
      check their eligibility (general statement and check of inclusion / non-inclusion criteria).
      The eligible subjects will fill up a study questionnaire and will perform a blood sampling
      for a dosage of serum vitamin D.
