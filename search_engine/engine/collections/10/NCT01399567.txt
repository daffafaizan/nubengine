      setting results in depression, decreased mobility, sleep disturbance, and impaired physical
      and social functioning. This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a pain
      management algorithm delivered using intense diffusion strategies. Outcomes are facility pain
      practices and residents' pain, physical function and depression. Specific aims of the study
      are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a pain management algorithm (ALG) coupled with
      intense diffusion strategies, as compared with pain education (EDU) and weak diffusion
      strategies, in improving pain, mobility, and depression among NH residents; 2) Determine the
      extent to which adherence to the ALG and organizational factors are associated with changes
      in resident outcomes and the extent to which changes in these variables are associated with
      changes in outcomes; 3) Evaluate the persistence of changes in process and outcome variables
      at long-term follow-up and 4) Evaluate the relationships among behavioral problems and pain
      in severely cognitively impaired residents who are unable to provide self-report.
