      Emory Dermatology Clinic. The plan is to improve the quality of future clinical trials in
      bullous pemphigoid (BP), the team will monitor repeated measurement data from patients with
      BP on standard-of-care treatments at four week intervals for four months. This time frame
      will allow completion of both aims in the three year time period. Aim 1 will evaluate the
      BPDAI scoring over time with specific reductions in the activity score as future outcomes for
      therapeutic response and assess changes in patient reported outcomes particularly related to
      pruritus for future clinical trial endpoints. Aim 2 will focus on the development of
      teledermatology platform for improving patient recruitment and retention. The data from this
      proposal will be critical for future BP clinical trials and clarify gaps in the current
      knowledge related to the natural disease history of BP patients on standard-of-care
      therapies, changes in BPDAI scores over time, and pruritus specific outcome measures to
      define the quality of life impact.
