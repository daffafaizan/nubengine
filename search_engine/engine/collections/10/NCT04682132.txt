      county front line workers, including EMS personnel, board of county commissioners and
      sheriffs' office personnel. These personnel will also be asked to fill out a survey that asks
      about their medical history and which of any symptoms they have experienced in the prior
      three weeks. The survey is voluntary and written informed consent is obtained . EMS personnel
      can still get the free testing even if they do not want to fill out the survey.

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 antigen and IgM
      and IgG markers amongst our county/EMS workers.

      The secondary objective is to describe whether the antigen/antibody markers are significantly
      correlated to the presence of a set of symptoms in the prior 3 weeks, and/or to the baseline
      demographics such as age, sex, and presence of co-morbidities.
