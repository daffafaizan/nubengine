      I. Determine the response rate in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors treated
      with oxaliplatin.

      II. Determine the cumulative toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine time to progression and
      overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      V. Correlate the extent of oxaliplatin exposure with response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease type.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
