      morbidity and mortality. In individuals with concomitant chronic renal insufficiency (CRI),
      outcomes are even worse due to pharmaceutical under treatment and higher baseline levels of
      oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated during mechanoenergetic
      uncoupling and can cause myocardial protein, lipid, and DNA damage, leading to the
      development of HF. One means of preventing the progression of HF may be through ROS reduction
      or an improvement in systemic or local oxidative stress handling. In this randomized, single
      blind placebo-controlled pilot study, we hypothesize that 12 weeks of treatment with oral
      pomegranate extract (POMx) will lead to a reduction in oxidative stress (as assessed by
      measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, F8-isoprostanes, and glutathione) in
      subjects (n=30) with cardiomyopathy (LVEF â‰¤40%) and CRI (GFR <60 ml/hr). Secondary aims
      include assessing the impact of POMx on myocardial remodeling and endothelial dysfunction by
      measuring serum collagen levels and asymmetric dimethylarginine, respectively. Findings from
      this study will serve as pilot data for a larger randomized trial of longer term POMx therapy
      in subjects with cardiomyopathy.
