      weeks for Stratum A patients. Treatment with abemaciclib (LY2835219) will start on the same
      day as radiation therapy (RT) and continue twice daily during and after RT for a maximum
      treatment duration of 2 years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research
      participants (dosage levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib (LY2835219)
      starting with dose level 1 (80% of adult dose). A cycle is defined as 28 days and the first 6
      weeks of therapy will constitute the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluation period.
      Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.

      Stratum B - Abemaciclib (LY2835219) will be administered orally on a twice daily basis
      continuously for 28 days, which defines one cycle. The maximum treatment duration will be 2
      years. Investigators plan to treat a maximum of 4 cohorts of research participants (dosage
      levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) with escalating doses of abemaciclib starting with dose level 1 (80%
      of adult dose). Dose escalation will be independent of Stratum A escalation. A cycle is
      defined as 28 days and the first 4 weeks of therapy will constitute the DLT-evaluation
      period. Participants must take abemaciclib by mouth as intact capsules.
