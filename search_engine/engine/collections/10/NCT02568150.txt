      they are used often in cosmetic area as well and frequency of usage is increasing as well.
      Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has developed a safe product by identifying wild-type
      Clostridium botulinum (type A) strain and purifying high purity, high quality botulinum toxin
      type A proteins from the strain. As a result of characteristic analysis (genotype analysis,
      morphological / biochemical characteristic verification test, toxicity test, etc) of the
      identified fungi, it was confirmed that the biological and chemicophysical properties are
      equal to those of wild-type Clostridium botulinum (type A, Hall strain).

      Regarding treatment satisfaction of those patients who were administered with botulinum toxin
      product, onset time plays an important role as a factor. Limitation found when reviewing the
      existing publications was in defining onset time solely on the determination of effect simply
      on response to whether there was an improvement. However, this study defines improvement rate
      of glabellar lines as ratio of reduction of more than 1 point from the baseline by
      investigator and thus it appears more objective data can be obtained than existing studies.
      Therefore, with this background, we intend to conduct phase 4 clinical study to explore onset
      time for DWP450-004 injection's glabellar lines improvement effect.
