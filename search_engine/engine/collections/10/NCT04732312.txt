      responsible for loss of autonomy. In order to keep patients with neurocognitive impairment at
      home, the availability of home caregivers is essential. The neurocognitive deterioration of
      elderly patients is a significant burden for home caregivers and can affect their quality of
      life. The implementation of formal home help (personalized autonomy allowance for seniors)
      can relieve home caregivers and improve their quality of life.

      Conduct of research:

      Elderly patients followed in the geriatric department of the Mulhouse French hospital, and
      for whom a formal home help (personalized autonomy allowance for seniors) is initiated will
      be recruited. The evolution of home caregiver's quality of life, burden and vulnerability,
      will be assessed during three months.
