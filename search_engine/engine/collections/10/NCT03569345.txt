      treatment for their cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Treatment areas consisting of
      tumors and a 5 mm margin will undergo AFXl exposure (CO2 laser) followed by IM 0.015% or
      0.05% under occlusion for 2-3 days. .

      local skin reactions are monitored at baseline (day1), day 3/4, day 8, day 15, day 29, day
      90, and tumor response monitored at baseline, day 29, and day 90. An additional repeat
      AFXl-IM treatment on day 29 will be offered if tumors persist, based on clinical evaluation
      and imaging on day 30.

      Primary outcome:

        1. severity and duration of clinical local skin reactions including erythema, scaling,
           edema, blistering, erosion/ulceration and crusting using a 0-4-point scale at all visits
           from baseline to day 90.

        2. To monitor BCC tumor response on clinical assessments supported by non-invasive imaging
           techniques including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and reflectance confocal
           microscopy (RCM) at baseline, day 29 and day 90.
