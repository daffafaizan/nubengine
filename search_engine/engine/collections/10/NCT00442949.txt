      acute coronary syndromes by comparing rapid catheterization on the day of admission (within 8
      hours of admission, with an average time close to 3 hours, as in the rapid strategy arm of
      the ISAR-COOL trial) with a slower approach where the examination is scheduled for the next
      working day (8 to 60 hours post admission, with an average close to 24 hours). Patients
      included will present with severe unstable angina defined as a TIMI score > 3 All patients
      must present with an indication for catheterization and they will receive the same optimal
      pharmacological treatment including abciximab (ReoPro*) when undergoing PCI and started just
      before the procedure as indicated in the label of the drug (substitution by another drug of
      the class, eptifibatide or tirofiban, is not possible in the catheterization laboratory
      according to the labels of these two other drugs). Randomization will evaluate only time to
      catheterization: rapidly, as soon as possible following admission (within 8 hours of
      admission) versus a delayed approach (8 to 60 hours following admission). The goal of
      randomization is to determine the ideal time to catheterization while indications for
      catheterization, pharmacological treatment, and patient care remain constant. This is a
      pragmatic study aiming to compare 2 different strategies in the management of ACS.
