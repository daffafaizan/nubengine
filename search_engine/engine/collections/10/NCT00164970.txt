      subjects take 1 mg of methylcobalamin and 5 mg of folic acid daily, while placebo group
      subjects take placebo capsules. The primary outcome is Mattis dementia rating scale. The
      secondary outcomes are mini mental state examination, neuropsychiatric inventory, and Cornell
      scale for depression in dementia. These measurements will be performed at baseline and every
      six months for 24 months. Fasting plasma homocysteine concentrations are measured at baseline
      and 18-month follow-up.
