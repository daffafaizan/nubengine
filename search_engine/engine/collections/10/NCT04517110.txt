      relief, we aim to reduce the amount of opioids they will require for pain relief and reduce
      opioid-related side effects that they may experience after surgery. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either pregabalin in addition to usual care or usual care alone.
      Participants in the pregabalin group will receive two 150 mg pregabalin capsules (300 mg
      total dose) within 2 hours before surgery and a 75 mg pregabalin capsule twice daily after
      surgery until discharge from hospital to a maximum of 5 days after surgery. Participants in
      the usual care group will receive two placebo study capsules within 2 hours before surgery
      and a placebo capsule twice daily after surgery until discharged from hospital to a maximum
      of 5 days after surgery. OPIATE will be the largest clinical trial of pregabalin in cardiac
      surgery with results that are expected to set new post-operative pain management guidelines
      to encourage the widespread use of pregabalin in cardiac patients.
