      The objective of this study is to examine the natural course of infectious and inflammatory
      diseases of the nervous system, to identify causative or associated pathogens when unknown,
      and generally to better understand the underlying immunological, genetic and pathophysiologic
      mechanisms that cause and contribute to these diseases and their ultimate neurological
      outcomes.

      Study Population:

      The study population will be patients at least 2 years old with known or suspected infection
      or inflammation of the nervous system and family members. Subjects will be recruited through
      referrals to the NIH.

      Design:

      This is a longitudinal case series with standardized research data collection at predefined
      time points. Subjects will have scheduled visits at the NIH either as an outpatient or an
      inpatient. The core research evaluations include: a comprehensive history and neurological
      examination; blood, urine, and saliva collection; neuroimaging; and lumbar puncture.

      Follow up visits will be individualized based on clinical needs and results of research
      evaluations. For some subjects, no additional NIH visits will be necessary

      Additionally, we will also enroll subjects with known or suspected infections or inflammation
      of the nervous system from whom only biological samples collected by outside clinicians will
      be processed and retained for research analyses. In cases were samples remain from those
      collected for clinical reasons and the samples are deidentified, the samples may be obtained
      with a waiver of informed consent.

      Outcome Measures:

      The study outcomes will primarily be the characterizations of varied inflammatory and
      infectious nervous system diseases. These characterizations will include: the clinical
      phenotype and biomarkers.
