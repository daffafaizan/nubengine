      research into new, more beneficial treatment strategies necessary. Cetuximab is a new type of
      drug that blocks the epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EFGR), and has shown significant
      activity in other cancers (colon, head and neck) where expression of EGFR is high. Cervical
      cancer cells express EGFR in a very high proportion of cases, especially in recurrent or
      resistant disease. This study evaluates the activity of the addition of cetuximab to full
      doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel.
