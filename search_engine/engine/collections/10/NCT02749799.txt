      patient-reported satisfaction after dosing with DFD-01 twice daily for 28 days. The product
      was approved for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis by the FDA on February 5,
      2016 before the first patient was enrolled.

      Forty five (45) adult males and females, 18 years of age and older with a clinical diagnosis
      of moderate plaque psoriasis who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized at the
      Baseline Visit. Each site attempted to enroll 50% of the patients with 3% to 10% body surface
      area (BSA) involved and 50% of the patients with > 10% BSA involved.

      The initial dose of study product was self-administered by the patient and supervised by
      clinic staff during the Baseline Visit. Patients continued to apply the study product to all
      affected areas (avoiding the face, scalp, groin, axillae or other intertriginous areas) twice
      daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 days. Patients visited the clinic for a total of
      up to five scheduled visits:

        -  Screening (Day -60 to 1)*

        -  Baseline (Day 1)

        -  Interim Visit (Day 8 ± 2)

        -  Interim Visit (Day 14 ± 3)

        -  End of Study (Day 29 ± 3)
