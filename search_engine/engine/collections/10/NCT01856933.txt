      (GBM) by immunohistochemical staining. Strong reactivity to the antibody component of PSMA
      ADC was observed in the endothelial cells of new tumor blood vessels in GBM. Since the
      endothelial cells are located on the luminal surface of blood vessels, PSMA ADC does not need
      to cross the blood brain barrier to reach its target. Following binding and internalization
      of PSMA ADC, the cytotoxic component of PSMA ADC will be released and destroy the
      neovasculature that supports tumor growth. Therefore, PSMA ADC may be an active treatment for
      GBM.

      Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been shown to be effective in improving
      progression-free survival as a single agent. Thus PSMA ADC, which targets tumor angiogenesis
      by a mechanism different from that of bevacizumab, may be a novel therapeutic modality for
      GBM.

      A phase 2 study of PSMA ADC is proposed for patients with GBM that have progressed after
      standard treatment that includes radiation, temozolomide and bevacizumab. A phase 1 study of
      PSMA ADC in prostate cancer is ongoing and a phase 2 dose level of 2.5 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks
      has been defined. Treatment after bevacizumab failure for patients with GBM is a major unmet
      medical need. If activity were demonstrated in this trial, a definitive randomized study
      would be proposed.
