    
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. One hundred
      twenty-two patients aged 10-58 requiring treatment with one of four routine dental procedures
      were enrolled. The investigators were licensed dentists in private practice. Each patient
      received one or more conventional injections of either articaine with epinephrine, lidocaine
      with epinephrine, prilocaine with epinephrine, or mepivacaine with levonordefrin. Local
      anesthetics were injected into no more than 2 sites. Injections of local anesthetic placed
      within 4mm of each other constituted the same site. The injection(s) of study drug were made
      at or near the completion of the dental procedure and were required to be not earlier than 20
      minutes after, and not later than 70 minutes after, the most recent injection of local
      anesthetic. Patients received an injection of study drug (1.8 mL) in each site at which local
      anesthetic had been injected (i.e. no more than 2 sites).

      Patients self-evaluated the return of normal sensation in the lip, tongue, nose, and chin by
      palpations at 5-minute intervals beginning 1 minute before the study drug injection and
      continuing for a minimum of 3 hours and until they achieved the return of normal sensation in
      lip, tongue, nose, and chin.

      Safety was assessed by the use of a Holter monitor, vital signs, pain ratings, and physical
      examinations including oral cavity examinations.
