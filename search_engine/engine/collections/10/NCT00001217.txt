      for patients with primary non-metastatic osteogenic sarcoma, both prior to and after the
      definitive surgical procedure for their primary tumor is superior as a treatment strategy to
      the current approach of giving drugs only after the definitive surgical procedure has been
      performed. An effort will be made as well to determine if the administration of
      pre-definitive surgery, chemotherapy leads to an increase in the proportion of the patients
      suitable for a limb salvage primary surgical procedure.
