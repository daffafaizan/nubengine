      unexpected death (SUDEP) is a major cause of mortality in people with epilepsy. SUDEP
      accounts for up to 20% of all cause mortality, and is most common in younger people,
      especially in their 20's to 40's year olds. In those with drug resistant epilepsy, SUDEP is
      five times more common than in well-controlled epilepsy. Likely causes of death include
      cardiac arrhythmias due to impaired autonomic regulation and reduced heart rate variability.
      Similarly, patients with recent myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure are at
      higher risk for sudden death, and manifest markedly reduced heart rate variability. Clinical
      studies of heart disease indicate that n-3 fatty acids, prevent cardiac arrhythmias, reduce
      mortality after myocardial infarction, and reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. The
      mechanism by which EPA and DHA exert their anti-arrhythmia effect is due to inactivation of
      high frequency sodium and L-type calcium channels in the heart. In addition, n-3 fatty acids
      improve HRV in cardiac patients, and this reduction in HRV is postulated to be a marker of
      the anti-arrhythmic effect of n-3 fatty acids. Preliminary data from our group indicates that
      n-3 fatty acids improve HRV in people with epilepsy, especially those with low HRV (SDNN <
      50). The commonality between n-3 fatty acids and improvement in HRV in patients with heart
      disease and epilepsy serves as a basis for our hypothesis that n-3 fatty acids may reduce the
      risk of SUDEP in epilepsy. The purpose of this proposal is to determine if n-3 fatty acids
      reduce seizures and modify cardiac risk in people with epilepsy who are at risk of SUDEP.
