      high FIO2 and high flow through an HFNC significantly improved the 6MWD compared with
      training using a 6 L/min nasal cannula. However, it was unclear whether the effects of
      pulmonary rehabilitation under HFNC were due to high FIO2, high flow rate, or a synergistic
      effect. It is also unknown whether there are differences in the effects of pulmonary
      rehabilitation under HFNC for each underlying disease.
