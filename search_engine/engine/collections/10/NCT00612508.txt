      Science University. This study will be conducted over six 28-day cycles. Subjects enrolled in
      the study will undergo baseline vaginal biopsy and then be randomized to receive either
      intravaginal ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel (NuvaRing®) or oral ethinyl estradiol and
      desogestrel (Desogen®). Repeat vaginal biopsies will be obtained after three and six months
      of exposure to either oral or intravaginal hormonal contraception. These will be analyzed to
      measure the thickness of the vaginal epithelium and to quantify the presence of Langerhans
      cell, macrophages, T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells.
