      radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. Their frequency of swallowing was transduced
      with an accelerometer placed on the skin over the thyroid cartilage and inductive
      plethysmography bands placed over the rib cage and abdomen. When laryngeal elevation
      coincided with respiratory apnea a swallow was marked. Five different motor frequencies were
      evaluated to determine their effect on participants frequency of swallowing (swallows per
      minute). Frequencies were 30, 70, 110, and 150 Hz and a combination of 70 and 110 Hz. For
      each vibratory frequency the number of swallows per minute occurring during stimulation was
      compared with sham when the participant was wearing the device but the motor was not turned
      on. The frequency fo swallowing during stimulation was compared with the frequency of
      swallowing between stimulations. Visual analogue ratings of the urge to swallow and
      discomfort were also measured after each condition. Other parameters were the pressure
      between the motor and the skin (0, 2, 4, and 6 kPa) and swallow initiation time when
      stimulation was on and when it was not. Swallowing frequency with continuous versus pulsed
      stimulation was also compared.
