    
      The Insight Telehealth system (ITSMyHealthfile) is a disease-managment interactive health
      care delivery system. Patients access the system through a special Web site using a password.
      The system prompts the patient to enter their weight, blood pressure and heart rate and there
      is a text box available for unstructed comments.

      Patients will be randomized to either the telemedicine group or usual care group (controls).
      Individuals in the telemedicine group will be asked to transmit their health status weekly.
      Both groups will be followed for one year with quarterly visits.

      Patients of either sex, of any ethnic background or race, between 22 and 85years of age, who
      have a 10% or greater 10-year risk of CVD based on the Framingham risk score, and risk
      factors that if properly treated would reduced the risk by 5% or greater will be eligible for
      the study.
