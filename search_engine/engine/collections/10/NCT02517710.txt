    
      Cesarean section is one of the most common medical procedures women of child bearing age
      undergo, in the United States and the world. This trial is designed to provide information
      and possible recommendation as to suture material used during closure of the uterus during
      that procedure. Our intent is to provide data relating to time of uterine closure, blood
      loss, and post operative pain. These conclusions may provide substantiated recommendations as
      to self locking and tying suture material in the performance of cesarean section as related
      to readily available synthetic suture material, which has the need for standard suture knot
      placement.
