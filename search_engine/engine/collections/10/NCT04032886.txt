      tactical stimulation it serves like a tool helping to reposition the joints.

      Here in this study, the investigators aimed to see the secondary effect of the technique on
      posture. Ä°t is already known that mechanical correction supports the joints and posture but,
      the question is; by supporting the upright position does it help the extra loaded muscles to
      release? As the best way to measure the stiffness of the muscles is Elastography, this study
      will highlight an important issue about correcting posture and regulate muscle loading.
