    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether concomitant radiofrequency Maze procedure
      for surgical treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation with rheumatic valve disease could
      provide better sinus rhythm control,improved cardiac hemodynamic status and decreased
      thromboembolism events and to compare if biatrial is better than left atrial procedure?

      150 patients with chronic AF having concomitant cardiac surgery will be enrolled. Patients
      will underwent bi-atrial radiofrequency,left atrial radiofrequency or no radiofrequency
      procedure randomly. All the patients will receipt amiodarone 200 mg/day for 12 months
      postoperatively.

      All patients were scheduled followed before discharge and at 3rd, 6th and 12th postoperative
      months.The following diagnostic procedures were performed

        1. Standard 12-lead electrocardiography

        2. Holter-ECG

        3. Transthoracic echocardiography
