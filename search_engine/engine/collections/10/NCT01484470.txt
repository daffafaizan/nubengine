      recurrent hematologic malignancies and marrow failure syndromes. However its wide application
      is limited by availability of suitably HLA matched adult donors. Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB)
      has been increasingly used as an alternative hematopoietic stem cell source for these
      patients. To date, over 10,000 UCB transplants have been performed in both children32-38 and
      adults.35,39-44 Its advantages include easier procurement, decreased risk to donors, reduced
      risk of transmitting infections, the immediate availability of cryopreserved units, and
      acceptable HLA mismatches. The transplantation of UCB allows a greater degree of HLA
      mismatching without an unacceptably high incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD). Adult
      patients receiving myeloablative cord blood transplants have a 90% chance of engraftment, but
      carry a 50% rate of transplant related mortality.
