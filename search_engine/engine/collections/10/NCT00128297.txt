      breast cancer (BC) patients with bone metastasis (BM). Its best way of administration and
      optimum treatment duration are still to be determined.

      Objective: evaluate the efficacy of continuous administration (arm A) vs. alternate
      administration (arm B) of PMT to delay time to first SRE in BC pt presenting with symptomatic
      BM.

      Methods: patients aged >18, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¥ 2,
      adequate renal function, and BC symptomatic BM were eligible. BM was defined as presence of 3
      or more hot spots (HS) in skeletal scintigraphy (SS), or any number of HS in SS if
      osteolytic, osteoblastic or mixed bone lesions determined by radiography, or 2 or less HS in
      SS if magnetic resonance or CT scan confirmation of BM. Symptomatic BM was defined as pain
      associated to SS HS, or SRE (pathological fractures or spine cord compression or radiation
      bone treatment or tumour induced hypercalcemia), or treatment with analgesia due to bone
      pain. Patients were allowed up to 1 previous chemotherapy and 2 previous hormone therapy
      lines for metastatic disease. Antineoplastic therapy could be changed at any time during the
      study. Eligible patients were stratified (isolated bone metastasis or associated to node or
      skin lesions vs. bone metastasis associated to visceral disease) and randomized to receive 2
      hour-iv. PMT 90 mg every 3-4 weeks for 18 months (arm A) or iv. PMT 90 mg every 3-4 weeks for
      6 months, followed by a 6 months rest, and a new 6 months on-treatment period (arm B).
      Quality of Life (QoL) was measured with short form (SF)-36 questionnaire.
