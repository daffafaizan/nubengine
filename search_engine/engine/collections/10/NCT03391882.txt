    
      An Open-Label, Randomized, Crossover Trial utilizing a Single-Blinded Rater to evaluate
      APL-130277 compared to s.c. Apomorphine in Levodopa Responsive Subjects with Parkinson's
      Disease Complicated by Motor Fluctuations.

      PART A consists of an open label, crossover titration phase where eligible subjects will be
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences in a 1:1 ratio to Sublingual APL 130277 followed by
      subcutaneous apomorphine or subcutaneous apomorphine followed by sublingual APL 130277.
      Subjects will undergo dose titration with the first study treatment (APL 130277 or sc
      apomorphine) to tolerance and effect, ie, the tolerable dose that turns the subject from the
      practically defined "OFF" state to the full "ON" state as determined by both the Investigator
      and subject. The subject will then be crossed over to the other study treatment (APL 130277
      or subcutaneous apomorphine) and similarly titrated to tolerance and effect. These determined
      doses of APL 130277 and subcutaneous apomorphine will be used during PART B.

      PART B consists of an open-label, crossover treatment period where subjects will be
      randomized to one of the study treatment for 4 weeks, then be crossed over to the other study
      treatment (APL-130277 or sc apomorphine) for additional 4-weeks of open-label treatment.
      Subjects return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments throughout the treatment
      period.

      This study is designed to test the superiority of sublingually administered APL-130277
      against subcutaneously injected apomorphine (APO-go) for the treatment of "OFF" episodes in
      patients with Parkinson's Disease, as measured by the change from pre-dose to 90 minutes
      post-dose in MDS UPDRS Part III score in Part B after 4 weeks of dosing in each crossover
      period.
