      whether IF and PBI with "boosters" are effective in reducing alcohol abuse among incoming
      college students. It is hypothesized that groups receiving IF and PBI will demonstrate lower
      levels of alcohol abuse over the first two years of college than those not receiving these
      interventions and that the effects of combining these interventions will be additive
      (Specific Aim 1). Structural equation modeling techniques will be used to conduct mediational
      analyses investigating theoretically derived hypotheses about the processes by which
      intervention factors influence alcohol use and problems (Specific Aim 2). Hierarchical
      multiple regression analyses will examine hypothesized individual and situational moderators
      of intervention efficacy (Specific Aim 3). The use of a factorial design and explicit
      mediational analyses will allow for very strong inferences regarding the "active ingredients"
      of intervention efficacy. The long-term objectives of this research are to improve the
      efficacy of early interventions and to inform research and theory on the etiology of
      alcoholism. More effective interventions, particularly those that target students during a
      developmental transition of enhanced risk, will result in fewer injuries from acute
      intoxication, enhance retention and learning, and lessen the development of alcoholism as a
      result of chronic alcohol abuse.
