      efficient method cover hard-to reach populations in developing countries. While the recent
      cheap cotton swabs have traditionally been used for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection,
      recent studies have questioned their efficacy by reporting the superiority of the more
      expensive flocked swabs.

      The objective of this study is to compare the performance of cotton vs flocked swabs for
      cellular retrieval and HPV DNA quantification after vaginal self-sampling.

      A total of 120 women will be recruited. Inclusion criteria will be as follows: 21 years of
      age or older, attending the colposcopy clinic, understanding the study procedures and able to
      comply with the study protocol. Pregnant women, those having previously had a total
      hysterectomy, and women with ongoing menstruation will be excluded. Each woman will collect
      two different vaginal self samples: one with the cotton swab and one with the flocked swab.
      Subsequently, a flow cytometric analysis, as well as a real time PCR analysis and a cytologic
      evaluation for specimen adequacy will be run on each sample. Agreement between the two
      methods will be calculated using the kappa statistic (Îº).
