      of stool. Chronic constipation is associated with episodes of irregular and unpredictable
      bowel habits and difficulty with remembering symptoms. These features lead to a recall bias,
      and inaccurate recollection and/or documentation of symptoms that are critical for diagnosis
      and management. A daily stool diary has been used in clinical trials and in clinical practice
      to accurately record bowel symptoms. However, patients find these diary entries cumbersome or
      embarrassing to use, especially with bowel movements that occur outside of home resulting in
      loss of data or inaccurate collection of information. Also, many patients forget events
      especially when this bowel habit is irregular. Therefore, it is crucial to explore new ways
      of accurately, reliability, and more discretely collect bowel habit information, by using
      current technology that a majority of people have access to.
