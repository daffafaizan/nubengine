      past two decades, given the patient desire to avoid cosmetically displeasing scarring. The
      mostly recently introduced remote thyroid surgery is the transoral endoscopic thyroid surgery
      via vestibular approach (TOETVA). Because of the several advantages comparing with other
      removeaccess thyroid surgery, making it nowadays growing in popularity since 2016. However,
      TOETVA carry some inherent risks, including mental nerve injury, tumor seeding and local
      recurrence, fibrosis-induced long-lasting pulling sensation below the lower jaws, and
      surgical site infection coming from the clean-contaminated environment of oral incision.

      Comparing with clean wound via the traditional open surgery, TOETVA carry the potential risk
      of infection. Based on the author's recommendation, prophylactic antibiotic (augmentin) will
      be administered 30 minutes before incision at operative room, followed by 2-day course of
      intravenous antibiotic, then shift to 5-day course of oral antibiotic finally. Up to date,
      only few case complicating postoperative infection were reported with extremely low infection
      rate (<1%). Therefore, the investigators want to study the short-course (2 days) of
      antibiotic coverage is also effective to prevent surgical site infection. It was proved in
      the preliminary study, comprising 5 patients in each group (2-day course in the study group
      and 7-day course in the control group). Later, the investigators will recruit more patients
      (n=100) to confirm this study.
