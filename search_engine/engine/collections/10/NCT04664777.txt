      and improve the quality of intraoperative care. This technology measures continuous Hb with a
      multi-wavelength spectrophotometric fingertip sensor.

      The perfusion index (PI) is the ratio of the pulsatile blood flow to the nonpulsatile or
      static blood in peripheral tissue. Perfusion Index thus represents a noninvasive measure of
      peripheral perfusion that can be continuously and noninvasively obtained from a pulse
      oximeter. Changes in PI can also occur as a result of local vasoconstriction (decrease in PI)
      or vasodilatation (increase in PI) in the skin at the monitoring site. These changes occur
      with changes in the volumeof oxygenated bloodflow in the skin microvasculature. PI values can
      change due to surgical process and may affect SpHb measurement.

      Aim of investigators in this study is to make continuous Hb measurement with Pulse
      CO-Oximetry method in living liver donors before and after surgery incision, to compare these
      measurements with the laboratory results routinely taken during the operation, to determine
      the level of correlation for this patient group.
