      and expression of tBRCA1/2 and other potential genes in triple-negative breast cancer.
      Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplation are enrolled in
      this study. The participants are required to have clinical stage II or III breast cancer with
      a clinical or radiographically measurable residual tumor after core biopsy. We will enroll
      the patients of pCR or SD/PD, which achieved after complete NAC. Every group will enroll 50
      patients. This study is to identify relationship between different gene mutations and
      expression, which may be targeted with currently available investigational drugs, and
      chemo-response.

      Patients who will fulfil all inclusion/exclusion criteria. We conducted a retrospective chart
      review of the 100 patients.
