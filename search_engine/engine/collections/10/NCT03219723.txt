      tested to treat people who have gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric mucosa-associated
      lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, stomach following
      endoscopic treatment of early gastric cancer, or H. pylori gastritis. This study will look at
      the presence or absence of new concerns regarding the safety of triple therapy with
      Vonoprazan tablets, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (first-line eradication) and triple
      therapy with Vonoprazan tablets, amoxicillin, and metronidazole (second-line eradication) for
      supplemental Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in the routine clinical setting. The
      study will enroll approximately 500 patients.

      First-line eradication

        -  Vonoprazan 20 mg / Proton pump inhibitor

        -  Amoxicillin hydrate 750 mg

        -  Clarithromycin 200 mg

      If H. pylori eradication with a three-drug regimen comprising vonoprazan or proton pump
      inhibitor + amoxicillin hydrate + clarithromycin has been unsuccessful.

      Second-line eradication

        -  Vonoprazan 20 mg

        -  Amoxicillin hydrate 750 mg

        -  metronidazole 250 mg

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan.
