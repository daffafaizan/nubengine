      Primary

        -  To evaluate the time to progression in patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric
           cancer treated with oxaliplatin in combination with S-1 vs capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  To assess progression-free survival, overall response, disease-control rate,
           time-to-treatment failure, response duration, time to response, overall survival,
           safety, quality of life, pharmacogenetics, and psychologic distress/coping strategy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral S-1 twice daily on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin IV over 2
           hours on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin as
           in arm I.

      Courses in both arms repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months.
