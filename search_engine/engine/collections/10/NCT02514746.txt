    
      Study participants previously immunized with CD-JEV (Clinical Trials identifier: NCT01567865,
      JEV05) will have serum collected three and four years after initial vaccination to assess
      long-term immunogenicity. Four years after receiving the initial dose of CD-JEV, eligible
      participants will be vaccinated with a second subcutaneous dose of CD-JEV to assess the
      antibody response.

      Participants will be monitored for safety for 28 days following receipt of the booster dose.
