      adaptation to motherhood. While it is known that women with a prior history of depression, or
      depression during pregnancy, are at elevated risk for postpartum depression, many women with
      no prior history of depression or other risk factors go on to develop depression in the
      postpartum period. Considering the grave consequences of postpartum depression on maternal
      infant bonding and childhood psychological development, it is critical to develop reliable
      methods to identify which women, who are not depressed during pregnancy, will become
      depressed after delivery.

      The biological pathways leading to depression at any time in life, including around
      pregnancy, are still poorly characterized. Oxytocin, a hormone involved in delivery and
      lactation, has received recent attention regarding its additional role in maternal emotions
      and care taking behaviors after birth. Specifically, lower plasma oxytocin concentration in
      the third trimester of pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of depression at two
      weeks postpartum (Skrundz et al., 2001).

      The primary goal of this study is to replicate previous findings and clarify whether oxytocin
      is predictive of clinically significant depression at 4 - 6 weeks postpartum, using a more
      comprehensive diagnostic measure for depression.
