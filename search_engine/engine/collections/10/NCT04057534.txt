      cognitive remediation treatment, CB-CRT" to reduce cognitive deficits in individuals with
      substance use disorder (SUD) seeking treatment using neurobiological and neuropsychological
      approaches. Furthermore, it will be assessed whether this chess intervention has a
      generalized positive effect on short-term abstinence. Interestingly, the functional domains
      and associated underlying neuronal networks observed to be affected in individuals with SUD
      overlap significantly with those that could be strengthened by chess-based cognitive training
      or formal chess. Specifically, strengthening of cortical control regions (dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) and brain areas relevant for decision-making (orbitofrontal cortex,
      OFC) could prevent future relapse. Therefore, chess as an add-on therapy to complement other
      standard treatments of SUD could lead to improved therapeutic outcomes.
