    
      Single arm, prospecitve, multicenter, non-randomized and open trial. The purpose of this
      trial is to collect and safety and performance data concerning the ACURATE neo™ AS Aortic
      Bioprosthesis and ACURATE neo™ AS TF Transfemoral Delivery System

      The ACURATE neo™ AS Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE neo™ AS TF Transfemoral Delivery System
      are intended for use in minimally invasive, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
      using transfemoral access in patients presenting with severe aortic valve stenosis.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and performance of the study device in
      patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis (AS) considered to be high risk for surgery.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate adverse events and study device performance.
