      I. Determine whether adding an IDO inhibitor to PD-L1 antibody therapy improves the
      probability of remission in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether adding an IDO inhibitor to PD-L1 antibody therapy improves long-term
      clinical outcomes in NPC.

      II. Determine whether the combination of durvalumab and epacadostat in recurrent and
      metastatic NPC patients is safe and well tolerated.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify potential associations between pre-treatment and on-treatment regulatory and
      effector immune cell populations and clinical outcomes in NPC patients treated with
      durvalumab and epacadostat.

      II. Characterize the oral and fecal microbiome in responding and non-responding patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and epacadostat orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 12 months in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression who are
      benefiting from treatment in the opinion of the principal investigator may continue
      durvalumab and epacadostat for up to an additional 12 months from the initiation (or
      re-initiation) of treatment on study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until start of a
      new anti-cancer treatment, until 30 days after documented disease progression, until death,
      or until 36 months from the initiation of treatment on study, whichever comes first.
