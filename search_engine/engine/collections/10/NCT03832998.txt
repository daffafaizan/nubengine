    
      This study is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Erenumab in migraine prevention in children (6 to <12
      years) and adolescents (12 to <18 years) with chronic migraine.

      The trial consists of four phases: screening (up to 3 weeks of initial screening and a 4-week
      prospective baseline phase); the double-blind treatment phase (24 weeks) in which
      participants receive placebo or Erenumab dose 1, dose 2 or dose 3 (based on participant's
      body weight) via subcutaneous injection once a month; the optional dose level blinded
      extension phase (40 weeks), in which all participants are assigned to receive dose 1, dose 2
      or dose 3 of Erenumab; and a 12 weeks safety follow-up phase (16 weeks after the last dose of
      investigational drug).

      The study intends to enroll 286 participants (256 adolescents and 30 children).
