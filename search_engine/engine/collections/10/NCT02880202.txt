      therapeutic tool for relief of pain and non-pain symptoms in hospice and palliative care
      patients. Massage therapy can provide comfort, relaxation, and improve quality of life for
      patients. The primary aim of the study is to gather data on the effects of complementary
      massage therapy on patient's symptoms and quality of life. The study goal is to improve
      patient symptoms of pain, anxiety, depression, and quality of life through the use of massage
      therapy provided to hospice patients. Questionnaires would be utilized before and after each
      massage intervention and would quantify symptom and quality of life levels.
