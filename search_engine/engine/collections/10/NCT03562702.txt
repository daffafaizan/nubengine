      emergency room setting. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is the first line therapy recommended
      by the American Academy of Pediatrics but is seldom used compared to intravenous therapy
      (IVT). ORT has many advantages including less traumatic to the patient, can be administered
      by mouth, can be administered at home and less costly compared to IVT. Furthermore,
      intravenous fluids may present several complications with IV placement such as infiltration,
      hematoma, air embolism, phlebitis, extravascular injection, intraarterial injection, etc.
      Speedlyte is a new oral rehydration product with lipophilic absorption which allows for
      electrolytes to be more readily absorbed compared to other oral rehydration solutions. The
      liposome encapsulates the salty molecules which is thought to decrease the negative salty
      taste associated with oral rehydration solutions. In addition, the encapsulation of
      electrolytes allows for more molecules to be delivered past the stomach acids and absorbed
      into the body under higher bioavailability due to the lipid shell.

      Participants will be randomized into two rehydration groups. One group will receive oral
      rehydration with the Speedlyte product, the amount will be based on the participant's weight.
      The other group will receive intravenous rehydration with a normal saline bolus per physician
      practice, usually in the amount of 20 mL/kg. These interventions can be incorporated into the
      emergency room practice without undue expense to the setting or placing excessive demands on
      nursing time as these practices are standard of care in many rehydration cases.
