      amyloid fibrils of variant TTR (primarily V30M) in peripheral nerve tissue produces the
      condition called FAP.

      The prevention of the formation of amyloid by stabilization of the TTR native state should
      constitute an effective therapy for amyloid diseases. Therapeutic intervention with a TTR
      stabilizer drug, such as Fx-1006A, is hypothesized to stop progression of the disease in FAP
      patients. FAP is a uniformly fatal disease and Fx-1006A is intended to halt the relentless
      neurological deterioration FAP patients experience.

      This Phase 2/3 study will enroll early to mid-stage FAP patients in order to interrupt and
      stabilize the disease at a point in time where progression of motor and autonomic dysfunction
      can be maximally effected. Male and female patients with FAP with documented V30M TTR
      mutation will receive Fx-1006A or placebo once daily for a period of eighteen (18) months.
