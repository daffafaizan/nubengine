    
      OCD individuals will be recruited at Hospital of Braga, Braga, Portugal, in collaboration
      with the Psychiatry Unit (n = 30, nonrandom convenience sample based on effect size of 0.30,
      alpha = beta = 0.05, and ANOVA repeated measures within-between interaction). Some
      participants may quit the study but sample size was predetermined considering a putative 30
      percent dropout rate. Clinical history will be assessed (sociodemographic information,
      disease onset and severity, and previous/current treatments). The participants'
      neuropsychological state, the blood hormonal levels, and brain function and structure as
      baseline measures before and after the neurofeedback intervention will be assessed. Two MRI
      neurofeedback sessions will be performed during 2 weeks (2 distinct days; 36 min per session)
      in a 3 T MRI scanner. Data analysis will be performed with a repeated measures design
      (baseline and after neurofeedback) between the groups to measure brain, blood, and
      neuropsychological changes. Patients will be supervised by a physician to track putative
      complications/adverse effects during the intervention. The participation will be immediately
      interrupted in case of adverse reactions or symptomatic worsening and a physician will follow
      the participants to provide the appropriated care.
