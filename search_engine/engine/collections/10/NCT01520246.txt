        -  To test whether the tumor suppressor candidate gene PDLIM2 is downregulated in human
           cancers such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and to use the human
           T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-mediated in vitro transformation of human T cells as
           control.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected cancer and control tissues are analyzed for the expression
      patterns of PDLIM2 and other control genes. Human T-cells isolated from human blood are also
      co-cultured with HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines.
