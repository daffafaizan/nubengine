      split-mouth design. All patients were informed individually about the nature of the proposed
      treatment, and informed consent forms were signed. Twenty-four patients were studied.
      Maxillary left or right quadrants were randomly assigned to PAPD laser treatment or
      sham-treatment and SRP. PAPD consisted of: i) photoablative gingival epithelium with diode
      laser (λ 810 nm, 1 W); ii) photodynamic treatments (4-10 weekly) with diode laser (λ 635 nm,
      100 mW) and 0.3% methylene blue as photoactive antiseptic, performed after SRP.
      Sham-treatment was similar but with switched off laser.

      Efficacy evaluations, including probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding
      on probing (BOP) was performed at baseline ,1year, and year 3 using a conventional manual
      periodontal probe. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), erythrocytes (RBC), damaged epithelial
      cells (DEC) and bacteria were assayed by cytofluorescence on gingival exfoliative samples at
      baseline, 6 month and 1, 3, 5 years.
