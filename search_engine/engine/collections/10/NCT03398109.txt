      astigmatism (TCA)was assessed by a rotating Scheimpflug camera combined with Placido disk
      corneal topography (Sirius; CSO, Firenze, Italy). A customized toric IOL (FIL 611 T, Soleko)
      was implanted in all eyes. One year postoperatively, refraction was measured, the IOL
      position was recorded, and vectorial and non-vectorial analysis were performed to evaluate
      the correction of astigmatism.
