      perform his/her own finger-stick test using the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS).
      Immediately after the subject tested him/herself a trained nurse/technician will collect
      another blood sample from the subject for testing by the YSI. The subject will complete a
      usability questionnaire on his/her experience using the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System
      (BGMS) and the nurse/technician will complete a questionnaire assessing the subject's
      performance. A venous blood sample for CBC will be taken by the nurse/technician and sent for
      analysis.
