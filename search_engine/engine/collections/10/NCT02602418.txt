      determine whether this adaptive WM training program will benefit HIV-infected individuals,
      and whether the investigators can identify individuals who might benefit most from the
      working memory (WM) training. Lastly, the investigators will explore how brain activation,
      neuroinflammation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamine levels might be related to WM
      function before and after the training.
