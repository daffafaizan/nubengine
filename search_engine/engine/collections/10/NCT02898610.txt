    
      Inflammation is a key pathophysiological contributor to unstable atherosclerotic plaque and
      thrombo-embolic events, stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death. Internationally,
      clinical trials are targeting atherosclerotic inflammation in patients with coronary disease
      using methotrexate, colchicine, and canukinumab.

      Aims:

      The primary aim is to compare low-dose colchicine (0.5mg/day) plus usual care, to usual care
      alone, to prevent non-fatal recurrent ischaemic stroke and coronary events and vascular death
      after non-severe, noncardioembolic TIA/stroke. Secondary objectives will investigate safety
      of low-dose colchicine, and efficacy for each component of the primary outcome, fatal and
      non-fatal events, disabling and non-disabling stroke, effect modification by prespecified
      subgroups, and impact on direct health care costs, adjusted for quality-adjusted life years.
