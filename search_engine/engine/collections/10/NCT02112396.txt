      refusing individuals suffering from addiction by coaching their Concerned Significant others
      (e.g., family members). The intervention is based on diverse elements such as communication
      training, contingency management, functional analysis of problem behaviors and strategies to
      improve the live of CSOs and aims to rearrange contingencies in the natural environment of
      the drinkers so that clean behavior is reinforced and drinking behavior is effectively
      discouraged. The intervention was developed for adult CSOs and usually consists of up to 12
      weekly face-to-face sessions with a duration of one hour each.
