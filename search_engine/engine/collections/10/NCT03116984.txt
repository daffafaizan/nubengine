    
      Enrolled HCC patients met the inclusion criterion, in the late or advanced stage,tumor
      confined in intrahepatic( meet the tolerance-dose for the liver), without cancer embolus in
      main branch of portal vein, without extrahepatic metastasis and the number of tumor wasâ‰¤3.
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the group A by TACE and the other group B
      by EBRT after 2 times TACE.

      TACE group: The frequency of treatment is determined based on the disease condition for
      patients who are randomly assigned to group of TACE.TACE is performed via an injection into
      the hepatic artery of agents by puncturing the common femoral artery, and micro-embolization
      superselective catheterization is preferred.Adriamycin(30 to 60mg) is considered as basic
      chemotherapy drugs in the process of transcatheter endovascular perfusion.The dose of fluid
      lipiodol was determined by diameter and blood supply type of HCC,generally 5-20ml, and no
      more than 30ml once.The boundary is considered whether there are large amounts of lipiodol to
      deposit in the tumor and tiny branches shadow of portal veins in paracarcinoma under
      fluoroscopic guidance. Embolizing agents(gelatin sponge particles 350um-560um) are added
      after lipiodol emulsion embolization.It has a possibility of observeation alone if tumor
      achieves a complete response after two times TACE.

      EBRT group: Patients who were randomized to the radiotherapy group start radiotherapy 3-5
      weeks after the completion 2 times TACE and began to undergo radiation. Radiotherapy
      equipment is based on the conditions of the cooperative units. 3-dimensional conformal
      radiation therapy(3-DCRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy(IMRT) or Image-Guided
      Radiotherapy(IGRT) will be opted based on hospital. IGRT can also be used via helical
      tomotherapy, Rapid Arc or Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy(VMAT). The target volume should
      include the visible tumor.
