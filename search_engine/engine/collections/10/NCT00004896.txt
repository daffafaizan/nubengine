        -  Determine the remission duration, disease-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in remission or early relapse or
           myelodysplastic syndrome treated with high-dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed
           by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral high-dose busulfan every 6 hours for 14-16 doses on days -9 to
      -6, followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2. Allogeneic bone
      marrow is infused on day 0.

      Patients who have already had 1 transplant receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV on days -6
      and -5, total body irradiation twice a day on days -4 to -1, and allogeneic bone marrow
      infusion on day 0.

      All patients receive prophylaxis for graft versus host disease.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
