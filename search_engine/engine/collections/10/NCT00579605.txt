      is rising each year. Therefore nursing interventions aimed at promoting infant immunity and
      mitigating factors to which the infant may be exposed may reduce the complications of this
      chronic illness. Breastfeeding is an ideal initial prevention strategy that strengthens the
      infant's immune system. In addition, the identification of biomarkers that reflect infant
      immune response sets the stage for the evaluation of nursing interventions targeted to
      decrease the impact of this chronic inflammatory disease. Although more mothers currently
      initiate breastfeeding, they do not sustain breastfeeding for the recommended 6 to 12 months.
      In general, Native American mothers' breastfeed for a shorter period of time and mothers in
      rural setting have fewer resources to support breastfeeding.
