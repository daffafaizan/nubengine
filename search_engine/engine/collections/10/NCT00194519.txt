    
      Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) is the primary cause of genital ulcers and one of the
      most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. Consistently, over 30 studies have
      found HSV-2 infection to be a risk factor for HIV acquisition with an overall relative risk
      of 2.1 in the studies that demonstrated HSV-2 preceded HIV infection. A recent study of
      HIV-discordant couples from Rakai, Uganda, has shown that at all levels of HIV viral load in
      the HIV-positive partner, HSV-2 infection in the susceptible partner increased the
      per-contact risk of acquisition of HIV five-fold, and GUD in the HIV-source partner increased
      the per-contact risk of HIV transmission five-fold. As strong as these epidemiological data
      are, an intervention trial is required to define the clinical and public health significance
      of these findings.

      This trial will directly answer the extent to which HSV-2 infection increases infectiousness
      of HIV/HSV-2 co-infected persons and the relative reduction in HIV transmission among HSV-2
      seropositive persons treated with daily suppressive antiviral therapy. Acyclovir has an
      acceptable safety profile for widespread STD treatment and is inexpensive, well-tolerated,
      and episodic and long-term suppressive therapy has not been associated with increased
      acyclovir resistance. Given high HSV-2 seroprevalence in HIV-infected persons (70-80%) and
      high HIV incidence in populations with high prevalence of HSV-2 infection worldwide, this
      approach could have great public health importance by providing a safe, acceptable, and
      cost-effective method to reduce HIV transmission among HIV-infected persons who are also
      HSV-2 seropositive.
