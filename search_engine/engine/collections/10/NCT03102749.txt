    
      Patients will be recruited in the respiratory department of University Hospital in
      Montpellier (France) from June 2012 to March 2014. All patients are asthmatics, in order to
      avoid any gender-related biases, investigators decided to include only women. All
      participants had normal range spirometry, specifically regarding forced expiratory volume.
      Each patient will undergo a bronchial provocation test coupled with a thoracic CT scan.
      Bronchial and alveolar Nitric Oxyde will also be measured, a blood sample will be obtained in
      order to measure biomarker concentrations, and the patients will be asked to answer the
      validated Asthma Control Questionnaire in order to quantify asthma control.
