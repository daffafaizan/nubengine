    
      This study is an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled, parallel design protocol in patients with Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)
      caused by S. aureus.

      Patients with a documented diagnosis of pneumonia due to S. aureus, and require ICU care, who
      have been intubated (or have a tracheostomy tube in place) and mechanically ventilated for at
      least 48 hours are eligible for screening.

      In total, approximately 240 subjects will be randomized 1-1 to be treated with placebo plus
      standard of care (SOC) or AR-301 (20 mg/kg) plus SOC in this Phase 3 study.

      Study subjects will receive a single treatment dose at Day 0 in addition to SOC antibiotic
      treatment, and then enter a safety, efficacy and PK study period for a total study duration
      of 28 days. The selection of SOC antibiotics is made in accordance with local best practices
      at the discretion of the investigator.
