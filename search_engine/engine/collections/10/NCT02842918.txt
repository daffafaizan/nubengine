      questionnaire to identify possible contraindications for spinal treatment techniques and
      exclude individuals if necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of two groups (spinal
      manual therapy or spinal range of motion which will serve as the name for the placebo group)
      and participate in neurodynamic testing procedures of the upper extremity (Upper Limb
      Provocation Testing) as well as lower extremity (Seated Slump Test). Subjects who are
      determined to be positive for one or more limbs will receive either a thoracic spine
      manipulation technique (spinal manual therapy) or a thoracic spine sham manipulation
      technique (spinal range of motion/placebo). After application of the technique, previously
      positive limbs will be retested. In attempt to determine validity and believability of the
      sham procedure and perception of its effect, subjects will be asked if they believe their
      upper/lower quarter mobility will change based on the group name and after the technique is
      applied. Subjects will also be asked if they believed they were in the treatment or placebo
      group.
