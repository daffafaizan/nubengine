    
      Prospective, randomized, multi-centre, open phase III study with two parallel groups of
      patients according to the eligibility criteria. The times in both hierarchical classified
      endpoints will be measured as times from randomization.

      Patients with macroscopic complete resection of colorectal liver metastases will be
      randomized in:

      Arm A: post-operative adjuvant therapy with Capecitabine/ Oxaliplatin over 6 months and
      follow-up

      or

      Arm B: follow-up

      Randomization: stratification after Scores of Fong et al:

        -  number of metastases (1 vs. >=1)

        -  maximal diameter of the metastasis (<= 5cm vs. > 5cm)

        -  disease free interval (>= 12 months vs. > 12 months)

        -  CEA (<= 200ng/l vs. >200 ng/l) in the strata 0-1, 2 and >= 3,
