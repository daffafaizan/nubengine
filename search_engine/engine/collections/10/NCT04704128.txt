      postmenopausal women. Its physiopathology is still unknown and several hypotheses have been
      put forward to explain this syndrome, such as neurological, hormonal or inflammatory process.
      The recent development of salivary metabolomic profiling in oral diseases has led to the
      identification of potential pathways in such disorders. The aim of this study is to analyze
      the salivary metabolomic in BMS patients compared to healthy controls.
