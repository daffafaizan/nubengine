    
      This is an interventional, case control study to investigate the production of nitric oxide
      in patients with citrullinemia type I. Through the infusion of isotopes [15N2-ureido]
      arginine, [5-13C,4, 4, 5, 5-D4] citrulline, [15N]citrulline, 15N sodium nitrate and
      [15N][18O3] potassium nitrate, the flux of citrulline and nitrate through the urea cycle
      pathway will be measured in conjunction with an independent measure of total plasma arginine
      flux. This will be informative in dissecting the contributions of de novo production of
      arginine vs. exogenous contribution of arginine into total body NO flux. Total body urea
      production will be measured by the isotopic dilution of constantly infused [18O][13C]urea.
      These flux measurements will be correlated with the level of residual enzyme activity and
      clinical phenotype in these citrullinemia patients. The investigators plan to enroll three
      patients with citrullinemia.

      Three unaffected control subjects will also be studied.
