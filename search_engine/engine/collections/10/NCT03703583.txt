    
      This is a cross-sectional single time point study. Infants and caregivers who come to a
      clinic for a routine health visit who wish to participate in the study by signing the consent
      form and meet all inclusion criteria/exclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      At the visit, a research staff member will assist the parents to complete (i) Feeding
      Practice and Gut Comfort Questionnaire and (ii) Infant Gastrointestinal Symptom (IGSQ)-13
      items. Additionally, infant's anthropometrics (weight, length, head circumference) will be
      recorded. These anthropometrics will be measured by the researcher as part of the routine
      visit.
