      prone to a higher risk, because of predisposing risk factors. A comprehensive preoperative
      risk assessment is recommended by the European Society of Anaesthesiologists guideline, but
      time-consuming and usually not performed at present. A telemedical approach would enable an
      out-of hospital risk assessment before hospital admission and provide important information
      without the need for additional in-hospital resources. The feasibility of the completion of a
      web-based questionnaire by elderly patients, within a controlled in-hospital setting is
      required, as a base for a telemedical approach.
