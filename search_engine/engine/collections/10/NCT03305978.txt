      referred for non enhanced chest CT in our Revolution CT scanner (GE HealthcareÂ®).The dose
      delivered with the two acquisitions is still lower than the french diagnostic reference
      level. Standard CT is interpreted and a report is sent to the referent physician as usual.
      Then the two acquisitions are read over time by two independent radiologists, blinded over
      judgment criterias. In case of discordance, an other radiologist will arbitrate. We hope to
      validate our Ultra low dose chest CT protocol, which is more than 10 times less radiating
      than a standard low dose CT, as a sensitive tool to detect lung nodules.
