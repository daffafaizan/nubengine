      Primary

        -  To determine if topical administration of perillyl alcohol (POH) cream can reverse
           actinic damage as evidenced by normalization of quantitative skin histopathology scores
           in skin tissue biopsy samples from patients with moderate to severe sun damage.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if topical POH can be administered safely to the forearms of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

        -  Placebo: Patients apply a placebo cream topically to each dorsal forearm twice daily for
           3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Low Dose: Patients apply perillyl alcohol (POH) cream (0.3%) topically to each dorsal
           forearm twice daily for 3 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  High Dose: Patients apply POH cream (0.76%) as in arm II. Patients undergo tissue
           sampling of the right or left dorsal forearm and of physician-selected representative
           actinic keratoses (AK) at baseline and after completion of study therapy. Tissue samples
           are assessed for changes in patterns of biomarker expression (i.e., p53, apoptosis,
           c-Fos histopathology) and karyometry. After completion of study therapy, patients
           undergo tissue sampling of the opposite forearm as well as blood sample collection to
           determine perillyl alcohol (POH) levels in blood and biopsy samples. Urine is also
           collected and analyzed for safety at the end of treatment. Digital photographs of the
           forearms and hands are obtained at baseline and after 3 months of study treatment.
           Optical coherence tomography imaging is also performed on pre- and post-biopsy sites to
           quantify the effect of POH on sun damage and AK in skin.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly.
