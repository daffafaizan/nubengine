      progression, is exclusively produced in response to testosterone. In order to elucidate if
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) can have testosterone like effects, samples from n=30
      non-smoking healthy volunteers, 20-30 years of age and with normal body mass index (20-25)
      with pharmacologically induced gonadotropin deficiency will be studied. The men are currently
      recruited and during 5 weeks undergoing:

        1. Pharmacologically induced gonadotropin deficiency w 1-3;

        2. FSH-treatment of 50% (group A), w 1-5;

        3. Testosterone (T) treatment of all (group A and B) w 4-5;

        4. End and follow up after 5 weeks.

      A subcutaneous injection with the GnRH antagonist degarelix (240 mgÂ¸ Ferring GmbH Wittland,
      Kiel, Germany) results in drop of both FSH and LH-induced testosterone. Half of the men will
      get recombinant FSH (300 IU; Gonal-f, Merck Serrono S.A. Aubonne, Schweiz) back, whereas 50%
      will not. Three weeks thereafter, the full spectrum of FSH dependent changes occur and are
      reflected in blood. From this occasion testosterone (Nebido, Ferring GmbH Wittland, Kiel,
      Germany) will be given to all participants to diminish the side-effects of the castration.
      Blood samples are collected at start, after 3 wks and after 5 wks. At that point also a
      follow up is undertaken. This experimental design will provide samples from each individual
      during normal conditions, during castration, and after a standardised dose of FSH.
