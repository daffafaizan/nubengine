    
      The present study is an Open-Label within-patient (single arm) second extension study of the
      Open-Label 2-month initial study (EM1000-1) and 4M first extension study, wherein most of the
      original eight AD subjects agree to participate. This present second extension study is
      intended to continue evaluation of the safety and efficacy of daily Transcranial
      Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT) in patients with mild-to-moderate AD for an additional 12
      month period, such that the interval between the initial day of treatment and final day of
      treatment will be 2-3 years.There will be a total of six clinical visits: pre-baseline,
      baseline, 2-, 5-, 8-, and 12-months. This second extension study will utilize the same
      MemorEM devices (designated as NSR and not Food and Drug Administration-regulated) as in the
      first extension studies, but will involve twice daily treatment for the first two months,
      followed by once-daily treatment thereafter.

      Expected Results: The investigators expect that the additional 12 months of daily TEMT will
      not present any significant side effects or safety issues, as was the case for the initial
      study and first extension study. The investigators further expect that cognitive measures
      will be stable and/or improve by the end of the 12M treatment period. In addition, changes in
      blood/cerebrospinal fluid levels of various beta-amyloid and tau species are anticipated to
      reflect the primary mechanism of TEMT action -- disaggregation of both A-beta and tau
      oligomers.
