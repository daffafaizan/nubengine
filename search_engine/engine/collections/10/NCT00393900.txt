      media with effusion (OME)and measure middle ear gas demand, middle ear volume and eustachian
      tube function longitudinally between the time of tube insertion and extrusion/nonfunctioning.
      The data will be used to test the hypotheses that: gas transfer across the middle ear mucosa
      decreases in phase with resolution of middle ear inflammation and effusion; gas transfer
      across the middle ear mucosa is increased by an episode of otorrhea; eustachian tube function
      is unaffected by tympanostomy tube insertion, and measurement of eustachian tube function and
      trans-middle ear mucosa gas transfer predicts disease recurrence and presentation after tube
      extrusion/nonfunctioning. The results of these studies will be used to support or refute
      tested components of existing models of middle ear pressure-regulation and to develop test
      protocols for risk assignments with respect to disease recurrence in individual ears after
      tympanostomy tube extrusion/nonfunctioning.
