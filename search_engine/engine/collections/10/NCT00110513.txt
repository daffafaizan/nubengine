      and Canada. GTC Biotherapeutics provided an international clinical team to support site
      registration requirements once a patient was identified for treatment. GTC Biotherapeutics
      also provided consultation to help evaluate patient eligibility.

      In September 2006, GTC Biotherapeutics modified exclusion criteria 1 (below) to allow for the
      participation of previously excluded patients with the hereditary thrombophilic disorders
      Factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A).
