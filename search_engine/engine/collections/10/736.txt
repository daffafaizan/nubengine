advances in filariasisespecially concerning periodicity of microfilariaea review is given of some advances in our knowledge about filariasis during thepast ten years.it is urged that investigations should be continued on methods to facilitatethe control of filariasis in large populations, by means ofdiethylcarbamazine--e.g. incorporation of the compound in cooking salt, aswas done with chloroquine against malaria.  furthermore, steps should be takento protect young people against filariasis by systematic treatment in theschools.in order to understand the cyclical disappearance of microfilariae from theperipheral blood and their accumulation in the lungs, the movements ofmicrofilariae in the pulmonary capillaries has been studied by cinematography.apparently their accumulation in the lungs is not due to mechanical retention,but perhaps they migrate round and round in the pre-capillary network ofarterioles.the periodicity of microfilariae is best considered as a biological rhythm.apparently the microfilariae have a circadian rhythm of their own which isentrained and synchronized by stimuli from the circadian rhythm of the host.judging by experiments with monkeys containing microfilariae of edesonfilariamalayensis, the most effective of these stimuli from the host seems to be therhythmic variation of body temperature which occurs every 24 hours.
