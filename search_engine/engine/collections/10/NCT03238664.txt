      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the efficacy of laparoscopic high-intensity focused
      ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of localized primary bladder cancer.

      II. To estimate the change in the number of expelled circulating tumor cells (CTCs), when
      comparing HIFU to robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of using laparoscopic HIFU.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo pre-HIFU contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), standard of care biopsy
      of the bladder tumor, laparoscopic HIFU, and post-HIFU CEUS. Patients then undergo standard
      of care RARC.

      ARM B: Patients undergo standard of care RARC.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and 3 months.
