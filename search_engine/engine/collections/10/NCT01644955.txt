      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose and define the toxicity profile of carboplatin
      delivered intracerebrally via convection enhanced delivery (CED) for patients with high grade
      glial neoplasms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the efficacy as defined by six-month progression free survival (PFS), median
      progression free survival, overall survival, and the radiographic response rate.

      II. Evaluate the drug distribution.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo craniotomy and then receive carboplatin intracerebrally via
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over 72 hours.
