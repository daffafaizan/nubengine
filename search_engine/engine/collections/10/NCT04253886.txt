      The Ovassapian Fibreoptic Intubating Airway has a flat lingual surface that widens distally.
      This provides better retraction of the tongue to prevent it and the soft tissues of the
      anterior pharyngeal wall from herniating around the side of the airway. The airway has a pair
      of vertical sidewalls and two pairs of curved guide walls at its proximal section. These
      walls are separated by a gap which allows removal of the airway after intubation has been
      completed.

      Fekry airway:

      ● It has two parts are: Airway body& Special connector

        1. Airway body consists of:

             1. Flange → it is the buccal end it is 7 cm wide to prevent it from moving deeper into
                mouth & may also serve to fix airway in place.

             2. Bite Portion → it is straight & fits between teeth &oral cavity.

             3. Oral straight part → open anterior lingual part; it varies in length according to
                size

             4. Pharyngeal curved part → extends backwards to correspond the shape oropharynx and
                ends below laryngeal inlet.

        2. The connector: it is a special type (two sizes: adult and pediatric) can attach to all
           ventilating machines& it has a teeth rest act as a bite block.
