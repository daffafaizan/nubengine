      prebiotics (or complex sugars) with potential health benefits. Prebiotics are natural
      compounds that help the establishment of beneficial gut bacteria (such as bifidobacteria),
      while preventing bad bacteria from doing harm. Supplementing diets with certain prebiotics
      has been shown to be well tolerated in adults and infants and to provide potential
      benefits.Therefore, the trial also aims to understand if consuming HMOs supplemented formulas
      could strengthen immunity and prevent common illnesses (for example, respiratory illnesses)
      in infants and toddlers. Furthermore, stool frequency and consistency will be monitored, so
      as to evaluate digestive tolerance to the formula.
