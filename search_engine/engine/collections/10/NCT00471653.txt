        -  Compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of temozolomide (TMZ) in patients who develop
           severe thrombocytopenia vs PK profiles in patients who do not develop severe
           thrombocytopenia while receiving standard first-line therapy for management of newly
           diagnosed high-grade gliomas.

        -  Determine if patients who develop thrombocytopenia have any single nucleotide
           polymorphisms in the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, prospective, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-42. Patients also undergo cranial
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic analysis,
      genotype analysis, plasma temozolomide levels, and MGMT repair gene polymorphism analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
