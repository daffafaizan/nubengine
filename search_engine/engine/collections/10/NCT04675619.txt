      observational studies and expert opinion. It is suggested that pirfenidone may slow disease
      progression in cases of CHP as it has some anti-inflammatory in addition to antifibrotic
      effects.

      Hypothesis Pirfenidone will slow disease progression in hypersensitivity pneumonitis patients

      Research questions

        1. Can pirfenidone slow disease progression in cases of CHP?

        2. What about the safety of pirfenidone in cases of CHP?

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone in chronic hypersensitivity
      pneumonitis.

      Objectives

        1. To compare the functional and radiological parameters between patients group who receive
           pirfenidone treatment and the patient group who receive conventional treatment: FVC, 6
           minutes walking distance, the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood ( PaO2),
           Pulmonary artery systolic pressure, St.George's Respiratory Questionnaire(SGRQ Score)
           and Quantitative ILD score (QILD), by quantitative HRCT chest.

        2. To compare the side effects between patients' group who receive pirfenidone treatment
           and the patient group who receive placebo treatment

      Study design An interventional randomized controlled study
