      with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver (NAFL) also known as Metabolism-Associated Fatty Liver (MAFL).
      However, meta-analyses have found significant variability among probiotic formulations. In
      fact, many probiotic properties are thought to be strain-specific.

      This study aims at providing a comprehensive characterization of a particular probiotic
      formula containing Lactoplantibacillus plantarum (formerly Lactobacillus plantarum) and
      Levilactobacillus brevis (formerly Lactobacillus brevis) in hepatic function of individuals
      with NAFL. The study will assess hepatic stiffness via transient elastography (Fibroscan),
      hepatic function via liver enzymes in serum (ALT, AST, GGT) and liver-specific inflammation
      via cytokeratin18 in serum, as well as some general metabolic and inflammatory markers.
