      are preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g ("very low birth weight" (VLBW)) who
      are delivered by caesarean section, in the first interventional group an extrauterine
      placental transfusion (EPT) will be done during neonatal resuscitation with respiratory
      pressure support. There will be a delayed cord clamping (DCC) of at least 30 - 60 seconds in
      the control group, before starting neonatal resuscitation with respiratory support.

      In EPT approach preterm born infants are delivered by caesarean section with the placenta
      still attached to the infant via the umbilical cord. Then, placental transfusion is performed
      up to several minutes by holding the placenta ~40-50cm above the babies' heart level while
      respiratory support by mask continuous-positive-airway-pressure (CPAP) is initiated
      simultaneously.

      Extrauterine placental transfusion may give more blood in babies delivered by cesarean
      section and may improve perfusion during the fetal-to-neonatal transition with impact on
      neonatal outcome.
