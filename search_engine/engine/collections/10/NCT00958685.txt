    
      Rationale: Clinical ARDS occurs primarily as the result of inflammatory injury to the alveoli
      producing diffuse alveolar damage.

      Objective: To evaluate the effects of an enteral diet enriched with ginger extract on
      inflammatory factors, respiratory profile and outcome of patients with ARDS.

      Methods: In this single center, randomized, controlled double blind study, 32 patients with
      ARDS were randomized to receive a high protein enteral diet enriched with ginger extract or
      placebo.

      Measurements and Main Results: Serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and LTB-4, oxygenation,
      measured as PaO2/FiO2, static compliance measured on days 0, 5 and 10.

      Patients fed enteral diet enriched with ginger extract had significantly lower serum levels
      of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and LTB-4 on days 5 and 10 compared to control group (P<0.05).
      Significant improvement in oxygenation was observed on day 5 (P=0.02) and 10 (P=0.003) in
      ginger extract group compared to control group. Static compliance was also increased
      significantly on day 5 (P=0.01) in ginger extract group compared to control group. A
      significant difference was found in duration of mechanical ventilation (P0.02) and length of
      ICU stay (P=0.04) in favor of ginger extract group. We did not find any difference in
      barotraumas, organ failure and mortality between the study groups.

      Conclusions: An enteral diet supplemented with ginger extract in ARDS patients may be
      beneficial for gas exchange and could decrease duration of mechanical ventilation and length
      of stay in ICU.
