    
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-highest cancer killer worldwide with an overall 5 year
      survival of about 8%. The only potentially curative procedure, surgical excision, is feasible
      in a minority of patients, but even in these patients the majority (~80%) die within 5 years.
      This study aims to see if adding paricalcitol (a vitamin D analogue) to chemotherapy can slow
      down tumour growth in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Studies have shown vitamin D can change the pancreatic tumour microenvironment from an
      immunologically suppressive (tumour growth promoting) to an immunologically hostile one,
      slowing down tumour growth in this way.

      Patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other organs and who have adequate hepatic
      and renal function are eligible. Participants will receive chemotherapy (paclitaxel and
      gemcitabine, with or without cisplatin). On development of stable disease or disease
      progression, paricalcitol will be added to the chemotherapy regimen and participants will
      continue on this treatment until their cancer stops responding to treatment. After that
      participants will be followed up 3 monthly for the collection of disease status and survival
      data.

      Participants will be asked to donate tumour and blood samples to allow the research team to
      look at the effects on the tumour biology.
