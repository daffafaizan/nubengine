      anxiety disorders. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been shown to increase psychological
      well-being for anxiety-related asthma. Our primary aim is to develop a standardized CBT
      protocol for asthma-related anxiety that can be transferred to internet-delivered CBT. Ten
      participants will be included in a single-subject multiple baseline design. They will all
      receive 10-12 sessions of CBT.
