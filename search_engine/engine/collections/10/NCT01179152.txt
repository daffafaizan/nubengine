    
      During the second week of September( week 38 of the year)there are recorded data of
      exacerbation of asthma all over the world, including Israel. A short preventive treatment of
      6 weeks may reduce asthma exacerbation in children,reduce primary care and ER visiting and
      hospitalization.

      We will study the effectiveness of Budicort or Symbicort turbuhaler as a preventive treatment
      in children aged 6-18 years.
