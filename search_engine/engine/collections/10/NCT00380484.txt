      systemic adverse events such as growth suppression. It has been reported that treatment with
      budesonide 200 microgram per day does not affect short term growth in children with asthma.
      The aim of the present study is to assess if an unaffected short term growth means that also
      long term growth will be unaffected.

      Short and long term growth in asthmatic children treated with budesonide will be compared
      with the growth in asthmatic children treated with montelukast.
