      this research project that studies two different audio-visual relaxation technologies in
      reducing amplified musculoskeletal pain. In addition, the investigators are interested in
      studying if they have an effect on some of the ways adolescents think about their pain and
      cope with it. Both of these technologies provide the user with a similar natural environment
      designed to have a calming effect, along with guided relaxation and soothing music. The
      adolescents will be assigned to use one of these for a total duration of about 10 minutes.
      Pain related outcomes including pain intensity, pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy to
      manage pain will be collected before and after the relaxation session.
