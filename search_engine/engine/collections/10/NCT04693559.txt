      alveolar bone grafting (ABG) has been widely accepted to correct alveolar bone defect in most
      cleft centres.The purpose of ABG is to restore the dental arch continuity, stabilize the
      maxilla, close the oronasal fistulae, facilitate subsequent orthodontic treatment, enhance
      nasal symmetry, establish better oral hygiene, limit growth disturbances, etc . Autologous
      bone grafting is the gold standard for treating alveolar clefts, with the iliac crest , bone
      being the most widely accepted donor site(Tan, Brogan et al. 1996.New bone graft substitutes
      have been devised in recent decades, such as demineralized bone matrix (DBM), bone
      morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), calcium phosphate (CP), calcium sulfate (CS), hydroxyapatite
      (HA), highly purified bovine xenograft, and more, but clinical evidence of their efficacy
      varies among clinical and experimental studies [4] With the advent of new biomaterials, which
      may include or consist of allogenic bone source such as collagen membranes, hydroxyapatite
      crystals, tricalcium phosphate powder that has been increased consideration for their
      placement in the repair of alveolar clefts as well as other dental applications
