      deficit populations that frequently fall: 1. physical therapy plus SEMD, and 2. usual care
      physical therapy only.

      Multimodal sensory cueing gives additional or enriched information to complement postural and
      mobility decisions. SEMD displays combine vibrotactile, visual and audio cueing that are
      intuitive and non-intrusive within a balance training system.

      Study intervention includes a maximum of 12 physical therapy intervention sessions, 2 times
      per week for 6 weeks or normalization of SOT, whichever occurs first. Usual care physical
      therapy prescriptions are written specific for number of sessions over a specific duration of
      time. Discharge from physical therapy occurs when number of sessions within a specified
      period of time is exhausted or goals specified by the physical therapist are met. Data
      collection includes 1 pre test and 4 post tests at intervals during the weeks of
      intervention, plus 3 follow-up phone interviews at specified intervals after intervention for
      maximal study duration of 6 months. A patient must attend at least 4 physical therapy
      intervention sessions for their data to be used and for the follow-up phone interviews to be
      initiated.
