      such as sirolimus-eluting stent (SES, CYPHER, Cordis, US), paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES,
      TAXUS, Boston Scientific, US), and zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES, Endeavor, Medtronic, US)
      compared with bare metal stents (BMS) by reducing neointimal hyperplasia, late luminal loss,
      and angiographic restenosis leading to decreased target lesion revascularization.
      Unfortunately, restenosis still occurs and late stent thrombosis can develop by delaying
      endoluminal healing or by chronic inflammation.Accordingly, development of new DES is
      required to improve efficacy by reducing revascularization and safety by reducing the risk of
      stent thrombosis. With the improvement of polymer, drug, and the platform, the 2nd generation
      DES, including everolimus-eluting stent (EES, Xience V or Xience Prime, Abbott, USA),
      zotarolimus-eluting stent with biolinx polymer (ZES-R, Endeavor Resolute or Endeavor Resolute
      Integrity, Medtronic, USA), and biolimus-eluting stent (BES, BioMatrix or Biomatrix Flex,
      Biosensors, USA), have been shown to be superior or non-inferior in safety and efficacy
      trials compared with 1st generation DES.

      However, it is difficult to know if there are any differences in efficacy and safety between
      the EES, the ZES-R, and the BES, in real world practice due to the lack of data comparing
      these three 2nd generation DES directly. This study provides the evidence for the CHOICE of
      stent when physicians are treating patients by percutaneous coronary intervention.
