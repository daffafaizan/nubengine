      of the heart in many heart conditions. When this test is done when the heart is working hard,
      such as when exercising, this is called contrast stress echocardiography.

      Current guidelines recommend the method called "contrast specific imaging setting," as the
      best way of looking at the main pumping part of the heart. However, it is not known if it
      provides better pictures when compared to a different method called "left ventricular
      opacification (LVO)."

      This study will compare pictures in patients who have had tests done using both ways of
      looking at the heart and will compare; LVO; enhanced and unenhanced LVEBD; LVO imaging with
      contrast specific imaging Wall Motion Classification and LVO to contrast specific imaging
      Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). The comparison will be done by a group of experts
      in cardiac ultrasound.
