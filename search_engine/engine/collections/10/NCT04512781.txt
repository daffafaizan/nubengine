      designs to effect ventilation and related physiological responses relative to the current
      cannula design, with which there are published clinical outcomes data. It is hypothesized
      that next generation nasal cannula designs (Prosoft and Unicorn) will be comparable at
      relieving patient dyspnea while on HVNI, when compared to the conventional (Legacy) cannula.
