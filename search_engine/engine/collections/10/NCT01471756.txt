      of snares used in Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR), a combined needle and snare unit
      (ISnare, US Endoscopy) versus an oval braided snare with spiral wire (Snaremaster, Olympus).
      The secondary aim is to explore whether EMR efficacy and efficiency is depended upon the
      injection solution used, saline versus Gonak (a solution containing HPMC, saline, and
      epinephrine) for EMR.
