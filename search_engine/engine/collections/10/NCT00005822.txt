        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SU5416 and doxorubicin in patients with stage
           IIIB or IV inflammatory breast cancer.

        -  Determine the overall response, response rate, and progression-free survival rate of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the antiangiogenic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the relationship of plasma levels of these drugs with safety and efficacy in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3 of course 1. For all
      subsequent courses, patients receive doxorubicin as in course 1 and SU5416 IV over 1 hour
      twice weekly (on days 1 and 4) beginning on week 2 of course 2. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      chemotherapy, all patients undergo a modified radical mastectomy and radiotherapy to the
      chest wall and regional lymph nodes. Patients with estrogen or progesterone receptor positive
      disease receive oral tamoxifen for 5 years after radiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 and doxorubicin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an
      additional 3 patients may be treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9
      months.
