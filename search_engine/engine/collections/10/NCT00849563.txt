      care clinics. Patients will be assigned to one of three study arms: those who want genetic
      testing for diabetes risk will be randomly assigned to either receive the testing in addition
      to the SRA (SRA+G) or to receive the SRA only (SRA-only). Those who do not wish to have
      genetic testing will receive the SRA only. All patients will be surveyed at baseline,
      immediately after going through the SRA (risk-counseling visit; 2-4 weeks after initial
      visit), at 3 months post risk counseling visit and at 12 months post risk counseling visit.
      BMI, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose and insulin will be measured at baseline and
      12 months. Surveys will allow us to track patients' emotional responses to diabetes risk
      information and changing perceptions of personal risk for Type 2 diabetes over time, and to
      see if these correlate with subsequent diet and exercise behaviors.

      We will use a linear model to assess the effects of genetic testing among the three study
      groups, using HOmeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and weight loss as
      the primary outcomes. We will use generalized linear ordinal regression models to fit the
      ordinal survey outcomes of risk perceptions to the continuous HOMA-IR and weight outcome
      variables.
