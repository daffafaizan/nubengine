      atrial fibrillation (AF) is electrical cardioversion, but AF recurs in 60-80% of the patients
      during the first year. AF is associated with electrical and anatomical remodelling of the
      atria, and angiotensin II is involved in the remodelling process. Studies have indicated that
      the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan may counteract both electrical and
      anatomical remodelling induced by AF. The investigators therefore hypothesised that treatment
      with candesartan may reduce the recurrence rate of AF after electrical cardioversion.

      Study design: 171 patients with persistent AF scheduled for electrical cardioversion are
      randomised in a double blind, placebo-controlled study. The patients receive tablets of
      candesartan 8 mg or matching placebo once daily for 3-6 weeks before cardioversion, and
      candesartan 16 mg or matching placebo once daily for 6 months after cardioversion. The study
      medication is discontinued if electrical cardioversion is unsuccessful or if AF recurrence is
      documented. Primary endpoint is recurrence of AF. Clinical, electrocardiographic,
      echocardiographic and biochemical markers will be analysed.
