    
      This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center, global Phase III study to
      determine the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) monotherapy and MEDI4736
      (Durvalumab) in combination with tremelimumab versus SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or
      carboplatin + gemcitabine doublet) first-line chemotherapy in treatment-na√Øve patients with
      histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, Stage IV transitional cell
      carcinoma (transitional cell and mixed transitional/non-transitional cell histologies) of the
      urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra) and to allow
      sufficient flexibility for Investigators and patients to select the agents that reflect their
      normal clinical practice and national guidelines. The patients enrolled in the study will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to receive treatment with combination therapy, monotherapy, or SoC
      (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine, based on cisplatin eligibility).
      Patients will be treated with MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) or MEDI4736 (Durvalumab) with
      tremelimumab, or treated with SoC until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed, unacceptable
      toxicity occurs, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. Patients
      will be followed for up to 2 years.
