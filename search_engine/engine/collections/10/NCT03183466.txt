      one-third to one-half of a rupture. However, the most controversial case is the one-third to
      one-half of the upper tear attached to the tendinous portion of the subscapularis. Currently,
      debridement or repair is under way. But evidence-based studies are lacking and no clear
      treatment guidelines are available.
