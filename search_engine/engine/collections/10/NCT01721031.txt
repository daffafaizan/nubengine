      urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction under general anesthesia, and this symptom
      complex may cause patient agitated and exacerbated postoperative pain. According to the
      previous study, i.v. tramadol 1.5 mg/kg administered 30 min before extubation results in
      reduction in the incidence and severity of CRBD. In clinical practice, tramadol is associated
      with side effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation, etc. Clinically, dorsal penile nerve
      block (DPNB) was applied in penile surgery, and got satisfactory pain relief effect
      postoperatively without side effects related to tramadol. Besides, we observed patients
      underwent urethra surgery with urinary catheter left in situ seldom complained of CRBD if
      DPNB and RB performed at the end of operation. We hypothesized that DPNB could relieve DPNB
      for male patient with indwelling urinary catheter insertion after induction of general
      anesthesia.

      In this study we compare the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with 0.33%
      ropivacaine and intravenous tramadol 1.5mg/kg in prevention of CRBD, as well as the
      incidences of side effects postoperatively.
