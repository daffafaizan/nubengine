      correction. However, many aspects -both pre-operative and post-operative- can interfere
      causing T-IOL rotation and misalignment.

      Complete preoperative ocular evaluation is performed including slit-lamp examination,
      uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Javal
      keratometry, corneal Scheimplug tomography (Pentacam), optical biometry (IOL Master), Goldman
      applanation tonometry and fundus evaluation through dilated pupils. The spherical IOL power
      is calculated considering the axial length obtained with optical biometry, the magnitude of
      astigmatism derived from Javal keratometry and the steepest axis obtained with corneal
      tomography. The power of the toric IOL is determined with the online Staar Toric IOL
      calculator. The reference landmarks are also marked preoperatively with a sterile methylene
      blue fine point pen. The marking is rechecked in the operating theatre with the electronic
      toric marker ASICO.

      Postoperative evaluation for IOL alignment and rotational stability is performed with
      slit-lamp photography on dilated pupils. Images are captured with Haag Streit slit lamp BQ
      900 and are evaluated with the image-analysis software Protractor (Staar).
