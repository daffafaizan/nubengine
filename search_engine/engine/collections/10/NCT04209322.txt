      6 to 12 weeks of sciatic pain to determine whether a strategy of PRF in addition to TFESI
      leads to better outcomes during the first year than does a strategy of TFESI only means for
      sciatica treatment.

      Eligible patients were 18 to 75 years of age, had a radiologically confirmed disk herniation,
      and had received a diagnosis from an attending neurologist of an incapacitating lumbosacral
      radicular syndrome that had lasted for 6 to 12 weeks. Correlation of magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) findings with symptoms was registered. Patients presenting with cauda equina
      syndrome, muscle paralysis, or insufficient strength to move against gravity were excluded.
      Other exclusion criteria were cardiac pace-maker implant, pregnancy, or severe coexisting
      disease. The occurrence of another episode of symptoms similar to those of the current
      episode during the previous 12 months, previous spine surgery and spondylolisthesis were not
      considered contraindications but bony stenosis.

      A computer-generated permuted-block scheme was used for randomization, with patients
      stratified according to center. A few hours before randomization, the patients were evaluated
      again, and those who had recovered from their symptoms at that time were excluded from the
      trial.
