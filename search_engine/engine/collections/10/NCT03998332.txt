      ranged from 0 to 192 months.

      For all patients included to the analysis, the clinical stage was estimated according to TNM

      was assessed in 60 patients treated with intention to treat (ITT), which is 45% of the total
      population.

      The degree of clinical stage (cTNM) was assessed in 72 patients based on the imaging
      examinations (including PET, CT, MRI, bone scintigraphy, etc.) and fine needle aspiration
      biopsy (FNA) (including EBUS, with pathological confirmation of LCNEC, which is 55% of the
      total population.
