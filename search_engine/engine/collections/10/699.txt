antidiuretic properties of chlorothiazidein diabetes insipidus dogschlorothiazide was found to decreaseurine volume and increase urine con-centration in diabetes insipidus dogs.there was no change in gfr, rpf,tmpah, plasma volume, extracellularfluid or total body water.  the one con-sistent altered function was a decreasein "free water" clearance.  diazoxide andmercuhydrin were not antidiuretic.  it isbelieved that the antidiuretic action isdependent on the chlorothiazide-inducedsaluresis.  although the mechanism ofthis antidiuresis has not been clearly de-fined, it seems best explained by postu-lating a decrease in filtrate reaching thedistal nephron (giving a decreased finalurine volume) coupled with inhibition ofsolute reabsorption in the distal tubule(preventing the selective reabsorption ofsolute in the distal tubule that is nor-mally seen, accounting for the increasein urine concentration).  the possiblerole of the mineralocorticoids in theantidiuretic response to chlorothiazidetherapy was investigated in diabetes in-sipidus and adrenalectomized dogs.  ad-ministration of sodium-retaining steroidsto diabetes insipidus dogs did not re-produce the urinary changes associatedwith chlorothiazide therapy.  in addition,the antidiuretic response to chlorothia-zide was not altered by adrenalectomyor spironolactone administration.  there-fore, the presence of the sodium-retain-ing steroids are not essential for the anti-diuretic response of chlorothiazide indiabetes insipidus.
