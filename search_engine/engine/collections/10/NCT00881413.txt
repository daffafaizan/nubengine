      management of peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB), which remains a prevalent disorder associated with
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Clinical effectiveness of PPI in the management of
      patients with PUB has been established by compelling evidence derived from a number of
      randomized trials. However, whether different PPIs are equally effective has not been
      investigated. Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, may achieve faster, more profound and
      steady acid suppression than other PPIs, but it remains undetermined whether the superiority
      of pharmacologic efficacy may be translated into advantages in clinical outcomes.
