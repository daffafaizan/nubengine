      the practices of PFMT and BT. Women in the treatment arm of the RCT attended a Bladder Health
      Class (PFMT & BT) to prevent UI. The class content emphasized self-efficacy. At 3-months post
      intervention the self-efficacy of participants was measured; these results were collected to
      analyze for predictive capacity of training adherence. For four years participants in both
      the treatment and control (no class) arms were followed with both questionnaires and 3-day
      bladder diaries (2/year) and clinic evaluations of (1/year). In addition, qualitative
      analyses of the narratives of Bladder Health Class participants identified individual
      attitudes and strategies that either facilitated or deterred adherence.
