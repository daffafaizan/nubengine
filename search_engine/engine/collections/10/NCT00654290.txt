      artery bypass grafting, being randomized prospectively into three groups, propranolol (p)
      (n=80), amiodarone (A) (n=80) and amiodarone with propranolol (AP) (n=80).

      All groups received their medications from 7 days preoperatively and continued their
      medications for 5 days post CABG.
