      ischemia-reperfusion injury suggest potential for therapeutic benefit in patients with acute
      MI. Before the therapeutic potential of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) in acute MI
      can be tested in large clinical trials, more information on the effects of short-term rHuEpo
      on platelet function are needed. Accordingly, the current proposal aims to determine the
      effects of rHuEpo (at a dose previously shown not to inhibit the anti-platelet effects of
      aspirin and clopidogrel in healthy subjects) on platelet function and other safety measures
      and measure of infarct size in patients with acute coronary syndromes receiving
      clinically-indicated standard anti-platelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and
      glycoprotein Iib-IIIa inhibitors.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the effects of intravenous rHuEpo 400 U/kg daily for 3 days vs.
      placebo on in vivo and in vitro platelet function in patients with acute MI undergoing
      percutaneous revascularization.

      Specific Aim 2: To obtain pilot data to estimate the effects of administration of rHuEpo 400
      U/kg daily for 3 days vs. placebo on biochemical markers of myocardial infarction size and
      left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with acute MI undergoing percutaneous
      revascularization
