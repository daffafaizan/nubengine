    
      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed-schedule
      investigation of the effects of calcium carbonate on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Gleevec® in
      healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such
      that twelve subjects (6 men / 6 women) will complete the study at UPCI. Subjects will be
      compensated for participation.

      Half of the subjects will receive Gleevec® alone on Day 1 and Gleevec® and calcium carbonate
      on Day 15, and the other half will receive Gleevec® and calcium carbonate on Day 1 and
      Gleevec® alone on Day 15, determined by randomization of subjects receiving either the
      combination or Gleevec® alone during the first visit. Doses will be 400 mg Gleevec® and 4000
      mg calcium carbonate (4 x Tums Ultra 1000® chewable tablets, equivalent to 4000 mg calcium
      carbonate or 1600 mg calcium.

      Multiple PK blood samples will be taken from Days 1-4 and Days 15-18. Gleevec® PK will be
      assessed after oral administration of 400 mg Gleevec® alone, and after oral administration of
      400 mg Gleevec® with concomitant administration of 4000 mg calcium carbonate. Two 10-hour
      outpatient dosing visits and six brief outpatient visits are required to accommodate all
      study procedures.
