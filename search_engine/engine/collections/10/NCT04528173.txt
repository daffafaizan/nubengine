      Primary: To determine if an opioid-free anesthetic provides equivalent acute postoperative
      pain relief in tonsillectomy.

      Secondary: To determine if post-operative pain at home is not significantly different with an
      opioid-free regimen compared to an opioid containing regimen for tonsillectomy.

      Study Design: Prospective, randomized, single-center trial study

      Study Interventions and Measures:

      Subject will be randomized to 1:1 intra-operative opioid-free (OFG) vs traditional care
      anesthetic with opioids (TCG) group

      The primary endpoint is the median pain score (calculated by a blinded validated observer in
      the recovery room at two time intervals) between the two cohorts.
