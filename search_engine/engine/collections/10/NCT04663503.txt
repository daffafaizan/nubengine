      in adult HSCT patients, only limited attention has been paid to this effective supportive
      therapy in children. Only five publications describe the effectiveness of exercise training
      in pediatric HSCT. San Juan et al. showed beneficial effects on functional performance,
      muscle strength, and Qol scores in a study of children (aged 8-16) undergoing a supervised
      exercise program that included resistance and aerobic exercises for 3 weeks after HSCT. In
      another study, the moderate intensity exercise program implemented to children undergoing
      allogeneic HSCT for 3 weeks during hospitalization showed positive effects on body mass and
      body mass index (BMI), and no negative effect on immune cell recovery. It was found that a
      structured physical activity program has positive effects on Qol and fatigue scores in
      children undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Yildez et al. showed
      improvement in areas such as functional performance, muscle strength, functional mobility.
      Marchese et al. showed an improvement in knee extension strength and ankle dorsiflexion range
      of motion.This study will implement an exercise program that is personalized to hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant recipients designed to prevent a decline in function/independence.
      Investigators will accomplish this by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that
      will examine the effect of an 8-12 week personalized exercise program compared to standard
      care following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Data from this study should increase
      understanding of the effect of exercise in this population on QoL, functional ability,
      endurance, muscle strength, and fatigue.
