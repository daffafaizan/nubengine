      by XPF caps (0.5mm lead-equivalent and 0.3mm lead-equivalent) to the standard protection
      (fabric cap, basically no protection) as measured in % radiation attenuation) during 150 days
      of fluoroscopy guided cardiology interventions. The second objective is to compare the
      operator comfort (rated on a visual analog scale) of wearing the XPF protection caps compared
      to the standard fabric caps.
