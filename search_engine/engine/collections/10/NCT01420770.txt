      eligibility (screening period 28 days), followed by a treatment period of at least 1 cycle
      (28 days) of study treatment, and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the
      last administration of study drug. However, treatment may continue if patients are deriving
      benefit and do not have unacceptable toxicity or meet study withdrawal criteria.

      The study duration will be approximately 16 months which includes a 3-month enrollment period
      followed by a 12-month treatment period following the last patient enrolled followed by a
      30-day follow-up period. The cut-off date for the analysis of the primary endpoint of
      response will be in maximum at the end of 3 months after the date of first dose of study drug
      of the last treated patient. The final analysis will be performed after the last enrolled
      patient completes the Cycle12 assessment.
