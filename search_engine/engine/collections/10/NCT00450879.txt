      I. To determine the biologic effect, measured by a decrease in phosphorylation of vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and/or decrease in microvessel density, in
      breast tumor biopsies after treatment with daily oral GW786034 (pazopanib hydrochloride) for
      at least 12 consecutive days in early stage, operable breast cancer or local and/or regional
      recurrence that is amenable to surgery.

      II. To determine the mechanism of antitumor effect, measured by a reduction in tumor cell
      proliferation (Ki67) or an increase in apoptosis in breast tumor biopsies after treatment
      with GW786034.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the change in levels of tissue vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in
      breast tumor biopsies after treatment with GW786034.

      II. To evaluate the change in phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and protein kinase B (AKT) in breast tumor biopsies
      after treatment with GW786034.

      III. To identify gene expression patterns in breast tumor biopsies before and after treatment
      with GW786034.

      IV. To evaluate the change in VEGF (in the plasma) and VEGFR-2 (in the serum) as circulating
      biomarkers after treatment with GW786034.

      V. To evaluate the change in circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood after treatment with
      GW786034.

      VI. To determine whether the steady-state plasma concentration of GW786034 correlates with
      inhibition of phosphorylated (phospho)-VEGFR-2 and other endpoints in breast tumor biopsies.

      VII. To evaluate the change in vascular permeability by dynamic contrast enhanced
      (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast after treatment with GW786034.

      VIII. To compare the images obtained with bilateral DCE-MRI of the breast before, during, and
      after treatment with GW786034.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12-20 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgical
      resection of tumor between days 13 and 21 (24 hours after completion of pazopanib
      hydrochloride).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.
