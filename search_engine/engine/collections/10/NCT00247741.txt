      and motor blockade, and a rapid recovery after the operation. Short-acting local-anesthetics
      are used frequently in this setting.

      Lidocaine is one of the agents that is used most frequently. It has been associated with an
      increased incidence of Transient Neurological Symptoms (TNS). Articaine is another agent that
      is being used more often and is said to act faster and shorter than lidocaine.

      We will compare spinal anesthesia with lidocaine and articaine in a randomized double-blind
      clinical trial. Endpoint are:

        -  onset of sensory and motor block

        -  recovery from sensory and motor block

        -  time to micturition

        -  patient satisfaction

        -  complications
