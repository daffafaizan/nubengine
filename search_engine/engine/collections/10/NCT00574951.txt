      Primary

        -  To assess the activity of AMG 706, in terms of the frequency of patients with
           progression-free survival for at least 6 months after initiating therapy or with an
           objective tumor response, in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial,
           fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v3.0.

        -  To characterize the distribution of the progression-free and overall survival of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AMG 706 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
