      CONDITIONING REGIMENS: Participants receive 1 of 3 regimens and are randomized to 1 of 3 arms
      for GVHD prophylaxis.

      REGIMEN A: Participants undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -6 to
      -4 (-7 to -4 for those < 18 years), then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days
      -3 and -2. Participants randomized to Arm 2 only receive TBI on days -3 to -1 (-4 to -1 for
      those < 18 years).

      REGIMEN B: Participants receive fludarabine phosphate IV and busulfan IV every 6 hours on
      days -5 to -2.

      REGIMEN C: Participants receive busulfan orally (PO) or IV every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -3 and -2.

      Myelofibrosis or other myeloproliferative neoplasms: Participants >= 18 years receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -7 and -6 and busulfan IV on days -5 to -2.
      Participants < 17 years receive busulfan IV every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2.

      All participants undergo peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      ARM 1: Participants receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -3 to -1.
      Beginning day -1, participants also receive tacrolimus IV or cyclosporine IV twice daily
      (BID) tapered at day 50, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6 and 11 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Participants receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3 and 4. Beginning day
      5, participants also receive tacrolimus IV or cyclosporine IV BID tapered at day 50 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 3: Beginning day -1, participants receive tacrolimus IV or cyclosporine IV BID tapered at
      day 50, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6 and 11 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 6 months, then annually
      up to 5 years.
