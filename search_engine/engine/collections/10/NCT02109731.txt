    
      Overview: Subjects with OSAS (but not using continuous positive airway pressure CPAP) will
      undergo NAP physical therapy of the upper airway, utilizing a physiologically determined
      training pressure and protocol, three days a week (approximately 30 minute sessions each) for
      a period of three months. Overnight sleep studies (PSGs) will be performed pre- and
      post-study. Primary outcome measurements include the pre- and post-study Apnea/Hypopnea index
      (AHI) and daytime hypersomnolence symptom scores. Each subject's total study time is
      approximately a 3-4 month period which includes screening visit, pre and post study overnight
      polysomnography, and therapy sessions of 3-4 a week for three months.
