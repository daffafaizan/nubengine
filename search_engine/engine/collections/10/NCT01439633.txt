      following a confirmed diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus will be recruited at Massachusetts
      General Hospital (MGH) . Along with Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) imaging and
      cautery marking for targeted biopsy, the patients will undergo a standard of care clinical
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedure including endoscopic random biopsy. This study
      requires the use of a balloon catheter which is a commonly used technique and is accepted in
      clinical practice for dilation of esophageal and colonic strictures and for photodynamic
      therapy.

      Once in position, the OFDI tissue marking laser will be activated by the physician. The
      physician will control the marking and make two marks of a duration of 2 seconds each. The 2
      seconds time period will limit the tissue effects to only the superficial layers of the
      esophageal mucosa.

      It is expected that the total experimental time including insertion and inflation of the OFDI
      balloon catheter, OFDI imaging, tissue marking, and removal of the OFDI balloon will add
      approximately 15 minutes to the total length of the EGD.
