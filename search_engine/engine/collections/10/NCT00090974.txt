      Primary

        -  Compare treatment-related symptoms using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
           Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire in postmenopausal women with
           receptor-positive stage I, II, or IIIA primary breast cancer undergoing treatment with
           exemestane vs anastrozole with or without celecoxib on protocol CAN-NCIC-MA27.

      Secondary

        -  Compare health-related quality of life using the FACT-ES questionnaire in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the extent to which differences in treatment-emergent symptoms affect overall
           quality of life in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, companion study. Patients receive treatment on CAN-NCIC-MA27.

      Health-related quality of life and treatment-related symptoms are assessed using the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire at
      baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,253 patients will be accrued for this study.
