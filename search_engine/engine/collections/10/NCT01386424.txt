      anticipation for future influenza pandemics puts influenza front and center in infectious
      disease research. Because the natural history and pathogenesis of human influenza has not
      been well characterized and cannot be adequately studied in animal models or with current in
      vitro techniques, important questions about influenza pathogenesis can only be approached
      through human challenge studies.

      Previous human challenge studies have addressed some aspects of the natural history by
      evaluating the timing of viral replication, shedding, clinical symptoms, and innate and
      adaptive immune responses. Although these studies have provided important information, all
      but one was performed prior to 1990. Without exception, these studies had limitations due to
      the scope of the study and/or the scientific techniques available at that time.

      While initially the protocol was designed to screen participants for influenza challenge
      studies, we have expanded our scope of research to include emerging and re-emerging
      infectious diseases.The primary goal of this study is to collect and store serum and RNA
      samples and obtain clinical and laboratory data from volunteers to determine in advance if
      they are potentially eligible to participate in future clinical studies. To accomplish this
      objective, up to 5000 participants will be enrolled in this protocol at the NIH Clinical
      Center clinic or day hospital in order to maintain a pool of participants who have been
      evaluated and can be screened for future LID Clinical Studies protocols.
