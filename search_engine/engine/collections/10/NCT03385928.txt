      eligible for treatment within 2 hours of stroke onset. A sample size of 326 patients is
      calculated to give 80% power to detect a large effect size assuming mean relative ICH
      haematoma growth of 38% in the placebo arm compared to 19% in the active treatment arm and
      standard deviation of 19%, inflated for nonparametric analysis. Adaptive increase in sample
      size will be performed if the result of interim analysis of the first 144 patients is
      promising, using the methodology of Mehta and Pocock. The maximum sample size is capped at
      326. Standard CT for initial diagnosis of suspected stroke patients will be performed.
      Neurological impairment and functional scores will be measured by a neurologist or health
      care professional trained in their administration. The assessors will be blinded to the
      treatment group. Patients eligible for the RCT will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either tranexamic acid or placebo stratified by treating centre and utilising randomly
      permuted blocks of random size.
