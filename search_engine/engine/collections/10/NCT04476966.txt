    
      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, Truncated AUC0→t Secondary Pharmacokinetic
      Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for transformed (with the
      90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, Truncated AUC0→t and for
      untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e.

      The confidence intervals of logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax,
      Truncated AUC0→t to be within 80.00-125.00%.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
