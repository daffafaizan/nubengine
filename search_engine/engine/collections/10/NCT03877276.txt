      of kidney stones. Oxalate is a small molecule found in plants and plant-derived food.
      Individuals that have high oxalate intake have an increased risk of developing kidney stones.
      The co-investigators have previously shown that healthy subjects that consume dietary oxalate
      have increased plasma and urine oxalate.

      White blood cells are essential for the immune response and rely on the mitochondria to carry
      out important cell functions. The Principal Investigator's current research shows that
      patients with calcium oxalate kidney stones have decreased mitochondrial function in their
      immune cells. Using the expertise of the investigators, this study will test whether oxalate
      has a direct effect on mitochondrial function in immune cells from healthy subjects. This
      information could help us understand the role of oxalate on the immune system during kidney
      stone pathogenesis.
