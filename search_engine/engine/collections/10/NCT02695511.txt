      that expected on the basis of loss of fat-free mass and fat mass even after weight
      stabilization. Aim 1: Determine the metabolic adaptation after 1 and 2 years of a 25% CR

      Hypothesis 2: The metabolic adaptation (what is not accounted by a decrease in FM and FFM) is
      not entirely accounted by reduced organ/tissue size (liver, spleen, kidney, heart and brain)
      but is accompanied by reduced activities of the sympathetic and thyroid systems. Aim 2:
      Assess the contribution of organ sizes and activities of the thyroid and sympathetic systems
      to the metabolic adaptation. Results will be compared to in vivo and in vitro oxidative
      phosphorylation (Smith, PI).

      Hypothesis 3: A decrease in markers of oxidative stress to lipid (urinary isoprostanes) DNA
      (strand breaks) in blood and protein (carbonylation and thiol oxidation) in blood and
      skeletal muscle tissue after 1 and 2 years of CR will be observed. Aim 3: Determine the
      changes in oxidative stress after 1 and 2 years of 25% CR by measuring urinary isoprostanes,
      serum carbonyls, DNA damage in nucleated blood cells and protein oxidation (carbonyls and
      oxidation of cysteine residues) in skeletal muscle.
