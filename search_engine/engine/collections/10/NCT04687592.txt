           energy trauma that causes a vertically-oriented shearing injury through the femoral
           neck.

        -  The most descriptive classification used for femoral neck fractures in young patients is
           the Pauwels classification. As the degree of the femoral neck fracture line relative to
           the horizontal plane increases, the types differ (30 degrees type I, between 30 degrees
           and 50 degrees type II, 50 degrees type III), and the instability of the fracture.

        -  Greater fracture verticality contributes to greater difficulty in obtaining adequate
           stability to resist vertical shear forces around the hip, thereby resulting in ascending
           greater risk of complications such as nonunion and osteonecrosis despite a number of
           potential fixation strategies.

        -  The primary goals of surgery include preservation of the femoral head, avoidance of
           osteonecrosis, and achievement of a stable union.

        -  Fixation options include cannulated screws, sliding hip screw with or without an
           additional derotation screw,. among orthopedic trauma surgeons there is no consensus
           that a single fixation Option is superior for treating these injuries.
