      function. Stationary cycling is one example of physical activity that can provide
      opportunities for residents who are inactive, living in long term care and are at high risk
      for falls.

      The use of jDome BikeAround provides older adults in long term care an opportunity to engage
      in a motivating reminiscence activity that is coupled with physical activity. Participants
      will be divided into two groups, one group will take part in jDome BikeAround sessions 3x per
      week for 6 weeks in addition to The Glebe Centre's Fall Prevention program, while the second
      group will just participant in Fall Prevention program. There will be a 6 week wash out, then
      the second cohort will participant in the jDome Bike Around sessions 3x a week in addition to
      the Fall Prevention program while the first cohort will just participate in the Fall
      Prevention Program.

      Participants will have their balance, mobility, leg strength, endurance tested as well as a
      tracking of fall risks at the beginning and end of each of the jDome BikeAround sessions (4
      measurement points). Feasibility will be determined by the ability to enroll an adequate
      number of participants, protocol completion by participants, and the number of adverse
      events.
