      The adverse effects of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) on short and long term
      quality of life are well documented. Patients experience numerous aversive symptoms (e.g.,
      nausea, fatigue, and sleep disturbance) that are accompanied by declines in physical and
      mental well-being. Although most longitudinal studies show return to baseline functioning for
      the majority of patients, it may take 6 to 12 months or longer to reach this goal. Clinical
      trials have shown that training in stress management techniques and participation in formal
      exercise programs each offered in isolation are effective in improving quality of life in
      patients receiving standard-dose chemotherapy and HCT. Review of these studies suggests that
      stress management interventions primarily improve mental health outcomes and nausea. The
      impact of exercise training interventions is more variable; most studies report physical
      health benefits, with some studies also reporting mental health benefits. Small studies
      suggest that combining stress management training and exercise are feasible and
      well-tolerated, but whether the combination provides an additive or synergistic impact on
      quality of life outcomes has not been directly investigated.

      Design Narrative:

      The protocol is designed as a factorial trial with two interventions, exercise and stress
      management, which results in four treatment arms: standard care, exercise only, stress
      management only and the combination of exercise and stress management. The primary objective
      of this randomized phase III trial is to test the ability of exercise training or stress
      management training to improve physical and mental functioning at Day 100 post hematopoietic
      cell transplantation.
