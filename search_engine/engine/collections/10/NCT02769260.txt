           established: an effect size of 0.35, an alpha error of 0.05 and a statistical power of
           87%. Assuming these criteria and using the repeated measures ANOVA test, a sample size
           of 15 subjects was required.

        -  Bacterial viability and thickness will be analyse by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope
           and Live/Dead BackLight staining solution.

        -  Bacterial diversity will be analyse by Pyrosequencing the 16S DNAr gene.
