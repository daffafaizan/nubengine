      lozenge 4 mg and Nicorette®gum 4 mg, after 12 hours of nicotine abstinence, with respect to
      steady-state nicotine pharmacokinetics, during 12 hours after start of the first
      administration. Multiple doses of each treatment are given once hourly during five separate
      treatment visits scheduled in a crossover setting with randomized treatment sequences. The
      study will include 40 healthy smokers between 18-50 years, who have been smoking at least 20
      cigarettes daily during at least one year preceding inclusion. Subjects and study personnel
      will be aware of which treatment is administered at a given visit.
