      controversial whether their incidence increases in hemiplegia. Based on the postulate that
      muscle weakness in hemiplegia predisposes rotator cuff injury due to biomechanical failure,
      this study aims to investigate whether the rotator cuff tears are associated with the muscle
      strength of the shoulder by observing hemiplegic shoulders of varying degree of paresis.
