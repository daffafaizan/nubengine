        1. Strict antiplatelet intake

        2. Strict anticoagulant intake

        3. uncorrected natural bleeding tendency e.g; patients with liver cell failure are at
           higher risk of perioperative bleeding when subjected to prostate surgery.

      Laser prostate surery was introduced to overcome this difficulty. However, till now there is
      no head to head comparision of different types of laser procedures in treating this subset of
      patients In the current study patients presented for BPH surgery in a tertiarry referral
      prostate unit will be assessed for bleeding tendency and will be treated either by Holmium
      laser enucleatiuon of the prostate or Greenlight laser vaporization of the prostate Single
      surgeon will perform all cases
