    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with newly diagnosed high-risk metastatic stage
           IV/clinical group IV rhabdomyosarcoma treated with upfront window therapy comprising
           irinotecan and vincristine.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen when given in alternating courses with
           vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) as continuation therapy in
           patients with partial or complete response.

        -  Determine the overall and failure-free survival of patients treated with irinotecan and
           vincristine followed by VAC alone or VAC alternating with vincristine and irinotecan
           plus radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and vincristine in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Upfront window therapy: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan
           IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of
           2 courses. Patients experiencing partial or complete response proceed to regimen A.
           Patients experiencing stable or progressive disease proceed to regimen B.

             -  Regimen A: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute weekly on weeks 6-13,
                15-19, 23-27, 29, 32-35, 38-39, and 41; dactinomycin IV over 1 minute weekly on
                weeks 6, 12, 23, 29, 35, and 41; and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes weekly
                on weeks 6, 12, 16, 19, 23, 29, 35, and 41. Patients also receive irinotecan IV
                over 1 hour daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 9, 10, 26, 27, 32, 33, 38, and 39 and
                undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, on weeks 15-22.

             -  Regimen B: Patients receive vincristine as in regimen A; dactinomycin IV over 1
                minute weekly on weeks 6, 9, 12, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, and 41 and
                cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes weekly on weeks 6, 9, 12, 16, 19, 23, 26,
                29, 32, 35, 38, and 41. Patients receive radiotherapy as in regimen A.

      Patients who do not receive upfront window irinotecan/vincristine therapy are treated with
      standard therapy.

        -  Standard therapy: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute weekly on weeks 0-13,
           15-19, 23-27, 29, 32-35, 38, and 41; dactinomycin IV over 1 minute weekly on weeks 0, 6,
           9, 12, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, and 41; and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes weekly
           on weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 19, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38, and 41. Patients without
           evidence of intracranial extension receive radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week,
           during weeks 15-22. Patients with evidence of intracranial extension, or who require
           emergency radiotherapy, receive radiotherapy during weeks 0-6. Dactinomycin is withheld
           during radiotherapy.

      All patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) or sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC)
      beginning 24 hours after completion of each course of chemotherapy and continuing until blood
      counts recover. Alternatively, patients may receive pegfilgrastim SC beginning 24-36 hours
      after completion of each course of chemotherapy and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-24
      months.
