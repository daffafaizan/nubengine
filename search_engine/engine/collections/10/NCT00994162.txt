    
      Patients meeting the eligibility criteria and agreeing to consent to their participation in
      the evaluation will receive treatment with the evaluation product for a maximum of 10
      dressing changes or up to a maximum of 30 days treatment with the EZCareâ—Š product, whichever
      comes first. Treatment will commence on Day 0 and dressing changes will take place as deemed
      appropriate by the Clinician responsible for the patient, however it is recommended that the
      dressing is changed at least every 3 days in accordance with the product instructions for
      use.

      Treatment will stop when, in the opinion of the Clinician, sufficient wound progress has
      taken place to merit a change in treatment regime i.e. surgical intervention (e.g. graft) or
      the use of more traditional dressings. Treatment with the evaluation product will not proceed
      past 30 days.

      Patients will be treated with a pressure setting of between 40mmHg and 80mmHg for the
      duration of treatment.

      A follow up wound assessment will take place 7 days post treatment discontinuation.

      If required, debridement may be performed prior to and during the patients participation in
      this evaluation.
