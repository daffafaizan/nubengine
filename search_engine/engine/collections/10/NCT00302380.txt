      ADHD with specific aims:

        1. To examine dopamine transporter (DAT) receptor binding potential in adults with ADHD,
           using PET scanning with 11C altropane as the ligand. We hypothesize that compared to
           adults without ADHD, adults with ADHD will have greater DAT binding that will not be
           accounted by psychiatric comorbidity or age.

        2. To examine the relationship of DAT binding to clinical features of ADHD. We hypothesize
           that DAT binding will be positively correlated with a) severity of ADHD symptoms and b)
           neuropsychological and interpersonal dysfunction.

        3. To examine the relationship between DAT binding and genetic risk factors. We hypothesize
           that DAT binding will be specifically associated with homozygosity of the DAT (480) gene
           in adults with ADHD and not with other ADHD-associated genetic markers (e.g., DRD4-7,
           D2, DBH).
