    
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either a positive affect skills intervention or a
      psychoeducation control group, with each intervention lasting 8-weeks. Participants in the
      positive affect skills intervention will have full access to the unchanged Happify platform.

      The psychoeducation control group participants will use a version of the Happify platform
      that encourages thinking about well-being through quizzes and polls without providing any
      instructions for promotion (i.e., Wait-list Control). Participants will be asked to complete
      questionnaires before and after the 8-week program, at which point study participation will
      end.
