      only 20% of U.S. adults take regular exercise and they have difficulty maintaining new
      healthy behaviors. The goal of this study is to use a planning intervention to help establish
      and maintain a daily step regimen in working midlife adults. The investigators will ask
      participants to plan when, where, and how to act on a daily walking goal in conjunction with
      a scheduling intervention to increase the chances that they will maintain this new regimen.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: consistent schedule,
      inconsistent schedule, no schedule. All participants will be provided with an accelerometer
      to measure their daily activity and as a behavioral support for our intervention and they
      will be given a step goal. The goal given to each individual will be to increase immediately
      their daily steps to a level based on recommended guidelines (e.g., Hill, Wyatt, Reed, and
      Peters, 2003). The investigators will test which version of the scheduling intervention is
      most successful for increasing and maintaining step counts. It is predicted that participants
      in the consistent schedule condition will increase their step count more than those
      participants in the no schedule control condition, and that they will maintain this activity
      for a longer period after the intervention period is complete than those participants in the
      inconsistent schedule condition.
