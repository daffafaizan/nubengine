      the weight based dosing of 4-8 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose of 60mg/day. The results have
      shown high rates of clinical and elecroencephalographic remission with lower relapse
      rates.However, a major concern related to corticosteroids, especially in infants and
      children, is the possible development of side effects. The most frequent ones are excessive
      weight gain, hyperphagia, water retention with edema, cushingoid appearance, hypertension,
      behavioral disturbances, increased infection susceptibility, leukopenia, electrolyte
      disturbances, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, impaired glucose tolerance, frank diabetes and sleep
      disorders. Furthermore, long-term side effects such as hypothalamus-pituitary axis
      suppression, psychosis, osteoporosis, nephrocalcinosis, brain atrophy, cataracts and, in
      children, growth retardation, have also been reported.

      Recently, role of intravenous methylprednislone pulse therapy has been explored as one of the
      therapeutic modality in IS, in order to avoid the development of side-effects associated with
      prolonged oral steroid therapy and maintain long-term efficacy. There have been few studies
      on use of iv pulse methylprednisolone in IS with small sample size, showing to a rapid
      improvement in EEG & cessation of spasm in majority of the infants without significant
      adverse effects.

      Emerging evidence suggests that intravenous pulse methylprednisolone might have superior
      efficacy and better safety profile when compared to high dose oral prednisolone in treatment
      of IS.

      Hence, present study aims at comparing intravenous pulse methylprednisolone versus oral
      prednisolone in an open label, RCT for treatment of children with IS.
