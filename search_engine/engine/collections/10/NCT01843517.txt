      associated with microscopic or gross tissue injury to the mother. Since this experience is
      widespread and occurs relatively early in life, the psychosocial, medical, and financial
      consequences of chronic pain following childbirth could be enormous. Surprisingly, previous
      studies with long term follow up of new mothers have included pain as a secondary measure and
      / or have focused on prevalence of pain without determining whether pain predated delivery or
      even pregnancy itself. The investigators recently performed a long term follow up study of
      over 1,200 women, and noted that pain which began during the childbirth itself was
      surprisingly rare in comparison to other physical injuries. Additionally, two central factors
      hypothesized to confer risk of chronic pain after other injuries including surgery,
      pre-dating chronic pain and degree of tissue and nerve injury, contributed minimally to the
      acute and sub-acute pain after childbirth. These two observations, low incidence of chronic
      pain and minimal effect of degree of tissue injury and history of chronic pain on sub-acute
      pain, point towards a potential protective effect of pregnancy or delivery on the response to
      physical injury.
