      The cases had total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels identified in blood samples before the
      operation. Patients given routine general anesthesia and postoperative monitoring procedures
      were assessed in terms of respiratory complications during anesthesia induction, extubation,
      anesthesia recovery and the first 24 hours postoperative.

      This research observed that patients with low preoperative 25OHD vitamin levels encountered
      respiratory complications related to general anesthesia more often. Especially in the early
      postoperative period there is a very significant difference between complications and low
      25OHD vitamin levels. Our study results show that low vitamin D levels may be a potential
      risk in terms of respiratory complications related to general anesthesia causing severe
      morbidity and mortality increase. The results lead to the consideration that optimizing
      vitamin D levels in the preoperative period for patients undergoing general anesthesia may
      aid in reducing complications.
