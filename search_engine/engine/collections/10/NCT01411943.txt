      with breast cancer experience distressing symptoms. Inflammatory activation and epigenetic
      alterations have been associated with the etiology of cancer. To date, no investigators have
      considered these epigenetic processes as possible mechanisms associated with the etiology of
      distressing symptoms in women with breast cancer. The specific aims of this study are to
      examine:

        1. The frequency and severity of psychoneurological (PN) symptoms (depressive symptoms,
           anxiety, sleep disturbances, fatigue, pain and cognitive dysfunction)and the
           interrelationship among PN symptoms at each time point

        2. Levels of inflammation and to quantify the frequency and genome-wide location of changes
           in epigenetic patterns across time following chemotherapy

        3. The relationship among inflammation, epigenetic changes, and the development, severity,
           and persistence of PN symptoms across time The study results may potentially deepen
           understanding regarding the biological processes underlying PN symptoms and lead to
           improved strategies for symptom management in women with breast cancer.
