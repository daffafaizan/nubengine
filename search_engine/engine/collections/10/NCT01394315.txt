      chemotherapy for breast cancer will undergo baseline clinical examination, mammography,
      ultrasound, MRI and DOT before commencement of treatment. DOT will be repeated at 1,3,6 weeks
      after chemotherapy, and at the end of each chemotherapy regimen. Ultrasound will be repeated
      every 6 weeks and at the end of treatment. Mammography and MRI will be repeated once at the
      end of treatment before surgery. A breast pathologist will evaluate the subtype of breast
      cancer and the pathologic response of the operative specimen at the end of treatment. Patient
      satisfaction questionnaires will be administered to evaluate their preferences for DOT,
      ultrasound, mammography and MRI scanning at the beginning and the end of the study.
