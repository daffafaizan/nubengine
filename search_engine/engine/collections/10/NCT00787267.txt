      percent of patients initially treated with surgery or radiotherapy recur and become
      candidates for systemic therapy. Src expression has been identified in a majority of NSCLC
      cell lines and may be important in hypoxic growth and angiogenesis of NSCLC.

      This phase II trial will investigate the activity of the oral Src inhibitor dasatinib in
      advanced stage NSCLC. We hypothesize that the inhibition of Src pathway with dasatinib will
      show anti-tumor activity in advanced NSCLC, with a tolerable safety profile.

      Fresh frozen tissue is needed for the genomics analysis, thus a biopsy will be required to
      participate in this trial. The genomic analysis will determine if the tumor is Src-active or
      Src-inactive and responses to dasatinib compared. In stage I, 40 patients will be treated
      without prior knowledge of their tumoral Src-activity. If all stage I responses are observed
      in the Src-active patients, the second stage will only accrue that cohort. If all responses
      are observed in the Src-inactive cohort, the activity of dasatinib and genomic determination
      of dasatinib response will be re-evaluated. Otherwise, if during Stage I, responses are
      observed in both cohorts, they will be accrued separately and evaluated in a two-stage
      manner.

      Dasatinib will be give orally twice daily and continue until progression of disease,
      intolerable toxicity or patient withdrawal. Imaging studies will be done pre-treatment then
      every 6 weeks to assess radiologic response to therapy.

      Patients will be followed for 30 days after the last dose of dasatinib to assess toxicity.
