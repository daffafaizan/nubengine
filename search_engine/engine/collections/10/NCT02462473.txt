      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study), pilot clinical utility study with a sequential and parallel cohort design in
      participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The study
      consists of up to 3 Phases: Screening Phase (Screening and first assessment visit should
      preferably take place on the same day), active assessment phase (12 weeks, An optional 12
      week extension phase. Participants will be assigned to Cohort 1, or randomized to Cohort 2 or
      Cohort 3. Participants in cohorts 2 and 3 who are receiving long acting injectable (LAI)
      formulations of paliperidone and/or risperidone and complete participation in the active
      assessment phase) will have the option of continuing into the extension phase. The duration
      of study participation will be approximately 12 weeks. Participants in the optional extension
      phase will have an additional 12 weeks of study participation. The primary outcome will be
      measured by the number of Medication Treatment Modifications (MTMs) made by the clinician at
      every visit. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
