      randomized.

      Patients had to have been seen by their primary care provider in the last 6 months to be
      eligible and therefore had a "missed opportunity" for Hepatitis C screening.

      Control group received "usual care" which in our system included alert (health maintenance
      reminder) to the primary care provider at the time of the visit and passive alert in their
      personal health record (i.e. an alert if they log into their personal health record and look
      for reminders for preventative care that it due/overdue).

      Intervention group received same care as control group plus automatic ordering of the
      hepatitis C screening test and active electronic letter their personal health record that
      they were due for hepatitis C screening, what hepatitis C is, what the testing and if
      positive, treatment could involve, and instruction to go to one of the laboratories in the
      healthcare system to have their blood drawn if they were interested in the testing.
