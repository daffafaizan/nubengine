      time points before and during treatment with TTFields. All patients who are offered treatment
      with TTFields will also be offered enrollment in this non-randomized, observational study.
      Imaging data will include the standard battery of MRI sequences, which includes DWI and ADC
      reconstruction. These data will be collected at standard time points and the proposed study
      will not rely on any additional imaging or tests outside of the clinical standard of care.
