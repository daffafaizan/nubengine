      practitioners and open-care paediatricians. This is a national, repeated transversal
      epidemiological study with two data measurement time-points over a period of two years (T1 in
      2009, T2 in 2011, two different samples of physicians) in order to assess immunization
      practices before introduction of the reimbursement of InfanrixHexaÂ®, during the transition
      period and then during the period following reimbursement of the vaccine. At each collection
      time-point, two patient age groups will be investigated: 12-15 months and 24-27 months, thus
      providing measurements before/after reimbursement.
