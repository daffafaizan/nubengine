      mycophenolate sodium are immunosuppressive drugs approved for the prevention of transplant
      rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an effective treatment in systemic lupus
      erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases.

      MMF has been used as maintenance therapy after treatment with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody)
      in a pSS patient. We have reported a case of successful treatment with MMF in pSS with
      vasculitis.

      The recent observations and the immunosuppressive effect of MPA in other autoimmune diseases
      led us to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MPA treatment in patients with pSS refractory
      to other immunosuppressive agents.

      The observation period will be 6 months. At baseline, after 3, and after 6 months we examine
      the clinical status including glandular function tests as well as different laboratory
      parameters associated with pSS. In addition subjective parameters will be determined on the
      basis of different questionnaires.
