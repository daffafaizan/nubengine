      assess lateral displacement of the femoral head and is being used in the Swedish and in the
      Danish surveillance programme. Most children with an MP > 40 % need surgery to prevent
      further displacement and prevent dislocation of the hip. In the Swedish surveillance
      programme they have developed the Cerebral Palsy Follow-Up Programme (CPUP) hip score as a
      risk score to determine which children are at high or low risk for hip displacement (MP > 40
      %) within five years after first radiographic examination.

      The aim of this study is to predict the likelihood that a child with cerebral palsy will
      develop hip displacement (MI> 40) within three years. The design is a prediction study.

      Data will be obtained from the national clinical quality database the Danish Cerebral Palsy
      Follow-up Program and the Danish National Patient Register.
