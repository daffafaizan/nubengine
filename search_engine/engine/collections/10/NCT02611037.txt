    
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 study with a lead in safety cohort to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoperfusion treatment with cisplatin (35 mg/m2^),
      methotrexate (100 mg/m^2) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m^2) in patients with unresectable MPM.
      During the lead in phase of the study, 3 patients will be treated with 50% reduced dose of
      methotrexate (50 mg/m^2) and regular doses of cisplatin (35 mg/m^2 body surface area (BSA))
      and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m^2 BSA).
