      So far the impact of a preoperative lymph node scintigraphy is unclear. Several studies
      indicate sentinel node biopsy to be a reliable method irrespective of prior lymph node
      scintigraphy, but data from prospective randomized trials are not available.

      Although a preoperative lymph node scintigraphy is not explicitly demanded in current S3
      guidelines in Germany its performance is a common practice.

      If a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy could be safely omitted, possible benefits are a
      facilitation of the preoperative workflow as well as cost reduction for health care systems.

      This study aims to clarify whether a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is of additional benefit
      in a prospective randomized study design. In the two study arms sentinel node biopsy is
      performed either with or without knowledge of the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy findings.
      Primary end point is the average number of histologically detected sentinel lymph nodes per
      patient in both treatment arms.
