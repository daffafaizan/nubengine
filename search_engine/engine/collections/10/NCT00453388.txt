      I. Identify doses of total-body irradiation (TBI) that lead to sufficient probability of
      donor engraftment (> 5% donor cluster of differentiation [CD]3 chimerism) by day +200.

      II. Evaluate the probability of severe acute graft-versus-host disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the probabilities of overall survival, regimen-related toxicity (RRT), and
      recurrent hematopoietic malignancy in those patients with a prior underlying history of such.

      II. Examine the degree to which mixed chimerism provides for amelioration of symptoms (i.e.,
      infections due to neutropenia, hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia) associated with bone
      marrow failure.

      III. Determine if the FA complementation group and % initial mosaicism predict engraftment
      and RRT outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      NOTE: Patients no longer receive pre-transplant cyclophosphamide as of February 2009.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then annually
      thereafter.
