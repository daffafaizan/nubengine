      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) because they were excluded from the
      major FFR studies. We will evaluate the feasibility and hyperemic efficacy of IV adenosine in
      patients with HFrEF in comparison with IC nicorandil for invasive physiological assessment
      using a coronary pressure wire. Patients with an angiographically intermediate lesion (40-70%
      diameter stenosis) in a major epicardial coronary artery and with left ventricle ejection
      fraction â‰¤40% will be prospectively enrolled. FFR under the various hyperemic stimulation
      using IV adenosine 140 & 180, IC adenosine, and IC nicorandil will be measured sequentially.
