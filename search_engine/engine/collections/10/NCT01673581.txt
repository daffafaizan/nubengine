      regarding treatment, knowledge about their disease and discussion with the physicians at
      initial patient visit. This initial survey should take approximately 20 minutes. Once
      patients have selected a treatment path investigators will contact them again and ask them to
      fill out a short 10-minute survey online or by mail. Investigators will contact patients by
      phone 2 weeks after their initial visit to see if they have made a decision. If not,
      investigators will contact patients by phone every 2 weeks or at an interval that works for
      the patient's schedule. Finally, 3 months after the initial visit today investigators will
      contact patients for the last time and again ask you to fill out a short 10-minute survey
      online or by mail.

      Once patients have completed the final survey there are no future surveys planned.
      Investigators may contact patients by phone in the future to ask them to participate in
      another study.
