      genetic basis for cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), various phenotypes of CVS (e.g. menstrual,
      Sato, calendar-tied) and migraine headaches (e.g. with aura, without aura, hemiplegic
      migraine). This information will allow physicians to improve care for patients who have been
      diagnosed with this disease and to provide their parents with more complete information
      regarding the cause of this disease. This research is being done because many unanswered
      questions remain regarding children with CVS.
