      and interviews with patients) matched cohort (designated group followed or traced over a
      period of time) study using IMS LRx database. This database covers 65% of all retail
      prescriptions in the United States and includes mail service and specialty pharmacy provider
      prescriptions independent of the method of payment. The study will include Opioid naive
      patients exposed to tapentadol immediate release (IR) or oxycodone IR from July 2009 to
      December 2010. A naive patient is a patient who has not received an opioid of any type in the
      3 months before the index date. The index date is the date of the first prescription for
      tapentadol IR or oxycodone IR after June 30, 2009. Patients will be followed for 1 year from
      their index dates. Each tapentadol IR-exposed patient will be matched to up to 4 oxycodone
      IR-exposed patients. Matching will allow to control in the design for potential confounding
      variables such as time of the exposure, geographic area, specialty of the prescriber, and
      age. These are variables that have been related with the risk of shopping behavior or abuse.
