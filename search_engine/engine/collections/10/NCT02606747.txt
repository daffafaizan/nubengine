      contains sensory reduction, pain, muscle wastage and so on. Sensory and motor nervous are one
      of the most important factors in balance control, the reduction of balance ability will
      result in high risk of fall.

      Most studies about DPN are focus on peripheral nervous, however, the central nervous system
      may also be involved in DPN patients. In this study, force platform, proprioception test and
      fMRI will be used to evaluate balance ability, proprioception and the brain function
      information of DPN patients, which will help to understand the relationship between
      peripheral and central nervous system.
