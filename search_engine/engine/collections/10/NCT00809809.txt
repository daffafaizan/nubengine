      treating herpes infections in vivo and have been shown in a clinical trial to be a effective
      topical treatment for HSL. Zinc salt solutions applied to herpetic lesions decrease viral
      load and markedly improve healing rates, relieving the symptoms of herpes as healing occurs.
      Zinc swabs contain 33 mmol/l of ionic Zinc in an emulsification of Benzalkonium chloride,
      glycerin, hydroxyethylcellulose, sodium chloride, and sodium hydroxide (ph 7.2). Zinc
      gluconate is monographed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS) and one
      of OTC indications for Zinc and its salts is for the treatment of cold sores.
