      melatonin (0.5 mg/kg). If that dose proves to be safe, subjects 11-20 will receive an
      increased dose of melatonin (3 mg/kg). Subjects 21-30 will receive a dose increased to the
      targeted projected therapeutic dose (5 mg/kg).

      The serum concentration of melatonin and capture adverse event reports during this dose
      escalation study in neonates undergoing hypothermia and the long-term safety and potential
      efficacy via developmental follow-up performed at 18-22 months of age. In addition, this
      study will determine the effect of melatonin on the inflammatory cascade, oxidative stress,
      free radical production, and serum biomarkers of brain injury in neonates undergoing
      hypothermia.
