      treatment for curatively resected gastric cancer patients after it proved its effecacy in the
      CLASSIC trial. Adjuvant XELOX chemotherapy is a long-term treatment with a total treatment
      period of 6 months and it is known that about 33% of patients cannot complete treatment
      schedule due to side effects. In particular, peripheral neuropathy, which is caused by the
      cumulative administration of oxaliplatin, is a major cause of lowering the patient's quality
      of life and treatment compliance, and it is known that the incidence rate increases when
      standard XELOX treatment is continued for more than 6 cycles. In colorectal cancer, clinical
      studies have been actively conducted to shorten the duration of standard adjuvant
      chemotherapy to reduce the peripheral sensory neuropathy caused by oxaliplatin, but there are
      no relevant studies in gastric cancer.

      This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of reduced adjuvant XELOX treatment (4
      cycles of XELOX followed by 4 cycles of capecitabine alone) to standard adjuvant XELOX
      treatment (8 cycles of XELOX).
