      activities such as work, recreation and social participation. In turn, these impairments can
      diminish quality of life. However, the relationship between PTSD, functioning and quality of
      life remains incompletely understood.

      Since achieving full participation in daily activities is the main goal of occupational
      therapy, and since quality of life is a primary treatment success measure, it is important to
      fully understand the relationship between PTSD, participation and quality of life.

      Various studies show that dissociation affects different body functions that manage and
      monitor mental functioning. Since quality of life is a subjective measure that relies on
      one's ability to mentally represent himself and others it is important to tack into
      consideration the way that dissociation affects the relationships described above.

      The research contains 4 Questionnaires that will be filed out by the participants and the
      data from the Questionnaires will be analyzed and compared.
