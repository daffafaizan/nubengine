      hemiplegia/ total paralysis of one side of the body, including the face, arm and leg. The IH
      is quit rare condition and occurs in 1 in 1000 live births. however, the condition is
      reported to cause functional and cognitive disability. Children with IH suffer from poor
      attention particularly visual attention, that is essential to be understand the written
      language. A focused reading is essential in learning and children with IH possess moderate
      intelligence and attend school.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation(tTCS) is a novel intervention that use small
      amplitude electrical currents to stimulate the essential areas of the brain through surface
      electrodes placed on the corresponding areas of the brain.

      The eligible children were divided into two groups. one group received tDCS with visual
      attention activities and the second group received sham tDCS with similar activities. The
      effect will be assessed before and after with Strops-color testing and a academic reading
      test.

      The experiment intends to explore the affect of tTCS on visual attention span among children
      with Left-sided infantile hemiplegia.
