      marketed in both the USA and Canada under the trade name PGX® (PolyGlycopleX) (InovoBiologic
      Inc, Calgary, AB, Canada). This complex consists of three viscous non starch polysaccharides
      which are processed using proprietary technology (EnviroSimplex®) to produce compressed
      granules which delays the onset of viscosity and increases palatability of the fiber when
      added to food. Previously, this fibre was shown to lower postprandial glucose levels in a
      dose responsive manner when mixed with a glucose drink and sprinkled onto a standard white
      bread demonstrating that the processing did not interfere with the effectiveness of the
      fiber. From this study the reduction in GI was calculated to be 7 units per gram of NVP when
      added to a solid food, however it is not known whether this relationship would be maintained
      when the NVP was added to a range of commonly eaten foods. This study therefore evaluates the
      effect of the addition or incorporation of NVP into a range of foods on postprandial glycemia
      and whether the reductions in glycemic index could be predicted using.
