        -  Determine the toxicity of 2 different schedules of motexafin gadolinium as a
           radiosensitizer in patients with glioblastoma multiforme receiving cranial radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated doses of this drug on these 2 schedules in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the biodistribution of this drug in both neoplastic tissue and normal brain
           parenchyma in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect and accumulation of this drug in both normal brain parenchyma and
           neoplastic tissue in these patients.

        -  Correlate the effect and accumulation of this drug in both normal brain parenchyma and
           neoplastic tissue with the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium (PCI-0120).
      Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive PCI-0120 IV over 30-60 minutes once every other day for 6
           weeks. Patients concurrently undergo cranial radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6
           weeks.

        -  Group II: Patients receive PCI-0120 IV over 30-60 minutes once daily concurrently during
           radiotherapy. Patients undergo cranial radiotherapy as in group I.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each group receive escalating doses of PCI-0120 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
