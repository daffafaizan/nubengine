           Paravertebral blocks、surface spray anesthesia and Vagus block） and group D（non-intubated
           general anesthesia combine with Paravertebral blocks、surface spray anesthesia、Vagus
           block and Phrenic block）randomly.

        2. Compare the volume of anesthetic drugs between the two groups.

        3. If the date of group S greater than group D，it shows that the effect of anesthetic
