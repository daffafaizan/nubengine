      a patient does not meet inclusion criteria after signing the consent for and undergoing
      venogram/IVUS (screen fail), additional patients will be enrolled until 60 patients have been
      successfully randomized. Up to 80 patients will be consented in order to account for
      potential screen fails. Randomized patients will be followed monthly until their ulcer heals,
      every 3 months after healing for one year postoperatively.

      Every patient subject will undergo venogram & IVUS. The investigator experience with over 600
      patients who underwent venous stenting at Mount Sinai - all of whom had preoperative MR
      venogram or CT venogram - revealed that pre-operative imaging missed the diagnosis of PVOO in
      approximately 10% of patients (this is unpublished data). Due to the small sample size of
      this pilot study, the very low risks associated with venogram and IVUS, and the 100% accuracy
      of venogram and IVUS in diagnosing PVOO, every study subject will undergo these two imaging
      studies. Once the diagnosis of PVOO is confirmed, the study subject will be immediately
      randomized in the OR. Study subjects randomized to convention therapy plus venous stents will
      undergo venous stent placement at the same sitting. For study subjects randomized to
      conventional therapy alone, the procedure will be terminated after venogram and IVUS.
