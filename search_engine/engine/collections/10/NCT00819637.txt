      mainstay of treatment is inhalation albuterol, either levalbuterol or racemic mixture, in
      repetitive fashion depending on the resolution of the airways obstruction. Formoterol is a
      long-acting (>12 hours) selective beta2-agonist that has a very rapid onset of
      bronchodilatation (<3 minutes and thus similar to that produced by albuterol). Patients with
      acute bronchospasm could benefit from the prn use of formoterol as they would receive acute
      relief of their symptoms and this would last for a prolonged time period. Additionally
      formoterol has been reported to be 28-109 times as potent as albuterol and safe at doses of
      54ug in healthy subjects and asthmatics. Racemic formoterol structurally has 2 chiral centers
      and thus is composed of 4 enantiomers. The RR form (or arformoterol) is the active
      bronchodilator and it is not clear what the physiologic actions of the other 3 enantiomers
      are. This study is the first to evaluate nebulized arformoterol solution for therapy of acute
      asthmatics presenting to the Emergency Department.
