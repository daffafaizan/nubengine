      connected with the simultaneous administration of Oral Anticoagulants (OA) and the influenza
      virus vaccine were evaluated in several small studies which yielded conflicting results, thus
      encouraging additional investigations with prospective studies in order to obtain a more
      consistent evidence about the safety and efficacy of vaccination against influenza virus in
      patients on OA Treatment.
