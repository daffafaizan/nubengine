      management of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) with coexistence of atherosclerotic intracranial
      arterial stenosis (AIAS), whose management strategies are inconsistent. Meanwhile, as a new
      cooperative interventional modality, optimized workflows, technical key knots and operation
      routines will be explored in the study.

      Objects: Patients with IAs with coexistence of AIAS, coincident with inclusion and exclusion
      criterion and admitted in participating organizations.

      Methods: Patients will be distributed into 2 groups, including traditional therapy
      group(control group) and hybrid operating group(trial group), and conduct with traditional
      multi-stage neurosurgical management or one-stage hybrid operating management
      correspondingly. The morbidity rate of peri-operative cerebral hemorrhagic/ischemic event is
      considered to be the primary observing indicator, and morbidity rate of peri-operative
      cerebral hemorrhagic/ischemic event, while peri-operative mortality rate, and health-economic
      indicators are secondary indicators.The information of operations will be recorded in detail
      as evidence of optimization of workflow and technical key knots.
