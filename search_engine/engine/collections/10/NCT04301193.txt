      bleeding spearheads as the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. One of the
      hurdles that clinicians confront is a lack of point of care coagulation system that can
      hasten the clinical management strategy in the right direction. Conventional methods take
      considerable time to obtain results. TEG and ROTEM are currently doing the job however these
      two modalities requires expertise and proficient training to perform test and interpret
      results. The level of expertise to run the TEG and ROTEM poses hurdles for providing
      coagulation around the clock as it requires trained operators. What is currently required for
      efficient and effective management of obstetric hemorrhage is a point of care coagulation
      system in the operating room and or labor and delivery suite that is user friendly, easy and
      quick to perform. In this study the investigators will evaluate a new point of care Quantra
      Hemostasis Analyzer system to assess coagulation rapidly with ease.
