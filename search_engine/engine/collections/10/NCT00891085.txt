      A prospective, randomized trial directly comparing open lung ventilation (OLV) with
      spontaneous breathing (SB) utilizing BiVent on the Maquet Servo-I versus synchronized
      intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV) will be conducted in the trauma-surgical intensive
      care unit at the University Hospital (TSICU). Both OLV-SB and SIMV protocols have been
      designed according to lung protective strategies. The primary goal of the SOLV trial is to
      see determine if the early application of open lung ventilation will less ventilator days. In
      addition, several secondary endpoints will be evaluated. It is not anticipated that this
      study will be powered to show a mortality difference.
