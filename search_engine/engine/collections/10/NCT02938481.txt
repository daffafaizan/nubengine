      the bowel and marginal artery is high. The optimal extent of bowel resection is closely
      associated with how we define 'regional' pericolic LNs, which should be resected because of
      the risk of metastasis. However, there are no standardised criteria for 'regional' LNs in the
      pericolic area.

      To establish a consensus for the extent of bowel resection and appropriate central LN
      dissection, international prospective stdies focusing on the distribution of metastatic LNs
      along the bowel and the primary feeding artery are conducted.
