      over-nutrition and may stress the fetal pancreas because of the increased demand for insulin.
      Such intrauterine programming events affect birth weight and raise the offspring's risk
      trajectory for future obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and premature death.
      Investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial in 200 overweight or obese
      pregnant Puerto Rican women (free of diabetes) and their infants, to favorably impact
      metabolic health in mothers and infants.

      Women presenting will be randomized to a lifestyle modification intervention or standard care
      control group before 16 gestational weeks. The intervention will focus on improving: (1)
      physical activity levels and (2) diet quality and calorie intake. The lifestyle intervention
      will be delivered within an empowerment theoretical framework through individualized
      intervention sessions, intensive group sessions, and by phone calls. The intervention will
      continue through the first postpartum year and will include the infants. A key objective is
      to evaluate whether the intervention optimizes infant BMI z-score. We will also evaluate
      whether the intervention increases the number of women who experience appropriate gestational
      weight gain, and evaluate several additional aims including relating the interventions with
      improved insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in the women, and insulin concentrations
      adjusted for glucose in their infants.This study will also help us to identify and overcome
      barriers to develop effective ways of intervening during pregnancy to meaningfully improve
      cardio-metabolic risk trajectories of future generations.
