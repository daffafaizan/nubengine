      standard treatment for OSA is with the use of a CPAP machine. The CPAP provides an air
      pressure to keep the airways opened during sleep so that a person with OSA can breathe
      normally. When used appropriately, the CPAP improves sleepiness and quality of life. However,
      about half of the patients who receive a CPAP prescription cannot tolerate it and thus remain
      untreated and are potentially at increased cardiovascular and diabetes risk. In light of
      this, this study aims to see if the use of an alternative treatment for OSA, oral appliance
      therapy, where adherence is generally superior to CPAP, will improve cardiometabolic outcomes
      in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. This pilot trial will primarily examine feasibility and
      assess recruitment rates.
