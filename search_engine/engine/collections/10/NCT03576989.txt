      (PMN) that are associated with persistent inflammation in the wound bed. The proposed
      research is to test the efficacy of an oral, nutrient intervention containing the bioactive
      components of fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA + docosahexaenoic acid - DHA) to assuage
      PMN activity and promote healing. The study plans to include 248 successive eligible adults â‰¥
      55 years of age with CVLUs who continue to receive standard care at two university
      out-patient wound clinics. Participants will be randomized to 2 groups: 12 weeks of daily
      oral therapy with EPA+DHA (1.87 g/d of EPA + 1.0 g/d of DHA) or daily oral therapy with
      placebo. At 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks, across the 2 groups, three specific aims will be pursued:

      Aim 1. Compare levels of EPA+DHA-derived lipid mediators, and inflammatory cytokines in blood
      and CVLU fluid.

      Subaim 1a. Compare inflammatory cytokine gene expression by PMNs in blood (neutrophils and
      monocytes).

      Aim 2. Compare PMN activation (blood, CVLU fluid), and PMN-derived protease levels (CVLU
      fluid).

      Aim 3. Compare reduction in wound area, controlling for key factors known to affect healing,
      and determine relationships with lipid mediators, cytokines and PMN activation.

      Subaim 3a. Compare frequency of CVLU recurrence and levels of study variables in blood
      between 2 subgroups within the EPA+DHA group with healed CVLUs (after 3 additional months of
      EPA+DHA therapy versus placebo therapy beyond Week 12 time point).

      Subaim 3b. Compare the symptom of pain at all time points and quality of life at first and
      last study visits across the 2 groups and 2 subgroups.
