      in spite of the immediate effectiveness of treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT). Continuing use of therapy skills following treatment is associated with maintenance of
      treatment gains. We have programmed a telephone to deliver pre-recorded summaries and
      rehearsal sessions of skills learned in therapy. The system also includes monthly feedback
      messages from therapists. We expect that this ad-lib access to therapy skills would allow
      patients to generalize skills to their personal post-treatment lives. It would also allow
      individuals in remote or rural areas to obtain access to assistance without travel barriers.

      Comparison(s): patients completing group CBT for substance abuse will be randomly assigned to
      two conditions. In one condition, patients will have unlimited access to the therapeutic
      telephone system for 4 months. The other condition is standard care (i.e., no formal relapse
      prevention).
