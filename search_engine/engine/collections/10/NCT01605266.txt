      genetic, serologic and environmental factors contributing to nephrotic syndrome and disease
      progression. This is a large multiethnic cohort to test hypotheses of gene and environmental
      risk factors and disease progression. Participants are recruited from Toronto, Ontario and
      surrounding regions. Additional sites will be added on in the future.
