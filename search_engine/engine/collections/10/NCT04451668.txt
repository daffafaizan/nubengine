    
      This study will enroll subjects with narcolepsy, either NT1 or NT2, who completed the FT218
      Phase 3 REST-ON study as well as eligible subjects with narcolepsy currently receiving a
      stable dose of twice nightly sodium oxybate IR. Following a screening period, subjects who
      meet the entry criteria will be enrolled into the study. Subjects who completed the FT218
      Phase 3 REST-ON study will initiate treatment with FT218 at 4.5 g and will follow a titration
      schedule up to the highest tolerate dose (up to 9 g), or the dose deemed effective by the
      investigator. Subjects previously maintained on twice nightly sodium oxybate IR will initiate
      FT218 treatment at a dose equivalent or closest to the total gram dose of twice-nightly
      sodium oxybate IR and then titrate up or down, in accord with safety and effectiveness as
      determined by the investigator.
