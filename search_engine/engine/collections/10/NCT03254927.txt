    
      CDX-3379 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 3 (HER3 or ErbB3) found on certain cells and may act to promote
      anti-tumor effects.

      Cetuximab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks EGFR, a protein receptor that regulates
      cell growth.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of CDX-3379 in combination
      with cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have
      previously received cetuximab and progressed.

      Eligible patients that enroll in the study will be given the dose of 12 mg/kg CDX-3379 once
      every 3 weeks in combination with 400 mg/m2 cetuximab on the first day followed by weekly
      doses of 250 mg/m2 cetuximab.

      Up to 45 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely
      monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side
      effects that may occur.
