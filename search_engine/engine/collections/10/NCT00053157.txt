        -  Determine the efficacy of sargramostim (GM-CSF) to mobilize CD34+ hematopoietic stem
           cells in donors and to reduce graft-vs-host disease in patients after allogeneic stem
           cell transplantation (SCT) for hematologic malignancy or aplastic anemia.

        -  Determine the safety of GM-CSF after allogeneic SCT transplantation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Donors: Donors receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1-6.
           Donors undergo stem cell harvest on day 7.

      Donors may undergo up to 3 apheresis procedures to reach the target stem cell dose and may
      receive additional GM-CSF prior to each collection.

        -  Patients: Patients receive conditioning therapy as per transplantation protocol RP98-15.
           Patients undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients then receive
           GM-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed weekly until day 100 and then at days 180 and 360.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients and 10 donors will be accrued for this study.
