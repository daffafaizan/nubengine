      due to a lack of blood flow to the musculature relative to its metabolism, which results in
      pain in the affected muscle groups. PAD affecting the lower extremities causes claudication,
      cramping pain in the calf, thigh or hip muscle induced by exercise. The initial test for
      evaluation of patients with claudication is ankle brachial index (ABI).

      Therefore, a non-invasive and affordable US technique that can quantify blood perfusion and
      microvasculature density, without using contrast agent, will improve PAD detection in early
      stage and can monitor the disease progress as well as the treatment response. The
      investigators anticipate that our new cost-effective and non-invasive ultrasound perfusion
      technique offers a quantitative imaging of perfusion that would help separating PAD from
      non-PAD and monitor the disease progression and treatment response.
