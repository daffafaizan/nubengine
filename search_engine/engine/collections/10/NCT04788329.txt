      two groups that undergo mindfulness training during the perioperative period. One of the
      treatment groups will be enrolled in the program "Prepare for Surgery, Heal Faster" provided
      by NYU. The other treatment group will be enrolled in Wim Hof Method, a meditation program.
      This program is not provided by NYU, but instructions will be provided to the patient on how
      to complete the meditative exercises involved in this established method. Postop pain
      medication and pain scores will be monitored.
