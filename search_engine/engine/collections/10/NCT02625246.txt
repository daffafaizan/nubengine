    
      A Phase 1 investigation will be performed to test the safety of two doses of bone-marrow
      derived hMSCs (20,000,000 and 100,000,000) administered via peripheral intravenous infusion.

      Group 1: 3 subjects will receive a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs: 20 x106 (20
      million) cells delivered via peripheral intravenous infusion Group 2: 3 subjects will receive
      a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs: 1 x108 (100 million) cells delivered via
      peripheral intravenous infusion Interim safety analysis will be performed four weeks after
      the 1st subject is enrolled in each cohort. Continued safety and tolerability with review of
      adverse events (AEs) will be assessed at each visit. Efficacy parameters (pulmonary function
      tests, lung diffusion capacity, lung volumes, 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and dyspnea/Quality
      of Life (QOL) questionnaires) will be assessed every 12 weeks until study completion.
      Clinical laboratory tests to assess safety will be performed at every visit.

      High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan will be performed at the baseline visit (if
      not done within three months prior to enrollment) and then at week 24.
