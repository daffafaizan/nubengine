      valve with Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HME) for tracheotomized patients (project
      development name 'TW', commercial name 'DualCare'). Study participants trial the new device
      for 2 weeks after which they can choose to discontinue using the device or continue in the 3
      month follow-up part of the study. Clinical feasibility is assessed using structured
      questionnaires addressing voice and speech, quality of life, breathing, swallowing,
      olfaction, sleeping, and respiratory symptoms. This is an exploratory, observational study
      and no specific hypotheses have been formulated.
