      Anthracycline-based chemotherapy, followed or not by mediastinal radiotherapy, substantially
      improves prognosis in this set of patients. Observational studies have shown that
      cardiovascular disease is the most non oncologic cause of death in this population. Coronary
      artery disease (CAD) affects 26% of survivors after 10 years of absence of HL . However, the
      early intervention and the assessment to predict the cardiovascular risk remain little known.
      In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that physical capacity can predict
      the cardiovascular alterations in HL Survivors. In addition, exercise training improves
      physical capacity and heart rate responses in this set of patients.
