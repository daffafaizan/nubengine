      saturation is low. In earlier observational clinical studies, the use of high flow nasal
      cannulae therapy in infants with bronchiolitis has been associated with a decreased rate of
      intubation and intensive care. This study is a randomized controlled trial in five pediatric
      university hospitals in Finland comparing high flow nasal cannulae therapy to usual oxygen
      therapy in infants with bronchiolitis.

      The investigators will recruit 160 infants who require oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation
      <92%) during hospitalization due to a viral bronchiolitis. The participants are randomized to
      receive oxygen therapy either with high flow or ordinary nasal cannula.The infants are
      closely observed by study physicians for clinical parameters. The primary end point is
      treatment failure (need for change of respiratory support method). Secondary endpoints are
      respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (%) at specific measuring points, time from
      randomisation to end of oxygen therapy and time from randomisation to discharge.
