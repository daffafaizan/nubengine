    
      Specifically, the investigators will test the hypotheses that:

      Primary Aim 1: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will report positive changes in sleep
      behavior as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Primary Aim 2: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will have increased sleep duration
      and sleep quality as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Secondary Aim 1: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will have fewer unscheduled
      absences and higher performance/productivity as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Secondary Aim 2: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will have improved mood and
      alertness and increased energy as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Secondary Aim 3: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will report fewer adverse health
      and safety outcomes as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.

      Secondary Aim 4: Early Dayzz participants who use the app will have lower health care costs
      over a 9-month follow-up period as compared to the Late Dayzz participants.
