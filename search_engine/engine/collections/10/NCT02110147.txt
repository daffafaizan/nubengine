      and medical history including all prior disease-directed therapy. In addition, vital signs,
      laboratory values and adverse events information will be collected and recorded. Urine
      samples will be obtained and measured for orotic acid and orotidine levels. Systemic levels
      of uridine will be evaluated from plasma samples collected at set timepoints.

      Upon successful completion of the Main Study and entry into the Treatment Extension, physical
      exams and vital signs will be performed every six (6) months. Additionally, plasma samples to
      measure systemic levels of uridine and urine samples to measure levels of orotic acid and
      orotidine will be collected every (6) six months.
