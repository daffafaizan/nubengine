      trial. It will be multi-Centre, with four groups plus a control group.

      The colonization performed by the strains and the modification of the intestinal microbiota
      will be evaluated by means of strain identification with RT-PCR equipped with specific
      primers, and bacterial population counting with in situ immunofluorescence techniques.

      The safety of strain intake will be evaluated with physical examination, blood parameters,
      and test son faeces to check for resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline by lactic flora.

      Tolerance will be evaluated by means of the record of gastrointestinal symptoms and the
      record of aspect and frequency of faeces.

      The effect on the systemic and adaptive immune system will be measured by means of lymphocyte
      populations and plasma cytokine present on blood, IgAs on serum, saliva and faeces. Also AGCC
      on faeces.
