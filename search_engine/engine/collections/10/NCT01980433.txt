      Wilson disease and right handed dystonia, after one single inhibitory repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Fifteen patients with focal right hand dystonia will receive
      randomly either active or sham rTMS (1 Hz) to the left somatosensory cortex (SSC) in one
      single 20 minutes session. Handwriting performance will be measured immediately after this
      unique session (Visual analogic scale of subjective discomfort in writing, DPRE and WCRS
      scales, pen pressure and pen velocity measured on touchpad), compared to scores obtained 24
      hours before the session. Three days later, the patient will receive the other session (sham
      rTMS or active rTMS) and the same parameters will be evaluated.

      This is a single-center, randomized, crossover, prospective, clinical and double-blind study
      (the rTMS session is performed by the neurophysiologist, but the patient and the neurologist
      who will perform the handwriting evaluation are blind to the session).
