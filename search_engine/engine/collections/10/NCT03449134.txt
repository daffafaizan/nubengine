      determine participant inclusion, a Baseline visit including 24 hours of objective measurement
      of cough. The study had two treatment periods (a main 12-week treatment period and a 40-week
      extension period), and a 14-day follow-up period. Participants at selected sites and
      countries who complete the main and extension study periods may consent to participate in an
      observational, 3-month, Off-treatment Durability Study Period, which extends the Estimated
      Study Completion Date.
