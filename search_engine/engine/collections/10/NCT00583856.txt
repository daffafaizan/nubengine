      However, there are situations in which an accurate reduction and restoration of facial
      symmetry is challenging. In these more difficult cases, the PI uses computer aided
      design/modeling software as well as intra-operative computer aided surgical navigation
      systems to assist with repair of these complex injuries. A retrospective review of these
      cases has not previously been performed.
