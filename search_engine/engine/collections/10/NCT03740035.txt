      composition and declines in physical function and quality of life ; the median age at PCa
      diagnosis is 66 years and approximately 64% of PCa survivors are > 70 years. The negative
      side effects of treatments are pronounced in older, sedentary, overweight or obese men with
      existing comorbidities. The concomitant loss of skeletal muscle mass, increased deposition of
      adipose tissue and loss of bone mineral density leads to fractures, cancer-related fatigue,
      frailty, compromised physical functioning, disability and loss of independence as well as
      anxiety and depression. Regular physical activity reduces morbidity, improves survival and
      can buffer PCa patients against the negative side-effects of treatment, yet less than 20% are
      meeting recommended guidelines-and most spend up to 70% of their time each day in sedentary
      behavior. Targeting a reduction in sedentary behavior by promoting regular spontaneous
      movement in conjunction with regular resistance training may be an effective approach for PCa
      patients who are likely to be fatigued and functionally impaired. Traditional theory-based
      exercise interventions have shown preliminary efficacy for promoting short-term exercise, but
      can be improved for longer-term efficacy. Traditional exercise interventions are generally
      not individually tailored, and therefore cannot incorporate behavioral theory to re-engage
      participants when lapses in self-regulation occur. eHealth technologies can enhance
      traditional theory-based exercise interventions. The study team hypothesizes that an eHealth
      delivered intervention can effectively facilitate the development and maintenance of
      self-regulatory skills that are critical to sustaining long-term behavior change.
