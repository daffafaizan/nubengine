      Such maternal consumption of xylitol studies have, however not been tested in a Scottish
      population.

      Sign 83, (www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign83.pdf) a Scottish government publication states that
      carrying out research in this area is needed.

      Childsmile (www.child-smile.org) is a Scottish government programme that promotes oral health
      from birth, particularly amongst people living in priority areas.

      Parents of newborn children who are assessed to be at risk of developing tooth decay are
      referred to the programme by their Health Visitor. Parents are visited at home by a Dental
      Health Support Worker. The dental health support worker will give more information, advice
      and arrange regular visits for participants to their local Dental Practice.

      This research study will compare two groups; one group randomised into the childsmile
      preventative programme, the other group randomised into the childsmile preventative programme
      plus consuming 5 grams of xylitol per day.

      We will be testing the mutans streptococci of the mother, at start of the study, and testing
      the mutans streptococci of mother and child at (child) aged two, in both groups- We will then
      be testing the dental decay of children in both groups

      The research study will use existing NHS fife funding. NHS Fife currently employs
      approximately 15 dental health support workers, of which part of their role will be to
      support this project

      Recruiting of study is planned to start in January 2010.
