      be randomly assigned to either PCT group or guideline group.The investigators aim to compare
      the efficacy and safety between PCT-gudied antibiotic therapy and guideline-guided antibiotic
      recommendations. The primary hypothesis is that PCT-guided antibiotic therapy will reduce the
      antibiotic prescription rate for AECOPD without negatively impacting the treatment success
      rate, compared with the GOLD guideline antibiotic recommendations.
