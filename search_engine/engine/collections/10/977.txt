some observations on the effects in vivo of varying ambient temperatureson filarial worms of snakes.new information was obtained on the biologyof filarial worms from experimentsusing constrictor constrictor mexicanusboas, infected with macdonaldius oscheiworms.  the microfilariae of m. oschei areaperiodic with respect to the light cycle,but fluctuate sharply in density from dayto day.  maximum minimum levels occurapprox. 2 days apart.  the microfilariaeare larger and more variable in size onthe days of maximum density than on thedays of minimum density.  it is suggestedthat the smaller microfilariae on the daysof low parasitemia are those that havebeen born recently and that they enlargeduring the following 48 hr. before they enterthe peripheral capillaries.  low ambienttemperatures have little effect upon m.oschei.  exposure of the host to ambient temperaturesabove 36 c for a period of24-48 hr. appears sufficient to kill adultm. oschei.  all microfilariae apparently diewithin 144 hr. at this temperature, and inslight infections.  they disappeared fromthe blood altogether within that period.  microfilariaefrom an infection 20 timesmore severe, however, were not eliminatedfrom the circulation prior to the deathof the host after 288 hr., although all thoseobserved were either decomposed ordistorted and apparently dead.  the indicationthat the temperature serves as a limitingfactor for the parasite at a point severaldegrees lower than that postulated forthe host species, is probably correlatedwith the nocturnal habits of the host.
