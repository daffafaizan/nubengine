      chemotherapy. Ovarian carcinoma is one of the most chemosensitive solid tumors and early
      stage patients are most responsive to treatment. However, despite improvements to the
      standard treatment over the past three decades, almost all patients with advanced stage
      disease at presentation will relapse, with an average progression free survival of 16-18
      months. When residual or recurrent disease manifests itself, resistance to chemotherapy often
      prohibits further curative therapy. Therefore, there are still significant unmet needs in
      treating ovarian cancer patients.

      Treatment with DPX-Survivac is for patients with late-stage ovarian, fallopian tube, or
      peritoneal cancer who have completed initial chemotherapy treatment and successful debulking
      surgery. The phase 1 dose finding study will administer 3 doses of DPX-Survivac with or
      without accompanying low dose oral cyclophosphamide.
