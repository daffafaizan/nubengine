      influence local enteric and peripheral metabolic functions and mental health.

      The association of some host environmental factors (e.g. age, metabolic status, dietary
      habits) with gut microbiota composition and function has been investigated but, to our
      knowledge, little is known about their influence on the ECS.

      There is also a need to better understand the influence of these factors and the interplay
      between the gut microbiota and the ECS and their relationship with intestinal, metabolic and
      mental health.

      The investigators therefore propose to fill this knowledge-gap in the general population of
      adults with various body composition, dietary habits and daily physical activity levels.
