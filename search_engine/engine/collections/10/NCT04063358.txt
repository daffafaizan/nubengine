      disability without medical intervention. Diabetic patients, particularly those with diabetic
      macular edema (DME), experience poorer visual outcomes after undergoing cataract surgery
      compared to non-diabetics. An increased risk in the development of post-operative cystoid
      macular edema and exacerbation of baseline DME is reported and this poses a significant
      challenge in managing concomitant DME and visually-significant cataracts.

      Goals of the study are to evaluate how different timing of anti-VEGF intravitreous injections
      (before operation, intra-operation or after-operation) affect visual acuity (BCVA) in
      patients with persistent diabetic macular edema who are undergoing cataract surgery; and to
      evaluate how different timing of anti-VEGF intravitreous injections affect OCT CSF thickness
      and total number of postoperative injections in patients with diabetic macular edema who are
      undergoing cataract surgery.
