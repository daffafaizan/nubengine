      Norway. The trial was approved by the regional ethics committee (2013/1853/REK) and
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02028468).Patients between
      70 and 90 years of age with displaced femoral neck fractures, intact cognitive function and
      the ability to walk with or without a walking aid prior to falling were asked for their
      agreement to be enrolled and partition occurred after informed consent.A subgroup analysis
      looking at periprosthetic bone mineral density around the femoral component was part of this
      level 1 single-center randomized trial. 51 patients were enrolled in this DEXA study, and
      future examination of bone remodeling in these patients is now planned.
