      comparator drug regimens in the future pivotal trial of tribendimidine and will provide
      evidence of the efficacy and safety of mebendazole among children and adolescents infected
      with hookworm in Ghana. Children and adolescents bear a large burden of morbidity from
      hookworm infection, so building the evidence base for effective treatments in this population
      has important public health implications in Ghana and other endemic settings.
