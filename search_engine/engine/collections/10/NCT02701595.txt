      of IE compared with traditional full-length parenteral treatment. Our primary objective is to
      demonstrate that in patients with left-sided multi-susceptible Streptococcus-Enterococcus IE
      who have received at least 10 days of IV antibiotic treatment with or without valvular
      surgery, a switch to an oral combination of amoxicillin between Day 10 and Day 28 after
      initiation of the IV antibiotic treatment, is not inferior to the continuation of the
      conventional IV antibiotic treatment regarding to treatment failure within 3 months after the
      end of antibiotic treatment.

      Nationwide, noninferiority, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trials.

      Randomisation will only be offered to patients who have received at least 10 days of IV
      conventional antibiotic treatment of IE, and fulfil the inclusion criteria.

      Randomisation will take place between Day 10 and Day 28 after initiation of parenteral
      antibiotic therapy or valvular surgery, thus ensuring to have at least 14 days of oral
      therapy in the experimental group.

      Patients will be eligible whether they have undergone valvular surgery or not. This will
      imply that surgery procedure prior to randomisation will be heterogeneous, but randomisation
      will be stratified on the requirement of valvular surgery as part of the treatment of the
      current episode of IE or not.
