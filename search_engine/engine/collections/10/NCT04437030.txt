      of light-absorbing molecules (absorbers), e.g. Deoxyhemoglobin and oxygenated hemoglobin in
      human tissue. This allows blood oxygen saturation (sO2) to be determined at depths of up to
      several centimeters. Measurements of correlates to blood volume and collagen concentration
      are also made possible. In photoacoustic imaging, the tissue to be examined is irradiated
      with nanosecond short, near-infrared (650 - 1300nm) laser pulses. If laser light is locally
      absorbed by a tissue structure, it expands thermoelastically, which triggers an ultrasonic
      pressure wave, which is measured with the aid of an ultrasonic head. The initial pressure
      distribution and thus the absorption in the tissue can then be reconstructed. Since different
      molecules show distinct absorption behavior depending on the wavelength in the near infrared,
      by acquiring several wavelengths it is possible to estimate which absorbers are in which
      concentration in a tissue structure. The effectiveness and tolerability of modern
      high-precision radiation therapy for head and neck tumors largely depends on the quality of
      the imaging. The potential diagnostic benefits of photoacoustics in the radiotherapy of
      patients with head and neck tumors principally concern the target volume definition, the
      implementation of image-guided, adaptive radiotherapy and imaging tumor follow-up as well as
      the early detection of tumors.

      Multispectral photoacoustics primarily enable the analysis of tumor hypoxia, which has been
      associated several times with increased radio resistance and an unfavorable prognosis. In
      addition, other factors, e.g. the blood volume and the collagen content in the tissue are
      analyzed.
