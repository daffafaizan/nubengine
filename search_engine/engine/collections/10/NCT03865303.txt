      preventable deaths in the USA, little progress has been made to reduce mortality outcomes
      from this known killer. An effective strategy leading to meaningful reduction in diagnostic
      error and delay rates has not made its way into practice. This proposal is unique and novel
      and combines mixed-methods research approaches with systems engineering research approaches
      to understand the interplay of the multiple factors contributing to diagnostic error and
      delay. The knowledge gained from this holistic approach will then be used within the learning
      laboratory to inform the design, development, evaluation, and refinement of the solutions to
      diagnostic error and delay. "Control Tower" will be the staging ground for the in situ
      learning laboratory and will be built on top of a well-established clinical informatics
      infrastructure and hospital environment open to innovation and practice change.
