      (migraine with headaches that occur on fewer than 15 days per month) will be recruited from
      local providers. After an initial screening, eligible participants will complete 30 days of
      monitoring 3 times daily on an electronic headache diary (a smartphone app) to confirm study
      eligibility. Participants whose eligibility is confirmed will complete an additional 2 months
      (60 days) of monitoring headache activity and adherence to acute and preventive (medication
      and behavioral) strategies recommended for people with migraine. Participants who show
      suboptimal adherence during the first 3 months of monitoring (<50% of eligible days) will be
      eligible to continue to the intervention component of the study. Participants who choose to
      continue in the study will be randomized to receive a tailored clinical decision support tool
      or education intervention, both delivered through the smartphone app. Participants will
      continue to self-monitor, with the intervention components active, for 3 months.
