    
      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine whether Gliolan® (5-ALA)-induced PPIX fluorescence correlates with
           malignant tumor histopathology (in a minimum of 3-5 serial biopsies taken from the red
           fluorescent region of tissue resection).

        -  To determine the patient safety profile of both oral Gliolan® (5-ALA), as well as use of
           the fluorescence operative microscope. These will include use of commonly accepted
           toxicity measures as well as recording surgically-related neurological deficits within
           the six weeks after surgery.

        -  To determine functionality and performance reliability of the blue light excitation
           microscope platforms (Zeiss Pentero, Leica OH4, Leica OH6 and others).

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To correlate PPIX-containing extracellular microvesicles recovered from blood (at
           multiple time points prior to and following tumor resection) with the pre-operative MRI
           tumor volume.

        -  To characterize the presence and longitudinal changes in microvesicle biomarkers
           recovered from blood evaluating EGFRvIII, IDH1/2 wt and mutations and others. These
           microvesicular blood genes will be identified and correlated with the same
           microvesicular genes identified in tissue at the time of surgery.
