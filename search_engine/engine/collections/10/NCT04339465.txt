      children and adolescents affected by rare diseases. Two innovative forms of care (CARE-FAM
      and WEP-CARE) will be implemented and evaluated at the 18 participating study sites. Both
      interventions include psychological diagnostics, early detection and treatment of concomitant
      mental diseases. The study is a prospective, randomized controlled multicenter study (RCT)
      with a factorial design with four groups: CAREFAM (face to face), WEP-CARE (online), both
      interventions, control group (TAU = treatment as usual). Central psychosocial outcomes will
      be assessed at four time points (i.e., Baseline and after six, 12 and 18 months) from the
      perspectives of the parents, the affected child and the siblings (0 - 9 years only external
      assessment; from 10 years of age additional self-assessment) and the professionals.
