      administered. These changes may be felt as lumps under the skin. Insulin injected into these
      areas may not work as well leading to needing increasing doses of insulin to control blood
      glucose levels. Hypoglycemia can occur when insulin is injected into normal areas. Previous
      studies have found that these lipohypertrophic areas can be seen on ultrasound before they
      can be felt. The Investigators will be using the euglycemic clamp techique to evaluate
      insulin absorption to see whether tissue with lumps that cannot be felt but are seen on
      ultrasound affect how insulin is absorbed.
