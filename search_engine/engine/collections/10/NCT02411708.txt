      and screening into the SGSC-005 study. Patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria

      infusion period. Assessments of vital signs, ECGs, safety labs, adverse events as well as
      patient and physician questionnaires will be completed up to 6 hours after the start of the
      infusion. Patients will then be assessed for discharge either to home or admitted to the
      hospital for further treatment depending on their disease severity. Follow-up phone calls
      will be completed 24 hours and 7 days after initiation of treatment . A follow-up visit will
