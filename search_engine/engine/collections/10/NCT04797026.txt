    
      Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that a social program connecting patients in residential care
      facilities with high school students through monthly letter writing would positively impact
      quality of life for both, reducing quantitative and qualitiative measures of loneliness

      Aims, purpose, or objectives:

      Our objective is to reduce loneliness and increase quality of life for patients residing in
      residential care facilities and for high school students.

      Background (Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc.):

      In response to the Covid pandemic, to protect their residents, residential care facilities
      have implemented restrictions limiting visitors as well as social activities. Anecdoctally
      this has negative impacted the quality of life of those residents, increasing their
      loneliness. Previous studies have shown positive impact of intergenerational programs
      including penpal programs.
