        -  Number of patient: N=50

        -  Inclusion criteria: Basal cell carcinoma of the skin proven with biopsy

        -  Exclusion criteria: (1) Size of the tumors >2cm; (2) Distance from the eyelid <1cm;
           (3)Number of tumors >5

      Treatment protocol: Patients will apply imiquimod daily for 14 days on the tumor and a rim of
      2mm around the tumor. On day 14 a session of mild cryosurgery (2 cycles of 10-15 seconds,
      with open spray liquid nitrogen) will be applied and the patients will continue application
      of imiquimod for another 3 weeks before being evaluated again. Persisting erosion will be
      considered as persistence of the tumor and imiquimod will be continued for another 3 weeks
      with/or without a cryosurgery session. The patients will be evaluated at 1,3,6,12 months
      after discontinuation of imiquimod and yearly thereafter for relapse. In case of clinical
      relapse, it will be confirmed by biopsy.
