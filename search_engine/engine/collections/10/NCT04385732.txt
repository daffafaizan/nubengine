      TBP tagged with digital dermoscopy, compared to clinical surveillance without MSP, results in
      improved diagnostic accuracy, specifically reduced number of unnecessary biopsies (i.e. false
      positives due to an excision or biopsy of a lesion being performed to diagnose melanoma and
      that lesion being identified on pathology as benign), in high (and very high) risk
      individuals whose risk is contributed to by high naevus counts.

      The secondary aims are to:

        1. Test whether MSP:

             1. Results in improved sensitivity of doctors' diagnosis of melanoma (i.e. reduction
                in false negatives)

             2. Improves health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, and reduces patient
                anxiety

             3. Reduces costs to patients and health care system

             4. Is cost effective compared with a strategy of no MSP

        2. Estimate the financial implications to Medicare of introducing MSP

        3. Evaluate diagnostic accuracy of tele-dermatology compared to en-face clinical visits.

        4. Evaluate the safety and acceptability of melanoma surveillance photography

      Investigators hypothesise that for ultra-high and high risk patients with multiple naevi,
      clinical surveillance with melanoma surveillance photography (compared to without MSP) will
      lead to better patient outcomes, in particular a reduction in the number of unnecessary
      biopsies (i.e. false positives) as a measure of diagnostic accuracy. Pre-specified secondary
      outcomes will be sensitivity and specificity, thickness and stage at diagnosis of subsequent
      melanomas, quality of life, costs and cost-effectiveness.
