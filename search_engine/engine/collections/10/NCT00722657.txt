      because of the increase of incidence and prevalence of the disease in the population. This
      study had a descriptive, retrospective, transversal character with quantitative approach,
      which aimed to delineate the social-economics profile of the asthmatic patients that used the
      health service available at the Care Nucleon Medical Integrate (NAMI). The studied population
      was composed of 40 asthmatic patients who attended between April and May, during 2006. Data
      collection was performed through a semi-structured stereotypic questionnaire, with closed and
      opened questions. The age range of the interviewee between 0 to 5 years old represents the
      biggest percentage of patients, obtaining 60% of the answered questionnaires. According to
      social-economics conditions, 55% were illiterate or were learning to read, 75% were using
      some drug prescribed at NAMI, 72.5% deny completely the disease, 52.5% recognized the factors
      that triggered the asthmatic crisis and 55% said having often crisis. Seventy per cent (70%)
      of the interviewee showed some difficulty related to the use of the drugs; 47.5% have
      different problems related to the access to the medications. Through the analysis of the
      social-economics profile delineated of the asthmatics patients attended at NAMI, it could be
      revealed that the biggest part of the patients are people with little instruction, due to the
      social exclusion in which they are found; being the majority of them children of the female
      gender.
