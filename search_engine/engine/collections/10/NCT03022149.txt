      participants aged 50-80 years. The participants had a diagnosis of subcortical vascular
      dementia at the neurology department of Tianjin medical university general hospital.
      Inclusion criteria included a clinical dementia rating 1-2; a mini-mental state examination
      score 15-26; and brain magnetic resonance imaging consistent with subcortical ischemic small
      vessel disease. All participants received standard medical management.Participants in the
      remote ischemic preconditioning group underwent 5 brief cycles consisting of bilateral upper
      limb ischemia followed by reperfusion. The remote ischemic precondition procedure was
      performed once daily over 180 consecutive days. Cognitive impairment assessment scale (
