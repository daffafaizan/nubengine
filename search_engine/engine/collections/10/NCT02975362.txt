      stroke patients develop motor dysfunction in the early stage after stroke. Acupuncture is
      often used as an adjunct to mainstream rehabilitation after stroke. It has been widely
      applied to be a kind of effective treatment for stroke in China. But, there is meta-analysis
      suggests that with stroke rehabilitation, acupuncture has no additional effect on motor
      recovery but has a small positive effect on disability, which may be due to a true placebo
      effect and varied study quality. The efficacy of acupuncture without stroke rehabilitation
      remains uncertain, mainly because of the poor quality of such studies.

      The objective of this proposed study is to determine whether acupuncture combined with
      rehabilitation treatment could improve significantly motor function in ischemic stroke
      patients.

      In this 8-week, assessor-blind, a Multi-center randomized, controlled study of acupuncture as
      additional treatment with the rehabilitation treatment, a total of 240 patients with stroke
      patients will be recruited. The patients will be randomly assigned to acupuncture combined
      with rehabilitation treatment (n =120) or rehabilitation treatment (n =120). (40 sessions, 5
      sessions a week). Changes in the motor function over time are measured using Fugl-Meyer Scale
      and Modified Barthel Index. Change in the stroke syndromes over time are measured using
      stroke syndrome of TCM Scale. Change in the quality of life over time are measured using
      SS-QOL scale.The study will be conducted at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese
      Medicine, Long Hua Hospital, Fudan University, Hua Shan Hospital.
