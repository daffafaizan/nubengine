      reserves) undergo surgery, these patients account for 80% of hospital deaths. The
      requirements for hemodynamic monitoring to critical patients during perioperative period
      reach are of maximal importance, for two major reasons: (i) absolute or relative volume
      deficiency often occurs in postoperative patients due to preoperative fasting, intraoperative
      bleeding and non-dominant fluid loss caused by vasodilation and fluid redistribution caused
      by anesthesia; (ii) insufficient fluid replacement may lead to increased postoperative organ
      complications and poor wound healing. Adequate and goal-oriented hemodynamic monitoring
      combined with early and appropriate treatment can improve the prognosis of high-risk surgical
      patients.

      Central venous pressure is a localized parameter of the superior vena cava or the right
      atrium and is closely related to the right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. With volume
      overload, CVP levels may be abnormally elevated. Maintaining central venous pressure as low
      as possible is conducive to the recovery of internal organs during haemodynamic treatment,
      especially for the kidney, intestine, and brain, etc. However, elevated central venous
      pressure (CVP) occurs frequently in critical care settings, including postoperative critical
      patients. In this study, we conducted a retrospective study of the relationship between the
      initial levels of CVP with organ dysfunction, the severity of illness, the length of ICU
      stay, and prognosis of critically ill patients.
