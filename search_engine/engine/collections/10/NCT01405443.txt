    
      Randomized controlled trial evaluating different training intervals on an endoscopy simulator
      and comparing performance using a validated score (Global assessment of Gastrointestinal
      Endoscopic Skills). Physicians participating in the study are novices with no previous
      experience in flexible endoscopy. Subjects are randomized into three different training arms.
      Proficiency scores will be evaluated by a supervising physician blinded to group allocation.
