    
      Study Population Pediatric subjects aged 1 month to less than 18 years of age with newly
      diagnosed conditions of advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or juvenile myelomonocytic
      leukemia (JMML).

      Length of Study The enrollment period will last for up to 22 months with subjects being
      treated for a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 6 months, until transplantation or disease
      progression (based on an independent central review of responses). Once investigational
      product (IP) has been discontinued, subjects will then be followed for 1 year after the last
      dose of investigational product (IP). The follow-up may not be terminated because of new
      anticancer treatment or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to
      complete the study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that
      is required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as pre-specified in the
      protocol and/or the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), whichever is the later date.
