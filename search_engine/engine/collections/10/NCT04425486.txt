      a vital role for eating, phonetics and esthetics. Primary teeth are also essential in the
      development of the mouth. They maintain the arch length within the jaw and provide guides for
      the eruption pathway of the permanent teeth.

      Problems in primary teeth in the form of pain and swelling can cause distress to the child,
      leading to inability to chew or speak properly and even may affect the appearance of a child.
      Premature loss of primary teeth can cause an earlier eruption of permanent successors and
      interfere with the harmony of adult dentition resulting in crowding caused by shifting and or
      drifting of the teeth toward the extraction space. Moreover, psychological, morphological and
      functional problems may result from premature loss of primary teeth.

      Most parents are unaware of the role a pediatric dentist plays in their child's life, and the
      importance of dental visits at an early age is underestimated as most believe that the milk
      teeth are going to exfoliate and it not worth paying much attention to. Even if a parent is
      recommended to take the child to a pediatric dentist, many may not consider doing the same
      since awareness of importance of primary teeth is less.
