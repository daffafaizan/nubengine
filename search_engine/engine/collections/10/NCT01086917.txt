      volunteers of the group will be injected. Injections in subsequent volunteers are always
      spaced at least one hour apart in any group. Injection of subsequent (groups of) volunteers
      will only commence if the previous injection was shown to be safe. Three different doses of
      PfSPZ will be administered: a dose of 2,500 PfSPZ Challenge (Group 1); a dose of 10,000 PfSPZ
      Challenge (Group 2) if not all volunteers become thick smear positive (TS+) in Group 1; and a
      dose of 25,000 PfSPZ Challenge (Group 3) if there is not 100% TS+ in Group 2. If all
      volunteers in Group 1 (2,500 PfSPZ Challenge) become thick smear positive, then Group 2a will
      receive 1,000 PfSPZ Challenge. If all volunteers in Group 2a become TS+, the volunteers in
      Group 3a will receive 500 PfSPZ Challenge. If all volunteers in Group 2 (10,000 PfSPZ
      Challenge) become TS+, Group 3b will receive 5,000 PfSPZ. If less than 100% of volunteers in
      Group 2a (1,000 PfSPZ Challenge) become TS+ then Group 3c will receive 1,750 PfSPZ Challenge.

      The clinical, biological, parasitological and immunological data of these groups' volunteers
      will be compared. Volunteers and the investigator will not be blinded, but the laboratory
      personnel will be blinded.
