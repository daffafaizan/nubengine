      patterns that some overweight and obese people find difficult to control. The drug works by
      inhibiting the effects of messenger molecules called opioids. These opioids are naturally
      produced within the human body, and are involved in controlling how much we eat, and the
      pleasure we get from eating. We believe that GSK1521498 might be effective in the treatment
      of obesity because it is well known that drugs working on similar binding sites in the brain
      reduce the pleasure we get from eating, especially high fat or high sugar food. We also
      believe the effects of GSK1521498 will be greater in obese individuals with greater severity
      of over-eating behaviours, as measured for example by existing questionnaire scales for
      binge-eating or compulsive eating behaviour. We will perform a variety of simple tests using
      a computer, questionnaires and eating assessments to examine effects on behaviour. We will
      also ask people to complete questionnaires so that we can see if there are any effects on
      their mood.
