      NightOwl HSAT to derive parameters relevant for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. The NightOwl
      HSAT comprises a finger or forehead mounted sensor and an automated analytics software. The
      sensor measures double-wavelength photo-plethysmography and accelerometry. The analytics
      software automatically interprets the sensor data and derives a measure of sympathetic
      activation of the autonomic nervous system, oxygen saturation, instantaneous pulse rate and
      activity. For each patient in the cohort, the AHI derived by the NightOwl will be compared to
      that of the Type I sleep monitor (in-lab PSG), which will acquire data simultaneously during
      the diagnostic night of the patient referred to the sleep lab for a polysomnography. On a
      randomly selected subset of patients, a Type IV sleep monitor will additionally be applied
      for comparison of its automated AHI derivation to that of the NightOwl.
