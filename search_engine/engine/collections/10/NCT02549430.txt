      activity in delaying/reversing resistance to endocrine agents. CDK 4/6 inhibitors may
      represent a biologically-driven option in this context.

      With the present study investigators aim to complement the ongoing trial on PD0332991 by
      acquiring information on its clinical activity in post-menopausal patients with ER positive,
      Her2 negative advanced breast cancer patients already pretreated with a first-line or second
      line endocrine therapy.
