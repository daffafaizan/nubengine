      Numerous studies demonstrate their safety and efficacy in nulliparous women, however, uptake
      of IUDs in this group is low. One of the major barriers to women obtaining IUDs is fear of
      pain during insertion, as studies do demonstrate that nulliparous women experience more pain
      than parous women during IUD insertion. Studies evaluating various methods for pain control
      during IUD insertion have shown conflicting results, leaving the question unanswered as to
      what is the best method to decrease pain during IUD insertion.

      This study aims to evaluate a novel approach to pain control by having women self-insert
      lidocaine gel into the vagina at least 5 minutes prior to IUD insertion. This will overcome
      some of the barriers from other studies where there may not have been ample time for the
      lidocaine to take effect, while at the same time eliminating the need for women to have
      multiple speculum exams. Although this is a novel approach to administering an anesthetic, we
      believe women will be interested in any intervention that may potentially alleviate pain
      during IUD insertion.

      If this study does demonstrate that pain is decreased with self-inserted lidocaine compared
      to placebo gel, this will potentially eliminate one large barrier to nulliparous women
      receiving IUDs. Increased uptake of highly effective contraception in nulliparous women is
      just one of the many steps necessary towards decreasing unintended pregnancy.
