      a diagnosis of xerosis in the context (current or historic) of atopic dermatitis. A total of
      30 subjects will be enrolled. After consent and basic demographics, a study team member will
      use the GPSkin Barrier® device to measure the baseline moisture level of the inner wrist,
      inner elbow, and dorsal hand of all subjects. Subjects will also fill out questionnaires
      pertaining to quality of life, measures of predictors of adherence, and severity of xerosis.

      Subjects will be randomized into one of three arms: the control group (n= 10), the electronic
      interaction group to assess patient's response to daily moisturizer (n=10), or the GPSkin
      group (n=10). All patients will receive Cetaphil Pro Eczema moisturizer equipped with an
      electronic monitor to measure adherence to daily treatment of xerosis. The digital
      interaction group will receive a survey by email each week asking about their Cetaphil use.
      The patients in the GPSkin group will receive the GPSkin Barrier® to measure the moisture
      level of their inner wrist, inner elbow, and dorsal hand daily. Subjects will be instructed
      to use the Cetaphil once daily. Subjects will return at 3 months. At this visit, the data
      from the electronic adherence monitoring will be downloaded, the Cetaphil will be weighed,
      the patient will fill out the same questionnaires (quality of life, measures of predictors of
      adherence, and severity of xerosis), and the stratum corneum hydration level will be
      measured. The intervention subjects will be evaluated on their use of the GPSkin Barrier® to
      measure their stratum corneum hydration
