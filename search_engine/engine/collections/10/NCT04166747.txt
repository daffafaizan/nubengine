      and perform the functional fitness test based on the protocol developed by Rikli and Jones,
      before and after the VR intervention. The functional fitness tests include evaluation of
      upper body strength, lower body strength, cardiorespiratory endurance, upper body flexibility
      test, lower body flexibility test, balance, agility test. They will be randomly assigned to
      the intervention group, receiving the VR program, and the control group who will not receive
      the VR program. The participants in the intervention group will be asked to use the VR device
      for 15 minutes, twice a week for 6 weeks, along with their daily routine activities. Control
      group will carry out the daily routine activities, without the intervention. The change in
      the quality of life (QOL) and happiness, for both control and intervention groups, will be
      assessed through EuroQol 5 dimensions 3 level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), mini version of
      Chinese happiness Inventory questionnaire, respectively, to filled at recruitment and
      follow-up after 6 weeks. The effect of the VR programs will be determined by the comparison
      of performance, for the functional fitness tests before and after the intervention and also,
      for the differences between the control and intervention groups
