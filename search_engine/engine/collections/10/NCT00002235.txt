      48 weeks. During the study, patients are evaluated for changes from baseline in plasma HIV-1
      RNA levels and lymphocyte subsets and for development of adverse events and toxicities. After
      Week 48, patients with documented virologic response are eligible to continue receiving study
      treatments and to attend scheduled follow-up visits. Patients who experience virologic
      failure are discontinued from the study.
