    
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, interventional, non-randomized study enrolling post
      MI low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF â‰¤35%) patients prior to or at discharge from
      the hospital after index MI as defined in the inclusion criteria. Prior to initiating any
      study specific procedures, patients needs to provide his/her consent by signing and dating an
      informed consent form. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be evaluated and the patients'
      medical history and baseline information will be collected. Seven days ELR monitoring will be
      done at discharge and at chronic phase after index MI. At 6 and 9 months telephone follow-up
      will be done to evaluate the health status, if there will be no in-office visit planned. At
      12 months there will be a scheduled in-office visit conducted to collect the health status.
      All the patients will be followed-up by telephone (health status) at study end (when the last
      patient completed the 12 month follow-up)
