      pressure that uses only optical sensors at the wrist. HNE is interested in exploring the
      potential of the device and technology (OBPM), and aims at benchmarking its performances
      against gold standard measurements of blood pressure.

      The goal of this study is thus to assess whether i) PulseWatch allows to capture blood
      pressure variations, and ii) the measured blood pressure values remain stable in time.

      The proposed study plans to include patients that are already scheduled for arterial
      catheterization at HNE. For these patients, the study will only require the placement of the
      safe optical device on the wrist to non-invasively record hemodynamic fluctuations.
      Therefore, no additional risk for the patient is to be foreseen.

      By demonstrating that the Aktiia SA OBPM technology is reliable, HNE aims to make one step
      further in improving blood pressure monitoring in general, and in particular in advancing the
      deployment of technologies that have the potential to be used in the ambulatory setting. The
      diagnosis and treatment of hypertension are expected to largely benefit from these
      advancements.
