      circulatory arrest (DHCA) at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital.
      Patients that are eligible will be randomized to receive either one dose surfactant or the
      sham (air) arm after the surgical procedure. Patients will be monitored for an additional 30
      days after the breathing tube is removed. It is possible that subjects may be discharged
      prior to the last assessment, therefore for subjects who have been discharged a member of the
      study team will contact the parent (s) or legal authorized representative by telephone.
