      imaging (DTI) in children with very early onset bipolar disorder (BPD). We hypothesize that
      the connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobe and parietal lobe and
      limbic structures will be abnormal, indicating white matter and gray matter deficits in early
      onset BPD. We also hypothesize that the superior lateral fasciculus cingulum bundle and the
      inferior lateral fasciculus will have decreased fractional anisotropy in very early onset BPD
      relative to healthy controls.
