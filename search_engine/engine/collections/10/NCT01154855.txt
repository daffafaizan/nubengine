      of patients with severe periodontitis; and 2. Characterize the immune regulator activity of
      periodontitis serum. This proposed feasibility study will then aid in providing the support
      for an increased sample size and other design requirements for larger, more expanded human
      clinical trial testing.In this study, forty (40) subjects will be divided into 2 groups: 1)
      Healthy oral status group and 2) Severe periodontal disease. Patients will be clinically
      screened using standard periodontal measurements.
