      high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2), and airway closure are the main factors implicated
      in the atelectasis, shunt and shunt-like effects that account for the majority of the
      impaired oxygenation seen during general anesthesia.

      Previous studies have shown that formation of atelectasis during preoxygenation and induction
      of anesthesia can be avoided by adding a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) followed
      by a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).During emergence from anesthesia, high
      concentrations of oxygen predispose to atelectasis formation. Even a recruitment maneuver,
      followed by ventilation with 100% oxygen with a PEEP/CPAP of 10 cm H2O until extubation,
      failed to improve postoperative oxygenation compared with that achieved with zero
      end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP).This failure may have been caused by the presence of lung
      regions with high oxygen concentrations.

      The investigators hypothesized that by inducing and discontinuing anesthesia during CPAP/PEEP
      and deliberately reducing FIO2 after extubation, postoperative atelectasis would be reduced
      compared with standard protocols. To test our hypothesis, the investigators studied 1) a
      control group with no CPAP/PEEP and a FIO2 of 1.0 while breathing spontaneously after
      extubation, and 2) an intervention group that was on CPAP/PEEP of 6 cmH2O from induction to
      extubation and that received an FIO2 of 1.0 until extubation and then an FIO2 of 0.3 via a
      facemask while on CPAP after extubation.
