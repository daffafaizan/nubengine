      of this response is release of glucagon and activation of the sympathetic nervous system,
      which provides the means for raising blood glucose levels towards normal. We can measure
      circulating hormones indicating the level of these responses, but additionally, sympathetic
      nervous system responses can be measured directly. We can measure the sympathetic nerve
      activity that controls blood flow to muscles (MSNA) and blood flow and sweating to skin
      (SSNA). The purpose of this study is to determine if either hypoglycemia or exercise cause
      differential responses in muscle and skin sympathetic nerve activity. We would also like to
      determine what the sympathetic response is to cycling exercise with insulin and normal blood
      sugar. Therefore, we would like to test the sympathetic responses to insulin with normal
      blood glucose, hypoglycemia, and during exercise bouts and normal blood glucose, with or
      without insulin.
