      EC145 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; available in the United States as Doxil® and
      outside the United States as Caelyx®) compared to PLD and placebo. Enrollment of 640 patients
      including approximately 500 that are folate receptor positive is planned.

      EC145 is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate vitamin
      receptor (FR) that is not generally found on normal cells. Experimental evidence shows that
      this target receptor is expressed on virtually all ovarian cancers. Early clinical evidence
      in a small number of Phase I participants, in a subset of participants in a completed
      single-arm Phase II study, and interim data from an ongoing randomized Phase 2 study
      (PRECEDENT) suggests that EC145 may have antitumor effect in women with platinum-resistant
      ovarian cancer and that EC145 alone and in combination with PLD is generally well-tolerated.
      This evidence suggests that EC145 may be useful as chemotherapy against platinum-resistant
      ovarian cancer.

      All participants will undergo imaging with the FR-targeting investigational diagnostic agent
      EC20 during the screening period to assess binding of the imaging agent EC20 to tumors. This
      non-invasive procedure will provide additional information on the utility of using EC20
      imaging to identify subjects with the FR molecular "target" prior to treatment with EC145
      therapy.
