    
      The patients for whom ATS Medical, Inc., ATS 3f(r) Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 1000 is
      intended are those patients whose prognosis without surgery for replacement of the diseased
      natural valve or previous implanted prosthetic valve is unacceptably poor in terms of
      survival, quality of life, or both, in the opinion of the attending physicians. For this
      special subset of patients, there are a number of widely accepted prosthetic heart valves in
      use.
