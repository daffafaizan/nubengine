      pharmacodynamics (PD) of blinatumomab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in both
      adult and pediatric Japanese patients with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. The Phase 2
      part will assess the safety and efficacy of the recommended dose level of blinatumomab
      identified in the Phase 1b portion of the study in the adult study population.

      In June 2017 protocol amendment 4 extended the study to include an expansion cohort of
      approximately 65 participants to investigate the safety of blinatumomab in participants who
      did not participate in Phase 1b or Phase 2 of the study. Adult and pediatric patients in the
      expansion cohort may receive up to 5 cycles of investigational blinatomumab and may receive
      commercial blinatomumab after a minimum of 2 cycles of the investigational drug.
