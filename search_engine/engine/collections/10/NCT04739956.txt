      visualisation of a pregnancy on trans-vaginal ultrasound (TVUS). The current method for risk
      stratifying a PUL is via serum BhCG levels at the time of identification of PUL and after 48
      hours, in order to ascertain the viability of the pregnancy. Patients and their partners need
      to wait for this result before a management plan can be adopted, taking at least 2-3 hours.
      There is a clear need for the patient care pathway to evolve in order to aid and improve the
      management of women classified with a PUL. By using point-of-care BhCG testing, the
      investigators hope to shorten the time to management. The investigators therefore propose
      that shortening the time interval would reduce psychological morbidity. This is a prospective
      cohort observational study.
