      painful orthopaedic surgery, commonly performed as a day-case procedure. Admission for opiate
      analgesia constitutes a failure of management and financial disadvantage to the healthcare
      organisation. The investigators seek to establish which technique will result in the best
      analgesia out of ankle block, metatarsal block, or a combination of the two. As analgesia
      constitutes part of a return to function, an additional aim is to determine whether either of
      these approaches will result in an objective functional benefit to the participants.

      The trial seeks to recruit 23 patients into either of 3 groups: Ankle + sham metatarsal; sham
      Ankle + metatarsal; Ankle + Metatarsal.
