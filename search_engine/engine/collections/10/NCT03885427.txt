      useful methods in decreasing preoperative separation anxiety , postoperative psychological
      trauma, and ensuring smooth induction for preschoolers undergoing elective surgery.

      Procedural sedation, and analgesia was defined by O'Donnell as a drug induced state of
      decreasing awareness, pain, and memory that allowing patient continue his ,or her own
      protective reflexes, and moving purposefully( O' Donnell etal, 2003).

      Ketamine is an anesthetic drug having sedative, and analgesic properties with different
      routes of administration in children (IV, intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral, rectal,
      sublingual, intranasal, and nebulized) .

      Ketamine produces its analgesic properties in acut pain management from reversible
      antagonizing the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)receptors , reducing levels of many
      proinflammatory mediators in the acute phase, and acting on other non-NMDA pathways that
      playing important roles in pain, and mood regulation, like its effect on µ-opioid receptors,
      nicotinic, muscarinic cholinergic, ɣ-aminobutyric acid receptors, activation of high
      -affinity D2 dopamine receptors, and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels.

      The oral route is the most popular than other routes ,as it's safe, efficient, acceptable,
      and familiar for pediatric patients..

      Oral ketamine often requires higher, and frequent doses as it's bioavailability is lower
      (17-24%) compared to IV (100%),Intramuscular (93%), sublingual/transbuccal(30%),
      intranasal(25-50%),and inhaler (70%) due to extensive first pass metabolism in liver, and
      intestine.

      Ketamine inhalation is safe, rapid absorption, and affordable route of administration.
