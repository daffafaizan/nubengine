    
      This is a randomized controlled study. Participants with moderate OSAS severity will be
      either allocated to receive a myofunctional reeducation protocol (study group) or a sham
      protocol (control group). Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be measured before and at the end
      (6 weeks) of the protocol. Participants from the study group will follow an upper airway
      reinforcement regimen using the IOPI (Iowa Oral Performance Instrument) device over 6 weeks
      while participants from the control group will perform a sham reeducation protocol using an
      "EMT threshold" at minimal resistance.
