      I. To determine whether v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (Akt) inhibitor MK2206 achieves
      objective tumor responses (complete response [CR], partial response [PR]) in advanced breast
      cancer patients who have a phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA)
      or Akt mutation and/or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss or mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 6 month progression-free survival on MK2206. II. To determine baseline
      molecular markers that may predict clinical outcome. III. To determine pharmacodynamic
      markers in blood and tumor tissue that may predict a decrease in proliferation-related Ki-67
      antigen (Ki-67) and clinical outcome.

      IV. To determine safety and tolerability of MK2206 in previously treated patients with
      advanced breast cancer.

      V. To determine if decrease in Ki-67 at 2 weeks correlates with anti-tumor effect (CR, PR, or
      stable disease [SD] > 6 months).

      VI. To determine concordance of PIK3CA and PTEN status between primary tumor and distant
      metastasis.

      VII. To determine concordance of PIK3CA status of circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) and distant metastasis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt Inhibitor MK-2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 weeks.
