      fat obtained after having modified the regimen of lactating cows. All diets will be identical
      in terms of menus, calories and macronutrient composition with the exception of TFA levels.
      All foods will be provided to study participants. Based on a 2500 kcal/day regimen, an intake
      of 4.1g of rTFA will represent 37 kcal/day (1.5% of energy intake) while the intake of 0.7 g
      of rTFA in the control diet will represent 6 calories (0.3% of energy). The 2 experimental
      diets will be formulated so that the percentage of daily calories from fat (33%),
      carbohydrates (52%) and proteins (15%) will meet the dietary recommendations of the American
      Heart Association and the NCEP for primary prevention of CVD.
