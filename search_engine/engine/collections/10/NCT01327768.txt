      1 to 2 months before transplantation. The OECs will be cultured and expanded under the rule
      of GTP. Then, quality control of OECs should be done by immunohistochemical staining positive
      for GFAP, S100, and P75. Finally, the investigators will transplanted the OECs (about 2 to 8
      X 10Â´6 cells in saline) into the peri-infarcted area of the brain. (2) Combination with
      traditional drug therapy (such as used the anti-thrombosis reagent or anti-platelet
      aggregation reagent). (3) NIH-stroke scale (NIHSS), European stroke scale (ESS), European
      stroke motor subscale (EMS), Barthel Index(BI) and MMSE will be performed for each patient to
      evaluate the therapeutic effect as the primary end points. (4) In addition, MRI(DTI) &
      TMS(MEP) will be also checked for each recruitment patient as the secondary end points.
