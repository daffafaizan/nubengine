      of erectile function in patients undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for
      prostate cancer.

      Recent laboratory findings in rat models and on human urogenital tissues suggest that
      erythropoietin may play a role in protection of the cavernous nerves during surgery. Some
      degree of nerve trauma occurs during bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, but for
      most it is temporary. Erythropoietin will be studied as an investigational drug for
      enhancement of erectile function postoperatively in a prospective, randomized study.
      Erythropoietin has been used in many men undergoing open radical prostatectomy in the past
      according to FDA indications for preparation for noncardiac, nonvascular surgery with a high
      risk of blood loss. Evidence also suggests it is safe with no demonstration of increased risk
      of venous thromboembolism (blood clots) or cardiac events for men with prostate cancer
      undergoing radical prostatectomy.

      The length of the study is 12 months and involves receiving a dose of study drug or placebo
      on the day before surgery, the day of surgery, and the day following surgery. The dose is
      given by subcutaneous injection. The study will also require the completion of questionnaires
      which will be completed online every three months until study completion (at 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months) to assess outcomes.
