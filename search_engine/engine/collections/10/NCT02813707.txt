      nutritional and psychological status of the patient. Therefore, studying that will help the
      community in establishing a database specific for the country instead of relying on other
      countries statistics and data.

      In 2009, figures from WHO have revealed that 39.9% of women in United Arab Emirates (UAE) are
      obese which considered the 7th highest proportion in the world. On the other hand, 25.6% of
      men are obese in UAE which considered the 9th highest proportion in the world.

      The search for ideal weight loss operation started more than 50 years ago. First bariatric
      surgery performed in 1954 by Kremen and his associates which involved the anastomosis of
      upper and lower intestine that bypasses large amount of absorptive circuit. Mason, Ito et al.
      developed the Gastric Bypass in 1967, which led to fewer complications than the intestinal
      bypass. A later improvement, the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, proved technically difficult to
      perform but led to long-term sustained weight loss, no protein-calorie malabsorption and
      little vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Many studies and researches are conducting studying
      the impact of bariatric surgery on different health parameters.

      There are many studies regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on diabetic and metabolic
      parameters. Study of 15 patients with Body Mass Index (BMI) between 30-35 kg/m2 with type II
      diabetes underwent Roux-En-Y gastric bypass with 1 year follow up. Results that diabetes
      mellitus remission achieved in 93% of cases with significant drop in blood glucose and HbA1C
      (p≤ 0.05 & p ≤ 0.001) respectively. Another study, 17 obese patients with type II diabetes
      mellitus (DM) received the duodenal-jejunal bypass liner followed for 24 weeks. HbA1C
      improved from 8.4±0.2 to 7.0±0.2% (p≤0.01). A third study regarding the effect of
      laparoscopic Roux-En-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) on (Diabetes mellitus II) DMII for period of 5
      years. 1160 patients underwent LRYGBP and 240 (21%) has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or
      DMII. Body mass index (BMI) decreased from 50.1 to 34 kg/m2. Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) returned
      to normal levels (83%) or markedly improved (17%) in all patients. Reduction in use of oral
      anti-DM (80%) and insulin (79%) followed surgical treatment. Furthermore, in other study 52
      morbidly obese patients were studied after sleeve gastrectomy. HbA1C changed form 6.0 ± 1.3%
      to 5.4 ± 0.8% to 5.4 ± 0.8% at 6 and 12 months respectively. Triglyceride decreased from 159±
      87 to 116± 41 and 116± 62 mg/dl, while High density lipoprotein (HDL) increased from 46± 12
      to 50 ±12 and 56±13 mg/dl at 6 and 12 months. There is a study of 100 obese patients after
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and the influence on body mass index (BMI), insulin
      concentration and lipid profile. Results include significant decrease in BMI, normalization
      of metabolic parameters, with improvement of type II DM, Hypertension (HTN), and sleep apnea.

      There is a study about improving renal function 12 months after bariatric surgery. They
      studied changes in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) before and 1 year after the surgery in
      223 severely obese patients. Normal GFR was 90-125 ml/min. They found that GFR increased in
      patients with previously normal, Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage II and CKD stage III.
      Another 12- month prospective study, regarding the effect of bariatric surgery on renal
      function and systemic inflammation and blood pressure. A total of 34 morbidly obese patients
      were investigated at baseline, 1 month and 12 months after Roux-En-Y gastric bypass. The
      results showed a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI), mean arterial pressure, and
      urinary and serum inflammatory markers (all p≤0.001). There are many studies in the
      literature regarding improving quality of life (QoL) after bariatric surgery. There was a
      study in which obese patient's QoL was investigated early and medium-term changes following
      Roux-en-y gastric bypass.

      There was a study regarding the sexual function post bariatric surgery. In a prospective
      study of 39 men underwent bariatric surgery. Their sexual function was assessed by mean of
      international index of erectile function (IIEF) before and 1 year after the surgery. In
      addition to, metabolic and hormonal parameters (like weight, HbA1C, lipoid profile, insulin
      sensitivity and sex hormones). They found that erectile function score improved from baseline
      of 54.85 ± 16.59 to 61.21 ± 14 with P ≤ 0.01 and gonadal function including testosterone
      level(from 256.36 ± 120.98 in baseline to 508.01±161.90 with P ≤0.01 at 1 year.

      There are many studies regarding the nutritional deficiency following bypass surgeries. There
      is a study of long-term nutritional deficiencies and dietary intake after sleeve gastrectomy
      or Roux-En-Y gastric bypass in a mediterranean population. It was a longitudinal, prospective
      and observational study in which primary outcomes were changes in energy, macronutrients, and
      micronutrients intake and weight loss. They found that the mean daily intake of calcium,
      magnesium, phosphorus, and iron was less than the current recommendations. The most common
      observed deficiency is 25-hydroxy vitamin D. On the other hand, there are 2 case reports of
      night blindness and visual impairment caused by vitamin A deficiency after bariatric surgery
      which considered a significant complication after mal-absorptive bariatric surgery. Moreover,
      there is a prospective, single-center, observational study regarding nutritional deficiencies
      following sleeve gastrectomy with a medium follow up of 2 years. From 100 patients were
      studied, 48% were supplemented with iron, 33% with zinc, 34% with a combination of calcium
      carbonate + cholecalciferol, 24% with vitamin D, 42% with vitamin B12, and 40% with folic
      acid. The patients who received only a sleeve gastrectomy had (Excess weight loss % EWL) of
      53.6%, 65.8% and 62.6% after 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively.
