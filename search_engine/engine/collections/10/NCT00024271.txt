        -  Determine the response rate, duration of response, and duration of survival of patients
           with peritoneal mesothelioma treated with surgery, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and
           whole abdominal radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo initial surgery, including total omentectomy and excision of gross
      disease. Approximately 3-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive intraperitoneal (IP)
      chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin IP over 2 hours once weekly on weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10
      and cisplatin IP and gemcitabine IP once weekly on weeks 2, 5, 8, and 11. Patients also
      receive interferon gamma IP once weekly on weeks 13-16.

      At approximately week 18-20, patients undergo second-look surgery. Patients with no gross
      disease receive hyperthermia mitomycin IP and cisplatin IP over 90 minutes.

      Approximately 2-4 weeks after second-look surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a
      week for 5-7 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
