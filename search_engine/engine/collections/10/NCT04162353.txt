      functional CAR molecules expressing on a T-cell, directed against the surface proteins BCMA
      and CD19. BCMA-CD19 cCAR is also aimed to treat multiple myeloma, a challenging disease due
      to the heterogeneity of myeloma cells, which renders single-antigen targeting CAR T-cell
      therapy ineffective. BCMA-CD19 cCAR is proposed to target both bulky myeloma cells expressing
      BCMA, and myeloma stem cells expressing CD19 to effectively eradicate the disease.

      BCMA-CD19 cCAR is also aimed to treat heterogeneous plasmacytoid lymphoma bearing two types
      of lymphoma cells, regular lymphoma cells expressing CD19 and plasmacytoid lymphoma cells
      expressing BCMA. The use of two different targets intends to increase coverage and eradicate
      cancerous cells before resistance develops in surviving cancer cells that have undergone
      selective pressures or antigen escape.
