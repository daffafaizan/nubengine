      TKA is associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, causing patient discomfort,
      mobilisation and hospital discharge.

      Continuous epidural analgesia is often used for controlling pain after TKA. Recent studies
      describe a new method for pain control after total knee arthroplasty which consists of local
      infiltration with local anesthetics and adrenaline. This infiltrations can be combined with
      ketorolac and/or morphine. The aim of this study is to:

        1. Compare analgetic efficacy of to types of local infiltration analgesia in total knee
           arthroplasty.

        2. Compare analgetic efficacy of local infiltration analgesia with continuous epidural
           analgesia.
