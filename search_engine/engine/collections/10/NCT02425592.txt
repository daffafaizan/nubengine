      prostate cancer. Treatment for prostate cancer, usually surgical removal or radiation
      delivered to the whole prostate, is associated with significant morbidity including
      incontinence and impotence.

      The goal of this and future research is to maximize the effectiveness of prostate imaging in
      order to minimize the morbidity of prostate biopsy and hence improve the quality of life of
      patients with prostate cancer. There are many applications to improved imaging of prostate
      cancer, but several the investigators are interested in include: improved risk stratification
      to limit unnecessary treatment while providing appropriate treatment to prevent progression;
      limiting the number of biopsies needed for diagnosis and/or decreasing the frequency of
      biopsies and hence decreasing biopsy-related morbidity; focal therapy for confirmed focal
      disease rather than treating the entire prostate in order to limit the significant morbidity
      associated with whole-gland treatment.

      This is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, prospective observational phase II trial
      evaluating MRI to detect prostate cancer progression in patients with low risk prostate
      cancer on Active Surveillance. The two centers involved will be the Yale-New Haven Hospital
      Smilow Cancer Center (Yale) and the VA Connecticut Healthcare System (VACT). The Yale School
      of Medicine will serve as the central data-coordinating center for this study.
