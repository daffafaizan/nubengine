      patients with insomnia visit complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) specialists for
      help due to fear of the side effects of long-term treatment with hypnotics. Acupuncture is
      commonly used to treat insomnia in the field of CAM. Among the different methods of
      acupuncture, it has been noted that ear acupressure (placing magnetic pellets on the
      auricular points), which has the advantage of being non-invasive and easily carried out,
      shows possible effects whereby there is improvement in the sleep quality of old adults.
      However, it is lacking of the evidence of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ear
      acupressure on insomnia.

      Insomnia is related to homeostatic dysregulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS). Ear
      acupuncture and its related techniques are believed to act through the reticular formation
      and the ANS may thus result in an amelioration of illness.

      In this study, a RCT is conducted to investigate the complementary effect of ear acupressure
      on chronic insomnia in old adults.Besides, the changes of ANS function (measured by heart
      rate variability) are recorded to evaluate the role of ANS in the treatment of insomnia.
