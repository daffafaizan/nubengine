      postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis are main factors that worsen the quality of
      life and shorten the duration of survival. Perioperative immune function is a key element
      that influences postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis; but it is subject to the
      impacts of many factors. Studies showed that elevated cortisol level and inflammation
      provoked by surgical stress result in suppression of immune function, whereas dexmedetomidine
      alleviates the elevated cortisol level and inhibit excessive inflammation; high-dose opioids
      inhibit the immune function and increase the invasiveness of tumor cells, whereas
      dexmedetomidine reduces the consumption of opioids during perioperative period; postoperative
      sleep disturbances also impair immune function, whereas dexmedetomidine improves sleep
      quality in patients after surgery; occurrence of postoperative delirium is associated with
      increased mortality, whereas dexmedetomidine reduces delirium incidence. The investigators
      hypothesize that dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia in elderly patients after cancer
      surgery may improve the long-term outcomes, possibly by relieving stress and inflammatory
      response, improving analgesic efficacy and sleep quality, and reducing delirium incidence.
