      inhibition is likely to be low and that the benefit of such therapy will also include effects
      on disease stabilization. Disease stabilization is difficult to interpret in the phase II
      setting. Thus, it is desirable to develop biomarkers which will provide additional
      information on novel treatment effects and how they might relate to disease progression
