      safety of placement of an Ahmed Glaucoma Implant (AGI) (New World Medical Inc., Rancho
      Cucamonga, CA, USA) against trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in patients with uncontrolled
      glaucoma, who may or may not have had previous clear corneal cataract surgery with
      intraocular lens implantation, over 5 years. Outcome discrimination between the two treatment
      groups will be made using following parameters:

        1. Intraocular pressure

        2. Need for supplemental medical therapy

        3. Incidence of short and long term surgical complications and need for re-operation.

        4. Visual function (Visual acuity and Visual field)

      Hypothesis: Glaucoma drainage implants have better surgical outcomes in terms of IOP lowering
      efficacy compared to trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C over 5 years in Asian patients with
      medically uncontrolled glaucoma.
