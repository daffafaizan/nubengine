      highly effective contraception among women with substance use disorder (SUD) with "SexHealth
      Mobile." Our study will follow a quasi-experimental design that uses an interrupted time
      series (i.e., usual care [control] then intervention care) to compare the uptake of
      contraception before and after implementing the "SexHealth Mobile" intervention.

      "SexHealth Mobile" integrates two existing services in our community: a mobile medical unit
      (MMU) operated by Swope Health Services and "SexHealth" a point-of-care contraception
      counseling service that our research team developed for Children's Mercy Hospital's emergency
      department (ED) for adolescents. Using a menu of adaptive services, "SexHealth Mobile" will
      bring contraceptive care to women with SUD (including the subset with opioid use disorder
      [OUD]) at recovery centers in the Kansas City community.

      Our primary hypothesis is that the current use of highly effective contraception will be
      greater at 1-month post-enrollment among women recruited during the intervention period
      (i.e., "SexHealth Mobile") compared to those recruited during the usual care period. The
      current use and discontinuation of contraception will also be compared at 2-weeks and
      3-months.

      Our approach consists of enrolling (n=170) eligible women are accessing health, recovery, or
      community services at a site we identified in our formative research work. We will aim to
      recruit up to 85 women during the usual care period and 85 during the intervention period. We
      will follow-up with participants at 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months after the enrollment date.
