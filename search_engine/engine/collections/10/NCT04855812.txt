      screening visit, a baseline assessment, and a follow-up visit (after 6 weeks of therapy). The
      baseline and follow up visit will include 2 separate testing sessions, each session will last
      approximately 2 hours. I will also participate in approximately 3 training sessions per week
      for 6 weeks. Each training session will last approximately 60 minutes.
