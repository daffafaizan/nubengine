      the US has important implications for the management of postoperative pain given its safety
      profile and suitability for use in the early phase of the postoperative period. In clinical
      studies a significant opioid-sparing effect has been documented with a substantial percentage
      of patients avoiding the need for opioid rescue medication altogether. This avoidance or
      delay in the use of opioids has been shown to reduce undesirable side effects. It is proposed
      that the use of IV acetaminophen in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) for postoperative
      analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy will result in decreased incidence of post
      operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and decreased use of narcotics.
