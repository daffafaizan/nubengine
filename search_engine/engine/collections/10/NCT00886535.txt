      associations between polymorphisms of candidate genes (focusing initially on the UGT2B7
      enzyme) and tamoxifen (TAM) toxicity. Pre- & post-menopausal women (aged â‰¥18 years) taking
      TAM (20 mg/day) as standard therapy or chemopreventive therapy will be included in this
      study. Patients will be enrolled after they complete all primary surgery, radiation, and
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients will be excluded if they are undergoing other adjuvant
      endocrine therapies. Other reasons for exclusion will include patients who are pregnant or
      lactating, or are currently on corticosteroids, phenobarbital, or megestrol acetate. The goal
      will be to recruit a total of 45 eligible patients over a 1 year accrual period. The
      investigators expect to treat ~50 new patients per year with TAM at the standard dose of 20
      mg/day.
