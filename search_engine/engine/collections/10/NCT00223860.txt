      gain of fat, with associated adverse carbohydrate, lipid, and energy expenditure changes that
      increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Impotence and infertility are common in patients
      with SCI. Of the many possible explanations of poor semen quality, one possible etiology is
      dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Early reports have been
      inconclusive with regard to testicular function. These apparent discrepancies could, at least
      in part, be attributed to varying factors in population selection, including health and
      nutrition parameters, medication effects, and level and duration of injury, or to differences
      in methodology. Recently, two large population studies found a sizeable proportion of persons
      with SCI having testosterone deficiency. Huang et al. (1993) found significantly elevated
      luteinizing hormone (LH) responses to LH releasing hormone (LHRH) in subjects with SCI
      compared to controls. Of those studied with LHRH stimulation, 16/30 subjects with SCI had
      exaggerated LH responses and 6/30 had elevated follicular stimulation hormone (FSH)
      responses. Bulat et al., (1995) have shown that persons with tetraplegia tend to have
      increased gonadotropin release to standard provocative stimulation compared with able-bodied
      controls or those with paraplegia. In a preliminary report, testicular stimulation with
      standard doses of hCG for 2 days was similar in 10 subjects with SCI and 8 able-bodied
      controls.
