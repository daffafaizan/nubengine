    
      Induction chemotherapy:

      All-trans retinoic acid, will be administered by mouth (PO) from the first day at a dose of
      45 mg/m²/day, fractionated into 2 doses.

      In patients aged < 20 years, the ATRA dose will be reduced to 25 mg/m²/day fractionated into
      2 doses.

      The treatment with ATRA will continue until a CR is achieved or for a maximum of 90 days in
      the case of persistence of atypical promyelocytes in the bone marrow.

      Idarubicin, 12 mg/m² on days 2, 4, 6 and 8 of treatment by slow intravenous infusion (20
      minutes).

      In patients older than 70 years of age only 3 doses of idarubicin will be given on days 2, 4,
      and 6.

      Supporting measures:

      Prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg/day days 1 to 15. Tranexamic acid, 100 mg/kg/day in continuous
      perfusion, if platelets < 50 x 10^9/L or evident clinical-biological signs of coagulopathy.
      This treatment will be discontinued if the platelet counts are > 50 x 10^9/L.

      Transfusion of platelet concentrates to keep up counts above 30 x 10^9/L during the first 10
      days and PRC to maintain hemoglobin levels greater than 9 g/dL.

      Prophylactic heparin should not be used.
