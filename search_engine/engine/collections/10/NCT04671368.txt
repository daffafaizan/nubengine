      surgery and specimens for pathological analysis will be taken according to the routine
      treatment process.

      The histopathologic slides will then be digitized by a whole-slide scanner. The images will
      be reviewed by gold standard committee for evaluation of ground truth. And then be separately
      diagnosed by Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System and practicing pathologists. So the
      investigators can compare the diagnostic efficiency of Artificial Intelligence with that of
      pathologists, thus understand the gap between artificial intelligence and actual clinical
      practice.
