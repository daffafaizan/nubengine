      questionnaire. Among those who did not have neuropathic symptoms or who have DN4 score below
      4 will be considered for the study.Then aerobic capacity will be measured by a cycle
      ergometer and VO2max will be obtained. Weight, body mass index and muscle mass will be
      measured by bioimpedance analysis. Physical activity status will be determined by
      International Physical Activity Score (IPAQ). Cognitive function will be evaluated by Mini
      Mental test. HbA1c and fasting blood glucose will be measured in venous blood after overnight
      fasting. Blood pressure will be measured in the sitting position after resting from the left
      arm. Speed of gait will be measured by an accelerometer.Then, the effect of above mentioned
      factors on speed of gait will be studied.
