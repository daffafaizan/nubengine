      transplantation(ASCT) or progress after multiple lines of chemotherapy have a poor prognosis,
      with a median survival of approximately 1.2 years.

      CHL frequently harbors a spectrum of chromosome 9p24.1/PD-L1/PD-L2 alterations, leading to
      overexpression of the programmed death 1 ligands,PD-L1 and PD-L2.

      Sintilimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1 that blocks the interaction
      between PD-1 and its ligands and was approved for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma in
      China in 2018.

      This study is a single arm,phase 2 study designed to evaluate the clinical activity of
      sintilimab in Chinese patients with R/R
