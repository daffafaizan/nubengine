      non-bacterial category of prostatitis that is a significant source of morbidity in American
      men. The cause of CPPS is unknown and there is a lack of convenient biomarkers for diagnosis
      of this syndrome. This project will examine the expression of biomarkers in expressed
      prostatic fluid from adult men with and without a diagnosis of CPPS. Thus our specific aim is
      to validate the use of the chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha and mast cell tryptase as
      biomarkers for CPPS in humans and correlate their levels with CPPS symptoms.
