      in the United States, and morbidity and mortality from COPD continue to rise. Despite the
      magnitude of the problem, therapeutic options are limited - particularly in comparison to
      cardiovascular disease. Smoking cessation is essential to the treatment and prevention of
      COPD. However, although smoking is the principal cause of COPD, only a minority of smokers
      develops symptomatic COPD and many former smokers develop COPD years to decades after they
      have stopped smoking. The only other medical intervention proven to reduce mortality from
      COPD is supplemental oxygen therapy. There is therefore an urgent need for newer
      understandings of the pathophysiology of COPD that might lead to the development of better
      therapies for COPD.

      MESA-Lung is ancillary of the ongoing Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). MESA-lung
      will utilize the various existing measures of endothelial function that have been already
      been collected in MESA (flow-mediated dilatation [FMD] and related biomarkers and gene
      polymorphisms) to test the hypotheses that the endothelial dysfunction occurs in the clinical
      COPD.
