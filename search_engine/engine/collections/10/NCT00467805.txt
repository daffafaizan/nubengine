      (separated by 2-3 days, first time - at the 3rd-8th day of their menstrual cycle) to be
      exposed for 45' to white-appearing or red LED light (sequential allocation). The white light
      has a distinct peak at 460 nm, the narrow-band red light peaked at 651 nm. The LED devices
      were positioned at the distance of 50 cm (white) and 45 cm (red) from the eyes to be matched
      by irradiance (approximately 7.0 microWt/m2); background light in direction of gaze was 5-10
      lux. Blood and saliva samples were collected before, in the middle, and during the last
      minutes of the 45' exposure to be measured later for concentration of luteinizing hormone,
      follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, estrogen, progesterone, and also - for cortisol and
      melatonin (the last one - in saliva) as well-studied indicators of the direct effect of
      light.
