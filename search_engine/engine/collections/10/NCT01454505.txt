      subjects (healthy normal volunteers). Each cohort was administered a different dose of
      AL-53817 Nasal Spray Solution in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      In Stage B, 2 different cohorts of unique, ragweed-sensitive subjects were administered the
      MTD for up to 5 days twice a day to determine the safety and efficacy of AL-53817 Nasal Spray
      Solution for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Subjects were required to meet minimum
      allergic rhinitis scores at two qualifying EEC visits to participate in the study. Subjects
      were continually housed in clinic during the 5-day treatment period.
