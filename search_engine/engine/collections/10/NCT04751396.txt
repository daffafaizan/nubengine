      I. To evaluate the acceptability (e.g., ease of use, design, accessibility, content) of the
      educational tool that will be developed for patients with melanoma and pre-existing
      autoimmune conditions considering or undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

      II. To test the usability in real world-settings of the educational tool (to be developed)
      and evaluate feasibility of patient recruitment (i.e., ability to identify enough patients
      and consent at least 50% of the identified patients) in a pilot study.

      OUTLINE:

      PART A: Participants navigate the educational tool over 30-45 minutes then participate in an
      interview about their thoughts and opinions about the content, ease of use, and format of the
      tool over 45 minutes.

      PART B: 2 group of participants will be evaluated sequentially (Participants in group II will
      be enrolled after all the participants in group I have been assessed).

      GROUP I: Patients receive standard educational information during their clinician encounter.
      Patients also complete questionnaires over 30-45 minutes at baseline within a week prior to
      their clinician encounter, immediately after the encounter, and at 3 months.

      GROUP II: Patients navigate educational tool over 20 minutes during their clinician
      encounter. Patients also complete questionnaires over 30-45 minutes at baseline within a week
      prior to their clinician encounter, immediately after the encounter, and at 3 months.
