      placebo-controlled clinical trial. Background: Vitamin D replacement could aid in the
      osseointegration of dental implants. Objective: to evaluate the effect of vitamin D
      replacement on osseointegration of dental implants in humans. Materials and methods: Twenty
      individuals with hypovitaminosis D underwent dental miniimplants and randomized to two equal
      groups for treatment with vitamin D (5000 IU / day) or placebo for 2 months. After two
      months, the miniimplants will be removed and prepared for histomorphometric analysis, which
      will evaluate bone implant contact in percentage. Testing the hypothesis that the contact
      between bone and implant and the bone density in the threaded area in the test group is
      higher than in the control group. Test t will be used to compare the differences between the
      groups.
