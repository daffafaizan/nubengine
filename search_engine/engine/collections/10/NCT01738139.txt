      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of intravenous ipilimumab (Yervoy)
      administered in combination with oral imatinib mesylate (GLEEVEC) for patients with advanced
      malignancies that are refractory to standard therapy, relapsed after standard therapy, or
      have no available standard therapy.

      II. To determine the maximum toxic dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      ipilimumab and imatinib mesylate combination therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine antitumor activity of ipilimumab and imatinib mesylate combination therapy.

      II. To determine antitumor activity of ipilimumab and imatinib mesylate combination therapy
      in KIT confirmed solid tumors.

      III. To evaluate the potential predictive role of tumor-associated immune biomarkers for
      therapy effectiveness.

      IV. To evaluate the potential predictive role of therapy associated toxicities with antitumor
      activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 and imatinib
      mesylated orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
