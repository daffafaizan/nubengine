      enrolled into this trial in two stages. All enrolled patients will be treated with R788 at
      200 mg PO bid until disease progression. In the initial stage of the study, a total of 19
      patients will be enrolled and treated with Fostamatinib Disodium. Should at least 4 patients
      exhibit a response at Week 8 or later of the study, the second stage of 36 patients will open
      to enrollment. Efficacy will be assessed by CT and PET scans (when indicated) and physical
      exam at baseline, and CT scans and physical exam of all disease-involved areas every 8 weeks
      until progression. Safety will be assessed by periodic physical exams, clinical laboratory
      studies, and adverse events. All patients will have a follow-up visit 30 days following last
      study drug treatment. Blood samples for PK assessment will be obtained from all patients
      enrolled in Stage 1 at protocol-defined intervals. Patients with accessible tumor tissue will
      be asked to undergo a biopsy for a fresh tissue sample for assessment of Syk activity in
      tumor tissue. Archived tissue samples from the initial diagnostic biopsy and the most recent
      biopsy for lymphoma will be obtained in the event a fresh tumor biopsy cannot be obtained.
      Patients who have accessible tumor tissue will be asked to consent to a second tumor biopsy
      at Week 8, to assess the impact of Fostamatinib Disodium treatment on the activity of Syk and
      its downstream markers. All baseline fresh or archived tumor tissue samples will undergo
      central pathology review to confirm the diagnosis of TCL.
