      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with stage IV ocular melanoma treated with
           lenalidomide, sunitinib malate, and low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Obtain blood, urine, and tissue samples from these patients, when easily accessible, to
           determine the effects of this regimen on pathways thought to have been modulated by this
           regimen in pre-clinical studies.

      OUTLINE: This is nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open-label study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide, oral sunitinib malate*, and oral low-dose
      cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Some patients will not receive sunitinib malate during course 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      4 months for 3 years and then annually thereafter.
