      production in healthy men. There are three phase to the study, a 2-month screening phase,
      4-month treatment and 3-month follow-up. In this study, the investigators aim to define a
      quantitative relationship between intra-testicular testosterone (IT-T) and spermatogenesis in
      man. Hormone levels will be measured in a small amount of testicular fluid at the beginning
      and end of treatment and sperm concentration will be measured.
