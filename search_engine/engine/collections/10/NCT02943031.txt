      enroll in the study. After bile duct tumor samples were collected, whole genome sequencing,
      drug screening ( including Mini-PDX and PDX) will conduct. Suitable drugs will be decided
      according to the different genomics classification, and then to develop individualized
      precise treatment programs.

      The investigators hope to achieve the following objectives:

      ① Through the establishment of Individualized Precision Therapy Programs to improve the
      overall survival of bile duct malignancy (BTC)；

      ② To study the molecular typing of the prognosis of biliary malignancy;

      ③ To construct a database of BTC gene bank, as well as for drug screening information.
