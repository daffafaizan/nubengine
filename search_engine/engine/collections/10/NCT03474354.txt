      loaded with doxorubicin in the treatment of unresectable HCC. Prospective, single arm, open
      label, single centre, pilot study. All patients will undergo clinical follow-up. Twenty
      patients will be enrolled. Primary endpoint : Local response (evaluated with CT and MRI at 4
      to 6 weeks post each procedure and at 6 months according to mRECIST) in patients with
      intermediate-stage HCC following chemoembolisation with radiopaque bead. Secondary endpoints
      include: 1) Better definition of end point of embolization for drug eluting beads : Ability
      to achieve near-stasis during chemoembolisation procedure in the tumour feeding vessels using
      intra-procedural imaging feedback from the radiopaque bead (early visualization of non target
      embolization 2) Total dose needed for tumor devascularization 3)Distribution of radiopaque
      beads and correlation with necrosis and adverse events
