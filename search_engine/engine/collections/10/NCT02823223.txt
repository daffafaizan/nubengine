      compare the efficacy of the Zephyr endobronchial valves vs. Standard of Care (SoC) in
      patients suffering from COPD with Heterogeneous Emphysema. Patients will be followed up for 6
      months after randomization. Patients in the SoC arm will crossover to the EBV treatment arm
      after the 6-month visit and will be followed up for 6 additional months.The primary objective
      is the variation of FEV1 between baseline and 3-month follow-up visit. The secondary
      objectives will evaluate quality of life, exercise capacity, dyspnea (including BODE index)
      changes, target lobe volume reduction, as well as safety outcomes.
