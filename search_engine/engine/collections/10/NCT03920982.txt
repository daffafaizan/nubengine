      harmful solutes targeting the cardiovascular system, immunologic system, endothelium and bone
      metabolism. However, nothing is known about the potential accumulation and pejorative effects
      of those uremic toxins during AKI (Acute Kidney Injury). The objective of this study is to
      explore the role of the uremic toxins and specially IS (Indoxyl Sulfate) in the mortality of
      patients hospitalized for a septic shock and AKI. This study will also describe for the first
      time the kinetic of the blood concentration of different uremic toxins and their relation
      with the mortality and the kidney function.
