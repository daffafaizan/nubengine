      and identify subgroups of patients with funguria at high risk for candiduria and determine
      the relative risks for obtaining candiduria. In addition, it will look at identifying
      subgroups of patients with funguria at high risk for candidemia and identifying subgroups of
      patients with funguria at high risk for death. Finally, it will attempt to determine if
      funguria independently predicts fungemia or death. Data will be complemented by surveillance
      of a comparable population without funguria.
