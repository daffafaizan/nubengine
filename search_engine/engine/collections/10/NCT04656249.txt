      the KIT and RET tyrosine kinases and was initially developed for use in various tumor types.
      This is a single-center, non-random, open-label study in participants with unresectable BTC
      and disease progression or failure following at least one chemotherapy regimen. This study
      contains three procedures: a pre-treatment procedure that will last within 21 days; a
      treatment procedure that will consist of study treatment cycles and tumor assessment
      conducted every 6-8 weeks; and a follow-up procedure that will begin immediately after the
      off-treatment visit and will continue as long as the participant is alive, unless the
      participant withdraws consent, or until the terminal of the study.
