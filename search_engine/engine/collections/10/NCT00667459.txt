      implant device,the PRESTIGE® LP Cervical Disc, with a control patient group receiving a
      plate. The PRESTIGE® LP Cervical Disc devices were implanted using an anterior surgical
      approach. Data from control patients receiving anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with
      an ATLANTIS Anterior Cervical Plate from the initial Artificial Cervical Disc study
      (NCT00642876) were compared as both treatment groups receive single-level surgical treatment
      from C3-C4 to C6-C7 for symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease.
