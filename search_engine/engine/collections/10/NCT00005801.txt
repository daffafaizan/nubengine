      older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning
      comprised of low dose total body irradiation, followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem
      cell transplantation, followed by unrelated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). II. Determine
      whether mixed chimerism can be safely converted to full donor chimerism in patients treated
      with DLI. III. Determine the potential efficacy of this regimen in AML patients who are in
      first remission.

      OUTLINE: Conditioning: Patients undergo low dose total body irradiation followed by infusion
      of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on day 0. Donor lymphocyte infusions:
      Nonmobilized donor lymphocytes are harvested from the same HLA identical related donor on day
      95 after PBSC transplantation. Eligible patients with mixed chimerism and no graft versus
      host disease (GVHD) receive the first donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on the same day that
      donor lymphocytes are collected. Patients who continue to have mixed chimerism and no GVHD
      receive the second DLI at a higher dose level on day 65 after the first DLI. Patients are
      followed weekly until day 90, and then monthly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
