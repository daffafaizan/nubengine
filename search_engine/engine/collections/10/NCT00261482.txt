      Marketing Authorization throughout the European Union. This is an open-label, single-arm,
      multicenter clinical study with a treatment duration of 24 weeks (6 treatment cycles of 4
      weeks). Four clinic visits are scheduled: a screening Visit 1, in which subjects are asked to
      complete a set of questions about satisfaction with the current method of contraception, and
      questions about overall health status. Visits 2, 3, and 4 follow after Cycles 1, 3, and 6,
      respectively of EVRA treatment. At Visits 3 and 4, the subjects are asked to answer questions
      about satisfaction with EVRA, and about overall health status. At Visit 4 (final study visit)
      the subjects are asked to compare EVRA with previously used contraceptive methods. Compliance
      is assessed at all visits by returned boxes of study medication and a review of Diary Cards
      where subjects recorded the dates and sites of patch application, and details of any patch
      detachment. The study will generate the first large-scale, European dataset on women's
      experience with EVRA, including satisfaction, safety, efficacy, and compliance. These data
      will be compared with subjects' experience with previously used methods of contraception.
      Each EVRA patch, containing 6 mg NGMN and 600 ug EE, and delivering 150 microgram NGMN and 20
      ug EE over 24 hours for 7 days, is worn for 1 week and replaced for 3 consecutive weeks. The
      fourth week is patch-free. Subjects can wear EVRA on 1 of 4 areas: buttock, abdomen, upper
      torso, or upper arm.
