    
      The study will take place in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) or in the CICU (Cardiac Intensive
      Care Unit) units, on non-anaesthetized subjects with an arterial line inserted into the
      radial artery. Continuous recording will be performed in parallel using invasive arterial
      line recording and CardiacSenseBP1 non-invasive recording. The ECG data recorded in the ICU
      will also be obtained. .

      Up to 80 subjects will be included in the study.

      The subject will possibly be connected to the CardiacSense1BP device a few times to check
      repeatability. The first measurement will be of up to 24h. Subsequent measurements will be of
      up to 5h. Data analysis will be performed offline.

      Data is collected for CardiacSense1BP device algorithm development.
