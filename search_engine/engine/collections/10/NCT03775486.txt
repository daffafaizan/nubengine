      to curative surgery or radiation with tumors that lack activation EGFR mutations and ALK
      fusions are eligible for enrollment. During the initial therapy phase, patients will receive
      treatment with Durvalumab along with the Investigator's choice of platinum-based doublet
      therapy for squamous NSCLC (nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin or gemcitabine plus
      carboplatin/cisplatin) and non-squamous NSCLC (nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin or pemetrexed
      plus carboplatin/cisplatin) for 4 cycles. Patients who have completed 4 cycles and not
      progressed throughout the initial therapy phase will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the
      maintenance phase of the study to receive either Durvalumab plus placebo or Durvalumab plus
      Olaparib maintenance therapy. Patients will receive maintenance treatment until specific
      discontinuation criteria are met, including clinical disease progression (as assessed by the
      Investigator) or RECIST 1.1-defined radiological Progressive Disease (PD), unacceptable
      toxicity, and withdrawal of consent. Tumor evaluation scans will be performed until objective
      disease progression as efficacy assessments. All patients will be followed for survival until
      the end of the study.
