    
      Monocentric, randomized, prospective, single blind, two treatment and two period crossover
      study.

      The investigators have proposed a cross-over trial to avoid or to detect the bias due to
      intra-individual variability and because, from preliminary observation, it has been noted
      that the effects of PEA on pattern-electroretinogram (PERG) are completely reversible after
      withdrawal, within one month.

      The investigators didn't considered a placebo treated group because the patient cannot
      interfere with the pattern-electroretinogram PERG measurement that is objective and totally
      patient-independent.
