    
      Randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial comparing postconditioning to control (no
      intervention). Postconditioning consists of four episodes of one minute inflation followed by
      one minute deflation of the angioplasty balloon, starting within one minute of reflow after
      direct stenting of the occluded coronary artery.
