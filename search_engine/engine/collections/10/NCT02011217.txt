      appetite and metabolism will be evaluated using a randomized cross-over study design. Each
      participant will consume three different breakfasts consisting of two different rye crisp
      breads and one wheat crisp bread on three different occasions separated by a 1 week wash-out
      period. Participants will rate subjective appetite (satiety, hunger and desire to eat) by
      using a visual analogue scale (VAS) every 30 min during a 4-hour period, starting 30 min
      before breakfast. Blood samples will be collected before breakfast and at regular intervals
      throughout the day for analysis of glucose, insulin and hormone levels. Gastric emptying rate
      will also be evaluated using paracetamol as an indicator. Glucose and hormonal responses will
      be related to subjective appetite and to differences in composition of the breakfasts.
