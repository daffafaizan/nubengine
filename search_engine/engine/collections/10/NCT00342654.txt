    
      Two large, nutritional intervention trials were conducted in Linxian, China between
      1985-1991. These trials tested the effect of multiple vitamins and minerals in the prevention
      of esophageal cancer in a population with the highest known rate for this disease in the
      world. Results from the trials showed that Beta-carotene + Vitamin E + selenium reduced total
      mortality, total cancer mortality, and stomach cancer incidence and mortality.
      Multivitamins/minerals also showed reduction in premalignant lesions. Preliminary follow-up
      data obtained for the time period after cessation of intervention in 1991 suggests that the
      observed benefit for total and cancer mortality is reduced but that the benefit for stomach
      cancer remains.

      The objectives of the follow-up study are: (1) to continue to determine cancer incidence and
      all causes of mortality in trial participants after intervention to permit examination of
      potential effects of the interventions on total and cause-specific mortality and cancer
      incidence in the post-intervention period; (2) to conduct a cross-sectional nutritional
      survey in a subsample of living trial participants to evaluate their nutritional status,
      asses the validity of dietary questionnaires, and relate neurologic status to vitamin B12
      plasma levels; (3) to collect a blood sample from all living trial participants to permit
      further etiologic investigations of genetic and environmental hypotheses; and (4) to perform
      nested case-control studies of selected genetic and environmental hypotheses.

      To accomplish the objectives of the follow-up study, we will: (1) determine updated vital
      status and cancer status data on all trial participants via monthly checks of village doctor
      records and quarterly checks of the Linxian Cancer Registry; conduct a Vital/Cancer Status
      Interview Survey among all (n approximately 34,000 trial participants (or their surrogates);
      identify, collect, and store all available diagnostic materials for trial participants
      identified as having developed cancer or died with cancer during the follow-up period; (2)
      conduct a Nutritional Survey on a subsample (n approximately 1000) of living trial
      participants that will include (a) a physical exam and brief medical history, (b) a
      neurologic history, (c) a cognitive function exam, (d) a hair/mouth skin exam, (e) a
      neurological exam, (f) a nutritional questionnaire, and (g) collection of a blood sample for
      hematologic/ biochemical analyses; (3) conduct a Blood Collection Survey of all living trial
      participants (n approximately 23,000) to obtain (a) a physical exam and brief medical history
      and (b) a single 10-ml blood sample for separation and preservation as WBCs (both viable and
      nonviable), RBCs, and plasma for genetic (e.g., xenobiotic polymorphisms) and environmental
      (e.g., plasma ascorbic acid) hypothesis testing; and (4) perform Nested Case-Control Studies
      of selected genetic and environmental hypothesis related to the etiology and prevention of
      esophageal cancer and stroke. These will be done using serum from the new cancer and stroke
      cases (approximately 2500) and controls (approximately 2500) previously identified from
      1991-1996, as well as using new cancer and stroke cases and controls for the period 1996-2004
      (approximately 9000).

      The followup for endpoints will continue monthly for an additional 5 years (through the year
      2003). The Nutritional Survey and Blood Collection Survey will be conducted in the spring of
      1999. The Nested Case-Control studies will be performed annually beginning in 2000, and the
      Vital/Cancer Interview Survey will be conducted in the Spring of 2001.
