    
      This is a randomized controlled trial. The study will compare the healing of the surgical
      wound and the recurrence rate after excision and primary para-median closure versus narrow
      orifice excision (fistulectomy)

      Group A: excision and paramedian closure according to modified Karydakis technique

      Group B: removal / fistulectomy by scalpels or trephines of primary and drainage orifices,
      healing of the wound by secondary intention
