      diseases like asthma. In addition, VD3 has been demonstrated in vitro, ex vivo
      (skin-explants) and in animal models to program the immune system towards anti-inflammatory
      immune responses, dominated by regulatory T-cells (Treg) producing Interleukin (IL)-10. In
      response to allergens, healthy individuals by default have such a protective immune response
      against innocuous allergens, whereas allergic subjects develop an inflammatory Th2-type
      response. VD3 co-administered with allergen may be a promising adjuvant to improve the onset
      and efficacy of allergen immunotherapy (AIT), by helping the allergic immune system to divert
      towards an allergen-specific response dominated by regulatory T cells (Treg) and IL-10. A
      clinical trial will be performed to compare the immune effects, the tolerability and safety
      of multiple doses of a VD3 analogue (Zemplar® 5 μg/ml - Abbvie, registered for the
      intravenous route) administered by the subcutaneous (s.c.) route in subjects with allergic
      rhinitis and healthy controls. Primary and secondary outcomes will be compared at baseline
      and at several time points during the study to investigate whether 1) the healthy controls at
      baseline have a more anti-inflammatory systemic cellular immune response to polyclonal
      stimuli and to allergens compared to birch pollen allergic subjects, and 2) whether s.c.VD3
      analogue can skew these responses in allergic subjects towards a profile more resembling the
      one observed in healthy controls. The overall aim is to provide additional (in vivo) support
      for the use of VD3 as an adjuvant in allergen-specific immunotherapy, on top of the existing
      pre-clinical evidence demonstrating that antigen-presenting cells educate the adaptive immune
      system towards an anti-inflammatory response when allergen is seen in the presence of VD3.
