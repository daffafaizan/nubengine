      testing involved pedobar pressures and a validated comfort questionnaire.

      x rays with arthrosis 1. metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ), hallux valgus and Intermetatarsal
      (IM) angles will be recorded.

      Clinically, weight, height, foot length, heel valgus, 1. MTPJ range of motion, pain, callus,
      hammertoes will be recorded.

      Sole pressure in heel, arch and forefoot grids measured by in-sole pressure pedar-x (Novel)
      and possible Emed system (Novel).

      3 working days in each type of shoe with Steps measured by pedometer Comfort assed as VAS
      according to: Mundermann,A., Nigg,B.M., Stefanyshyn,D.J., and Humble,R.N.: Development of a
      reliable method to asses footwear comfort during running. Gait Posture, 16:38-45, 2002.

      Primary outcome is the foot sole pressures. Both VAS comfort and foot pressures will be
      regressed to see if age, BMI, shoe size, steps, shoe type, callus, index minus, hallux valgus
      etc has an effect.

      16 needed for the pressure and 21 for the comfort score. 22 will be included to make sure the
      investigators have enough power.
