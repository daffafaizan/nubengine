    
      Protocol:

        1. Volitional Cough assessment by spirometer (Pony FX- Cosmed): a) Forced vital capacity
           (FVC); b) Volume Tidal; c) Maximum Espiratory Pressure (MEP); d) Maximum Inspiratory
           Pressure (MIP); e) Peak of Cough Expiratory Flow.

        2. Cough Reflex would be trigged by the inhalation of 0.4M of citric acid solution using
           the ultrasonic nebulizer (MO-03 Norditalia Elettromedicali) connected with the
           spirometer and the nebulizer via a bidirectional valve. It would be measured the Peak of
           Cough Expiratory Flow.

      Participants:

      It would be recruited 60 subjects at the IRCCS Ospedale San Camillo Venezia (Italy). All
      participants have to provide informed consent independently. The study group is composed by
      thirty participants with diagnosis of ALS and the severity score of Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS). The control group consist of thirty healthy
      subjects matched by aged and sex with the study group.

      Statistical consideration:

      The variables measured will be summarized by means and standard deviations or by proportions.
      Numeric variables MIP-MEP-FVC-Vt-PCEF will be analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test to verify
      the normality of distribution. Depending on the outcome, for the comparison between groups
      will be used or the t-test (parametric) or the test of Mann Whitney (non-parametric) for
      independent samples.
