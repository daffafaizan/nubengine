      on the basis of clinical, electrophysiological and serological features. Cyclosporine as a
      disease-modifying therapy has been effective in a controlled study; corticosteroids,
      immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis and
      intravenous human immune globulin have shown benefit in uncontrolled trials. There are
      several drawbacks to currently used medical treatments, including serious and debilitating
      side-effects, prohibitive costs, and the need for continuous or periodical treatment. Almost
      20-25% of patients with MG are unresponsive to commonly used therapies, resulting in
      significant burden and economic loss. Rituximab is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
      which produces a substantial reduction in circulating plasma cells (CD19+) and B cells
      (CD20+) and provides targeted therapy for B-cell lymphomas. Recently, rituximab has been
      found to be effective in several antibody-mediated autoimmune processes, including immune
      thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and IgM-related polyneuropathies. There is
      preliminary evidence in the literature that treatment of MG patients with rituximab is likely
      to be of benefit. These observations would strongly suggest that rituximab might benefit
      refractory MG and needs further study.
