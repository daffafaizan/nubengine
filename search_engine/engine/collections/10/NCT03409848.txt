    
      Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world, and the third leading cause of
      cancer death in both sexes worldwide.

      Surgical resection is currently the only curative treatment option for gastric cancer;
      however, ~50% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and chemotherapy
      is the mainstay of palliation in this setting.

      Trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, significantly improved survival in patients
      with overexpression of HER2.

      In regard of the very limited therapeutic landscape of HER2 positive EGA, compared to breast
      cancer, further treatment options to relevantly improve the outcome is warranted. The
      integration of check-point inhibitors (e.g. Nivolumab, Ipilimumab) into the first line
      setting either within a chemotherapy-free combination arm or within an intensified standard
      arm of FOLFOX and trastuzumab with nivolumab may be able to improve the current limited
      survival of median 14 months.
