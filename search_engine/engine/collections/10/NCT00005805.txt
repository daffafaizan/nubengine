      fatigue in patients undergoing chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for malignant disease. II.
      Determine the relationship between fatigue, depression, and anxiety in these patients. III.
      Determine the correlation between quality of sleep and level of fatigue in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled study. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) 3
      times a day. Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo 3 times a day. Treatment continues for
      6 weeks in the absence of worsening symptoms or unacceptable toxicity. Patients complete the
      Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Brief Fatigue Inventory at the beginning and end of the
      study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (110 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
