      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity rate of therapy with weekly
      bortezomib combined with oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and low-dose dexamethasone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival. II. To describe the association between disease status,
      treatment response, treatment toxicity, quality of life, functional status, risk for
      development of frailty, and inflammatory cytokine levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on
      days 1, 8, and 15; cyclophosphamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21; and
      dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months.
