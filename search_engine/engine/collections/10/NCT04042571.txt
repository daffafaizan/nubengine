      significantly influencing morbidity and mortality. Mostly observed between days 4 and 10
      after aneurismal rupture, its incidence is higher in cases of severe SAH. Vasospasm strongly
      affects prognisis generating delayed cerebral ischemia.

      Clinical deterioration (focal neurological deficit) is the best way to detect severe
      vasospasm. Unfortunately, most of severe SAH are intubated and sedated prohibiting
      neurological evaluation. In these frequent situations, Transcranial Doppler (TCD), clinical
      and biological monitoring, CT-scanner (angio-CT and Perfusion-CT), MRI and cerebral
      angiography are routinely used to detect vasospasm. Yet, these tools have imperfect
      sensitivity and specificty delaying diagnosis and treatment.

      Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method measuring tissue oxygenation by
      regional saturation of capillary-oxygenated hemoglobin (rSO2). This technology demonstrated
      ability to measure cerebral oxygenation and has previously been reported to monitor carotid
      and pediatric surgery. To date a few studies also reported NIRS monitoring feasability in
      post-SAH vasospasm. Our aim is here to evaluate NIRS monitoring for the diagnosis of
      vasospasm in severe SAH.
