      exclusion criteria. Seven to fourteen days prior to Allo-SCT (before initiation of SCT
      related antimicrobials), all consenting patients will supply stool sample (first stool
      sample), which will serve as the autologous FMT sample, and clinical data will be collected.
      Patients who will develop GI related GVHD will be asked to supply another stool sample 7Â±2
      days after the appearance of GVHD related symptoms (second stool sample). Clinical and
      laboratory data will be collected. Another stool sample will be collected 7-14 following
      autologous FMT (third stool sample), and clinical data and outcome will be documented. Day 1
      of the study will be defined as day of Allo-SCT, and follow up period is 6 months.
      Complementary data will be collected from the electronic medical records.
