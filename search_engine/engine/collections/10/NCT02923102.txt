      Recoverben® , a Aloysia citriodora extract on recovery after exhaustive exercise. Effects
      will be investigated with 400mg Recoverben® and compared to placebo.

      Targeted parameter will be determined at the beginning of the study and after
      supplementation, each. Parameter include maximal strength (MVC), muscle soreness (VAS), pain
      sensitivity (Algometry) and biomarkers (CK, IL-6, glutathione peroxidase).
