    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label and multicenter study. The study consists of a Screening Phase
      (28 days prior to the first administration of the study drug), Treatment Phase (time when the
      first dose of ibrutinib is administered until disease progression, the investigator no longer
      considers the treatment to be tolerable, or the participant meets any one of the
      discontinuation criteria) and Follow-up Phase (end of the last dose of study drug until 30
      days after the last dose of study drug or the start of subsequent anti-CLL/SLL therapy,
      whichever comes first). Participants will be instructed to take 3 capsules of ibrutinib (at a
      dose of 420 mg) orally once daily starting at Cycle 1, Day 1. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
