      intolerance are ventilatory limitation leading to deconditioning and inactivity. However the
      weak correlation between exercise capacity and FEV1 implies that other factors than reduced
      pulmonary function contribute to this impairment as well. Several studies have found changes
      in skeletal muscle, with fibre shift, increased oxidative stress, increased inflammatory
      cytokines and impaired mitochondrial function, suggesting a lower limb dysfunction.

      Numerous exercise studies in COPD patients have shown physiological and physiological
      benefits of training and endurance training is now regarded as an important part in pulmonary
      rehabilitation.

      In this study we investigate training effects in patients with moderate to severe COPD with
      special focus on skeletal muscle.

      COPD patients will perform high intensity aerobic interval knee-extensor exercise training 3
      days/week for six weeks . At baseline and follow-up, muscle oxygen consumption and
      mitochondrial respiration will be measured.
