lens development.. the differentiation of embryonic chick lensepithelial cells in vitro and in vivo .the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos wasstudied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantationinto several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed byreimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantationfollowed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lensmaterial of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serialsections . the results were interpreted as follows..1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount ofindependent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they failto undergo any fiber formation .2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explantswill respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellulardifferentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changesnecessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support theseresponses .3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficientfor their complete autonomous maturation .4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the onlydeterminant of its overall shape .
