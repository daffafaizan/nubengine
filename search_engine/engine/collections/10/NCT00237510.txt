      all antidepressants have been clearly shown to cause excessive sweating. It is unclear to
      what extent excessive sweating caused by antidepressants becomes less or goes away with time.
      In many instances, it continues to be a problem even after 6 or more months on the
      antidepressant.

      There is no generally accepted treatment for excessive sweating. This study has been designed
      to study whether terazosin is effective in reducing antidepressant-induced sweating, and
      whether it is well-tolerated and acceptable to patients. In addition, secondary objectives of
      this study are to determine the time taken for patients to respond to terazosin, the usual
      doses needed for improvement, and the extent of reduction in sweating. This information will
      not only help doctors in using terazosin for this purpose in their patients, but will help in
      designing further studies of this treatment.
