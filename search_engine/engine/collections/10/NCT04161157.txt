      identify any improvements that need to be made. Then, investigators will test the feasibility
      of the Pathways intervention with 20 patients who are undergoing cancer treatment for
      advanced stage or metastatic lung cancer. Pathways is designed to help patients set and
      pursue personal goals during lung cancer treatment. In this study, investigators want to see
      if they can recruit patients with lung cancer who are being treated at the University of
      Kentucky Markey Cancer Center to participate in the Pathways intervention.
