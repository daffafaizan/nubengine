    
      Procedure :

        1. All patients admitted to the Intensive care unit will undergo eligibility screening

        2. Baseline assessments will be performed to eligible participants upon the first 24 hours
           including :

             1. anthropometric data (age, gender, height (participant in the supine position),
                ideal body weight (IBW), Mid-Upper-Arm Circumference (MUAC), and primary admission
                diagnosis (Traumatic Brain Injury/TBI or non-TBI).

             2. Laboratory assessment including platelets, white blood cells, lymphocytes, serum
                creatinine levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, albumin, serum potassium
                levels, serum sodium levels, serum pH, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and
                partial pressure of oxygen (PO2)

             3. Scoring of Severity-of-illness using the laboratory parameters and clinical
                parameters under SOFA, APACHE II Score and NUTRIC score elements

        3. The allocation of the participants is performed through simple randomization with the
           masking of the investigator.

        4. the intervention will be done according to the protocol of each arm.

        5. Measurement of outcomes according to the time frame by the intensive care and
           nutritionist team.

        6. Data analysis including descriptive statistics and outcome analysis using paired t-test
           or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Differences in mean values between the 3 groups are
           compared using the ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test. A p-value <0.05 is considered
           statistically significant.
