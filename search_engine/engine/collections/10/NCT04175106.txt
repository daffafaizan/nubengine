      chosen for their phytonutrient levels. This will be compared to phytonutrient-matched
      processed protein bar and a macronutrient-matched control meal, in healthy human volunteers.
      Blueberry phytonutrients will be analyzed in blood and urine over a four-day period, 48h
      prior to consumption and 48h after. The participants will consume each of the four meals over
      a 3-month period (4-way crossover design, 4 blocks of 4-day periods).

      The main objective of this study is to compare the proportions of blueberry phytonutrients
      recovered in the blood and urine after ingestion of the four treatments.

      After eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomly assigned to the four berry related
      interventions. The consumption of each intervention corresponds to one study period, which
      are separated by one-week washout. Blood will be collected at baseline and across 48h (1h,
      3h, 6h, 9h, 24h, 48h) after intervention consumption while urine will be collected for 48h
      before and after intervention (-48h, -24h, 0-9h, 9-24h, 24-48h).
