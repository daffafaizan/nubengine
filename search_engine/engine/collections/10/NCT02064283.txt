      measures the movement of water molecules through tissue called diffusion MRI. Researchers are
      using this new MRI technology to track the diffusion, or movement, of water through tumor
      tissue, and map these changes as a cancer patient undergoes treatment. Early research seems
      to indicate that tumor cells restrict the movement of water, so as tumor cells die, the
      movement of water changes within the tumor. These changes in the movement (diffusion) of
      water may help doctors determine earlier than traditional tests whether a patient's cancer is
      responding (getting better) to treatment. This study will evaluate the feasibility of
      identifying changes in diffusion MRI characteristics of bone that correlates with response to
      therapy in men with metastatic prostate cancer.
