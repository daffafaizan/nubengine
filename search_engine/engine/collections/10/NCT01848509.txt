      criteria. 200 patients will be randomized into 2 arms (telemedicine with GPRS transmission of
      CPAP data from patients' home and classical follow-up) during the 3 first months of the
      follow-up. The main end-point is CPAP compliance with the aim of detecting a mean increase of
      at least 1hr in the use of CPAP.
