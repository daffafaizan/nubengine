      control group (conventional sutures) or into interventional group (synthetic tissue
      adhesive). The intervention time is documented. Follow-up visit is performed 8 weeks after
      port implantation. It includes a photo documentation, quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D)
      and pain scala questionnaire (POSAS) by patient and by 3 independent observers as well as the
      documentation of complications.
