      1, 4, 8 and 11 of the 21 day cycle. This process was repeated for 2 cycles. After two cycles
      of BD therapy, the collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) should be completed
      within 4 weeks. Recommended dose of drug is as follows: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) 5-10ug/kg on days 1-5 will be given, then peripheral blood stem cells will be
      collected on days 5-6 for 2Ã—10^6 CD34+ cells /kg. Patients will receive ASCT therapy in 8
      weeks after collection of PBSC (Recorded as day 0), while melphalan (day -2) with a dose of
      140 or 200 mg/m2 (choosing a dose according to the degree of risk for patients). Melphalan
      will be administered by central venous catheter.

      Arm 2: the patients who assigned to arm 2 will receive ASCT alone as an initial treatment.
      The process of ASCT is as same as arm 1.
