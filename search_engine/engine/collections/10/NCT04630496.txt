      examining the use of a Fitbit by thoracic surgery patients over the age of 70 years-old
      before surgery. The study is looking to see if patients can wear a wrist step-tracker and
      keep a log of their daily step counts for one week. The study is looking to see if people are
      willing to keep track of their daily steps, so in the future participants may be provided
      with step-goals to achieve and their steps prior to surgery can be accurately measured.

      This research study involves using a Fitbit tracker to record daily steps over the course of
      1 week prior to scheduled surgery. Participants will be given a step tracker in clinic and
      instructed on its use. During the 1 week period, participants will be called by a study team
      to check on progress.

      After a week, participants will be asked to return the step-tracker and their log either at a
      scheduled pre-surgery clinic visit or in the pre-operative area which ever comes first.

      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.
