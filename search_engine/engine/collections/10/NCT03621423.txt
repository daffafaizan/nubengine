      described in the literature and is a common practice in hemiplegic shoulder. The Injection
      technic in this pathology is described by using anatomical landmarks of the shoulder region
      without using medical imaging.

      On the other hand, injections to the subscapularis muscle has also been described using
      ultrasound guidance but not for this specific pathology.

      There are no evidence-based guidelines describing us guided spastic subscapularis muscle
      injection. Injecting this muscle while in its spastic state requires a modulated approach
      Harrison et.al described cadaveric dissections of the subscapularis muscle and proposed a
      technique to reach the motor point zone of this muscle In our study the investigators follow
      the injection description published by Dong Wook Rha on cadavers based on Harrison's lateral
      approach description. The Ultrasound enables a correct identification of the target muscle
      avoiding possible complication of vessel or pulmonary puncture In our study the investigators
      will try to prove the efficacy of the lateral approach to the subscapularis muscle using
      ultrasound and nerve stimulator
