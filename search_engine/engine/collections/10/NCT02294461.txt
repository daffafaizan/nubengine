      and safety study of oral enzalutamide (formerly MDV3100) in asymptomatic or mildly
      symptomatic participants with progressive metastatic prostate cancer who have disease
      progression despite androgen deprivation therapy. In order to join the study, participants
      could not have been previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Approximately 30 Chinese
      participants were allocated to the pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort. Participants in the PK cohort
      were required to be hospitalized from Day 1 before the randomization date to at least the
      completion of all the assessments planned on Day 3. All participants in the PK cohort
      underwent blood sampling for the PK analysis. Data reported in the results section was based
      on data cutoff dates of 20 Sept 2015 for efficacy and safety data and 20 Jan 2016 for PK
      outcome measures. The study completed double-blind period and is now in the open-label
      period.
