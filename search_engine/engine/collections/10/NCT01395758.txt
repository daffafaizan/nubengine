      plus tivantinib (ARQ 197) versus single agent chemotherapy in subjects with previously
      treated KRAS mutation positive NSCLC. Eligible subjects are randomly assigned to receive
      erlotinib plus tivantinib or one of three (based on Investigator's choice) single-agent
      chemotherapy agents including pemetrexed, docetaxel, or gemcitabine.
