      lesion. FD is claimed to affect 25% of the population in South Korea. Although conventional
      approaches based on current evidence such as proton pump inhibitor and prokinetic agents have
      been used, many FD patients turn to traditional Korean Medicine treatment largely due to the
      lack of satisfactory effect of these treatments.

      Acupuncture treatment, one of the most sought therapeutic modalities in traditional Korean
      Medicine, has been commonly used for gastrointestinal disorders in Korea. However, the effect
      of acupuncture on FD has not been rigorously evaluated. In the present study, we will
      investigate whether 8 sessions of acupuncture treatment over 4 weeks, in comparison with no
      acupuncture treatment, i.e. waitlist-control, improve symptoms of FD. Outcome measures
      include proportion of responder, Korean version of Nepean Dyspepsia Index, EuroQol-5
      Dimension, Functional Dyspepsia-Related Quality of Life, Beck's Depression Inventory,
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and ghrelin hormone. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) will
      be also conducted to elucidate any possible difference in genotype between responders and
      non-responders to acupuncture treatment.
