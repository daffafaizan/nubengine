      studied after surgery. Brief cognitive exam will be done followed by fMRI of connectivity and
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Connectivity (neuronal changes) and DTI (Anisotropy and mean
      diffusivity) data will be compared with age matched controls and correlated with subjective
      measures of cognition.
