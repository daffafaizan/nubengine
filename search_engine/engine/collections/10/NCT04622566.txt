      Asia, which generally carries a worse prognosis than cutaneous melanoma. Surgery remains the
      primary therapeutic intervention for mucosal melanoma, and neoadjuvant therapy is still
      needed which can lead to improvements in outcomes by surgical resectability, local control
      and organ preservation.

      Immunotherapy has showed promising activity in advanced melanoma. However, PD-1 antibodies,
      both Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, showed much poorer response to mucosal melanoma than to
      cutaneous melanoma.

      Pembrolizumab showed modest objective response rate (ORR, 13%) in advanced mucosal melanoma
      in Chinese population (NCT02628067). Recent study also demonstrated that neoadjuvant therapy
      with one dose of Pembrolizumab could lead to pathological complete response (pCR) or major
      response in nearly 30% of resectable advanced melanoma and pCR was associated with reduced
      risk of recurrence and improved survival.

      Lenvatinib is also a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of VEGFR1,2, 3
      which has been approved by FDA for differentiated thyroid cancer, advanced renal cell
      carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.

      It is hypothesized that neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in combination with Lenvatinib could result
      in higher anti-tumor activity with lower toxicity and prolong RFS and OS in high-risk
      resectable mucosal melanoma.

      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of the combination Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib
      as neoadjuvant treatment in resectable mucosal melanoma.
