      1) To compare the efficacy of two commonly used, generally accepted forms of immobilization
      for the treatment of lesions in the head with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy.
      Specifically, this study will use the ExacTRAC kilovoltage imaging system to assess
      positioning accuracy for these two systems.

      OUTLINE:

      Two routinely used methods of immobilization, which differ in their approach to reproduce
      head position from day-to-day are the Gill-Thomas-Cosman (GTC)frame and the BrainLab
      thermoplastic mask. The GTC frame fixates on the patient upper detention and thus us in
      direct mechanical contact with the cranium. The BrainLab mask is a two-part masking system
      custom-fitted to the front and back of the participant's head. After patients sign an
      IRB-approved informed consent form, eligible participants are either randomized to either the
      GTC frame or the mask for their course of SRT. Participants are treated as per standard
      procedure; however, prior to each treatment, a set of digital kV images (ExacTrac,
      BrainLabAB, Germany) is taken. These images are fused with reference digitally constructed
      radiographs obtained from treatment planning CT to yield lateral, longitudinal, and vertical
      deviations of isocenter and head rotations about respective axes. The primary endpoint of the
      study is to compare the two systems with respect to mean and standard deviations (SDs) using
      the distance to isocenter measure.
