      exchange of Na+-K+ and Na+-H+ in the distal tubule and collecting duct of the kidney, thus
      increasing the excretion of Na+ and water, reducing the excretion of K+ and H+. Recent
      studies have found a significant increase in urine uPA in patients with massive
      proteinuria.Urine uPA concentration were positively correlated with urinary protein and
      decreased with remission of proteinuria. In children and adults with nephrotic syndrome,as
      well as rat with proteinuria induced by puromycin amino-nucleoside, amiloride can inhibit uPA
      concentration in urine, which may be one of the mechanisms of amiloride in reducing
      proteinuria.

      This study is a prospective , crossover, open-Label study. All patients need to be on an
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) daily
      at least four weeks prior to the study. The baseline data would be recorded. Patients
      enrolled will receive either amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide first for 8
      weeks.Hydrochlorothiazide, a similar diuretic as amiloride, but not inhibiting urokinase
      plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), will be used as a control. Then the patients will
      discontinue amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide for a washout for 4 weeks, but continue with the
      ACE inhibitor or ARB. After that patients will cross over to receive another medication for
      another 8 weeks. We aim to evaluate the effect and safety of Amiloride in decreasing
      proteinuria for patients with chronic kidney disease.
