      of altered melatonin production in individuals with autism. Melatonin produced in the pineal
      gland helps regulate human circadian rhythms including sleep-wake, and is considered as the
      best measure of circadian rhythms.

      Several studies revealed that plasmatic and urinary nocturnal levels of melatonin are
      significantly lower in individuals with autism (in particular, in prepubertal children)
      compared to typically developing individuals. In addition, this reduction in nocturnal
      melatonin was significantly associated with the severity of communication and social
      interaction impairments, especially in verbal communication and play. Finally, diurnal
      excretion of melatonin was also found to be decreased in individuals with autistic disorder.

      Given these results, administration of melatonin could serve, at least in prepubertal
      children wih autism, to normalize physiological, developmental and behavioral processes that
      are influenced by this pineal hormone. A randomized clinical trial is therefore necessary to
      establish potential therapeutic efficacy of melatonin in autistic disorder and to specify its
      dose-effect relation. This is the first clinical trial studying the melatonin dose-effect in
      autism.
