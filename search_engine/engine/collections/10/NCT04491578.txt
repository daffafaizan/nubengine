    
      This study aims to evaluate the impacts of an advance care planning (ACP) programme "Have a
      Say" for persons with early stage dementia (PWEDs) or mild cognitive impairment and their
      family caregivers in the community. A randomized controlled trial with repeated blinded
      outcome assessment will be conducted to assess the effects of an ACP programme on dyads of
      PWEDs or persons with MCI and their family caregivers recruited from elderly community
      centres. Individuals who have a clinical diagnosis of any form of dementia at the early stage
      or have a Global Deterioration Score (GDS) 3 or 4 will be eligible to this study.
      Participants in the experimental group will receive a 4-session ACP programme. It includes an
      educational component, guided reflection and ACP discussion through a series of group-based
      activity and dyadic discussion delivered by trained ACP facilitator and guided by an ACP
      booklet. Dyads of participants will be provided with information about the trajectory of
      dementia, their future healthcare needs and caring options. Their values and care preferences
      on future care will be elicited in a consistent manner. They will be supported to have an
      individualized ACP discussion. Individuals assigned to the control group will receive
      attention-control health talks. The primary study outcome is the ACP engagement level of
      PWEDs. Secondary outcome is the dyadic concordance on end-of-life care preference. Adverse
      outcomes such as depression and caregivers' burden will also be evaluated. Data collection
      will be conducted at baseline, immediately after, one month and three-months after the
      intervention.
