        -  Determine the overall survival at 6 months in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
           treated with gemcitabine and celecoxib.

        -  Determine the objective tumor response, progression-free survival, and median survival
           of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 65 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral celecoxib twice
      daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months from study entry and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.
