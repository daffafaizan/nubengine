      Primary

        -  Compare survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer that is
           not suitable for first-line chemotherapy treated with erlotinib vs placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare progression-free survival and response rate.

        -  Compare toxicity.

        -  Compare the quality of life.

        -  Compare cost-effectiveness.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily for up to 24 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for up to 24 months. Quality of life is
           assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.
