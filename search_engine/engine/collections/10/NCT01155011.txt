      meet current physical activity guidelines. Ecological models posit that behavioral
      interventions are most effective when they operate on multiple levels. The MIPARC study
      intervenes on four levels: individual (pedometer-based self monitoring, educational materials
      and monthly counseling calls), interpersonal (monthly group sessions and peer mentoring),
      environment (walking signage prompts, tailored walking maps, step counts)and policies (review
      of on-site activity opportunities and walkability, recommendations for change and peer led
      advocacy)to increase the activity levels of residents. The study promotes walking as the
      primary means to increase light to moderate PA, with a secondary focus on strength and
      flexibility and decreased sedentary behavior.

      As most Continuing Care Retirement Communities have management structures that provide the
      opportunity to improve the social and built environments for physical activity and walking,
      this study also aims to train participants on how to advocate for improvements in the
      environment that would improve walkability.
