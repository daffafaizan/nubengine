    
      This prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, double (patient and endoscopist)
      blinded study is conducted at the Gastroenterology Consultants outpatient clinics and
      endoscopy centers in association with the University of Nevada-Reno School of Medicine. After
      obtaining signed informed consent, outpatients are recruited and randomized into 1 of 2
      treatment groups; PEG3350-Bisacodyl with 200 mg liquid simethicone treatment and
      PEG3350-Bisacodyl treatment with inert placebo (water).

      The primary outcome includes reduction of bubbles using the intraluminal bubbles scale.
      Secondary outcomes include the evaluations of the numbers and types of polyps, numbers and
      types of masses detected, cecal insertion time, withdrawal time, adverse effects, and the
      adequacy of bowel prep using the Boston Bowel Prep scale.
