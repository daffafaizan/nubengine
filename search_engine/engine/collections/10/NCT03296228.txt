      Scoliosis (AIS) in the world. Its recommendations for fusion of the minor curves depend on
      its structurality. It defines a minor curve as structural if there is inflexibility on
      side-bending more than 25 . However, a recent Delphi survey from a panel of experts in AIS
      management showed that there was no consensus as to which type of dynamic radiograph was
      optimal. Up to two thirds of the surgeons did not use side-bending as a routine, and hence
      they cannot apply the Lenke Classification accurately in clinical practice nor follow its
      recommendations for fusion.

      Furthermore, the current classification does not give specific recommendations regarding the
      selection of fusion levels and does not take into account the clinical appearance of the
      patients which impact on treatment. Consequently, there are still controversies regarding the
      Upper Instrumented Vertebra (UIV) and Lowest Instrumented Vertebra (LIV) selections, and
      following the recommendations may not allow fusion of the least number of segments nor give
      best clinical results eg shoulder balance.
