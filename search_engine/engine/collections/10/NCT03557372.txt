      investigators are examining this new radiation schedule for recurrent glioblastoma.

        -  The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved radiation therapy as a
           treatment option for your disease.

        -  This is the first time that this particular radiation schedule will be tested in humans.
           There many other studies which have tested different radiation schedules in
           glioblastoma.

      In this research study, investigators are adapting a standard two-week schedule of radiation
      commonly used for recurrent glioblastoma using a mathematical model. This study uses the same
      total dose of radiation as standard treatments but breaks up the dose into different amounts
      daily to maximize tumor kill. investigators have used a new mathematical model to create this
      schedule of radiation. This model was created to better represent how glioblastoma cells can
      escape the damaging effects of radiation. Based on the results of several laboratory studies,
      it is possible that this model may result in improved outcomes compared to standard radiation
      schedules.

      The primary question of this study is to see whether participants can complete this new
      radiation schedule at the scheduled times. In addition, investigators will follow
      participants to ensure that this treatment is safe. If this treatment proves feasible,
      investigators hope to compare this treatment directly with standard radiation schedules for
      newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma.
