    
      Androgen sensitivity in the cell is determined by the number of Cytosine-Adenine-Guanine
      repeats in the Androgen Receptor gene. Lower CAG repeats have been associated in previous
      studies with androgenic conditions such as acne, hirsutism and hair loss in men and women.
      Keeping this in mind, we tested women with hair loss in the frontal or vertex area, for their
      AR genotype. Patients were randomized to placebo or 1 mg finasteride therapy for 6 months.
      Global photographs and 2 tatooed areas of 1cm2 each were measured monthly to assess global
      appearance and hair counts for medication impact.
