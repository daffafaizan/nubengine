      intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, intermediate-stage HCC includes a
      heterogeneous population of patients with varying tumour burdens, liver function (Child-Pugh
      A or B) and disease aetiology.This suggests that not all patients with intermediate-stage HCC
      will derive similar benefit from transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI), and that some
      patients may benefit from other treatment options.

      Repetition of TACE is based on evidence suggesting that one cycle of TACE may not be
      sufficient for effective treatment of intermediate-stage HCC and repeating TACE prolongs
      survival. However, intermediate-stage HCC patients often have unsatisfactory clinical
      outcomes with repeated TACE and there is not sufficiently addressed by existing guidelines
      include the criteria for repeating TACE and recommendations about the number of TACE cycles
      to be repeated before switching to another or no treatment.The study,recently published in
      the journal of Hepatology shows the ART score of >=2.5 prior the second TACE identifies
      patients with a dismal prognosis who may not profit from further TACE sessions.In clinical
      practiceï¼Œhowever, we also found some patients who showed TACE-resistant at the beginning of
      treatment may access to get objective response of retreatment with TAI. So we conduct this
      prospective,randomized controlled study to find out whether the patient who showed
      TACE-resistant can obtain survival benefit from retreatment with TAI.
