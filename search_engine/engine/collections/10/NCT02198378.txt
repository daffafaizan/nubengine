      with the use of MEOPA associated with intravenous paracetamol in the management of patients
      with STEMI. The investigators hypothesize that the association of MEOPA and paracetamol,
      which is easy to use in a pre-hospital setting, will give patients pain relief as effectively
      as morphine.

      This alternative treatment would avoid the use of morphine, whose potentially damaging
      consequences on myocardial function have been suggested by experimental studies and by an
      observational study. The physician of the mobile emergency team (SMUR) verifies the inclusion
      and non- inclusion criteria for the study. The patient must present STEMI defined in
      accordance with the recommendations and chest pain of intensity â‰¥ 4 on the NRS. The specific
      treatment for STEMI will be given before inclusion in the study, with the exception of
      analgesic treatment. In particular, inclusion in the study must not delay the initiation of
      strategies of recanalization and reperfusion.

      The SMUR physician in charge of the patient will administer the treatment defined by
      randomization.

      After 30 minutes, the patient will be managed in accordance with the recommendations and will
      be hospitalized, generally in a cardiology intensive care unit. At one month, the clinical
      research technician will record the patient's vital status and collect the patient's hospital
      records.
