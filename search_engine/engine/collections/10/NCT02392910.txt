        -  During the original 6 month trial, patients in the i.v. iron group received 1000mg iron
           per the protocol. No patients required iron in the subsequent 6 months.

        -  During the subsequent follow-up, patients required a mean of between 165 and 274 mg iron
           per year (range: 0 to 600 mg per patient per year).

        -  Post the initial 1000mg iron, 19 out of 20 patients required at least a second dose of
           i.v. iron. Most patients required only one or two doses per year.

        -  The average time to requiring a second iron administration was 14.5 Â± 2.7 months (range:
           14 months, 23 months).

        -  Correction of iron deficiency (ID) resulted in statistically significant increases in
           transferrin saturation (TSAT) throughout the study (p < 0.01 untreated group). At all
           measured points, TSAT values in the treated group were at least on target (> 20%
           increase).

        -  For serum ferritin, significant differences were observed at 6 months and 1 year however
           this difference was not observed at 5 years post baseline where serum ferritin values
           were 173ng/mL and 167ng/mL for the control and IV iron groups, respectively.

        -  Statistically significant improvements versus the untreated group were observed for both
           hemoglobin (Hb) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) as well as for left ventricular ejection
           fraction (LVEF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class at each year.

      Effect of i.v. iron sucrose on hospitalizations and mortality

        -  There were numerically fewer hospitalization reported at 6 months compared to those
           among untreated patients (0% and 25%, respectively), although the difference versus
           untreated patients was not statistically significant (p=ns).

        -  At 1 year after commencing the original study, the number of patients requiring a
           hospitalization (for any reason) was 50% in the control group and 10% in the IV iron
           group (p<0.01).

        -  By 5 years follow-up these rates had increased to 85% in the control arm and 20% in the
           IV iron treated group (p<0.01).

        -  In relation to all-cause mortality, there were no deaths in either group after the first
           6 months. The number of deaths due to any cause after year 1 had increased in both
           groups (20% in the untreated group, 5% in the treated group; p=ns).

        -  At 5 years follow-up, 11 (55%) of patients in the control arm were deceased, compared
           with 4 (20%) in the IV iron treated group (p < 0.05).
