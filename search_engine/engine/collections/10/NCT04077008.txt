      may be unilateral or bilateral, may have many causes either benign e.g; urolithiasis,
      retroperitoneal fibrosis, renal papillary necrosis or malignant e.g; urinary tract tumors as
      bladder cancer and prostate cancer, or Extrinsic tumor as cervical cancer(5) , lymphoma or
      other pelvic tumors When kidney obstruction occurs bilaterally this raises serum chemistry
      and may lead to post-renal AKI which represents about (1-10%) of all causes of AKI.
      Post-renal AKI is an emergency case that requires an urgent and minimally invasive procedure
      to drain the urine either by PCN or ureteric stents.

      There has been always a debate about which one is better to drain the obstructed kidneys
      percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteric stents and which is better in improvement of renal
      function and with less effect on life style . Also the mode of drainage of the obstructed
      kidneys, bilateral or unilateral, also has been a point of debate. Unless bilateral renal
      obstruction is due to benign or treatable malignant cause, unilateral nephrostomy is always
      the rule according to some authors . some authors, reported better improvement in renal
      function with bilateral PCN with pelvic tumors The investigators will do prospective
      comparative study for studying mode and laterality of drainage in benign and malignant causes
      in bilaterally obstructed kidneys .
