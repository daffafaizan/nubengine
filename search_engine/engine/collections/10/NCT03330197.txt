      tumor resection. Pediatric patients who are scheduled for craniotomy and tumor resection will
      receive one dose of veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 will be
      administered by free-hand injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.
      This arm has been completed and is currently closed to enrollment.

      Pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) will receive Ad-RTS-hIL-12 by
      stereotactic injection and then will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.

      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the
      follow-up period.
