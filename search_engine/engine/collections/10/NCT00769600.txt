      To evaluate the 3-month event-free survival of the combination of the combination of
      itraconazole and pemetrexed in patients with recurrent/refractory non-small cell lung cancer.
      3-month event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the proportion of patients who are alive and
      without event after 3 months (evaluated in a window of +/- 1 week) of treatment. Events are
      defined as disease progression or death from any cause. All patients treated on protocol will
      be included in the determination of EFS, regardless of treatment modification or
      discontinuation.

      Secondary Objectives

      To determine the objective response rate of the combination of itraconazole and pemetrexed in
      patients with recurrent/refractory non-small cell lung cancer. The best overall response is
      the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease
      progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements
      recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on
      the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.
