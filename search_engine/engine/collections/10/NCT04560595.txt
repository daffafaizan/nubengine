      individual's caffeine consumption in spite of clinically significant problems exacerbated by
      caffeine use. This study will evaluate whether a caffeine reduction program developed at
      Johns Hopkins can help people reduce the caffeine use in an online format. Volunteers will
      participate in an intervention study conducted entirely online, including video visits for
      screening, instructions for caffeine reduction, and follow up. The study also involves
      filling out online surveys sent via email and text message. During screening, participants
      will be asked questions about participants' personal characteristics including demographic
      information, weekly caffeine consumption, and general medical history. Participants who are
      determined to be eligible after screening will complete a session during which participants
      receive a digital copy of a caffeine reduction manual and instructions on how to gradually
      cut down caffeine. After this, participants will complete weekly online surveys over six
      weeks. Participants will complete two follow-up video visits at 7 and 14 weeks after
      participants received the caffeine reduction instructions. The investigators will measure
      caffeine consumption over time using the online surveys and interview questions during video
      visits, and the investigators will also measure how various caffeine related problems may
      improve during caffeine reduction, such as sleep problems, gastrointestinal issues, and
      anxiety. During the end of study sessions, participants will answer questions related to
      acceptability of the online format and report on participants' current caffeine use.
