      found that there is a decrease in pulmonary function, loss of thoracic mobility and a high
      prevalence of chronic poststernotomy pain (CPSP) after CABG. So far there is no effective
      treatment for these conditions. The OstinCare study aims to investigate whether osteopathic
      treatment has an added value in the treatment of these patients.
