    
      This is a single-dose, single-center, open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention), 3-treatment, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance)
      and parallel-group (a medical research study comparing the response in two or more groups of
      participants receiving different interventions [treatments]) study. The study consists of
      Screening Phase (that is, 21 days before study commences on Day 1); open-label treatment
      Phase and end-of-study or early withdrawal assessment. All participants will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 3 treatments, that is, Treatment A (single dose of JNJ-56021927 on Day 1),
      Treatment B (200 milligram [mg] itraconazole once daily from Day 1 up to Day 32 along with
      single dose of JNJ-56021927 on Day 4), and Treatment C (600 mg gemfibrozil twice daily from
      Day 1 up to Day 32 along with single dose of JNJ-56021927 on Day 4). Blood samples will be
      collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment.
      The maximum duration of participation in the study per participant will be approximately 78
      days (Treatment A) or 81 days (Treatment B and C). Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
