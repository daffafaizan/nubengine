    
      This is a pivotal, prospective, multi-center randomized, controlled, open-label clinical
      study designed to compare the performance and safety of the AirXpander Tissue Expander System
      to currently cleared saline tissue expanders. Subject who meet the inclusion and agree to
      participate in the study will be enrolled and randomized to either the investigational arm
      (AirXpander Tissue Expander) or the control arm (standard saline tissue expander) using a 2:1
      (AirXpander to saline) permuted block randomization stratified by investigational center and
      procedure (unilateral or bilateral). If the subject is having a bilateral procedure, the same
      type of expander will be implanted in each side. Subjects in both arms will be followed in
      the same manner until the explantation of the tissue expander(s) and exchange for permanent
      implant(s).
