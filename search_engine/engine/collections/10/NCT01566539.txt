      Objective 1: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmaco- fMRI study, men and women
      will be randomized to treatment with either 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP, or
      placebo (PL). Approximately 40 minutes later, brain function will be imaged with fMRI as
      participants play an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with same-sex partners. The resulting
      data will be analyzed to investigate OT and AVP effects on cooperative behavior and the
      neural response to cooperative social interactions.

      In addition to this cross-sectional design, a subset of participants will return on a second
      day for a within-subject study.

      Objective 2: Men and healthy women will be randomized to treatment with either 40 IU
      intranasal AVP or a saline placebo approximately 30 minutes before their brain function is
      measured with fMRI as they view same and other-sex faces. All subjects will be scanned a
      second time several days later with no treatment to evaluate the persistence of AVP effects
      over time. The resulting data will be analyzed to investigate AVP effects on subjective
      evaluations and neural responses to viewing same and opposite sex faces.

      Objective 3: Healthy men and healthy women will receive either 24IU intranasal OT or PL
      approximately 40 minutes before their brain function is measured with fMRI as they view
      animations of geometric shapes depicting either random movement or social interactions such
      as playing, chasing, fighting. All participants will receive PL on scan 1 and will be
      randomized to either 24IU intranasal OT or PL on scan 2. The resulting data will be analyzed
      to investigate OT effects on subjective evaluations and neural responses to the animations.
