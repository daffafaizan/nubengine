      has been embraced enthusiastically worldwide. Given the unmet clinical need for accurately
      diagnosing and staging prostate cancer and the encouraging results of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET
      worldwide, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and University of California San
      Francisco (UCSF) conducted pivotal registration trials to assess 68Ga-PSMA-11's safety and
      efficacy profile in detecting prostate cancer in adult patients. To gap the unmet clinical
      need of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET during the period prior to FDA approval, UCLA Nuclear Medicine
      offers expanded access of this investigational PET drug to eligible participants.
