      cycle, 200 milligrams of pembrolizumab will be given through an IV (intravenously) for about
      thirty minutes. In addition, participants will begin taking the ibrutinib capsules every day
      starting on cycle 1, day 1. Participants will have a follow-up visit every 3 weeks, on about
      the first day of each cycle with laboratories drawn to make sure that the study drugs are not
      causing any side effects. In addition, participants will have a computed tomography (CT) scan
      every 6 to 7 weeks to determine whether your cancer is getting better or worse.
