        -  Compare the disease-free and overall survival of women with early breast cancer who are
           randomized to discontinue adjuvant tamoxifen vs those randomized to continue for at
           least 5 additional years.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified for analysis according to
      duration of tamoxifen given before randomization (2-3 years vs 4-5 years vs 6-7 years vs 8-9
      years vs 10 years and over), age (less than 49 vs over 50), and important prognostic factors,
      including tumor type and grade and nodal and estrogen receptor status. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients discontinue tamoxifen after at least 2 years of prior treatment.

        -  Arm II: Patients continue treatment with tamoxifen for at least 5 additional years in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed annually.
