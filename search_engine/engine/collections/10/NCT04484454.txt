      age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions, given the growing
      understanding of their involvement in key cellular functions as well as the clinical trends
      observed when plasmalogen levels are depleted. In addition to supporting the structural
      integrity of membranes, these plasmalogens are also involved in a variety of critically
      important cell functions: membrane fusion, ion transport, vesicle formation, and
      oxidation-reduction. Plasmalogen and serum plasmalogen deficiency has been shown to impair
      cellular functions, particularly related to cholesterol processing, and has been implicated
      in Alzheimer's and other diseases. Plasmalogen precursor supplementation has been
      demonstrated as safe and potentially efficacious in preclinical studies and some patient
      populations. In theory, ProdromeNeuro supplementation may yield therapeutic benefits among
      patients with age-related cognitive decline by increasing levels of neuroprotective
      plasmalogens.

      The present study is being undertaken as an open-label study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of ProdromeNeuro Omega-3 Oil as an intervention for patients with age-related
      cognitive decline. Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize validated tests that
      are appropriate for repeated measures. Neurocognitive assessment and serology testing kits to
      evaluate for plasmalogen levels will also be administered at baseline, end of the first
      month, end of the second month, end of the 3 month, and after one month post treatment
      termination.
