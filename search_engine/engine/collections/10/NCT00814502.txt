      suffering from dementia. Most research involving sleep in dementia has involved community
      dwelling or nursing home residents. Relatively little is known about the sleep patterns of
      patients with dementia who develop acute behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and necessitate
      hospitalization. The relationship between sleep disturbances in these patients and
      behavioral/psychiatric symptoms is also insufficiently studied. The current study will
      examine these two sets of data (sleep/wake cycles and clinical symptoms) in a population of
      elderly subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) or vascular dementia (VD) during
      their hospitalization period. We will compare the sleep outcome measures (primarily sleep
      efficiency) and clinical outcome measures in subjects treated with Zolpidem CR or Placebo. We
      will utilize a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design to test our hypothesis
      that targeting sleep disturbances in hospitalized elderly subjects with DAT or VD leads to
      improvement in sleep and clinical outcomes.
