      brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). MRI is a widely
      used method to obtain high resolution brain pictures that are routinely used for diagnostic
      and clinical purposes. The electrical stimulation is applied on the scalp with a non-FDA
      approved method called tDCS (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation), typically equivalent
      to what a 6V battery would produce (and up to no more than 15V). To compare, an AA battery
      delivers current at 1.5 volt. While almost unnoticeable to the participants, these currents
      can still temporarily affect brain activity without causing adverse effects. This stimulation
      would be applied while the participants are in the MRI scanner so that the brain activity can
      be measured. The participants will have the opportunity to have a test session with the
      stimulation outside the scanner to get familiar with it.
