      rise in the density of gametocytes. Drug-induced release could enhance transmission of
      resistant parasites and would argue against the use of SP, especially for intermittent
      preventive treatment (IPT). We did a randomized trial to determine the effect of treatment
      with SP on gametocyte carriage. The trial is a three-arm open-label randomized trial. We
      randomized asymptomatic carriers of P.falciparum to receive antimalarial treatment or
      placebo, and recorded the prevalence and density of gametocytes over the next 2 months. The
      trial was conducted during the dry (low malaria transmission) season in four rural villages
      in The Gambia. Adults and children aged over 6 months who had asexual P.falciparum infection
      and were confirmed to be free of clinical symptoms of malaria over a 2-day screening period
      were enrolled and randomized to receive a single dose of SP, or SP plus a single dose of
      artesunate (SP+AS), or placebo. The primary endpoints were presence of gametocytes 7 and 56
      days after treatment, and the duration and density of gametocytaemia over 2 months measured
      by the area under the curve of gametocyte density against time.
