      intervention refinement based upon a pre-pilot, and a randomized controlled pilot study of
      the final intervention. All participants are adult survivors of childhood cancer, males and
      females from three ethnic backgrounds (Black, Hispanic, White). The randomized control pilot
      is designed to assess the acceptibility/feasibility of a community-based intervention to
      engage childhood cancer survivors more actively in cancer follow-up care. Pilot data on
      outcome measures will provide data parameters (e.g. means and variances of groups) for
      accurate power analyses and sample size calculation to support a subsequent efficacy trial.

      Relevance: This project is a critical initial step towards addressing systemic problems in
      transition of care and has the potential to decrease morbidity of adult childhood cancer
      survivors.

      Outcomes include: knowledge of late effects and follow-up care, uncertainty related to 1)
      relapse, 2) secondary cancers, and 3) late effects, perceived efficacy to communicate with
      physician, access to childhood medical records, self-efficacy to obtain medical records, and
      the number of completed health care visits at a six month follow-up interview.
