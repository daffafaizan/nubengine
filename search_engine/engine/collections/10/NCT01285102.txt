      I. To define the response rate of colorectal liver metastases (in the treated lobe) treated
      with DEBIRI, in refractory mCRC patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the time to progression in the treated lobe for this patient population.

      II. To evaluate the overall survival for this patient population. III. To evaluate patient
      tolerance and the toxicity profile of treatment with DEBIRI in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive irinotecan-eluting beads via hepatic artery embolization every 3 weeks for
      up to 3 (unilobar disease) or 4 (bi-lobar disease) courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
