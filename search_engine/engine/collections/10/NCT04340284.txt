      clear but estimates from the published literature suggests a range between 5-10% of the total
      fractures.The gap in non-healing management has instigated the search for novel
      osteo-inductive substances. bone marrow concentrate is being utilized for many year with
      excellent results .Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)are one of the major cell types of the Bone
      Marrow Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC)that self-renovates and differentiates into multiple cell
      types of mesodermal origin such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes.

      Adipose tissue is an alternative source for MSCs .besides abundant and readily accessible it
      also overcomes issue of morbidity with bone marrow aspiration.

      This retrospective analysis was conducted to report the outcome in patients treated with
      fluoroscopic guided percutaneous injection of SVF at the site of fracture as an outpatient
      procedure between November 2012 to August 2018.

      The purpose of this study is to report the feasibility of minimally invasive percutaneous
      injection with autologous SVF and study the osteo-inductive efficacy of Adipose derived
      stromal cells in SVF in the management of non-union.
