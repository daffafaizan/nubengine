      Traditional approach to labor management consists evaluation of cervical dilatation, head
      position and head descent via digital examinations. Rate of progress is evaluated using data
      of available labor curves. Unsatisfactory progression is either treated with labor
      augmentation or cesarean section depending on the degree and duration of labor retardation.
      Transperineal ultrasonography is able to assess cervical dilatation, fetal head descent and
      head position. Data obtained from analysis of labor via transperineal ultrasonography is not
      available. This research's primary aim is to generate labor curves using data obtained via
      ultrasonographic measurements.
