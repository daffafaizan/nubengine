      Depending on their location and the patient's symptoms, surgical removal of fibroids may be
      indicated.

      Interstitial or subserous myomas are accessible through the abdominal route (laparotomy or
      minimally invasive surgery).

      The impact of this surgery on the endometrial cavity and the risk of post-surgery synechiae
      is poorly understood, although it is essential, especially in a population of women wishing
      to preserve their fertility. In order to reduce and prevent endometrial synechia formation,
      we suggest PREVENDO study which consist in the systematic intracavitary placement of an
      anti-adhesion gel (HYALOBARRIERÂ® GEL ENDO) immediately after surgery in patients undergoing
      abdominal myomectomy or polymyomectomy (laparotomy, laparoscopy, robot-assisted laparoscopy)
      and the evaluation of the proportion of endometrial synechiae 6 weeks after surgery in
      patients during diagnostic hysteroscopy performed 6 weeks after surgery.
