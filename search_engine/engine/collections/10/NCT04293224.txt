      in all groups, pre-diet testing (week 5), an 8-week controlled feeding period, post-diet
      testing (week 14), a follow-up period of dietary education and observation, and end of study
      testing (week 32). During the 8 week feeding, participants will be randomly assigned one of
      the following diets:

        1. DGA Mediterranean diet pattern at sufficient energy level to maintain body weight
           (energy balance)

        2. DGA Mediterranean diet pattern at a moderately reduced energy level (negative energy
           balance)

        3. TAD diet pattern at a moderately reduced energy level (negative energy balance)

      In the follow-up phase, the investigators will evaluate how multiple factors may influence
      body weight management, including previous dietary exposure, as well as the role of cognitive
      function, executive function, genetics, habitual diet, physical activity, eating behavior,
      stress and stress responsivity, metabolic flexibility and gut microbiome.
