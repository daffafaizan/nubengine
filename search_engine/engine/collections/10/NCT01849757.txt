      Comparison of priming constituents in patients undergoing CPB assisted cardiac surgery: 6%
      HES 130/0.4 or Albumen 5%

      Clinical Perfusion

      Sub-investigators:

      Research will be conducted at: the cardiac operating rooms of the Royal University Hospital,
      and affiliated hospitals

      Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the use of an artificial colloid (6% hydroxyethyl starch
      130/0.4) (HES) as a priming constituent is more disruptive to the coagulation and renal
      systems compared to the use of human derived albumen.

      It is further hypothesized that patients who undergo cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with HES
      130/0.4 as a priming constituent will demonstrate decreased creatinine clearance and
      increased post-operative bleeding and transfusion requirements.

      Academic validity Permissive hemodilution results when crystalloids and colloids are
      substituted for blood as priming fluids in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. While there
      are obvious benefits to decreasing autologous blood exposure to the patients undergoing CPB,
      determining the most physiological substitution has not been conclusively resolved.
      Historically, available HES had a greater molecular weight then the product currently in use
      and was associated with detrimental adverse events when compared to saline as fluid
      replacement therapy (5.3% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.001). (1) When albumin was compared to HES 450/0.7
      and HES 200/0.05 for fluid management in adult CPB surgery, (18 trials of 970 patients) HES
      increased transfusion of red blood cells by 28.4% (p = 0.027), increased the transfusion of
      fresh-frozen plasma by 30.6% (p = 0.008) and increased the transfusion of platelets by 29.8%
      (p = 0.027). HES 130/0.4 could not be compared to albumen in this same study because there
      was insufficient data collected. However, no significant differences were found when
      comparing transfusion requirements between HES 450/0.7, HES 200/0.05 and HES 130/0.4. (2)
      Viscoelastic device analysis concluded that the administration of HES 130/0.4 in patients or
      healthy volunteers resulted in a weaker and smaller clot. (3) Short-time infusions of HES
      200/0.5 and HES 130/0.4 after cardiac surgery produced a temporary impairment of fibrin
      formation and clot strength while human albumin had no effect. (4)

      In regards to the association between HES and renal failure, on the one hand use of HES
      130/0.4 as a priming fluid used in children undergoing CPB did not result in any negative
      effects on renal function and was safe to use in the pediatric population. (5) On the other
      hand, when used for resuscitative measures in 7000 randomly assigned patients admitted to
      intensive care, though there was no difference in 90 day mortality between the group assigned
      HES 130/0.4 and the group assigned saline, more patients assigned HES 130/0.4 required renal
      replacement therapy. (1) When used immediately after CPB in a double-blind clinical trial
      comparing 4% gelatin, Ringer's solution and HES 130/0.4, it was found that significantly
      lower mean creatinine levels were found in the HES 130/0.4 group compared to the other two
      groups. (6)

      Our research is directed toward determining conclusively if HES 130/0.4 has a similar risk
      profile to HES 450/0.7 and HES 200/0.05 when used as a priming constituent for the CPB
      circuit. Additionally we will determine if an albumin/crystalloid prime is superior to a HES
      130/0.4/crystalloid prime. A fully crystalloid prime control group will be included for a
      controlled comparison.

      Research design/Methods

      The will be a randomized, control trial. Three groups of subjects will be studied:

        1. Control group: Crystalloid prime

             -  2 L crystalloid prime,

             -  2.5 mL/kg Mannitol 20%,

             -  1 ampoule of NaHCO-3 (50 mL),

             -  10,000 iu heparin

        2. Voluven (light?):

             -  HES 130/0.4 prime 500 mL

             -  balance of crystalloid

             -  2.5 mL/kg Mannitol 20%,

             -  1 ampoule of NaHCO-3 (50 mL),

             -  10,000 iu heparin

        3. Albumin:

             -  Human albumin 500 mL 5%

             -  balance of crystalloid

             -  2.5 mL/kg Mannitol 20%,

             -  1 ampoule of NaHCO-3 (50 mL),

             -  10,000 iu heparin

      Statistical Analysis We would like to have 7000 subjects included in this research project.
      Study populations and outcomes for patients undergoing CPB assisted cardiac surgery are
      extremely varied. An extremely large population size will be necessary to answer the research
      question proposed as the priming differences in question result in very subtle outcome
      differences.

      All patients will undergo CPB assisted cardiac surgery. Blood samples will be drawn at
      routine intervals from each subject. Blood will be sampled upon entering the operating room,
      at the completion of surgery, and at 24 hours post-operatively.

      The amount of blood drawn will not be above and beyond the usual tests and analyses related
      to the care of all affected patients undergoing CPB assisted cardiac surgery.

      a)

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  greater than 50 years of age

        -  will be afflicted with co-morbidities associated with cardiac disease (increased
           cholesterol, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, previous myocardial infarctions and
           decreased ejection fraction)

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  emergencies

        -  renal failure

        -  dialysis dependent

      The cardiac center involved to date is:

      RUH Saskatoon The goal is recruitment of all cardiac centers in western Canada.

      Primary end-points: are postoperative bleeding and transfusion of autologous units of red
      blood cells, frozen plasma and platelets.

      Secondary end-points: Post-operative renal function parameter creatinine

      Data collection will be ongoing. Interim analysis will be completed once half the patients
      have been recruited with final statistical analysis to be conducted once data capture is
      complete.

      Potential Significance/Justification CPB assisted cardiac surgical outcomes have improved
      tremendously since the first such procedure was done in 1953. Outcome improvements have
      always come from small changes that were evidence based. This research project means to
      determine the safest prime for a procedure, which occurs roughly 2,000,000/year throughout
      the world. In regards to the cost of the study solutions in question, there is a $4.10
      difference between the cost of 500 mL of HES 130/0.4 prime and 500 mL of 5% Albumin with HES
      130/0.4 being more expensive.
