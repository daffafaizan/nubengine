      obtained during E(B)US-NA in the non-cancer patient with CT enlarged mediastinal/hilar lymph
      nodes that are not visible on chest X-ray. As secondary aims, the clinical implications of
      E(B)US-NA findings will be assessed, in particular the number of cases where a specific
      treatment is initiated.
