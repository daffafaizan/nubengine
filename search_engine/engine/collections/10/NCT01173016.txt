    
      This 2-year open-label pilot study of laronidase includes patients (age 5-13 years) who are
      at least 2 years post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and donor engrafted. Outcomes
      are assessed semi-annually and compared to historic controls. Eligible patients will receive
      Laronidase as an infusion over several hours once a week at a local site. The dosing of
      enzyme will be the standard doses recommended by Genzyme.

      The findings of this Pilot Study will be used to assess whether a subsequent larger study can
      be conducted.
