      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of fenretinide (HPR) in children with high risk solid
      tumors.

      II. Determine the toxicities of HPR in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of
      HPR in these patients. IV. Determine the CSF level of HPR in patients whom cerebrospinal
      fluid is obtained for routine purposes while on this study.

      V. Determine the effect of HPR on plasma retinol levels in these patients. VI. Determine the
      activity of HPR in these patients. VII. Determine the antitumor activity of HPR on minimal
      residual bone marrow disease in neuroblastoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive oral fenretinide 3 times a day on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for up to 8 courses. Patients may receive an additional 22 courses of therapy in the presence
      of stable or responding residual tumor. Patients with recurrent neuroblastoma, after prior
      myeloablative therapy with no measurable disease, will stop treatment after 8 courses.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fenretinide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed until death.
