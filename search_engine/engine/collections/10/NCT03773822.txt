      dysfunction of the heart pump. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is a
      pathophysiological concept, first described in septic shock. It is characterized by an
      impairment of the hypothalamic pituitary axis during critical illness. Its diagnosis is
      usually suggested by an inappropriate response to the adrenal stimulation test. The results
      of corticosteroid supplementation studies in septic shock are controversial, but most of
      these studies demonstrate that corticosteroid therapy improves reversal of shock.

      The concept of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency has recently been
      expanded to cardiogenic shock. The latter has many physiopathological similarities with
      septic shock. However, no studies have evaluated the effect of supplemental corticosteroid
      supplementation in cardiogenic shock.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hemodynamic effect of low dose corticosteroid
      therapy in the treatment of adult cardiogenic shock.

      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial comparing
      intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenously every 6 hours) plus enteral fludrocortisone
      (50 Âµg/day) with placebo for seven days in critically ill patients with cardiogenic shock.

      The primary endpoint for this trial will be catecholamine-fee days at day-7. Secondary
      endpoints will include all-cause mortality at 28 and 90 days after randomisation.

      Several pre-defined sub-groups analyses are planned, including: postcardiotomy, myocardial
      infarction, etomidate use, vasopressor use...

      380 patients will be enrolled in this study at approximately 20 study sites. Each patient
      will be followed-up for 90 days.
