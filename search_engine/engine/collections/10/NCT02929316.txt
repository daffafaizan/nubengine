      established CD diagnosed > 6 months. All patients will have history of abnormal MARSH score
      on initial duodenal biopsy at diagnosis and MARSH 0 on repeat biopsy following a gluten free
      diet (GFD). All patients will also have positive celiac serologies (anti-TTG, anti-gliadin,
      etc.) at diagnosis, as well as, positive HLA DQ2/DQ8 genetic profile. At enrollment, all
      patients will have negative celiac serologies, indicative of serologic remission on a gluten
      free diet. Female subjects of childbearing potential (does not include those with history of
      tubal ligation/surgical sterilization, hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy) who are sexually
      active with a non-sterilized male partners agree to routinely use adequate contraception from
      signing informed consent, during study process and for an additional 18 weeks after the last
      dose of vedolizumab. A male subject who is non-sterilized and sexually active with a female
      partner of childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing informed
      consent throughout the duration of the study and for 18 weeks after the last dose.
