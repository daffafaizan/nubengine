      will be admitted to the intensive care unit, and as part of the clinical care either a
      central venous access positioned in the superior vena cava or in the pulmonary artery. As a
      part of the routine clinical care blood gases are frequently taken for continuous evaluation
      of therapy to monitor the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). A measurement of thenar
      tissue oxygen concentration will be timed with a central venous blood gas draw to monitor the
      tissue oxygen concentration (StO2).

      The StO2 measurement will be taken by using the InSpectraTM StO2 monitor manufactured by
      Hutchinson Technology Inc. after applying the noninvasive clip on probe to the thenar
      eminence of the right hand to measure the StO2 level. After a stable reading is obtained for
      60 seconds it will be recorded.

      The two different measurements of oxygen concentration will be compared to determine if a
      correlation exists.
