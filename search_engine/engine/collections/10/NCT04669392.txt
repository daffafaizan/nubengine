      functions. Optimal irrigation is based on the sequential application of two or more
      irrigating solutions to reliably achieve the goals of safe and effective irrigation. Irrigant
      must meet the following criteria: It must be antimicrobial, it must have the ability to flush
      debris from the canal, biocompatibility is essential, must dissolve both necrotic and vital
      pulpal tissue, must act as a lubricant, should be able to penetrate into dentin tubules and
      remove the smear layer.

      Saline solution is the basic irrigating solution in root canal treatments, yet it has no
      antimicrobial activities and only results in cleaning the root canals. Ethanol irrigation is
      believed to be an alternative promising replacement in tissue fixation from Formocresol due
      to the concerns from its carcinogenicity and toxicity. Also Ethanol has an excellent
      bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal and most importantly it is one of the volatile
      liquids.
