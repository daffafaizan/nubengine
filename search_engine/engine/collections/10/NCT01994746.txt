      starting plasma glucose >= 90 mg/dL. Hypoglycemia was induced by an intravenous (IV) infusion
      of regular insulin diluted in normal saline during the clinic visit. Five minutes after
      stopping the insulin infusion (once the plasma glucose was <60 mg/dL), participants were
      treated with either a 3 mg glucagon dose nasally or 1 mg of glucagon administered by
      intramuscular (IM) injection.

      After a wash-out period of 7 days or more, participants returned to the clinic and the
      procedure repeated with each participant crossed over to the other treatment. As such, each
      participant underwent two episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in random order and
      received glucagon nasal powder during one episode and commercially available glucagon
      (GlucaGen, Novo Nordisk) by IM injection during the other episode.
