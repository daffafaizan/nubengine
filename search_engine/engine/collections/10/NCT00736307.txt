      essential for normal vision. Defects in renewal and repair of ocular surface as a result of
      limbal stem cell deficiency are now known to cause varying ocular surface morbidity including
      persistent photophobia, repeated and persistent surface breakdown and overt
      conjunctivalisation of the cornea. Restoring ocular health in these eyes has traditionally
      been frustrating. Ex vivo cultured limbal epithelial stem cells have been used successfully
      to treat limbal stem cell deficiency. Ex-vivo limbal stem cell allograft transplantation is
      achieved by harvesting limbal corneal tissue from donor eyes (either matched living relatives
      or cadaveric donors). The donor stem cells are obtained by excising a small area of the
      conjunctiva at the limbus and are a minor procedure. The tissue so obtained is then grown in
      tissue culture and once the cells have multiplied sufficiently, small sheets are transplanted
      on to the affected eye(s), backed with an amniotic membrane. The surgery is undertaken under
      either local or general anesthesia.
