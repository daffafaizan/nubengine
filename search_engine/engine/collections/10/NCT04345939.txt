      analysis of a large dataset with multiplex PCR-based targeted gene sequencing, to identify
      eleven major Mycobacterium species implicated in human disease. Simultaneous detection of
      certain antibiotic resistance genotypes, i.e., erm(41) and rrl in M. abscessus, is also
      feasible. This platform detected both reference strains and clinical isolates with a high
      degree of specificity and sensitivity.

      In this study, the investigators plan to verify the detection efficiency of GenSeizer in
      clinical samples (sputum, alveolar lavage fluid) and compare it with existing methods on the
      market (PCR reverse hybridization) and gold standard method (target sequencing after
      incubation)
