      moderate, controlled exercise on a treadmill. Blood and urine samples will be collected
      before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 24 hours after exercise. Fifteen biomarkers,
      three selected to evaluate each of the five physiologic pathways previously listed, will be
      tested at each of the three time points. Abnormal biomarkers before exercise suggest chronic
      pathway activation while exacerbated levels after exercise suggest further activation
      stimulated by exercise. Biomarker levels 24 hours post-exercise will be used to evaluate
      continued pathway activation or pathway recovery. By definition, 95% of health controls will
      show normal biomarker levels pre-exercise and biomarker patterns post-exercise will serve as
      the expected standard by which to compare the test subjects.
