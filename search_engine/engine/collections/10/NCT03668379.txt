      mobile health (mHealth) tool (text-messaging) to improve adherence to the treatments for
      depression. The treatments being tested are a behavioral activation therapy (BAT) and
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The outcomes are feasibility of the SMART and ATS in the
      HIV care site and acceptability of the SMART and ATS to patients and clinic staff. To achieve
      the overall goal, there are two aims. Aim 1 uses qualitative research methods for the conduct
      of focus groups and individual interviews with HIV+ Latinos in both English and Spanish. The
      goal of Aim 1 is to tailor the intervention to the cultural and linguistic needs of Latinos
      and the organization needs of the HIV clinic study site, which informs Aim 2. Aim 1 is guided
      by the CDCs Map of Adaptation tailoring framework, which consist of three Action Steps.
      Action Step 1-3 are to better understand and document: 1) expressions for depression in
      Spanish and barriers to care, 2) language issues in detecting and reporting depressive
      symptoms, 3) cultural perspectives of how depression presents as a barrier to care, and 4)
      attitudes (i.e., cognitive and emotional evaluations) toward BAT and CBT, and text-message
      preference and confidentiality concerns to promote adherence to the intervention activities.
      Aim 2 is to build and test a pilot SMART for an ATS - a set of decision rules that uses
      detectable changes in patient health status to inform the next course of treatment.
      Successful completion of the proposed study will yield pilot data on the feasibility and
      acceptability of an ATS for depression integrated into HIV primary care at the University of
      California San Francisco - Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.
