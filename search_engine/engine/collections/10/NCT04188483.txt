      Despite mouse studies and human clinical trial suggest selenium supplementation might enhance
      immunity, little is known for the effects of selenium supplementation on humoral immunity.
      Vaccination is the most effective medical intervention to prevent infections and to reduce
      disability and mortality associated with infectious disease. However, some individuals, in
      healthy or disease conditions, mount less effective humoral immune responses to vaccination.
      Therefore, new strategy to enhance humoral immunity upon vaccination is highly sought after.
      Using mouse models, we have observed that selenium supplementation significantly increased
      antigen-specific antibody responses. Thus, we hypothesize that selenium supplementation may
      be beneficial in enhancing humoral immunity in humans.

      Objectives: To investigate whether selenium supplementation will boost the humoral response
      to influenza vaccination in healthy adults.

      Design and trial size: This is a randomized prospective study. A total of 60 healthy
      subjects, 18-55 years old, will be enrolled in this study.

      Intervention and duration: The enrolled subjects will be randomized into selenium
      supplementation and control group. The selenium supplementation group will receive 200 μg
      selenium daily by taking two selenium-enriched yeast tablets (SelenoPrecise®, Pharma Nord)
      once daily for 60 days. The control group will not receive selenium supplementation. Thirty
      days after allocation, both groups will receive standard seasonal influenza vaccination for
      the 2019-2020 season. Peripheral blood samples will be collected at baseline (day 0, prior to
      treatment), day 30, day 37 (7 days after vaccination) and day 60 (30 days after vaccination).
