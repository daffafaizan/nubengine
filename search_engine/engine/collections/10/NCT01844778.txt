      Inhalation Solution (TIS) were recruited for the study. They went through one treatment cycle
      on their usual inhaled antibiotic treatment, and were all transferred to TIP for the second
      treatment cycle. The primary endpoint was the total administration time of TIP vs TIS vs
      colistimethate, defined as the total time taken to prepare the delivery device and drug,
      administer the drug, and clean and disinfect the delivery device.
