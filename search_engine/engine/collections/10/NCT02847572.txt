      In their dominant eye a Tecnis Symfony IOL will be implanted and in the non dominant eye, a
      Tecnis +3.25D Multifocal implanted. The surgeries will be within 2 days of each other. Every
      patient will receive same postoperative instructions and medications. The aim is to
      investigate the potential benefits of implanting two different IOL's to give the patient a
      wider range of near vision with decreased risk of haloing and glare to enable them to be less
      dependent on reading glasses
