    
      -  The study will be conducted in 6 village health centres in the Mon and Kayin states

        -  The patient or parent/guardian (in case of minor or under aged) must personally sign and
           date the latest approved version of the informed consent form before any study specific
           procedures are performed

        -  A case record form will be completed for each patient documenting symptoms prior to
           clinic attendance, concomitant illness, drug history. Height, weight, vital signs and
           physical examination findings will be recorded.

        -  At enrolment (D0) all patients will have the following samples taken:

             -  Repeat parasite count (thick and thin films). Treatment should be started without
                waiting for the result.

             -  Filter paper blood blots (3 dots on Whatman 3MM filter paper approx 180-300 ÂµL
                blood) for parasite genotyping (MSP1, MSP2, GLURP in case of recurrence during
                follow-up)

             -  Haemoglobin

        -  Laboratory procedures

             -  Slide microscopy: Thick and thin blood films stained with Giemsa will be read and
                counts expressed as the number of parasites per 500 white blood cells

             -  Molecular studies: The samples will be used to detect asexual parasites (blood
                smear, sensitive PCR), parasite population structure (Sequenom genotyping and
                sequencing), gametocytes (microscopy). The samples will be stored in a cool box and
                kept maximum 5 days in the field and will be transported to the local laboratory
                for processing. Plasma and buffy coat will be separated, frozen and stored. The
                frozen packed red cells will be transported to the molecular laboratory at MORU,
                Bangkok, Thailand, for sample processing (DNA extraction, quantitative PCRs).
