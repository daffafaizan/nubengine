      two-period, crossover study in LD-experienced subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      Subjects received 7 days of one treatment (IPX066 or IR CD-LD) followed by an approximate
      7-day washout period followed by another 7 days of the other treatment (IR CD-LD or IPX066).
      During the approximate 7-day washout period, subjects took their prestudy CD-LD regimen.
      Pharmacokinetic and efficacy/pharmacodynamic measurements were done on Days 1 and 8. Safety
      measures (electrocardiograms [ECGs], clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, adverse events
      [AEs], and concomitant medications) were evaluated over the course of the study.
