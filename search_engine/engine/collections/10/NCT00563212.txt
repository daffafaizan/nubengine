      phase I study of aerosol interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Prior to initiation of treatment, patients
      will undergo CT of the chest, pulmonary function testing, and bronchoscopy with
      bronchoalveolar lavage. They will also undergo a lung deposition study to determine the lung
      dose of IFN-γ that will be delivered with each treatment. Patients will then receive aerosol
      IFN-γ 100mcg delivered three times weekly via nebulizer for one year. Study patients will be
      followed monthly to monitor potential side effects, vital signs, and progression of IPF
      symptoms. Labs will be drawn at regular intervals to monitor for side effects and to measure
      cytokine levels. Bronchoscopy will be performed at the 6 and/or 12 month visit to compare
      cytokine levels pre-, during, and post-treatment.
