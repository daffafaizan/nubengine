      not be specifically selected as this would interfere with the representativeness of the
      results. The study will be conducted with office-based urologists and office-based general
      physicians, practitioners and internists (GPs) in Germany, thus representing a wide range of
      practices and populations. Each urologist or GP may invite patients to participate who have
      already been diagnosed with overactive bladder and prescribed Toviaz according to their usual
      standard of care. Study enrollment stopped on December 31, 2011 due to difficulty in
      recruiting patients. No safety issues were related to the decision to stop patient
      enrollment.
