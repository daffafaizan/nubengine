      marketed in Europa and US for the treatment of Gaucher type 1 patients for whom enzyme
      replacement treatment is not an option.

      Gastro-intestinal side effects are common with this formulation. This medication has been
      shown to have a beneficial effect both on Cl- an Na+ transports in cystic fibrosis epithelial
      cells. In addition, a single airway delivery of low-dose Miglustat normalizes nasal potential
      difference (NPD) in F508del cystic fibrosis mice. NPD abnormalities specific of CF patients
      are considered to reflect the primary defect of CFTR protein so that any curative treatment
      is expected to correct them at least partially.

      In the field of respiratory pharmacology, it is a general rule that the inhaled route is to
      be favoured whenever possible : it is usually more effective despite much lower doses and
      systemic absorption (which also implies lower costs and improved tolerance).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a single local administration of
      Miglustat on NPD measurements in CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation.
