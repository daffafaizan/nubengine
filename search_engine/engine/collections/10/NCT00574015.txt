      department. There are two commonly employed methods of alleviating this severe form of pain.
      Oral opioid analgesia is the most commonly utilized strategy for treating this pain. However,
      many emergency physicians and dentists employ a local anesthetic technique known as
      supraperiosteal nerve block. This study will compare the relative efficacy of these
      techniques.

      Patients meeting enrollment criteria will be randomized to either receive a supraperiosteal
      nerve block or oral hydrocodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 650 mg. They will otherwise be managed
      identically. Reduction of pain scores between entry and 30 minutes post intervention will be
      compared as well as numeric pain scores obtained by phone contact 24 hours later. Secondary
      outcomes will include the proportion of individuals from each group filling prescriptions for
      pain medication and the number of pain pills taken.
