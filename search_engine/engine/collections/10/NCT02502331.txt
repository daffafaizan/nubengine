    
      1. Primary immunogenicity endpoint

             -  Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of Vibriocidal antibodies against Inaba serogroup O1
                post second dose

             -  GMTof Vibriocidal antibodies against Ogawa serogroup O1 post second dose

             -  GMT of Vibriocidal antibodies against serogroup O139 post second dose

        2. Secondary immunogenicity endpoints

             -  Proportion of participants showing seroconversion against Inaba serogroup O1, Ogawa
                serogroup O1and serogroup O139 post vaccinations

             -  Seroconversion is defined as 4-fold rise in vibriocidal antibody titer at Visit 3
                two weeks after the second dose, compared to baseline titers, measured at Visit 1
                prior to vaccination.

      Proportion of participants with:

        1. Immediate reactions within 30 minutes after each dose of vaccination.

        2. Solicited systemic Adverse Events: nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue,
           myalgia, fever, and anorexia/loss of appetite within 7 days after each vaccination.

             1. Diarrhea is defined as having 3 or more loose/watery stools within a 24-hour period
                or at least 1 bloody loose stool or any number of loose stools with signs of
                dehydration.

             2. Fever is defined as having an axillary temperature of 38 â„ƒ

        3. Unsolicited Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events occurring 14 days following each
           vaccination, as reported by participants Measurement of Geometric Mean Titer of
           vibriocidal antibodies post vaccination, Ratio ofGeometric Mean Titer of vibriocidal
           antibodies post vaccination of Test vaccine' compared with 'Comparator vaccine'.

      Expected outcome: Statistical equivalence of the two vaccines.
