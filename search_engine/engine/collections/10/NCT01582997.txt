      study will be designed to assess safety, tolerability, single and repeat dose PK profile and
      preliminary efficacy of GSK2118436 in Japanese subjects with BRAF V600 mutation positive
      solid tumors using continuous daily dosing schedule. Dose escalation of GSK2118436 will be
      performed according to a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design. GSK2118436 is given twice a
      day. However, to characterize the PK of GSK2118436 and its metabolites after single-dose
      administration, GSK2118436 will NOT be administrated for a week after the first
      administration. GSK2118436 continuous dosing will start after the 168-hour PK sample is
      obtained. Subjects may receive study treatment until disease progression, death or an
      unacceptable adverse event.
