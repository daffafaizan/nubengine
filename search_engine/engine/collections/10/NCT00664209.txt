      antibiotics leads to improved absorption and pharmacokinetics of levodopa. This may
      potentially benefit patients with Parkinson's disease who have motor fluctuations,
      specifically excessive "off" time, when their levodopa is not working to control symptoms. We
      seek to identify the frequency of H. pylori infection in this population using standard lab
      assays and determine whether eradication with standard triple therapy results in improved
      clinical response to medication.
