4613. selective brain cooling produced by cerebral ventricular perfusionhypothermic cerebral ventricular perfusionwas applied to dogs.  shivering appear-ed to be directly related to the cns temperaturerather than the peripheral bodytemperature.  selective heating of the brain-stemproduced panting.  rewarmingof the body was retarded by the initiation of heatloss mechanisms controlled cen-trally when hyperthermic perfusion was used.shivering disappeared but pantingwas unaffected by pentobarbital anesthesia.cooling of one or both frontal areas andthe anterior part of the third ventricle did notsignificantly affect the respiratoryor circulatory systems but brain-stem hypothermiaproduced distinct respiratoryand circulatory reactions.  it is suggested thatcooling of the 3rd and 4th ventricu-lar areas may be utilized for anesthetic purposes.
