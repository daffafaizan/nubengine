    
      SPECIFIC AIM 1. The first aim of the study is to explore the impact of sciatic PNB technique
      on hamstring donor site pain control postoperatively.

      H1.a. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB decreases pain
      scores during the initial 72 hours following hamstring autograft harvest when compared to
      single-injection sciatic PNB.

      H1.b. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB decreases oral
      pain medication use during the initial 72 hours following hamstring autograft harvest when
      compared to single-injection sciatic PNB.

      H1.c. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB decreases the
      incidence of unplanned admission due to poor pain control during the initial 72 hours
      following hamstring autograft harvest when compared to single-injection sciatic PNB.

      SPECIFIC AIM 2. The second aim of the study is to explore the impact of sciatic PNB technique
      on active knee flexion postoperatively.

      H2. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB does not delay
      active knee flexion during the initial 72 hours following hamstring autograft harvest when
      compared to single-injection sciatic PNB.

      SPECIFIC AIM 3. The third aim of the study is to explore the impact of sciatic PNB technique
      on patient satisfaction with postoperative pain control.

      H3.1. The extended duration of analgesia offered by continuous sciatic PNB improves patient
      satisfaction during the initial 72 hours following hamstring autograft harvest when compared
      to single-injection sciatic PNB.
