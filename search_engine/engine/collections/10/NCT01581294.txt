    
      This study is a modification, and an extension, of the NOR-DMARD study that was conducted in
      5 Norwegian rheumatology departments in the period 2000-2012. The study includes a structured
      follow-up with study visits at baseline (start of biological drug) and after 3, 6, 9, 12
      months and every 6 months thereafter. Each study visit includes clinical assessment,
      patient-reported outcomes and measurement of acute-phase reactants. The data collection also
      includes blood samples for biobank at baseline and 3 months, and annual radiographs of hands
      and feet in patients with peripheral arthritis. Adverse events data will be systematically
      recorded, but also retrieved by linkage to other registers.
