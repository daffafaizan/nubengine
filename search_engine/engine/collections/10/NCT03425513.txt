      of higher HBV prevalence exist in areas with large immigrant populations. Therefore national
      prevalence figures can underestimate the burden of HBV infection. The prevalence of chronic
      HBV in the population-based study in 2003 is believed to be an underestimate due to
      under-representation of the non-Belgian population. Moreover, by this time there are no data
      regarding the risk factors for HBV infection in the general population of Belgium.

      Even in low-prevalence areas such as Belgium, HBV prevention and control is a public health
      priority, particularly since safe and effective vaccines are available. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the current prevalence and risk factors of HBV infection in a multi-ethnic
      neighbourhood situated in Middle Limburg, Belgium. Additionally, the investigators will
      determine linkage of care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive subjects.
