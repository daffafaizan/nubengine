    
      This study will be a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects and
      asthma patients, performed at 2 study centers. The study will consist of 3 parts (Part 1 [SAD
      in healthy subjects]; Part 2 [SAD in asthma patients]; Part 3 [MAD in healthy subjects under
      fasted conditions, with one cohort participating under fed conditions during one day as
      well]). The SAD cohorts in Parts 1 and 2 of the study will include male and women of
      non-childbearing potential (WONCBP) until the exposure limit for males has been reached. If
      an additional cohort for Parts 1 and 2 with a dose exceeding exposure limits in males is
      warranted (to explore the upper end of the dose response curve), this will be conducted in
      WONCBP only. Cohorts in Part 3 will include male subjects and WONCBP, depending on
      recruitment feasibility. All cohorts in the study will be single-blinded.
