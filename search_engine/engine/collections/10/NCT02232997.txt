      induced nephropathy in high risk patients undergoing coronary angiography. Long term
      hydration at routine speed(12h before and after procedure at 1ml/kg/h), as the most
      recommended adequate hydration, has been carried out to prevent contrast induced nephropathy
      in lots of clinical trials. Base on the data in the POSEIDON randomised controlled trial with
      haemodynamic-guided fluid administration, short term hydration at high speed(1h before and 4h
      after procedure at 3ml/kg/h) may not be inferior to the classic long term hydration, the
      speed should be reduced half of the intended speed in all the patients. We hypothesized short
      term hydration may not be inferior to the long one to reduced significantly the hospital stay
      and healthy cost.
