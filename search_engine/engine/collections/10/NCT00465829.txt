      longer term than LABS-1, i.e., more than 30 days. Using a sample of the LABS-1 cohort,
      approximately 2,400 patients, will be recruited over 3 years. LABS-2 will include clinical
      assessments and detailed interviews and questionnaires pre-operatively and at several
      post-operative time points (30 days, 6 months, 12 months following surgery, and annually
      thereafter) to assess risks of surgery, and changes in clinical, metabolic, and psychosocial
      characteristics in patients, and health care utilization following bariatric surgery.
      Detailed data about the surgical procedure and peri- and post-operative care will also be
      collected to determine if components of the surgical procedure, and peri-operative and
      post-operative care as well as clinical/demographic patient characteristics are associated
      with post-operative risks and changes in patient status. Patients enrolled in LABS-2 will
      provide blood specimens pre-operatively and post-operatively to address LABS-2 hypotheses and
      additional samples will be stored at the NIDDK tissue repository for serologic, pathologic
      and genomic testing of other hypotheses.
