      (Subsys) for procedural pain (dressing changes/minor debridement) in patients with burn
      injury. It will be compared with a standard treatment regimen of oral morphine. The
      hypothesis is that the fentanyl spray will be more effective for the treatment of procedural
      pain in patients with burn injury.
