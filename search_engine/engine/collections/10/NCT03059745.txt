      operating room documentation of procedures. Currently there are numerous methods considered
      to be the Standard of Care in the surgical treatment of Cholecystitis, or Cholelithiasis,
      including Open Surgery, Laparoscopic, and Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery. This study
      retrospectively reviews the intraoperative and post operative clinical outcomes of
      Laparoscopic and Robotic Assisted Surgery at U.C. Davis Medical Center to: 1) establish the
      role of robotics in laparoscopic surgery, and 2) to assess the learning curve by surgeons.
