      emphasis on how to integrate carepartners (family members) into the rehabilitation process
      without increasing negative carepartner outcomes.

      A novel, web-based carepartner focused intervention (CARE-CITE) is designed to foster problem
      solving and skill building while facilitating carepartner engagement during upper extremity
      functional activities in the home setting. The proposed study will evaluate the application
      of the CARE-CITE intervention paired with usual and customary care during the sub-acute
      stroke.
