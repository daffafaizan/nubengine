      significant reductions in tumor size can be achieved in large, long established, tumors.
      Cutaneous neurofibromas, which do not usually become apparent until puberty, continue to
      increase in size and number throughout adulthood. The psychosocial burden of these
      disfiguring tumors is significant, and the targeted age group (14-30) is at a life period
      associated with an acceleration in tumor growth. It is for these reasons that the
      investigators hope to affect the growth rate of less established tumors, in order to prevent
      or lessen this burden as the patient progresses further into adulthood.

      Therefore, the investigators wish to determine the time to disease progression (defined as
      50% growth in size over baseline) for benign neurofibromas treated with PDT in patients with
      neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in subjects aged 14-30.

      The treatment will consist of choosing several neurofibromas of similar size, and applying a
      topical drug called Levulan, or just the topical application alone (a placebo). Within 24
      hours of drug treatment, the neurofibromas will be illuminated with red light (both Levulan
      and placebo). The Levulan is what is known as a photosensitizer, and will be activated by the
      red light to potentially kill some of the tumor cells. Approximately every 6 months after,
      for three years, the tumors will be measured by digital photography and ultrasound to see if
      they are growing more slowly than the ones with the placebo application alone.
