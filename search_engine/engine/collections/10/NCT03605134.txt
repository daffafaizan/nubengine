      the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). However, there are multiple different causes
      that also result in abnormal Tn levels, such as direct myocardial-cell injury, impaired renal
      excretion and sepsis. Because of this, elevated Tn level is a common finding in hospitalized
      patients.

      Several studies on patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) without MI show that Tn
      elevation is a mortality risk factor and an independent predictor of hospital mortality.

      Up till now it is not yet known if the routine measurement of Tn in elderly patients
      undergoing surgery can significantly improve their outcome and that is the primary aim of
      this study. In addition, it is not known what the impact could be if a diastolic function
      assessment could be performed peri-operatively.

      This study will examine the correlation between elevated Tn levels in elderly patients
      undergoing major surgery and their short-term outcome (in-hospital). Before and immediately
      after surgery, diastolic function will be assessed by means of transthoracic echocardiography
      (TTE).
