      Part 1 will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of APG-1387 in
      combination with entecavir, including determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/
      recommended dose in patients with CHB. APG-1387 will be administered once weekly via
      intravenous infusion for 30 minutes for consecutive 4 weeks. APG-1387 will be escalated at 3
      dose cohorts of 12 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg. Entecavir will be administered orally at 0.5 mg
      daily for 12 weeks: in combination with APG-1387 for the first 4 weeks, followed by entecavir
      maintenance monotherapy for additional 8 weeks. The total treatment duration will be 12
      weeks.

      Part 2 is a randomized, parallel, open-label study to investigate the preliminary anti-HBV
      efficacy of APG-1387 in combination with entecavir compared with entecavir monotherapy. CHB
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 4 cohorts at 1:1:1:1, including APG-1387 at 3
      different doses (12 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg) in combination with entecavir for 12 weeks,
      respectively, then continued entecavir monotherapy for additional 12 weeks; and one entecavir
      monotherapy cohort for 24 weeks. The course of treatment is 24 weeks in all cohorts.
