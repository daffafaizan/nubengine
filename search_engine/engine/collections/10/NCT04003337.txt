      of blastocyst through morphokinetics (analysis of embryos depending not only in their
      morphology -that is, the aspect of the embryo-, but also based on times of cell division)
      during the use of time-lapse (Embryoscope®) may have a better impact in clinical results, as
      selection is not performed in mere morphological evolution (visual aspect of the embryo) of
      the embryos.

      In order to obtain this objective, patients participating in the study will be randomly
      assigned to one of the following groups:

      Group A: Patients who will perform an embryo transfer of a blastocyst using morphological
      criteria to evaluate que quality of the blastocyst (Gardner Classification), that is, based
      on the aspect or form of the embryo.

      Group B: Patients who will perform an embryo transfer of a blastocyst using morphokinetics
      criteria to evaluate the quality of the blastocyst (Embryoscope®), that is, based not only in
      the aspect of the embryo but also in cell division times experimented by the embryos.
