      Patients will be randomly allocated either the experimental group, undergoing an individual
      CRT for 40 hours during 16 weeks, or the control group following a psycho-educational
      intervention without any neurocognitive work, both lasting the same amount of hours and
      period of time. Blood samples will be obtained from participants in four moments: before
      treatment, at week 4, at week 16, and at 32 week follow-up. In addition, repeated
      measurements will be obtained with a neurocognitive battery based on the MATRICS consensus
      battery and the Positive And Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS). Assessments will be conducted
      by trained personnel who will remain blind to the group assignment. A factorial model will be
      performed conducting a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to study the effects
      of CRT on the levels of BDNF, neurocognition, symptoms and social functioning, adding the
      necessary co-variants. Finally, a linear regression model to determine the predictive role of
      serum levels of BDNF and data from functional and structural neuroimaging on the effects of
      CRT will be performed.
