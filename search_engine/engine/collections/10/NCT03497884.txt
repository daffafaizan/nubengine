      respectively. For the l-Hz sessions (low frequency), stimulation is delivered at 100% of the
      subject's resting motor threshold at 1 Hz continuously over 30 min for a total of 1,800
      pluses. The 10-Hz stimulation is delivered at 100% of the subject's resting motor threshold
      via 60 trains of 3-s 10-Hz rTMS (30 pulses per train).
