      For the patients Visit 1 (Day 0): duration : 60 minutes

        -  Information to patient and collection of non-opposition

        -  Collection of socio-demographic data: age, sex, level of education

        -  Clinical data collection: duration of RBD, duration and severity of the concomitant
           disease:, medical and surgical history

        -  Assessment of cognitive functions: Mini Mental State Examination

        -  Verification of inclusion / exclusion criteria

        -  Ongoing treatments and calculation of Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) for PD
           patients.

        -  RBD severity scale for Patient (RBDSS-PT) + Global Clinical Impression-Severity Scale

      Visit 2 (J7) : duration : 20 minutes

        -  Ongoing treatments

        -  RBDSS PT + Global Clinical Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S-PT)

        -  Patient will be given a Weekly Severity Agenda for 4 weeks plus a copy of the RBSSS-PT +
           Global Clinical Impression-Severity Scale

      At home, patients will fill :

      D8 à D36 :

      • Weekly Severity Agenda (wRBDQ) for 4 weeks

      D36 :

        -  RBDSS-PT + Clinical Global Impression-Severity These documents will be mailed back in a
           pre-payed envelop. For the Bed Partners Visit 1 (D0- baseline): duration: 30 minutes

        -  Information of and collection of non opposition

        -  Verification of inclusion / exclusion criteria

        -  Ongoing Treatments

        -  RBD severity scale of the bed partner (RBDSS BP)+ Global Clinical Impression-Severity
           Scale

      Visit 2 (D7- retest) : duration : 20 minutes

        -  Ongoing treatments

        -  RBDSS-BP + Clinical Overall Impression Severity Scale

        -  Patient will be given a Weekly Joint Severity Agenda to be completed together with the
           patient, (wRBDQ) for 4 weeks, plus a copy of the RBDSS-BP + CGI-S-BP

      At home: bedpartners will fill:

      D8 à D36 :

      • Weekly Severity Agenda for 4 weeks, in common with patient

      D36 :

      • RBDSS-BP + Impression Global Clinique-Severity scale These documents will be mailed back in
      a pre-payed envelop.
