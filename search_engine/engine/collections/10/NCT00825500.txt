    
      This study was designed to compare the safety and pharmacodynamic profiles of concomitant
      administration of single doses of ADASUVE and intramuscular (IM) lorazepam compared to that
      of each agent administered alone. Respiratory pharmacodynamics were monitored through
      recordings of respirations/minute and pulse oximetry. Other pharmacodynamic safety measures
      included effects on blood pressure, heart rate, sedation, and psychomotor measures of
      attention, information processing speed, reaction time, and coordination.
