      back pain (CLBP). However the effect sizes are still modest and there is room for
      improvement. A way to progress in this line is enhancing treatment adherence and
      self-management by means of information and communication technologies (ICT). The objective
      of this study is to investigate the short- and long-term efficacy of a Cognitive Behavioural
      Treatment (CBT) group program for CLBP supported versus non-supported by ICTs. A secondary
      objective is to evaluate the influence of relevant variables in treatment response. Possible
      barriers in the implementation of CBT with and without ICT will be also investigated.

      Methods: A randomized controlled trail with 180 CLBP patients recruited in specialized care
      will be conducted. Participants will be randomly assigned to three conditions: Control group
      (CG), Cognitive Behavioural program (CBT), and CBT supported by ICTs (CBT + ICT).
      Participants belonging to the three conditions will receive a conventional rehabilitation
      program (back school). The CBT group program will last six sessions. The CBT + ICT will use
      the Internet and SMS in order to practice the therapeutic strategies between sessions and in
      the follow-ups in their homes. Primary outcome variables are self-reported disability and
      pain intensity. Assessment will be carried out by blinded assessors in five moments:
      pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. The influence of
      catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs, anxiety and depression in response to treatment in
      the primary outcomes will be also analysed.

      Discussion This study will show data of the possible benefits of the use of ICTs in the
      improvement of CBT for the treatment of CLBP
