      compare the favorable rate between treatment with Aspirin alone and combination treatment
      with BNG-1 and Aspirin in patients with ischemic stroke. The favorable to therapy will be
      determined if all of the following occurs: alive, Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) < 3, Barthel
      Index (BI) >= 60.

      Secondary objectives are to compare the following:

        1. Compare the favorable rate at one week after study drug administered and the end of
           treatment (Week 4) and 4 weeks of follow-up (Week 8) of either Aspirin alone or
           combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.

        2. Compare the mean change in Barthel Index (BI), at each evaluation time-point of either
           Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.

        3. Compare the mean change in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at each
           evaluation time-point of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and
           Aspirin.

        4. Compare the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) at each evaluation time-point of either Aspirin
           alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.

        5. Compare the change in Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) at each evaluation
           time-point of either Aspirin alone or combination treatment with BNG-1 and Aspirin.
