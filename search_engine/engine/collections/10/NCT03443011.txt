      All patients over the age of 50 with clinically suspected acute diverticulitis that meet
      inclusions criterium will be asked for participation. A Clinical examination and blood
      samples will be drawn.

      Subjects will be sent to the radiology department where they will undergo computed tomography
      (CT) of the abdomen. The CT protocol consists of a low dose non contrast enhanced CT followed
      by a normal dose CT with intravenous contrast. This is needed as randomization of patients is
      not possible due to the fact that the Clinical diagnosis of diverticulitis is difficult and
      unreliable. This would lead to the situation that we would not know if a participant in the
      low dose CT Group has diverticulitis which was not seen with the low dose protocol or if the
      patient did not have diverticulitis.

      The radiologist on call will examine the full dose CT examination and write a report as
      routine. At a later date Three blinded radiologists will examine first all low dose CT
      examinations and grade them according to our CT protocol. At a later date the radiologists
      will evaluate all full dose CT examinations using the same CT protocol.

      Findings will then be compared between the two different CT methods and sensitivity and
      specificity for low dose CT will be calculated.
