    
      This is a Phase I multicenter, double-blind, single dose, dose-ranging study, in healthy men
      followed on an inpatient basis to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of 11β-methyl nortestosterone dodecylcarbonate (11β-MNTDC).

      This single dose, dose-ranging study of 4 escalating doses will be conducted in two centers.

      Initially, 12 men will be enrolled in total, 6 men at each center, with a goal of having a
      minimum of 12 healthy male subjects completing this study (10 active drugs and 2 placebos)
      both in the fed and fasting states at each dose.

      Each of the 4 doses of 11β-MNTDC will be administered first fasting and then fed. Each of the
      doses of 11β-MNTDC will be administered about 28 days apart +/- 14 days with the time
      interval between the fasting and fed dosing will be approximately 7 days (-2/+9 days) and a 7
      to 14 day washout will occur before dose escalation.
