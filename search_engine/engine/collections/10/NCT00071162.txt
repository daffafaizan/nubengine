      pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and multiple tender points on physical examination. The
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FMS are not clearly understood, but neuroendocrine
      factors seem to be of major importance. Studies of familial association suggest that genetic
      factors play a role in FMS. This study will establish patterns of genetic linkage in families
      with FMS.

      Participating family members will undergo a brief physical exam (including tender point
      exam), donate a blood sample, and complete a detailed questionnaire that includes experience
      with pain, fatigue, depression, bowel symptoms, headache, anxiety, and physical limitations.
      Measurements of serum serotonin and related compounds will also be obtained. To detect
      genetic factors, a genome-wide linkage scan using 405 microsatellite markers will be
      performed.
