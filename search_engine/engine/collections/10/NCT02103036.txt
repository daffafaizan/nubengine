      regard to clinical improvements. The secondary objectives are: to determine which treatment
      is more effective in improving pain in the fewest sessions possible, to determine the
      involvement of inflammatory biomarkers in the development of pain and revalue the results
      after one month of having finishing treatment.

      The project is a longitudinal, single-blind and randomized study with two treatment groups:

      GROUP 1: Infrared light+ Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) + Core Stability
      Exercises.

      GROUP 2: Infrared light + Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) + Traditional
      Back School.

      Duration of treatment: 4 weeks. The participants will performe the exercises in 20 daily
      sessions (Monday to Friday) guided by a physiotherapist. Following treatment with the
      physiotherapist, the participants should perform the exercises at home for 4 weeks at a rate
      of three times per week.
