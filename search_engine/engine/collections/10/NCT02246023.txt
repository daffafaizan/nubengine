      (fractionated) by a specially-trained nurse in attendance of the bronchoscopist. But,
      fractionated propofol administration (FPA) may lead to oversedation and enhanced side effects
      (oxygen desaturation and arterial hypotension), as a stable plasma concentration of propofol
      is not maintainable. In contrast to FPA, continuous infusions of propofol are commonly used
      to induce and maintain long-term sedation in intensive care units and general anesthesia.
      Recently, continuous propofol infusion for sedation in bronchoscopy has been shown comparable
      to FPA in terms of safety and efficacy. Generally, infusion devices can be manually
      controlled (MCI) or target-controlled (TCI). In the latter, the physician sets a target blood
      concentration and the computerized infusion device makes the necessary changes to the
      infusion rate.

      The objective of this study is to compare propofol TCI with FPA in flexible bronchoscopy
      concerning patient safety and sedation quality.
