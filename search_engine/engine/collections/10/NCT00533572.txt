      transfect autologous RDEB keratinocytes with a type VII collagen containing retrovirus
      vector. We then plan to graft the genetically engineered and corrected autologous
      keratinocytes back on to wounds of the RDEB subject. We expect the grafts to attach as normal
      keratinocytes and replace the damaged skin with skin that is able to make type VII collagen
      and anchor normally to the dermis. We are trying to define the number of subjects 18 or older
      who meet the criteria for the gene transfer trial. We are offering the subjects the
      opportunity to be evaluated for the potential trial.
