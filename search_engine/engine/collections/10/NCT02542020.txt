      aims of this project are: (i) to estimate the prevalence and incidence of liver injury
      (including progression of fibrosis, necro-inflammatory activity and steatosis) and to report
      the normal values of non-invasive methods in HIV population; (ii) to validate the diagnostic
      performance of non-invasive methods using a method without a gold standard (Latent Class
      Analysis); (iii) to validate the prognostic value of non-invasive markers to predict overall
      mortality and liver-related outcomes and (iv) to correlate liver injury with nutritional
      status. The secondary aim will be the constitution of a cohort of HIV patients, with or
      without chronic viral hepatitis co-infection for long-term follow-up of severe outcomes.

      This prospective cohort study has been approved by the Local Ethical Committee (CAAE:
      32889514.4.0000.5262) and it has been enrolling patients from June 2015 at the Evandro Chagas
      National Institute of Infectious Diseases - Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (INI - FioCruz), Rio de
      Janeiro, Brazil. A total of 2,000 patients will be included in this study during the next 5
      years. This project aims to report the prevalence and incidence of liver disease in a
      representative sample of HIV patients with and without chronic viral hepatitis co-infection.
      In addition, the risk factors associated to presence and progression of liver fibrosis and
      steatosis will be identified and an innovative non-invasive management for estimation of
      liver injury in HIV patients will be validated.

      Patients have been submitted at the same day to the following procedures: (i) clinical
      examination (anthropometric and demographic characteristics), (ii) blood sample collection
      (for blood analysis, calculation of biomarkers and stockage of samples), (iii) transient
      elastography (with M and XL probes by a single experienced operator (>2,000 examinations) and
      (iv) nutritional status (bioelectrical impedance and 24h diet recall).
