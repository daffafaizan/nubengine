      do with improving outcome in terms of successful pregnancy. However, as these rates have
      increased, attention is slowly turning to focus on the health of the resultant child.
      Short-term health complications, in particular birth defects,have been well-described.
      However, even this "hard" outcome has been difficult to characterize as studies used
      different methodologies, varied age of detection, and frequently didn't have an appropriate
      comparison group. When underlying parental factors and infertility are included in the
      analyses, the association is substantially weakened or disappears completely. This
      exemplifies the problems with much of the currently available research regarding childhood
      outcomes following ART. While the health of children born through these technologies is of
      critical public health interest, and of personal interest to families, only limited data
      exist.

      In order to evaluate the potential risk to long-term health of children conceived through
      assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and non-IVF fertility treatments (NIFT), rigorous
      epidemiological methods, appropriate characterization of the exposure, standardized
      collection of outcome data, and appropriate comparison groups are required. The proposed
      Developmental Epidemiological Study of Children born through Reproductive Technology (DESCRT)
      is aimed to carefully address these important characteristics.
