    
      The objectives of this study are to characterize the risks (safety and tolerability),
      effectiveness (continued viral load suppression and CD4 changes), and benefits (safety,
      tolerability, adherence, general satisfaction with the treatment regimen and QoL), of
      switching from a Combivir (BID) / efavirenz (QD) regimen to an all QD regimen of
      Truvada/efavirenz.
