      rates of mortality orneurologic sequelae. The severity of sequelae, together with the volume
      of cases, makes JE an important cause of encephalitis. The disease is endemic across
      temperate and tropical zones of Asia,and because of its zoonotic cycle, eradicating JE from
      the environment is unrealistic. Universal childhood vaccination is essential for disease
      control. In Sri Lanka, immunization against JE began in 1988. By 2006, two types of JE
      vaccines were available for use in Sri Lanka-inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine and live
      attenuated SA-14-14-2 JE vaccine (LJEV). Only the inactivated vaccine was being used in the
      country's public-sector immunization program. Concern in Japan over a rare but potentially
      dangerous adverse event associated with a mouse brain-derived vaccine led the manufacturer in
      Japan to discontinue production in 2005, thus limiting global supply of inactivated JE
      vaccines and raising costs for remaining inactivated vaccines. In August of 2006, the World
      Health Organization stated in its position paper on Japanese encephalitis vaccines that the
      mouse brain-derived vaccine should be replaced by a new generation of JE vaccines. For Sri
      Lanka, switching to the less expensive LJEV was estimated in 2006 to save the National
      Immunization Programme (NIP) between US$8.6 and $8.9 million annually in direct vaccine costs
      alone. To generate local immunogenicity and safety data to guide policy for potential use of
      LJEV in Sri Lanka's NIP, the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition, in cooperation with PATH,
      initiated the study. The study was conducted in three peri-urban health divisions of low JE
      endemicity in the District of Colombo.
