      in the gut of patients with arsenical keratosis which is increase by the administration of
      probiotics (manuscript is preparing). However, E.coli contribute only about 0.1% of the total
      gut bacteria. It is not known whether anaerobic bacteria play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of arsenical keratosis. This can be evaluated by administering probiotics.
      Thirty patients of moderate arsenical palmer keratosis from an arsenic affected area will be
      recruited on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will be provided two
      probiotics capsules per day orally for 12 weeks. Water sample will be collected before
      starting the study for confirming the diagnosis. Stool samples will be collected twice
      (before and after completion of the study) for qualitative and quantitative analysis of
      anaerobic bacteria. Similar number of arsenic exposed controls (30) and healthy volunteers
      (30) from the same area will be included in this study and they will be provided probiotics
      capsules with similar dosage and duration. Like aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria may be
      modulated by probiotics in arsenicosis patients.
