      follow-up. Patients affected by mild to-moderate distal lateral subungual onychomycosis
      (DLSO) on a target great toenail will be included in the study. Clinical as well as mycology
      assessments will be performed throughout the whole study. Safety will be monitored by
      recording any adverse event and evaluating local tolerability.
