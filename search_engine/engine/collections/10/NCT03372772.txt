      weakness, lethargy, lassitude amounting from degrees mild, moderate to a severe one to total
      incapacitation on the part of the patients. Hypothyroid patients instate of receiving
      adequate thyroid hormone replacement, experience fatigue-related symptoms. Carnitine is a
      non-essential amino acid synthesized endogenously from essential amino acids- lysine and
      methionine with in the body involved in long chain fatty acid transportation to the
      mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine- transportation system is essential for production of
      energy at cellular level. Thyroid hormone plays an important role in carnitine-dependent long
      chain fatty acid transport and oxidation. Some available reports suggest that, Levocarnitine
      supplementation produced potentially favourable effects on fatigue-related symptoms in
      hypothyroid patients although still awaits confirmation. The present study is an attempt to
      investigate into the effects of Levocarnitine supplementation on fatigue in patients with
      hypothyroidism.
