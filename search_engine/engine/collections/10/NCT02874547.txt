      management is a CHW-delivered culturally appropriate storytelling intervention for patients
      diagnosed with HTN. We will develop and test interactive videos presenting stories of
      patients who have successfully made changes enhancing blood pressure control; and integrate
      this new tool with a CHW approach to management of hypertension. This two site, two-armed
      randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 252 english and spanish speaking patients with
      uncontrolled HTN. All participants are randomized to receive five visits (two in-person and 3
      telephone calls) with CHWs either immediately (intervention condition (I)) or 6 months after
      enrollment (delayed intervention (DI)). Intervention participants receive the intervention
      immediately and DI participants receive print materials at enrollment and are telephoned 4-6
      months after enrollment to schedule an in-person visit at the health enter to begin receiving
      the intervention protocol.
