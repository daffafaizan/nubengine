      biosynthesis and alters the cellular metabolism in colon and other resectable cancers.

        -  The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacodynamic study.

        -  Potentially eligible patients will be screened in the University of Kentucky Markey
           Cancer Center clinics. Eligible patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed
           resectable cancers without any distant metastases will be identified. Upon obtaining
           informed consent, patients will be enrolled into the study and randomized to TVB-2640 or
           placebo in a 2:1 fashion. Subjects and clinical investigators will be blinded to
           treatment group assignment.

        -  Baseline blood samples will be collected on Day 0 for all patients.

        -  All enrolled patients will receive the study drug (TVB-2640 or placebo) at a BSA-derived
           flat dose, orally once daily, starting Day 1. They will receive the study drug for 10-21
           days (minimum of 10 days and a maximum of 21 days), i.e. from Day 1 to Day 10-21. The
           last dose of the study drug will be on the day before the surgical resection.

        -  For patients in both randomization groups, surgery will be performed anytime during the
           window of Day 11- Day 22. On the day of surgery, surgical resection specimen and blood
           samples will be collected.

        -  All patients will be evaluated and graded for adverse events according to the NCI Common
           Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.

        -  Patients will be followed for 4 weeks after the last dose of the study drug to monitor
           for any drug-related adverse events.
