           their leukemia cells, we cannot guarantee that they will be able to receive a vaccine.
           First, we may not be able to make enough vaccine from the collected cells. Second, they
           may not be able to participate in a vaccine study in the future for reasons related to
           the status of your overall health. Third, an appropriate vaccine trial may not be
           available in the future.

        -  In order to make the vaccine, leukemia cells will be collected by one or more of the
           following methods: drawing blood during one of two visits to the clinic; leukapheresis;
           bone marrow aspiration; or, surgery to remove a lymph node.

        -  The physician will discuss with the participant which approach is best in their case to
           ensure the highest number of tumor cells collected.
