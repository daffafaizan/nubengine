      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety of deferasirox given over 6 months in reducing liver iron
           concentration in patients with transfusional iron overload after undergoing allogeneic
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of deferasirox in reducing liver iron overload in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral deferasirox once daily for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
