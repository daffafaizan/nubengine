      variety of advanced solid tumors within the past year. It is anticipated that this number
      will increase as the clinical indications for treatment with these agents also increase. The
      investigators conducted a survey of 60 Medical Oncologists within the UPMC system regarding
      their interest in a trial that will attempt to address the question of optimal length of
      PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Fifty-two (86.7%) physicians indicated that they would participate in a
      clinical trial that had a primary goal of determining whether it was feasible to stop
      immunotherapy after 1 year of treatment.
