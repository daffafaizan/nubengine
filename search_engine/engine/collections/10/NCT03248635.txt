      broadbased, high quality, high impact research to uncover the causes of cancer and the means
      of its prevention. To this end, DCEG relies on epidemiologic data captured on self-reported
      questionnaires. The purpose of this pre-test study is to pilot a questionnaire to: (1) detect
      problems that might contribute to response errors; (2) develop ideas for improving the
      questionnaire in order to minimize such errors; and (3) assess the length of time to complete
      the questionnaire. If there are specific sections of the questionnaire that are skipped by
      all 30 initial participants, then six (6) additional, separate individuals may be invited to
      pre-test the questionnaire for sections that were missed by the initial set of participants.
      After a post-revision of the questionnaire based on the pre-test results, up to 10
      additional, separate individuals will be invited to test the revised questionnaire for
      duration and comprehensibility.
