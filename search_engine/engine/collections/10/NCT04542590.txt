      nephrocalcinosis in patients with PH3 has not been established. The goal of this study is to
      record 24-hour Uox levels and the incidence of new stone formation and/or the degree of
      nephrocalcinosis in patients with PH3 over time.

      Potential participants are screened over an up-to-6 week period according to the eligibility
      criteria and will then be followed every 6 months over an up-to-2-year period to determine
      the annualized new stone formation rate (number of new stones being formed per year) and the
      change in the degree of nephrocalcinosis (if applicable).

      New stone formation is defined as occurrence of any of the following:

        -  Spontaneous stone passage in the absence of pre-existing stones

        -  Stone passage occurring without change in the number of pre-existing stones detected by
           renal ultrasound

        -  Appearance of new stones on renal ultrasound or 100% or more growth of a pre-existing
           stone (estimated area)

        -  Surgical removal of newly formed stones Note: Spontaneous passage or surgical removal of
           pre-existing stones does not meet the criteria for new stone formation.

      This is a non-interventional study that will last up to 2 years.
