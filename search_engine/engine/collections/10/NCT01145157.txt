      total knee arthroplasty utilizing 'SignatureTM Personalised Patient Care', Conventional Total
      Knee Arthroplasty and Computer Assisted Navigation.

      The 'SignatureTM Personalised Patient Care' is a system that uses a patient's Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and X-ray design to build surgical instruments customized for a
      patient's unique knee anatomy. Cutting positioning guides are produced to match the outer
      shape of the individual's distal femur and proximal tibia.

      The cutting positioning guides are intended to be used as patient-specific surgical
      instrumentation to assist in the positioning of total knee replacement components
      intra-operatively and in guiding the marking of bone before cutting.
