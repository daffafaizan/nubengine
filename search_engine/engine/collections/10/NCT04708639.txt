        -  To determine if monitoring the amount of translocated DNA in the blood reflects
           alectinib treatment effect.

        -  To assess the presence and type of resistance mutations using ctDNA at the time patients
           experience clinical progression on alectinib.

        -  To investigate if the resistance mutations identified at clinical progression could have
           been identified in blood samples taken before clinically evident progression.
