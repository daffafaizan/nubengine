      aerobic exercise intervention (participant will choose between treadmill, elliptical or
      stationary bike). Each participant will engage in 60 minute daily sessions delivered 3
      times/week for 8 consecutive weeks (a total of 24 sessions). The investigators will determine
      the relationship between cognitive improvements and TMS neuroplasticity. The cognitive
      domains explored will be: 1) Visuomotor processing speed and cognitive flexibility/task
      switching; 2) Response inhibition, mental flexibility, and attentional control; 3) Attention
      and working memory; 4) List Learning and Memory; and 5) Semantic Verbal Fluency. The
      investigators will also explore the effect modification of BDNF levels and BDNF allelic
      status, and APOE4 status on cognitive response after exercise.
