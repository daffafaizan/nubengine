    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate of leflunomide treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess complete response rate and duration of response of leflunomide treatment.

      II. To assess toxicities of leflunomide treatment. III. To assess disease status by the CAILS
      (composite assessment of index lesion severity).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To generate a preliminary ribonucleic acid (RNA) signature associated with response of
      CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LYPDs) cells to leflunomide.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.
