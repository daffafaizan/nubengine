      dialyzer membrane into an electrolyte solution known as dialysate. Dialysate is produced from
      acid concentrate, bicarbonate solution and water using a three stream proportioning system
      that mixes the acid concentrate, bicarbonate and water to produce the final dialysate.
      Patients are typically anticoagulated with heparin during dialysis to prevent blood from
      clotting in the extracorpoeial circuit. Heparin use is associated with significant risks
      including the possibility of bleeding, heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and
      contamination. For these reasons, the possibility of reducing heparin dose while maintaining
      HD adequacy is clinically attractive. CitrasateÂ® is an FDA approved acid concentrate that
      contains citric acid (citrate) rather than acetic acid (acetate) which is traditionally used
      in acid concentrate. Citrate in higher concentrations is also a known anticoagulant. We are
      therefore conducting this study to determine whether the use of Citrasate, citric acid
      dialysate enables the reduction of the heparin requirements in patients undergoing
      hemodialysis.
