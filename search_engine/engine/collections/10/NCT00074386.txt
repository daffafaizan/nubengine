      of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), these people were often not considered
      transplant candidates based on concern about potential adverse effects of immunosuppressive
      drugs on HIV disease progression. However, with the use of HAART, HIV infected people have
      experienced significant improvements in morbidity and mortality. HIV infected people with end
      stage kidney and liver disease are now potential candidates for transplantation, yet patients
      and clinicians lack the necessary data to determine the safety and efficacy of
      transplantation and immunosuppression in this group. This lack of conclusive data has led to
      continued denial of care by many transplant centers and third party payers, resulting in
      frustration and confusion for both patients and their health care providers.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of solid organ transplantation in people
      with HIV infection by following a prospective, multi-center cohort of HIV infected people who
      undergo kidney or liver transplantation. The long-term goals are: 1) to provide patients and
      clinicians with information regarding the HIV-specific risks of transplantation; 2) to
      provide clinicians with information necessary to manage immunosuppressive and HAART
      medications together; and 3) to understand underlying basic science mechanisms that explain
      patient outcomes so that clinical management can be adjusted to improve outcomes.

      Approximately 150 kidney and 125 liver transplant patients will be enrolled in this study
      over a 3-year period at medical research centers throughout the United States. Participants
      will be enrolled in the study for five years from the day of the transplant.
