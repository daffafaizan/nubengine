        1. To further determine the nature of vision loss and optic nerve structural change
           associated with glaucoma. Using recently developed measures of visual function and
           techniques for imaging the eye, we will use a multivariate approach for analysis of the
           functional and structural changes associated with glaucoma to delineate further the
           relationship of these changes to the underlying physiological mechanisms..

        2. To evaluate and improve new diagnostic and monitoring techniques encompassing measures
           of visual function and optic nerve and retina nerve fiber layer structure and to compare
           the rate and patterns of progression of glaucomatous damage in Black and White eyes.

        3. To improve techniques for evaluation of current management and new therapies for
           glaucoma as they become available. We will expand our analysis using multivariate
           techniques incorporating visual function, optic nerve structure, and various risk
           factors to improve detection of true change. We will determine whether the benefits
           found in Whites using visual function specific perimetry and optic disc imaging for
           earlier detection and for monitoring progression are also found for Blacks.

        4. To determine the quantitative temporal relationships between recognizable optic nerve
           damage and measurable visual field loss and how these relationships differ among Black
           and White patients. Using new techniques with improved sensitivity, the detection and
           monitoring of early optic disc defects may provide profiles of people at risk for
           developing glaucomatous visual function loss thus better defining target populations for
           treatment.
