      I. To determine response rate (complete and partial responses and hematological improvement)
      to decitabine in patients with myelofibrosis.

      II. To determine the safety of decitabine in patients with myelofibrosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of decitabine on specific epigenetic changes including
      methylation status of specific target genes and gene re-expression.

      II. To determine the effect of decitabine on hemoglobin F levels and on the absolute numbers
      of circulating cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ progenitor cells and to investigate the
      potential utility of these markers as a surrogate for biologic activity of decitabine in
      myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (MMM).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive decitabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every
      42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
