    
      Rational and background :

      The care for low back pain associated with neuropathic pain is a problem often encountered in
      daily outpatient.

      And the care effectiveness has been frequently evaluated by the patients directly, because
      the pain would be felt by patients themselves.

      On the view of those, we decided to investigate the clinical treatment outcome of pregabalin
      or other analgesics medication for relief of pain and improvement of sleep interference and
      QOLs by Patient-reported outcomes.

      Research question and objectives :

      To evaluate the effect of pregabalin comparing with the conventional analgesic care in
      chronic low back pain patients with accompanying lower limb pain (neuropathic component)
      treated in primary care settings under routine clinical practice.

      Study design:

      This is an 8-week, multicenter prospective observational study. Subjects who have chronic low
      back pain patients with accompanying lower limb pain (with a neuropathic component) and meet
      all other entry criteria are enrolled at baseline in the duration of study. The analgesic
      treatment is determined by the clinical judgment of the physician in charge of patient
      management. This therapeutic choice is not related to the decision to take part in the study.
      All enrolled subjects will be received with analgesic treatment. The study requires 3 visits
      at least, baseline/enrollment visit, Week 4 visit and Week 8 visit (or discontinuation).
