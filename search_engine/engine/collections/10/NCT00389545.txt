      usually those presenting late, show ongoing left ventricular (LV) remodeling and poor
      clinical outcome despite primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac transfer
      of bone marrow-derived stem and progenitor cells has been investigated as an adjunctive
      therapy to promote regeneration of infarcted myocardium. Therefore, we designed a
      multicenter, randomized study to test the safety and efficacy of intracoronary injection of
      autologous BMNCs in patients with large acute anterior myocardial infarction and late
      presentation, who were treated with successful primary PCI.
