      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We hypothesized that Bifidobacterium breve is effective on
      symptoms of IBS patients. IBS patients will be enrolled via advertisement. Any IBS subtypes
      will not be rejected. They will take either 1.0 g of Bifidobacterium breve 3 times a day or
      same amount of placebo for 8 weeks. IBS symptoms and allied markers will be checked before,
      during, and after the administration.
