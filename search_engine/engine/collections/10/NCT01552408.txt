      This study consists of a screening period of up to 14 days (Days -14 to -1), and a 36-month
      treatment period (Day 0 to Month 36). Subjects who provide consent will enter the screening
      period to determine eligibility. As part of the screening process, the examining investigator
      will evaluate the macular foveal avascular zone fluorescein images to determine subjects'
      eligibility. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio so that approximately 20
      eyes will receive 0.3 mg ranibizumab monotherapy, and approximately 20 eyes will receive 0.3
      mg ranibizumab combined with Ultra wide 200Â° field angiogram guided targeted pan retinal
      photocoagulation (PRP). Subjects must meet VA and retinal thickness eligibility requirements
      during the screening period. The subject can have both eyes in the study. If both eyes are
      eligible, one eye will be randomized, to cohort 1 while the other eye will be randomized to
      the cohort 2. A subject with both eyes in the trial will have each eye in a separate cohort.
