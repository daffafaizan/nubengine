      tumor and the normal liver, and inside the normal liver will be tested by computer-assisted
      image analyses in patients undergoing liver resection for CLM between 2005 and 2013
      preoperatively treated with oxaliplatin or irinotecan with or without bevacizumab or
      cetuximab. The survival will be assessed in relation to several prognostic factors and to
      that immunoreactivity.
