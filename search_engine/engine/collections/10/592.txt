influence of hormones on tumor growth and plasma prolactin levels in ratsbearing a pituitary "mammotropic" tumorthe effects of estradiol, cortisol acetate, thyroxine, or thiouracil ontumor growth, organ weights, and plasma prolactin levels were determinedin rats bearing a furth pituitary "mammotropic" tumor (mtt.f4).  thistumor is known to secrete large amounts of adrenocorticotropin, somatotropin,and prolactin, but no follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone,or thyrotropin.  at the dose levels used, estradiol significantly suppressedtumor growth without influencing body growth, and it partially inhibitedenlargement of the adrenals and atrophy of the thymus.  cortisol acetatesignificantly reduced both tumor and body growth.  thyroxine had no significanteffect on tumor growth but enhanced the somatotropic effect as indicated byincreases in body growth and organ weights.  thiouracil had no significanteffect on tumor or body growth, although it significantly increased thyroidweight.  estradiol, cortisol acetate, and thyroxine each increased the plasmaprolactin levels of the tumor-bearing rats.
