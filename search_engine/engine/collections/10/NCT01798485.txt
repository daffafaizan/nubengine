      in patients with advanced NSCLC. A Phase 2b/3 Study (9090-08) was initiated to evaluate the
      safety and activity of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel vs. docetaxel alone in NSCLC.
      Study 9090-08 is ongoing. Results from an interim analysis show that the combination has been
      well tolerated and an encouraging improvement in efficacy, including overall survival (OS)
      has been observed.

      Update: An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) was established to review accumulating
      unblinded safety data, and efficacy data at two specified Interim Analyses. The DMC monitored
      the conduct of the trial (including the accrual/retention of patients) and reviewed the risks
      and benefits. The study was stopped after the first Interim Analysis due to futility.

      The efficacy portion of this report is based on a 05 October 2015 data cut after the number
      of protocol-defined death events (336) for the first interim analysis had been achieved. The
      safety portion is based on the final database locked on 23 December 2015.
