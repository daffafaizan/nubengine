    
      This is a Phase 2 randomized two arm phase II trial of pembrolizumab alone or sequentially
      following focal radiation to one of the target lesions, in previously treated patients with
      stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The primary goal of this trial is to compare the
      efficacy of focal radiation (RT) to an index lesion as a way of enhancing the anti-tumor
      immune response to pembrolizumab to that of pembrolizumab alone. The primary efficacy
      endpoint is overall RECIST-defined response outside the radiation field. To accomplish this
      goal 66 patients will be randomized 2:1 (stratified by histology (squamous versus
      non-squamous) and refractory versus non-refractory disease) to radiation plus pembrolizumab
      or pembrolizumab only, respectively.

      Primary Objective: To determine the tumor responses outside the radiation field (abscopal
      effect) after radiation followed by pembrolizumab in metastatic NSCLC.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the progression-free and overall survival in patients with NSCLC receiving
           pembrolizumab, who receive Single Fraction Radiation Therapy (SFRT)

        2. To determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of SFRT and pembrolizumab

        3. To examine potential predictive biomarkers in tumor samples and peripheral blood in
           patients treated with pembrolizumab and SFRT

        4. To determine the local control of SFRT in the radiated lesion, when SFRT is given with
           pembrolizumab

        5. To evaluate the induction of a T-cell response in patients with metastatic NSCLC treated
           with radiation and the effect of radiation
