      patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), and secondarily to determine if this drug can help in the
      treatment of bone marrow failure in these patients. It is hoped that oxandrolone will have
      less side effects than oxymetholone, the androgen used most frequently in the short-term
      treatment of bone marrow failure in FA patients. Subjects will be enrolled for approximately
      18 to 30 months (12 - 24 months of treatment and 6 months additional monitoring). The
      oxandrolone starting dose is 0.04mg/kg/day. Study monitoring includes weekly complete blood
      counts, monthly serum chemistry labs, quarterly physical examinations including virilization
      exams and liver ultrasounds. Semi-annually, hand radiographs are obtained for bone maturation
      and behavioral assessments are conducted to detect any aggressive behavior or mood changes.
      If no improvement n the subject's blood counts are noted after 4 months of therapy, the dose
      will be increased to 0.08mg/kg/day for a period of 4 more months. If no improvement is noted
      after a total of eight months, oxandrolone will be discontinued. If the blood counts show
      improvement, then the drug will continue for a minimum of twelve months. Subjects may remain
      on study and receive a total of 24 months of therapy if they have a response in their blood
      counts without unacceptable side effects. Post-treatment monitoring includes blood work and
      ultrasound every three months, and hand radiograph at six months.
