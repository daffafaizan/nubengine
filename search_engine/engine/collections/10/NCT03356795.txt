      causes more than 90% of cases. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system,
      birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these
      are less important. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer
      and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. The treatment of cervical
      cancer consists of surgical intervention, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

      In this study, the participant's T-cells will be collected and modified. Then the modified T
      cells, called chimeric antigen receptor modified-T cells (CAR T) which can recognize specific
      molecules that are expressed on the surface of cervical cancer cells, are given back to the
      participant by intravenous infusion.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of CAR T
      cells immunotherapy in patients who have GD2, PSMA, Muc1, Mesothelin or other markers
      positive cervical cancer. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the persistence
      and function of CAR T cells in the body.
