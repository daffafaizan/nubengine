      compared the use of barbed suture with conventional suture in laparoscopic myomectomy .The
      myoma bed was closed with either conventional polyglactin suture or unidirectional barbed
      suture . The operative time was shorter in the barbed suture group (73.3 ± 21.4 min Vs. 80.7
      ± 18.6 min) but this difference failed to reach statistical significance because of small
      sample size . However, the time required to suture the myoma beds was significantly lower in
      the barbed suture group .
