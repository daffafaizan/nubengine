      patients. Psilocybin is a naturally occurring substance found in some mushrooms that some
      cultures have used for centuries in religious practices. Psilocybin has not been approved for
      general medical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Its use in this study is
      investigational. Psilocybin is a mood-altering drug with effects similar to other
      hallucinogens like LSD and mescaline. Mescaline is the main psychoactive component of the
      peyote cactus used in Native American religious practices. Such substances have been used for
      centuries in some cultures as a way of inducing non-ordinary states of consciousness for
      religious and spiritual purposes.

      An earlier study that was done in our lab with healthy participants found that psilocybin,
      given in a comfortable and supportive setting, can provide an experience that is personally
      and spiritually meaningful for the participant. This study is being done to find out if
      psilocybin can also produce personally and spiritually meaningful experiences in cancer
      patients. This could be important because spirituality has been associated with increased
      psychological coping and decreased depression in serious illness. People with a diagnosis of
      cancer between the ages of 21 and 80 years old and who meet the medical requirements may
      join. About 44 people are expected to take part in this study.
