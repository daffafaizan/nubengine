      non-stent-based local drug delivery system, DCB has several advantages over drug-eluting
      stent(DES).Paclitaxel DCB inhibits excessive neointimal hyperplasia of a diseased lesions
      without leaving a permanent metallic frame, therefore reducing the risk of coronary
      thrombosis and eliminating adverse events associated with stent fracture, allergic reactions
      to metal struts or polymer. Since only 1 to 3 months duration of dual anti-platelet
      therapy(DAPT) is required after DCB intervention, the bleeding risk associated with prolonged
      DAPT is reduced. DCB angioplasty was proved safe in an all-comers, prospective, multicenter
      registry and confirmed not inferior to DES when treating small coronary lesions in a
      randomized clinical trial(BASKET SMALL-2). DCB has been used in"off-label"indications in
      the"real world" for de novo lesions, especially in vessels with diameter more than 2.75mm,
      and there is limited data on its long term clinical efficacy and safety in Asian patients in
      contemporary clinical registries. We therefore sought to evaluate the long term clinical
      outcome of DCB in treatment of coronary de novo lesions in Chinese patients.
