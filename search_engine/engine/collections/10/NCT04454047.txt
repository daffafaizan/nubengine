      tennis elbow. Consecutive 50 cases of refractory tennis elbow from 50 patients who underwent
      extracapsular arthroscopic surgery which performed independently by the same doctor from
      March 2012 to November 2016 was retrospectively analyzed. The key points of technical
      standard were summarized, including debridement, decortication and microfracture, suture
      under arthroscopy and postoperative cast fixation. Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), Mayo elbow
      performance score and Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand outcome measure (DASH) were
      evaluated for postoperative results. The effects of various technical points were analyzed by
      rank sum test, independent sample t test, Ï‡2 test and multiple logistic regression.
