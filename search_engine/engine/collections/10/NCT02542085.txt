      Patient exclusion criteria:

      Age< 18 y or > 80 y ASA >4 (the American Society of Anaesthesiologists' classification of
      Physical Health) BMI> 40 A previous mesh repair of the hernia Hernia defect size <2 or >7 cm
      Emergency operation

      Eligible patients are randomized into two operative groups (lap/hybrid). In the laparoscopic
      group the hernia defect is covered with a Parietex composite mesh (using minimum of 5 cm
      marginals, Securestrap fixation instrument and four lifting strings. In hybrid group the
      hernia sack is resected and fascial defect is sutured through a minilaparotomy incision.
      After this, a mesh repair is performed laparoscopically.
