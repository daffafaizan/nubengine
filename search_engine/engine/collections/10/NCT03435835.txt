      vascular function of the leg in old individuals. The objective of this study is to establish
      evidence to support the validity of HT in improving walking tolerance on PAD patents.

      Subjects will complete baseline assessments for eligibility, including medical history and
      ankle-brachial measurement. Eligible participants will be asked to report to the laboratory
      on 4 different occasions. The purpose of visits 1 and 2 The central hypothesis of this study,
      based on preliminary data, is that exposure to HT will enhance the oxygenation of calf
      muscles during exercise and as a result, the onset of pain will be delayed and walking
      performance will be enhanced. is to familiarize the participants with the treadmill walking
      test and assess the test-retest reliability of maximal walking time determination. On visits
      3 and 4 participants will receive either heat treatment or a control treatment for 80 min
      prior to undergoing a symptom-limited incremental test on the treadmill.
