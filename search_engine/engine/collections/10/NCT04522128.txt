      has the potential to negatively affect all domains of quality of life (QoL). QoL can be
      improved by giving feedback on gaps between someone's perceived QoL in a domain and how
      important it is to them (plus prompting reflective questions). However, interventions that
      are designed to improve QoL may increase the effectiveness of this as optimised behaviour
      change techniques can be used. This study aims to develop and test a quality of life
      intervention during social isolation/distancing.
