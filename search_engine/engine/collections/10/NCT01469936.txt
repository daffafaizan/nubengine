    
      Patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia will enter the study and follow a run-in phase during
      which they will all be supplemented with prebiotics, probiotics and grape fruit seed extract
      for 5 weeks :

        -  Patients that do not present a satisfactory relief of gastrointestinal symptoms (patient
           subjective evaluation) will enter the randomised phase after 2 weeks +/- 1 week, at day
           D0.

        -  Patients that do present a satisfactory relief of gastrointestinal symptoms (patient
           subjective evaluation) will exit the study at that point, and follow their usual medical
           care.

      Patients that enter the randomised phase will be supplemented with either PERMEAPROTECT or a
      PLACEBO, for 5 weeks +/- 1 week. Patients will then follow a 2 weeks +/- 1 week of wash-out,
      during which no supplementation will be made.

      Measures of the outcomes will be made :

        -  at Day 0 (beginning of supplementation).

        -  at Day 35 (+/- 7) (end of supplementation).

        -  at Day 49 (+/- 7) (end of follow-up, end of study)
