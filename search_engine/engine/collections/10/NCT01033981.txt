      patients expected was not reached. The date of cessation of the drug was January 27, 2011.
      There was no intervention in the treatment or administration of the drug; the study only
      observed the treatment and collected data. As the study was dependent on the arrival of new
      patients with metastatic renal cancer, which was of a very low incidence, the study was
      terminated. Efficacy, adverse events or other safety issues were not factors in terminating
      the study. Lack of patients was the only reason.
