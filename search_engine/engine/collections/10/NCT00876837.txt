      (SCIs) is to assure that they can grow up to have as productive and satisfying lives as their
      peers. Understanding factors associated with these outcomes of our patients after they have
      become adults may help to identify interventions and rehabilitation strategies that will
      optimize long-term outcomes. Long-term studies of adults with pediatric-onset SCI are needed
      to identify important outcomes, including survival, participation, health status and
      health-related quality of life, and life-satisfaction. Further, these outcomes need to be
      compared to population norms. Predictive models of important outcomes will be developed using
      independent factors, including demographic, impairment, functional limitation, participation,
      and environmental and personal factors. In addition, the impact of age at injury, upper
      extremity reconstruction or functional electrical stimulation implants, and the Mitrofanoff
      procedure on adult outcomes will be assessed. The stability of selected outcomes in
      comparison to normative and census data will be determined and factors associated with
      changes in these outcomes will be assessed.
