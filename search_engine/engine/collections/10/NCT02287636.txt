      I. Determine the diagnostic accuracy of PET/MRI as compared to the standard of reference
      PET/CT in lesion detection and lesion characterization.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain quantitative measurements in various body regions of standardized uptake values
      (SUV) in normal tissue and foci of pathologic tracer uptake in PET/MRI of pediatric patients
      with oncologic disease using various magnetic resonance attenuation correction (MRAC) methods
      and compare those to respective SUV based on CT attenuation correction.

      II. Assess the potential for radiation dose reduction with PET/MRI when eliminating CT
      radiation dose.

      III. Assess time efforts and workflow improvement with PET/MRI compared to sequential PET/CT
      plus MRI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT followed by PET/MRI.
