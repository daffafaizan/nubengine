    
      This is a randomized open-label study to determine the effects of monthly romosozumab for 12
      month or one-time zoledronic acid infusion on bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical
      markers of bone formation and resorption, in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and low
      BMD.

      Patients: Thirty women between 20-70 years of age with spinal cord injury and low bone mass
      (BMD T-score lower than -2.0 in at least one location: Lumbar Spine, Femoral Neck or Total
      Hip sites) will receive study medication.

      Primary outcome:

      Total hip BMD change during a one-year treatment period.

      Secondary outcome:

      Change in Femoral neck BMD at 12 months, Bone turnover markers change over time (3, 9 and 12
      month): C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), N-terminal propeptide of type I
      procollagen (P1NP).

      Study population:

      Thirty women between 20-70 years of age with spinal cord injury that occurred more than 24
      month ago and low bone mass (BMD T-score lower than -2.0 in at least one location: Lumbar
      Spine, Femoral Neck or Total Hip sites)
