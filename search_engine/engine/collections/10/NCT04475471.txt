      outcomes unfavorably. It is possible that one common CVD treatment, medications that impact
      ACE-2 function, may impact outcomes either favorably or unfavorably.

      However, studies so far have, perforce, been conducted with important limitations (e.g. small
      numbers, limited geographical representation, lack of data standardization for risk factors
      and outcomes, limited measurement, lack of appropriate adjustment for important confounders,
      and missing data). Considering the high global prevalence of CVD and its risk factors (e.g.
      hypertension and diabetes) and the suggested link with COVID19 it is urgent to initiate more
      robust studies to clarify the many issues early reports have engendered. So that
      investigators will conduct a global study for a better understanding of the cardiovascular
      conditions that increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19, and a better
      characterization of cardiovascular complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
