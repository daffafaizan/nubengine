      chronic venous disease also present a higher prevalence of onychodystrophy. Chronic venous
      disease (CVD) is a vascular disease that manifests itself in the lower limbs and is related
      to a number of different clinical syndromes, all of which have venous hypertension (HTV) in
      common.

      Onychodystrophy in the lower limbs is a progressive non-infectious condition associated with
      various factors the prevalence of which increases with age.It is mainly an acquired
      condition, but it can also be congenital. It is associated to a number of factors, it can
      sometimes be asymptomatic and it is progressive, non transmittable and evolves at a slow
      pace. It is characterised by an abnormal pigmentation, changes in the shape or texture and/or
      the deformation of nails.

      The work performed was observational, cross-sectional, analytical, inferential and
      unicentric. In order to prove its feasibility, the researcher conducted a preliminary
      investigation work (pilot study) with a total of 40 patients (aged 40 to 85) who were treated
      at the Service of Angiology and Vascular Surgery of the Hospital de Sant Pau (Barcelona,
      Spain). These patients were selected to verify their data and then the researcher performed a
      statistical study from a descriptive and inferential point of view to find out whether there
      is a relation betwen the prevalence of onychodystrophy and the degree of severity of chronic
      venous disease. In order to minimise methodological mistakes in the outcomes and sampling,
      the study has been carefully defined and framed.
