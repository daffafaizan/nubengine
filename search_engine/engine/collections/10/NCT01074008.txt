    
      This was a Phase 2a, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in
      chronically, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected participants designed to explore the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity, as well as the evolution and
      persistence to resistance of ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072. Participants were treated with
      ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 monotherapy for 3 days, followed by 81 days (12 weeks minus 3
      days of monotherapy) of ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 combined with pegylated
      interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV), followed by 36 weeks of pegIFN/RBV alone. Participants
      randomized to an ABT-450/r treatment group who achieved rapid virologic response (RVR) and
      had HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels < 25 IU/mL at all subsequent visits were eligible to
      stop pegIFN/RBV therapy on or after Week 24.
