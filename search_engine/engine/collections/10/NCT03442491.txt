      accounting for more than 125 000 deaths per year across the world. Prompt diagnosis and
      effective action are the cornerstones of management and are crucial to prevent fatal maternal
      haemorrhage.

      The Hayman suture offers the potential advantages that can be applied fast and easy, a key
      point in an emergency situation, and avoids having to perform a lower segment hysterotomy
      when post-partum haemorrhage follows a vaginal delivery, therefore minimising the trauma to
      the atonic bleeding uterus.

      Considering that published data are extremely limited, the aim of our study will be to
      evaluate retrospectively the efficacy of Hayman's Haemostatic Suture for the treatment of
      resistant post-partum hemorrhage resistant to pharmacological therapy.
