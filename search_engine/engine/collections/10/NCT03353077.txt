      alpha radiation mediated treatment with Alpha DaRT seeds for the treatment of Skin Squamous
      Cell Carcinoma (SCC) tumors.

      Treatment will be delivered through radioactive sources (Alpha DaRT seeds) inserted into the
      tumors in the skin. This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation
      of the tumor, as used in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation
      emitting atoms, that will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation
      therapy already used in patients.

      Lesions with histopathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma will be studied.

      Reduction in tumor size 30-45 days after DaRT insertion will be assessed. Safety will be
      assessed by the incidence, severity and frequency of all Adverse Events (AE).
