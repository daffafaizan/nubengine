      temozolomide, we feel this approach may add to the overall efficacy of treatment for the
      following reasons: 1) results with bevacizumab/everolimus in renal cell carcinoma suggest
      there is at least an additive efficacy when these drugs are used in combination; 2) the
      efficacy of single agent temozolomide following standard concurrent radiation
      therapy/temozolomide has not been proven, 3) the use of the three-drug maintenance program
      (i.e., bevacizumab/everolimus/temozolomide) would probably not be tolerated well on a chronic
      basis in this patient population; and 4) the bevacizumab/everolimus combination has potential
      advantages as a maintenance therapy, since it has been well tolerated for many months in
      patients with other malignancies.
