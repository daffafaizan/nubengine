      multidisciplinary team, aims to establish whether silent aspiration can be detected in
      patients with dysphagia (swallowing difficulties), using a microphone array attached to the
      neck (to capture acoustic respiratory changes), pulse oximetry (to detect reduction in blood
      oxygen levels) and respiratory rate analysis, with data combined and analysed via
      post-capture signal processing techniques.

      The project aims to develop equipment and signal processing algorithms to a point where a
      novel intervention has been established that allows semi-automated detection of safe versus
      unsafe (aspiration) swallows. The intervention will be trialled in patients with dysphagia
      within standard videofluoroscopy clinics under clinical supervision. There will be on-going
      development of the intervention and signal processing algorithms during this process. Public
      and patient involvement work will feed back into the design process.

      If the intervention performs successfully in this proof-of-concept study, the investigators
      aim to proceed to a larger clinical trial to determine its sensitivity and specificity as a
      screening tool for aspiration, before final development into a commercial product.
