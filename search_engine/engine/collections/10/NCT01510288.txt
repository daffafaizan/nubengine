      Irradiated allogeneic tumor cells expressing GM-CSF generate a long-lasting and specific
      anti-tumor immunity in preclinical models. Results from several phase I and II trials showed
      Prostate GVAX (GVAX) to be well tolerated and suggested improved survival. Cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a crucial immune checkpoint molecule that
      down-regulates T-cell activation and proliferation. Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal
      antibody (IgG1) that blocks CTLA-4, promotes antitumor immunity, and has been demonstrated in
      two phase III trials to improve overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.
      Pre-clinical studies of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody in combination with GM-CSF secreting tumor
      cell vaccines demonstrated a potent synergy. In this phase I study the investigators examine
      in CRPC patients whether ipilimumab can be safely combined with GVAX. In addition, the
      investigators will treat an additional 16 patients at a dose level of 3â€¢0 mg/kg to determine
      the safety profile and antitumor effects of GVAX and ipilimumab in patients with CRPC.
