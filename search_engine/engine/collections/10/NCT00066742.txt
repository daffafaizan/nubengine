      I. To assess overall survival in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
      treated with induction tirapazamine combined with cisplatin, etoposide and high dose thoracic
      radiotherapy followed by consolidative cisplatin and etoposide.

      II. To assess time to treatment failure calculated from initiation of step 1, response
      (confirmed plus unconfirmed, complete plus partial during induction in the subset of patients
      with measurable disease) and toxicity in this patient population treated with this regimen.

      III. To investigate in an exploratory manner the association of baseline PAI-1, VEGF, OPN and
      NDRG1 plasma markers with patient response and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 10, 12, 29, 36,
      38, and 40; cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and 36; and etoposide IV over 1 hour
      on days 1-5 and 29-33. Beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy, patients undergo thoracic
      radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 7 weeks.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 28 days after completion of radiotherapy, patients with
      stable or responding disease receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 22 and etoposide
      IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 and 22-24.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-85 patients will be accrued for this study within 17 months.
