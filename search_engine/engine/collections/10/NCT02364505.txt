      peculiarities and implemented with a multimedia web-based software.

      The project will be divided in two parts. During the first phase of the project, a standard
      mindfulness-based stress reduction protocol will be modified according to clinical
      peculiarities and specific needs of people with multiple sclerosis. In the meanwhile, a
      multimedia software with these teaching will be developed, so that the training could be
      available online, from home. The protocol and the software will be tested for ergonomics in a
      pilot, qualitative, study.

      In the second phase, a randomized clinical trial will be performed. One-hundred and twenty
      multiple sclerosis patients-caregivers couples will be randomly allocated in the experimental
      or to the control group. Subjects in the experimental group will attend the telemedicine
      mindfulness intervention, while controls will join a psycho-educational telemedicine program.
      At baseline, post-treatment and at a 6-month follow-up, participants will be assessed for
      quality of life, anxiety, depression, quality of sleep and mindfulness level. A subgroup of
      subjects will be assessed with actigraphs, for an objective evaluation of their sleep and
      physical activity. Experimental subjects will be assessed for participation and engagement to
      the treatment. Data will be analyzed with a complex longitudinal design, considering both
      within and between groups comparisons.

      The dissemination process will involve scientific publication on neurological and
      psychological journals, a book, scientific meeting presentations and communication to general
      media. If there will be a positive effect of the mindfulness software, it will be diffused to
      multiple sclerosis clinics and associations.
