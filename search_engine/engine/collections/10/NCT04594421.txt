      eosinophil in peritoneal dialysis effluent during peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis,
      and to explore the relationship between eosinophil increase, peritonitis severity and
      antibiotic use. In this study, 100 patients with peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis
      who meet the inclusion criteria will be selected. Demographic data, laboratory variables,
      peritoneal fluid cytology and bacterial culture will be collected within 24 hours of
      peritonitis (day 1). Peritoneal fluid cytology includes leukocyte classification and
      eosinophilic leukocyte count will be examined at day 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60 and 90 after
      peritonitis. All patients will be followed up for 90 days, and their peritonitis outcome will
      be recorded. The primary endpoint is the prevalence of eosinophil increase in peritoneal
      effluent, which is defined as >100 eosinophils/mm3, or >10% eosinophils of the total
      non-erythrocyte count. Secondary end points are peritonitis outcome at month 1 and 3
      including transfer to hemodialysis , death and continue on peritoneal dialysis.
