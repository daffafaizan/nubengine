mansonia crassipes as the natural vector of filarioids, plasmodium gallinaceumand other plasmodia of fowls in ceylonit would appear from theseobservations that m.crassipes is the natural vector ofp. gallinaceum of fowlsin ceylon and possibly of otherspecies of plasmodium offowls or of related avian hosts.if one of the otherplasmodia from m. crassipes isin fact p. lophuraethen this will be the first recordof p. lophurae fromthis part of the world.  we are,however, not certainwhether the fowl is the naturalvertebrate host ofp. lophurae in ceylon.we have seen crithidial forms inthe midgut of engorgedwild-caught m. crassipes.  thismosquito may, therefore,prove to be the vector of thetrypanosome as well.  thetrypanosome differs fromtrypanosoma gallinarum andt. calmettei which have previouslybeen reported fromfowls.
