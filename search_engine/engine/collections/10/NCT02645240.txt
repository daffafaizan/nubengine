      accurately predict the occurrence of intestinal infraction in patients with mesenteric
      vascular occlusion or ischemia in order to prevent unnecessary surgical intervention in
      patients with just intestinal ischemia and to hasten intervention in patients with actual
      intestinal gangrene.
