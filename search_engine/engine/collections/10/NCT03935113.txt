      problems. Research has shown that the most common consequence of stroke is the paresis of
      limbs.The ability to live independently after a stroke depends on the recovery of motor
      functions,particularly those of the upper limb.The core concept of the Kinesio taping is to
      influence the brain through the sensory input, stimulate the nervous system, and improve the
      motor performance of the stroke patient.
