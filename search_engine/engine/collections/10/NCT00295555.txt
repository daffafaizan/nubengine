      (2-8 mg/day) on 24-h blood pressure and autonomic nervous activity. Hypertensive patients
      with non-insulin-dependent diabetic nephropathy, patients with essential hypertension,
      patients with diabetes mellitus and patients with chronic nephropathy undergo ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring before and after treatment with doxazosin. Simultaneously, spectral
      analysis is performed to calculate the high frequency components as a marker of
      parasympathetic nervous activity, and the low frequency components/high frequency components
      ratios as an index of the sympathovagal balance.
