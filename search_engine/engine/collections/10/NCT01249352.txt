      The study will be conducted in Brazil and has the purpose of determining the activity and
      safety of nimotuzumab in terms of overall survival, TTP, clinical and endoscopic response
      rates, resectability rate, toxicity profile, and quality of life. All participating patients
      will sign a consent form before they undergo any study-related procedure. The eligible
      patients will have locally advanced esophageal cancer, and they will be randomized to one of
      two treatment groups. Randomization will be centrally coordinated by the sponsor and
      performed by means of the electronic CRF itself.
