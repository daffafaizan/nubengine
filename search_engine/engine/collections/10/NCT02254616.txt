      were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 groups: MT+tDCS, MT+sham tDCS, MT, and CI groups. The
      participants in each group receive equivalent amounts of treatment.

      Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for the pretest differences, will be separately
      performed for each outcome measure to test the effects of different intervention groups.
