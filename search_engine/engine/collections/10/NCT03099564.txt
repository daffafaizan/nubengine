    
      If a second Y90 radioembolization treatment is required for bilobar disease, this should
      occur within 4 weeks of the initial procedure (between Cycles 2 and 3 of pembrolizumab). The
      next dose of pembrolizumab should be separated from the Y90 radioembolization by at least one
      week.

      Imaging will be obtained every 9 weeks (after every 3 pembrolizumab treatment) to assess for
      tumor response and to evaluate for progression. Subjects will remain on treatment until
      documented tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal or death.

      Screening Angiography (shunt study):

      During screening, subjects will undergo angiography using technetium-99-labeled
      macroaggregated albumin to detect any uptake outside the liver via measurement of
      hepatopulmonary shunting. Prior to the angiography, a local anesthetic (to numb the area
      prior to catheter insertion) and sedation will be administered to the subject, as per
      institutional standards.

      This procedure is standard of care for subjects prior to Y90 radioembolization, and will be
      performed per institutional site standards. Hepatopulmonary shunting must be < 20% for
      subject to meet eligibility criteria. Subjects will undergo a mandatory tumor biopsy on the
      same day as the screening angiography.

      Prior to administration of the first dose of pembrolizumab (i.e., Day 1 of Cycle 1), repeat
      laboratory tests will be obtained to ensure subject still meets eligibility criteria.

      Pembrolizumab 200mg IV (IV over 30 minutes) every 3 weeks Day 1 per 21 day cycle (3 weeks).

      Prior to administration of subsequent pembrolizumab doses, the following criteria must be
      met:

      ALT and AST:

        -  Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST <2×ULN: ALT/AST < 5×ULN

        -  Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST ≥2×ULN: ALT/AST < 3× the baseline level

        -  ALT/AST ≤ 500 U/L regardless of baseline level

      Total bilirubin:

        -  Among subjects with baseline levels < 1.5 mg/dL: a value of < 2.0 mg/dL

        -  Among subjects with baseline levels that are ≥ 1.5 mg/dL: a value < 2× the baseline
           level

        -  Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL regardless of baseline level

      Y90 radioembolization will be performed as standard of care via institutional standards.

      To be eligible for Y90 radioembolization, the following criteria must be met:

      ALT and AST:

        -  Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST < 2×ULN: ALT/AST < 5×ULN

        -  Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST ≥ 2×ULN: ALT/AST < 3× the baseline
           level

        -  ALT/AST ≤ 500 U/L regardless of baseline level

      Total bilirubin:

        -  Among subjects with baseline levels < 1.5 mg/dL: a value of < 2.0 mg/dL

        -  Among subjects with baseline levels that are ≥ 1.5 mg/dL: a value < 2× the baseline
           level

        -  Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL regardless of baseline level

      In addition, any non-hepatic toxicities from the prior dose(s) of pembrolizumab must have
      resolved to Grade ≤ 2.
