      functional connectivity in the tremor network in ET patients and healthy controls. The fMRI
      data will be acquired in two separate conditions: t-fMRI and rs-fMRI. a. For t-fMRI, patients
      will perform simple repetitive tasks (e.g. finger tapping, hand grasping) to identify
      activation clusters within tremor network. Functional connectivity between the clusters will
      be calculated by creating cross-correlation matrices. A sensitivity analysis will then be
      performed to determine an optimal value of CCT to distinguish ET patients from controls. b.
      For rs-fMRI the hubs within tremor network will be identified with a state-of-the-art
      multimodality atlas. Cross-correlation matrices will be created to calculate measures of
      functional connectivity. A sensitivity analysis will then be performed to determine an
      optimal value of CCT to distinguish ET patients from controls. 2. To study changes in
      functional connectivity in the tremor network before, immediate postoperative and and
      24-hours after FUS-T in ET patients. a. The CCT will be calculated and compared between
      baseline, immediate postoperative and 24-hours post-operative conditions to determine the
      effect of FUS-T. For this sub-aim the connectivity data will be separately analyzed for
      t-fMRI and for rs-fMRI. b. The CCT in immediate postoperative and 24-hours post-operative
      condition among ET patients will be compared to healthy controls to determine whether FUS-T
      restored the abnormal connectivity in tremor network. For this sub-aim the connectivity data
      will be separately analyzed for t-fMRI and rs-fMRI.
