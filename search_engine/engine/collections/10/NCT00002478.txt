      advanced ovarian epithelial or cervical cancer. II. Evaluate the frequency and severity of
      observed adverse effects in this patient population treated with prolonged oral VP-16.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive etoposide by mouth once daily on days 1-21 every 4 weeks. Patients
      with responding disease continue treatment for up to 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease continue treatment for up
      to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 4-6 responses are observed in the first 25 patients, an additional 15
      patients will be entered. The estimated duration of the study is 8 months.
