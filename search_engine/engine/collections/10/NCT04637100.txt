      concealed. The experimental group will consist of the subject utilizing their personal mobile
      or tablet device to play a pre-selected set of problem-solving games for a goal of 1 hour
      daily. The control group will utilize their personal mobile or tablet device to perform the
      non-problem-solving task of watching educational videos of their choice from a pre-selected
      set of videos for the same amount of time daily. The intervention gaming arm will be provided
      different gaming apps if they lose interest or find a particular game too easy or too
      difficult. The control video arm will be provided different educational videos according to
      their needs that may change throughout their inpatient stay.
