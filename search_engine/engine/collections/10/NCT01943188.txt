      I. Conduct a safety and feasibility study of stereotactic radiotherapy with autologous T-cell
      infusion for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression free survival at one year. II. Determine the overall survival at
      one year.

      OUTLINE:

      STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY (SBRT): Patients undergo standard of care SBRT over 1-2
      weeks according to tumor volume and location.

      LYMPHODEPLETION: Beginning 3 weeks later, patients receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) for 3 days.

      REINFUSION OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMC): Within 3-14 days of completing
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide, patients undergo autologous PBMC infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week, 4 weeks, and monthly
      thereafter.
