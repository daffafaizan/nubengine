      with [18F]-choline (18F-choline is not mandatory) should be available for comparison.
      Diagnostic [68Ga]RM2 will be injected intravenously into the subjects, and PET/CT imaging
      performed. Images will be assessed visually and quantitatively. Subjects should be scheduled
      for subsequent prostatectomy within 4 weeks after PET scan.

      Prostate cancer will be confirmed by histopathological step-section analysis following
      prostatectomy and used as Standard of Truth. Based on the results of the initial 30 patients,
      an expansion cohort of 50 patients for Part 2 will be enrolled to increase the safety and
      tolerability database and to further characterize the uptake of [68Ga]RM2 in specific
      subsets.
