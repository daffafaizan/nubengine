      prevalent, serious, and often unrecognized breathing disorder resulting from repeated upper
      airway collapse, decreased oxygen levels, and a very high risk of life threatening
      complications at the time of surgery. Current guidelines recommend using regional as opposed
      to general anesthesia in SDB patients to minimize risks and the use of strong narcotic
      medications. It is unclear whether interscalene block in use for analgesia (pain relief) may
      actually worsen the severity of SDB by invariably freezing the phrenic nerve, thereby
      temporarily paralyzing the diaphragm.

      This novel clinical trial will examine whether or not ISB increases the rate of upper airway
      obstruction or collapse during sleep and other dangerous postoperative complications seen in
      patients with SDB following shoulder surgeries.

      The Primary Objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of ISB on the oxygen
      desaturation index (sleep apnea severity) in untreated SDB patients undergoing ambulatory
      shoulder surgery compared to patients who do not receive ISB.

      Secondary Objectives are: 1) To evaluate the impact of hemidiaphragmatic paresis on
      impairment in pulmonary function; 2) To evaluate the impact of impairment in pulmonary
      function on the oxygen desaturation index (ODI); 3) To assess the incidence of important
      perioperative clinical outcomes such as hypoxemia, recurrent respiratory events, delayed
      discharge, and resource utilization in SDB patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder surgery
      compared to patients who do not receive ISB; and 4) To assess important analgesia related
      outcomes such as: time to onset of pain, intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption,
      hourly and daily VAS pain scores, opioid related side effects, patient satisfaction with
      analgesia, and presence/absence of nerve block complications.
