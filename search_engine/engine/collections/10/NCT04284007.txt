      an adjuvant for peripheral nerve blocks.

      The investigators compared the effect of perineural versus intravenous dexamethasone on the
      prolongation of the action of levobupivacaine in ultrasound guided interscalene block for
      shoulder and upper arm surgeries.

      The study hypothesized that adding perineural dexamethasone to levobupivacaine in ultrasound
      guided interscalene block may be more superior to adding intravenous dexamethasone to
      levobupivacaine and levobupivacaine alone in shoulder and upper arm surgeries as regard
      analgesic effect, duration of analgesia and hemodynamic stability.
