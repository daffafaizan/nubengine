      survival. Areas of new blood vessel growth, or neovascularization, such as with trauma or
      tissue ischemia, appear to release factors that stimulate production of endothelial cells
      from progenitor stem cells located in the bone marrow. Endothelial cells for the inside
      lining of blood vessels are important in the formation of viable and functional blood vessel
      conduits. Recent work suggests that tumors-including primary brain tumors-secrete many of the
      same stimulatory growth factors as normally incite endothelial cells to be produced and
      turned out into the circulation. Initial evidence suggests that these circulating endothelial
      progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the impressive neovascularization seen with tumors. In
      this study, we wish to investigate the interaction of gliomas and EPCs to elucidate a
      potential role for EPCs in tumor formation, response to therapy, progression, and overall
      survival, as well, to identify potential new targets for anti-tumor and/or anti-angiogenic
      therapies using genomic and proteomic techniques.

      Patients suspected of having, or with prior biopsy proof of, a WHO grade II-IV central
      nervous system (CNS) glial tumor(s) seen in the Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, will be
      considered for entry into this study. Tissue samples of tumor resected as part of standard
      care will be collected at surgery and preserved for research. Blood samples will also be
      collected. Blood will also be collected from anonymous normal volunteers who donate blood at
      the NIH Blood Bank; these anonymous donors will serve as controls.
