      forms of migraine have a multifactorial and polygenic pattern of inheritance and genetics
      research is crucial for a deeper understanding of migraine mechanisms. Recently, 12 genetic
      loci have been identified to be associated with migraine with (MA) and without aura (MA) in
      four large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The functional consequences of these
      genetic loci in humans are yet unknown.

      Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide which plays a crucial role in the
      pathophysiology of migraine and is present in migraine relevant structures. CGRP can induce
      migraine attacks in MO patients via an adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent pathway and
      CGRP antagonism is efficient in the treatment of migraine attacks. Also, a recent study has
      showed that intracellular accumulation of cAMP is crucial for the induction of migraine
      attacks. However, CGRP does not cause migraine attacks in familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM),
      an autosomal dominant subtype of MA.

      The phenotype of the migraine inducing effects of CGRP might therefore be linked to some of
      the 12 genetic susceptibility loci that have been identified. One of the genetic loci
      (rs13208321) is located in a gene (FHL5) that is associated with the regulation of
      cAMP-responsive elements.
