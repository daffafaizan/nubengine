        -  To determine the rate of pathological complete response in women with operable
           triple-negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant bevacizumab, docetaxel, and
           carboplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV, docetaxel IV, and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeat
      every 3 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
