      I. To show that indocyanine green (ICG) (indocyanine green solution) is equal to both
      isosulfan blue (ISB) and technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid (TSC) and will allow all lymph node
      mapping to occur in the operating room (OR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive peri-tumoral, intradermal injections of isosulfan blue and indocyanine green
      solution. During surgery, patients undergo identification of the sentinel lymph node and
      imaging using a laser with videocamera (SPY Elite camera).
