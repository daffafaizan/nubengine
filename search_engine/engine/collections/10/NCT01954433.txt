      cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) are taking an increasingly
      important role. Over recent years, economic evaluations gained interest in orthopedics,
      suggesting the inclusion of economic factors in addition to traditional outcome measures in
      the evaluation of surgical interventions.

      This is a prospective mono-center observational study involving three independent patient
      groups (Total shoulder prosthesis for arthritis (TSA), Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff
      tears (RCR), Trapeziectomy for Trapeziometacarpal Osteoarthritis (TMC OA)) of 150 patients
      each. Before-and-after comparisons will be made: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility data
      collected post-operatively up to one (TMC OA) and two years (TSA and RCR) will be compared
      with those collected up to one year pre-operatively. Eligible patients unwilling to receive
      surgery will be followed-up for one and two years, respectively, to allow for a parallel
      comparison group.
