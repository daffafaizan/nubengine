      mortality. Non selective beta-adrenergic blockers are effective at preventing first time
      variceal bleeding and re-bleeding. The efficacy of these drugs depends on the magnitude of
      reduction in portal pressure after administration, which varies widely between patients.
      Studies have shown that a reduction in portal pressure (as measured by HVPG) to 20% from
      baseline or to values â‰¤ 12 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) is associated with a low residual
      risk of bleeding . Patients with such a reduction are considered to be "responders" to beta
      blocker (BB) therapy. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to
      therapy and need to be prescribed to an alternative therapy. The clinical application of this
      observation is limited since it requires a repeated HVPG measurement,which is not feasible in
      most cases. A non-invasive breath test that can assess portal pressure in correlation to HVPG
      and allow efficient management of patients at risk, could be very useful.
