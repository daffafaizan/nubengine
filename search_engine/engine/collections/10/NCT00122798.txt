      a high volume stroke hospital and to compare the results with national and international
      data.

      Methods: 204 consecutive stroke patients are analyzed in a prospective study in a single
      center teaching institution. The intervention consists of a structured therapeutic chain of
      290 collaborating GPs, a standardised acute hospital proceeding overlapping with an early
      integrated neurovascular rehabilitation within the same institution. Primary endpoints
      include death and dependence at 6 months, secondary endpoints are the length of hospital stay
      (LOS) and the quantitative analysis of physical and psychosocial impairments. The data are
      directly compared with the same endpoints of the Swiss subgroup of the international stroke
      trial (IST) and recent international data.

      Results: At 6 months, mortality is significantly lower with 12 % (compared to 23 % in the IST
      trial) and only 39 % (67 %) of the patients are dead or dependent. Stroke severity is similar
      as in other study populations. Median LOS is 15 days in the acute clinic and 39 days in the
      rehabilitation institution. The psychosocial outcome compares favorably to a matched control
      group.

      Conclusions: A structured chain of acute stroke treatment overlapping with an early
      integrated rehabilitation is superior compared to national and international ischemic stroke
      trial data.
