      dihydrochloride). We hope to learn whether treatment with Kuvan® is safe and effective in
      improving the ability of the stomach to relax after eating and improving the symptoms of
      diabetic gastroparesis. Women are selected as a possible participant in this study because
      they have diabetes and moderate to severe gastroparesis (meaning stomach empties slowly).
