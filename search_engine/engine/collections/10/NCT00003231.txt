      with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. II. Assess the clinical and pathological response
      rate to this therapy in this patient population. III. Compare the benefit of surgery in terms
      of overall survival of responding and nonresponding patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive infusions of docetaxel over 1 hour on day 1, followed by infusions
      of cisplatin over 1 hour on days 1-2. Treatment is repeated for three 21 day courses.
      Patients undergo tumor resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Patients are to
      receive postoperative radiotherapy within 4 weeks of resection if the tumor reaches the
      resection margins and/or the first mediastinal lymph node levels are involved. Patients will
      be followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 5-40 patients will be accrued within 3 years.
