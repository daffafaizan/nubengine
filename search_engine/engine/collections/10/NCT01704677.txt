    
      Two-year results of the Norwegian TDR study were published in BMJ in May 2011 (Hellum et al).
      The current protocol is 8-year follow-up of patients included in the Norwegian TDR study.

      Hypothesis of the 8-year follow-up:

      Main hypothesis (H0): There are no differences in change between TDR and REHAB for pain and
      disability measured by Oswestry Disability Index (main outcome), back pain, quality of life,
      psychological variables, work status, patients satisfaction, drug use, urinary incontinence,
      and back surgeries after 8 years.

      Secondary Hypothesis:

        1. There are no differences in incidence and degree of disc degeneration at adjacent level
           or facet joint degeneration at index level between groups (radiological analysis).

        2. There is no association between baseline characteristics, pelvic anatomy / sagittal
           balance (defined by lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt, pelvic incidence angle and sacral
           slope), and clinical outcome after TDR.

        3. There is no difference in cost effectiveness between surgery and REHAB 8 years after
           inclusion to the study.

      Statistical analysis:

      The investigators will use the same analysis as for 2-years results: two-way ANOVA, mixed
      model, regression analysis. p<0.05 will be considered statistically significant

      Additional analysis (not conducted at 2 years):

        1. cross-overs will receive last value before cross-over/fusion surgery

        2. survival analysis

        3. pelvic anatomy / sagittal balance (defined by lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt, pelvic
           incidence angle and sacral slope) will be included in the predictor analysis

        4. Both CT scans and MRI are taken for the evaluation of index level facet arthropathy
