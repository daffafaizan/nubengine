      I. To compare the toxicity profiles within 4 weeks of surgery of oxaliplatin and mitomycin C
      delivered via Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in patients with peritoneal surface
      malignancies from primary appendiceal tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the time to progression in patients treated with oxaliplatin vs. mitomycin C
      delivered via Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for surface malignancies from primary
      appendiceal tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients undergo surgical cytoreduction and receive mitomycin C by hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).

      Arm II: Patients undergo surgical cytoreduction and receive oxaliplatin by HIPEC.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36
      months.
