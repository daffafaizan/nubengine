      of quality of care. Together with the advance in research and medicine there should be a
      trend towards mortality reduction, however actual data in Czech Republic are not well
      documented. The aim of this retrospective cohort trial was to evaluate the mortality of
      paediatric intensive care patients admitted to Department of paediatric anaesthesiology and
      intensive care between two periods 2008-2012 and 2013 and 2017. The patients records was
      retrospectively searched and the mortality was adjusted according to the primary admission
      diagnosis.
