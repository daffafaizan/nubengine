744. studies on protein and nucleic acid metabolism in virus-in-fected mammalian cells.  the formation of a virus-specificantigen in krebs ii ascites-tumour cells infected with ence-phalomyocarditis viruskrebs ii mouse ascites-tumor cells infectedwith encephalomyocarditis virus werefound to contain, in addition to mature virus,a virus-specific protein antigen.  anassay, based on the ability of this antigento block the neutralization of purified virusby its specific antiserum, was developed.this antigen was present both in the cul-ture fluid 17 hr. after the infection of cellswith virus and intracellularly, where itstiter increased at a time when viral capsidprotein was being synthesized.  within thecell, it was mostly localized in the solublecell sap.  in contrast with virus, the anti-gen did not agglutinate sheep erythrocytes,and its immunological properties weredestroyed by digestion with trypsin.  ribonucleicacid was not detected in concentrat-ed preparations of the antigen, nor was the titerof antigen affected by ribonuclease.the antigen had a sedimentation coefficient (20 )of approx. 14s, and its diffusion co-efficient, determined by the method of allison andhumphrey (1960), was 3.2 x 10-7sq. cm. sec.-1.  the particle weight of the antigenwas hence 420,000   40,000.  thecapsid protein from purified encephalomyocarditisvirus could be degraded by treat-ment with ethanolamine into a protein of sedimentationcoefficient (20 ) of approx. 4s.the 14s antigen, when similarly treated, yieldeda protein of similar size.  however,no such smaller antigen was detected in virus-infectedcells.  it is concluded that thenon-hemagglutinating antigen represents a polymericform of the basic viral capsid-protein molecule and that it is synthesized in thecytoplasm of infected cells.  it maybe either an intermediate or a by-product in theprocess of viral capsid-protein syn-thesis.
