      of 50 participants over a two-year period. For each enrolled participant, a TEG transfusion
      algorithm will be followed for patients exhibiting inadequate hemostasis in the operating
      room (Flowchart 1). Once patient has a normal TEG result with adequate hemostasis, either
      heparin or bivalirudin will be used as the anticoagulant. If patients are receiving no
      anticoagulation or heparin anticoagulation then a second TEG algorithm will be followed in
      the ICU when hemostasis is normal and heparin is introduced (Flowchart 2). If patients are
      receiving bivalirudin as their anticoagulation strategy, the transfusion parameters with TEG
      application will not apply. In addition to determining the compliance and feasibility of
      following these TEG algorithms, clinical outcome data including transfusion rates, types of
      blood products transfused, estimated blood loss and thrombotic events will be collected for
      every enrolled patient until they are discontinued from ECMO. Statistical analysis of the
      primary, secondary and tertiary endpoints of this study will determine the likelihood of
      exploring future clinical trials involving TEG-driven coagulation and transfusion management
      of the ECMO population.
