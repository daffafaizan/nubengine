    
      Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children is the most common chronic glomerular disease. The
      first line of therapy is prednisone and about 90% of the patients will

      response to this treatment. The course of the disease is characterized of

      recurrent relapses and repeated prednisone therapy. While prednisone doses and

      therapy duration in the disease diagnosis has been based on multiple prospective

      studies, the dose and therapy duration in the relapses was never challenged in a

      prospective control study.

      To address this question we designed prospective 3 arm study to evaluate the

      effective of exception steroid regiment to treat relapses versus lower doses.

      The study population is children in the age 2-18 year old with steroid sensitive nephrotic
      syndrome.

      After relapse will be diagnosed based on physical exam and urine tests, the

      patients will randomize to receive prednisone doses that are 60/m2 or 45/ m2 or 30/ m2.

      A measurement of time to obtain remission, duration of remission est. will be collected.

      We plan to recruit 100 children in this study.
