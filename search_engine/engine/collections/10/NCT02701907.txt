      alteration (mutation, amplification or deletion) in genes (i.e. mutation, amplification,
      deletion) identified as causally implicated in cancer. A low level of genomic alteration is
      defined by the presence of less than the 5th quantile of genomic alterations to be expected
      in the given tumor type. Conversely, a high level of genomic alteration is defined by the
      presence of more than the 5th quantile of genomic alterations to be expected in the given
      tumor type.

      The list of genes for which alterations are identified as causally implicated in cancer is
      defined by the Cancer Gene Census. This is an ongoing effort to catalogue those genes for
      which mutations, amplifications or deletions have been causally implicated in cancer. It is
      constantly updated by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (UK) and available at:
