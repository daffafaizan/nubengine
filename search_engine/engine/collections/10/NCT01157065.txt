    
      The study consisted of a Screening Visit (Visit 1), a Day 0 visit (Visit 2), 6 on-therapy
      visits at Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 (Visits 3-8), and an Exit Visit at Week 12 (Visit
      9). Patients who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria at Visit 1 were randomized in a 3:1
      ratio to receive either AL-78898A or LUCENTIS as a single 50-Î¼L injection in the study eye.
      Additionally, patients received standard therapy for exudative AMD beginning at Week 2/Visit
      5 if the patient was not improving per protocol-specified criteria. Beginning at Week 4/Visit
      7, patients not improving received standard therapy for exudative AMD at the investigator's
      discretion.
