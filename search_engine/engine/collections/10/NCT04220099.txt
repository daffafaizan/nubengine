      that would predict Electroconvulsive Therapy(ECT) Response in Schizophrenia (SZD). The
      investigators will recruit 30 SZD patients who are preparing for ECT treatment and assesse
      psychotic symptoms using Positive and Negative symptom scale(PANSS) before and after
      8-sessions clinical course of ECT treatment. These patients needed ECT treatment are assessed
      by clinicians according to American Psychiatric Association(APA) guidelines. Meanwhile
      resting EEG will be recorded for 10 minutes before the first episode of ECT treatment.
      Decrease of PANSS scores will be calculated after the last session of ECT treatment to
      distinguish responder/non-responder.
