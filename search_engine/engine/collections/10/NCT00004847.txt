    
      Pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare and clinically important
      chromaffin cell tumors that typically arise from the adrenal gland or from extra-adrenal
      paraganglia, respectively. The clinical features and consequences of PHEO/PGL result from the
      release of catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine). An undetected PHEO/PGL poses a
      hazard to patients undergoing surgery, childbirth, or general anesthesia, due to the
      potential for excess catecholamine secretion, which can result in significant, often
      catastrophic outcomes. Diagnosing and localizing a PHEO/PGL can be challenging. Plasma and
      urinary catecholamines as well as their metabolites and radio-iodinated
      metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning can yield false-positive/negative results in patients
      harboring the tumor. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lack
      sufficient specificity. The molecular mechanisms by which genotypic changes predispose to the
      development of PHEO/PGL remain unknown - even in patients with identified mutations.
      Moreover, in patients with hereditary predispositions, PHEOs/PGLs differ in terms of their
      growth, malignant potential, catecholamine phenotype, responses to standard screening tests,
      various imaging modalities and therefore subsequently, different therapeutic options. This
      protocol focuses on developmental, molecular, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomics,
      immunologic and other types of studies to investigate the bases for predisposition to develop
      PHEOs/PGLs and for expression of different neurochemical and other phenotypes and malignant
      potentials including therapeutic responses. Furthermore, this protocol will also use new
      imaging approaches, for example [18F]-6F-dopamine ([18F]-6F-DA),
      [18F]-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine ([18F]-FDOPA), and [68Ga]-DOTA-Tyr-octreotate ([68Ga]-
      DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, as well as PET/MRI scanning and dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI.
