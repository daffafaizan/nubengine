      treated with the EndoStim LES Stimulation System. The primary objective is to provide a tool
      for participating physician investigators to collect and analyze outcomes data related to the
      use of the EndoStim LES Stimulation System.

      This is a prospective, multi-center patient Registry. Sites may choose to also
      retrospectively enroll previously treated patients (after obtaining informed consent) and
      enter retrospective data into case report forms paper or on-line.
