      challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Necessary protective equipment as FFP-mask and face
      shields impair communication significantly. Digital enhanced approaches to maintain team
      communication during endoscopic procedures are mandatory not only in actual circumstances.

      Materials and methods:A prospective, two-armed interventional study will be performed at an
      endoscopy unit at a tertiary center. 200 endoscopic examinations (EGD, colonoscopy, EUS,
      ERCP) were randomly assigned (1:1) to a group that was performed with DECT equipped endoscopy
      team or with standard communication. All examinations were performed under protective
      equipment. Primary outcome was rate of communication associated adverse events. Secondary
      outcomes included team subjectively perceived comfort with DECT enhanced communication during
      endoscopic work, duration of examinations, SAE.
