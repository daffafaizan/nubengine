      Subject is screened, undergoes leukaphereses, and optional rectal biopsy, and safety
      evaluations before dosing. The University of Pennsylvania manufactures the study product.

      Step 2:

      Subjects receive a single infusion of 0.5-1x10(10) CD4 CAR+CCR5 ZFN modified T cells. Cohort
      2 participants undergo a mini-leukapheresis and optional rectal biopsy at the end of step 2.

      The duration of Step 2 will be:

        -  Cohort 1: 1 day

        -  Cohort 2: 8 weeks

      Step 3:

      All subjects will participate in a 16 week analytical treatment interruption (ATI). ATI will
      be less than 16 weeks if patient's viral load is sustained >100,000 or CD4 count <350 or less
      than 50% of baseline. At the end of step 3 all participants will undergo mini-leukapheresis
      and optional rectal biopsy.

      Step 4:

      Participants who have HIV viral loads â‰¤1000 copies/ml will continue in an extension of the
      analytical treatment interruption until viral load is sustained >100,000 or CD4 count <350 or
      less than 50% of baseline.

      Step 5:

      Reinitiation of antiretroviral therapy with monthly visits until the HIV RNA is below the
      limit of quantification. All participants undergo a mini-leukapheresis and optional rectal
      biopsy at the end of the step 5.

      Step 6 (Secondary Follow-up):

      All subjects will be followed for safety for up to 5 years post-infusion.
