      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma of the
           retroperitoneum or pelvis treated with surgery with vs without preoperative
           radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicity and complications associated with these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the rate of microscopically complete surgical resection in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the overall survival rate of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor
      grade (low [G1] vs intermediate [G2] vs high [G3/4]), tumor size (< 15 cm vs â‰¥ 15 cm), and
      tumor histology (liposarcoma vs non-liposarcoma). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgery.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo preoperative radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5.5
           weeks. Within 28-63 days after the completion of radiotherapy, patients undergo surgery.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 28 days, 4 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually for
      5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 370 patients (185 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4.5 years.
