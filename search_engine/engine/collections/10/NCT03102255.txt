      four spaces from these nasal turbinates, but the two spaces separated by the upper nasal
      turbinate are too narrow to be clinically meaningful. So when performing nasotracheal
      intubation, the tube enters one of the two spaces in low part divided into the lower
      turbinate. The middle turbinate, unlike others, a large number of blood vessels and nerves
      are distributed. Therefore, less hemorrhage might occurs when the tracheal tube enters into
      the lower pathway below the lower turbinate because the tube would not scratching the middle
      turbinate.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the method 'sniffing position and nasal tip lifting'
      increases possibility to enter into lower pathway when the tube enters the nasal cavity. The
      purpose of a present study was to investigate the effect of 'sniffing position & nose' on the
      intranasal route of the tube.
