      defense mechanism against vascular injury, mediating vascular tone, vascular structure, and
      blood-vessel wall relations. Endothelial dysfunction marks the occurrence of cardiovascular
      injuries and is a critical step in the development of cardiovascular disease. Individuals
      with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and this
      may be related to poor blood vessel function. Interventions to improve blood vessel function
      in CKD are needed. Exercise training has been shown to improve blood vessel function in older
      subjects and those with heart disease but this has not been investigated in CKD. The National
      Kidney Foundation recommends exercise for dialysis patients to reduce cardiovascular risk
      however there is very little data regarding the benefits of exercise in earlier stages of
      CKD. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of 12 weeks of exercise training on
      blood vessel function in moderate to severe CKD.
