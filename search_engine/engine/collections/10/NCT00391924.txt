      autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS).
      Uncontrolled studies suggested that the administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may
      improve such complaints. The aim of our randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study is
      to examine the effect of daily oral 200 mg DHEA on fatigue, well-being, and functioning in
      women with SLE or pSS.
