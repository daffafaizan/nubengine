      people who have advanced solid tumor and/or lymphoma malignancies. This study will look at
      the quantitative characterization of the mass balance, metabolic pathways, and rates and
      routes of excretion of TAK-659.

      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. The study will consist of 2 periods:
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study period and optional
      post-ADME study period. In ADME study period, participants will be assigned with
      [14C]-TAK-659 100 milligram (mg). After completion of ADME study period, participants may
      choose to continue in the optional post-ADME study period to receive TAK-659 100 mg.

      This single center trial will be conducted in Netherlands. The overall time to participate in
      ADME study period will be 14 days and if participants choose the option to continue in the
      post-ADME study period, the maximum duration of participation will be 12 months, unless in
      the opinion of the investigator and sponsor the participant would derive benefit from
      continued treatment beyond 12 months. Participants will be followed up to 28 days after last
      dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs
      first.
