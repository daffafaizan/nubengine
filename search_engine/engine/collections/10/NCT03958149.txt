      a second neck scan where the participant is wearing a spinal collar. Experts will analyse the
      scans for measurements of angulations. In addition the study will collect demographic data
      and results from a validated patient questionnaire assessing comfort wearing the spinal
      collar.

      The hypothesis:

        1. The shape of the neck is different when comparing the young and old populations

        2. The spinal collar does not alter the shape of the spine

        3. The spinal collars are uncomfortable in the elderly population
