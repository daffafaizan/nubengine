      They are each given for one year. The following four combinations are tested in four groups
      of patients:

        -  Group A: Cyclosporine in a normal dosage, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and
           corticosteroids

        -  Group B: Daclizumab in the first two months after transplantation, cyclosporine in a
           lower dosage compared to group A, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids

        -  Group C: Daclizumab in the first two months after transplantation, tacrolimus in low
           dosage, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids

        -  Group D: Daclizumab in the first two months after transplantation, sirolimus in a low
           dosage, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids.

      All drugs of the four immunosuppressive regimes are approved by the Health Authorities in the
      participating country for use in kidney transplantation. The regimen administered to the
      patients in Group A represents a standard treatment, currently given with success to many
      transplant patients in a number of countries in the world. The treatments in Groups B, C and
      D are experimental in the sense that either the doses administered are lower than the ones
      used before and/or the combination of drugs is experimental. Nevertheless, there are results
      of scientific studies indicating that they are all effective alternatives and that they might
      have advantages compared to the standard immunosuppressive regimen, in particular as far as
      their safety (side effects, long-term toxicity) is concerned. However, from the previous
      clinical experience, it is not yet clear which regimen offers the most advantages for the
      patients. To find this out, in SYMPHONY the four regimens are administered to the four groups
      of patients (A-D) and the results in the different groups will be compared.
