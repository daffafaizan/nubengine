      sustaining improvements in complex systems.1 By definition, CQI engages frontline staff in
      iterative problem solving using plan-do-study-act cycles of learning, with decision-making
      based on real-time process measurements. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) has
      sponsored Breakthrough Series (BTS) Collaboratives since 1996 to accelerate the uptake and
      impact of quality improvement. These collaboratives are typically guided by evidence-based
      clinical practice guidelines, incorporate change methodologies, and rely on clinical and
      process improvement subject matter experts. Organizations have been adopting the
      collaborative model, and there is a growing literature on its positive impact. This
      collaborative approach to healthcare improvement has appealing face validity but lacks
      definitive evidence of its effectiveness. A recent derivative of collaboratives has been
      deployment of tool kits for quality improvement. Intuition suggests that such tools kits may
      help to enable change, and, thus some agencies advocate the simpler approach of disseminating
      tool kits as a change strategy. We sought to compare the collaborative model with the tool
      kit model for improving care. Recommendations and guidelines for central line-associated
      bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention have not
      been implemented reliably, resulting in unnecessary ICU morbidity and mortality and fostering
      a national call for improvement. Our study evaluated the effects on care processes and
      outcomes of a multi-institutional quality improvement initiative focused on preventing CLABSI
      and VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU).
