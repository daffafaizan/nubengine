      training program (gatekeeper training) in medical school students in Winnipeg, Manitoba,
      Canada. The main objective of the current proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      gatekeeper training program, Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), in
      improving medical students' intervention skills with suicidal patients compared to training
      as usual. Secondary aims include comparisons of changes in knowledge, perceived competence
      and attitudes around suicide.

      Findings from previous studies have demonstrated a significant positive effect of gatekeeper
      training on suicide prevention attitudes, skills and knowledge. As well, general studies in
      medical education reveal that students who have been able to practice, observe, and receive
      feedback in small groups showed an improvement in skills and confidence over those who were
      given didactic teaching only. Therefore, the investigators anticipate that the ASIST training
      program will significantly improve medical students' knowledge about suicide intervention,
      and will increase their recognition and response to suicide risk compared to education as
      usual. The investigators also expect that ASIST training will help them to understand the
      impact of attitudes on suicide prevention, and will increase their perceived competence and
      ability to recognize and treat a suicidal individual compare over training as usual. It is
      hypothesized that medical students trained in ASIST will differ significantly in their
      ability to correctly recognize and intervene with suicidal individuals based on their use of
      a standardized suicide intervention model and objective assessment using standardized
      patients.
