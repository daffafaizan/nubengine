    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To investigate the safety and efficacy of clofarabine combined with pegaspargase in
           patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the first phase of the
           study. (Phase II)

        -  To investigate, in terms of minimal-residual disease (MRD), the cytotoxic efficacy of
           clofarabine compared with high-dose cytarabine in combination with pegaspargase in these
           patients. (Phase III)

        -  To compare the incidence of infectious complications after the administration of
           daunorubicin hydrochloride versus doxorubicin hydrochloride during reinduction.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the safety profiles of clofarabine and pegaspargase versus high-dose
           cytarabine and pegaspargase in these patients.

        -  To compare, in terms of MRD, the efficacy of clofarabine and pegaspargase and high-dose
           cytarabine and pegaspargase, respectively, versus methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and
           asparaginase in study GER-COALL-07-03, the historical control group (retrospective
           comparison).

        -  To determine the influence of MRD-based stratification in COALL-09 on overall survival
           and event-free survival in a historical comparison of previous COALL studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, sequential phase II/III study. Patients are stratified to low
      risk (LR) or high risk (HR) depending on peripheral white blood cell count on diagnosis, age
      on diagnosis, and immunological subtype. Patients undergo 2 randomizations (1 during
      intensification and 1 during reinduction) in the study.

        -  Preliminary treatment: All patients receive daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours
           on day -7 and methotrexate intrathecally (IT) once on day -9, -8, or -7.

        -  Induction: All patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; daunorubicin
           hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, and 15; and oral prednisone 3-4 times daily
           on days 1-28.

      Patients are assessed for minimal-residual disease (MRD) status after induction phase.
      Patients not in remission on day 29 are treated off study. Patients with LR disease are
      further stratified to LR-reduced (LR-R), LR-standard (LR-S), and LR-intensified (LR-I)
      groups; patients with HR disease are further stratified to HR-reduced (HR-R), HR-standard
      (HR-S), and HR-intensified (HR-I) groups. Patients in the LR-R and HR-R groups do not undergo
      randomization during study.

        -  Intensification (randomization 1): Patients receive therapy according to risk and
           disease subtypes. Some patients in different risk group are randomized* to receive
           high-dose (HD) cytarabine and pegaspargase or clofarabine and pegaspargase.

             -  LR-R and LR-S: Patients receive medium-high-dose (mHD) methotrexate IV over 24
                hours on days 50, 64, and 78; etoposide phosphate IV over 1-2 hours and cytarabine
                IV over 1 hour on day 66; oral mercaptopurine on days 50-56 and 78-120; oral
                thioguanine on days 64-70; and methotrexate IT on days 29, 50, 64, and 78. Patients
                in LR-S group who still have a detectable MRD load on day 29 are randomized
                (randomization 1) to 1 of 2 arms to receive cytarabine and pegaspargase vs.
                clofarabine and pegaspargase.

        -  CNS therapy: All patients with initial CNS involvement undergo cranial radiotherapy for
           a total of 12 or 18 Gy. HR patients (precursor B-cell ALL with initial WBC count ≥
           200/nL and T-cell ALL with initial WBC count ≥ 100/nL) with no initial CNS involvement
           also undergo cranial radiotherapy for a total of 12 Gy, beginning 2-3 weeks after the
           last dose of HD cytarabine or clofarabine. LR patients and HR patients (precursor B-cell
           ALL with initial WBC count < 200/nL and T-cell ALL with initial WBC count < 100/nL) with
           no initial CNS involvement do not receive initial cranial radiotherapy. At the beginning
           of CNS therapy, before cranial radiotherapy, HR-I patients receive vincristine IV on day
           1; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on day 1; oral dexamethasone 3 times daily
           on days 1-7; and pegaspargase IV over 2 hours on day 7.

      methotrexate IT and oral mercaptopurine daily during the 4 weeks between intensification and
      reinduction.

        -  Reinduction (randomization 2): Patients undergo reinduction immediately after completion
           of interim therapy. Patients in LR-S, LR-I, HR-S, and HR-I groups are randomized to 1 of
           2 arms (doxorubicin hydrochloride vs. daunorubicin hydrochloride)

             -  LR-S: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, oral dexamethasone on days
                1-14, pegaspargase IV over 2 hours on day 9, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on
                day 22, cytarabine IV or intramuscularly (IM) on days 23-26, oral thioguanine on

                     hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 8.

             -  LR-R and HR-R: Patients are not randomized. They receive vincristine IV on days 1
                and 8, oral dexamethasone on days 1-14, pegaspargase IV over 2 hours on day 8, and
                methotrexate IT on days 1 and 15.

             -  LR-I, HR-S, and HR-I: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 22, and 29;
                oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-14 and 22-35; cyclophosphamide IV over 30
                minutes on days 43 and 57; cytarabine IV or IM on days 43-46 and 57-60; oral
                thioguanine on days 43-49 and 57-63; and methotrexate IT* on days 1, 22, and 43.

                     hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 22, and 29.

      NOTE: *Patients who underwent cranial radiotherapy do not receive methotrexate IT.

        -  Maintenance: Beginning 2-3 weeks after reinduction, all patients receive oral
           mercaptopurine daily and oral methotrexate weekly for 2 years. Except for LR-R and HR-R,
           patients also receive pegaspargase IV over 2 hours every 3 weeks for 3 doses. Patients
           who have not undergone CNS radiotherapy receive methotrexate IT at 3, 6, and 9 months.

      Blood and bone marrow samples may be collected periodically for research studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months
      for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 high-risk patients will be accrued for phase II, 296
      patients for the first randomization (phase III), and 396 patients for the second
      randomization will be accrued for this study.
