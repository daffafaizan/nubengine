           is choline-selective, and signals from water and lipids are suppressed simultaneously.

        2. Compare to different methods for choline quantification. The first method is
           quantification through an external phantom standard, containing a known concentration of
           choline. The other method is based on the utilisation of internal water signal as a
           reference.

      Both calculations can be performed from the same MR exam. Ten patients will be included in
      the study.
