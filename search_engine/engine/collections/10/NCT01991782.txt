    
      Patients who are over the age of 18 years with closed fractures treated at Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center by the Orthopaedic Trauma Department will be recruited into the
      study into one of two arms: a telemedicine arm in which the patient will have some of his or
      her visits conducted through video calls, and a control arm in which all of the visits for
      the patient will be in-person at the Vanderbilt University Orthopaedic Trauma Clinic.
      Comparisons between the two groups will be made through surveys administered to the patients
      half-way through the study and at the conclusion of the study, and comparisons will be made
      using standard statistical tests. The feasibility of telemedicine as a medium for follow-up
      visits in lieu of in-person visits will be assessed in this study.
