      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. The FDA (the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Lorlatinib as a treatment for any disease.

      All participants in this study will receive Lorlatinib. Lorlatinib targets the abnormal ALK
      or ROS1 proteins in NSCLC cells. Lorlatinib has been tested in other research studies and
      results show that the medicine may help to control the growth of NSCLC even after it has
      spread to the CNS. The CNS is a term used to refer to the brain and spinal cord, including
      the lining of the brain and spinal cord which is called the meninges.

      In this research study, the investigators are trying to determine whether lorlatinib is
      effective in controlling the growth of cancer cells after they have spread to the CNS.
      Another purpose of this study is to determine why the cancer cells that have spread to the
      participant CNS have continued to grow despite treatment with other drugs. For this reason,
      blood samples will be collected as part of this study to assess the DNA released by the
      participants cancer cells into their blood when the cells travel to other sites in their
      body.
