      Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS) in an inpatient female psychiatric population and to
      identify characteristics associated with JPFS in this population. We chose to explore two
      primary hypotheses. Because of the common link between adult fibromyalgia and anxiety and
      depression, we hypothesize that those with JPFS will score higher on measures of these
      symptoms. Given the adult literature on the suspected link between physical and or sexual
      abuse and adult fibromyalgia, we also hypothesized that adolescents who meet criteria for
      JPFS will have higher rates of sexual and physical abuse.

      The other specific aim of this study was to determine the short- and long-term impact of an
      intervention on reduction of JPFS symptoms. The intervention was a psychoeducational seminar
      on JPFS (pain management, diet, exercise and sleep hygiene) followed by a relaxation
      technique (audio-guided CD). The control group was involved in an educational seminar on skin
      care (WITHOUT relaxation technique). Study measures were obtained immediately before and
      after the intervention/control seminars (short-term) and 8 weeks after discharge (long-term).
      Each group was discharged with a CD player and CD with relaxation technique or skin care
      seminar. Participants recorded the use of the CD's and completed follow up questionnaires 8
      weeks after discharge from the hospital.
