      phase II dose of eniluracil, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin in patients with previously
      treated advanced colorectal cancer. II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of eniluracil and fluorouracil. Patients receive
      oral eniluracil and oral fluorouracil twice daily on days 1-21. Patients receive oxaliplatin
      IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response are treated with 2 more
      courses and then therapy is stopped. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      eniluracil and fluorouracil until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose (RPTD) is defined as 1 dose level below the
      MTD. Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study, and an
      additional 27-40 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study.
