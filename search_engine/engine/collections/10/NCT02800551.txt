    
      Rationale: Radiation therapy is an effective palliative treatment for painful spinal
      metastases. A sub-group of patients with mass-type spinal metastases, a factor associated
      with poor local metastasis control, require treatment optimization ensuring durable pain
      control and metastatic tumor control.

      Proposed solution: To intensify (escalate) radiation dose using simultaneous integrated boost
      with image-guided hypofractionated SBRT for painful mass-type spinal metastases in a
      randomized controlled trial. Two experimental fractionation regimes will be tested in the
      study depending on presence or absence of epidural involvement. Dose intensification is
      expected to achieve long-term pain control and long-term palliation as well as long-term
      local metastatic tumor control without adding toxicity as compared to conventional
      fractionation regimes with conventional radiation therapy.

      The study will be carried out as multinational, multicentre phase II clinical controlled
      trial enrolling patients with painful mass-type spinal metastases who are eligible for
      radiation therapy without surgery. This study additionally includes a prospective
      observational arm for patients not eligible for randomisation who are treated in analogy to
      arm A of the randomised arm.
