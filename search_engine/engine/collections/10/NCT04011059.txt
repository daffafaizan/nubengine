      previous myocardial infarction and a viable myocardial zone with indications for coronary
      artery bypass grafts. Twenty patients will be included in each treatment arm over 36 months.
      One group will undergo revascularization surgery, extracellular matrix patch placement and
      injection of cell culture medium; the other group will undergo revascularization surgery,
      extracellular matrix patch placement on the epicardial surface with cultured WJ-MSCs and
      injection of WJ-MSCs around the infarcted zone.

      The allocation of treatments will be defined by block sizes of 2, 4 and 6, randomly
      determined by a random number generator (ralloc, Stata Co. 8,2). This assignment will only be
      known by the tissue bank that will deliver the syringes with the solution to be administered
      and the epicardium patches to the study participants.
