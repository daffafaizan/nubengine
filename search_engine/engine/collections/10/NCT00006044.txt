        -  Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of exogenously administered testosterone
           in patients with progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer who have been in
           castrate state either surgically or pharmacologically for a minimum of 1 year.

        -  Assess the changes in expression of androgen receptor and other receptors in human
           biopsy specimens or circulating tumor cells before and after this treatment in this
           patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive testosterone via an enhanced absorption transdermal system continuously for
      28 days. The transdermal patches are changed daily.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive a fixed daily dose of testosterone with escalating duration
      of exposure until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed at day 1 and at weeks 2 and 4.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
