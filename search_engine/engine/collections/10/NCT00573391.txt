      in subjects with advanced multiple myeloma. There is also research that shows this drug may
      be even more effective when used in combination with other drugs that have been used to treat
      myeloma for many years (melphalan, thalidomide, and dexamethasone). This study is being done
      to find out if the combination of VelcadeTM with melphalan and dexamethasone (VMD) will be as
      effective, or even more effective as it is in combination with thalidomide and dexamethasone
      (VTD).
