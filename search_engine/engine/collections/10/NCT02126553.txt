      I. To assess relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      treated with lenalidomide maintenance therapy after achieving remission.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival (OS) of patients with AML treated with lenalidomide
      maintenance.

      II. To assess event-free survival (EFS) of patients with AML treated with lenalidomide
      maintenance.

      III. To assess the duration of remission (CRd) of patients with AML treated with lenalidomide
      maintenance.

      IV. To assess toxicity and safety of lenalidomide maintenance in patients with AML.

      V. To assess the effects of lenalidomide maintenance on natural killer (NK) cell modulation
      and dynamics of minimal residual disease and their relationship to outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.
