      Arm of the study.

      Home Visit Arm:

      This interdisciplinary home visit program consists of 4 visits to patients' homes over the
      course of one year from a team of a movement disorders doctor, a nurse, a research
      coordinator, and a social worker. The team will come to a patient's home and assess the needs
      of both the patient and caregiver (if present), and connect the patient with any needed
      services. These visits can replace or be in addition to seeing another movement disorders
      doctor.

      Usual Care Arm:

      The information collected from the home visit participants will be compared to data collected
      from participants who elect to complete the usual care arm of the study. These participants
      and their caregivers (if available) will be invited to complete an online version of the
      survey. They will be contacted 12 months after their initial completion of the survey to
      complete a follow-up survey.
