      interventions and their upstream approach to improving health and well-being. Many such
      lifestyle interventions address health risk nonpharmacologically and present participants
      with the opportunity to change their overall trajectory of health. Exercise interventions are
      of particular interest based on evidence of numerous physical and mental health benefits. Our
      target population in the Running Against Prehypertension Trial (RAPT) was people with upper
      range prehypertension. By adopting and maintaining a running program, these individuals who
      are at a high risk of hypertension can avoid a lifetime of medication and chronic disease.
      The objective of RAPT was to collect feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy data
      over a 12 week period on a running program aimed at teaching a natural running form called
      ChiRunning that used the mindful movement principles of Tai Chi. By using this natural
      running form, participants may increase satisfaction and decrease rates of injury towards
      greater adherence to the program. Participants were randomized to one of three study arms: 1)
      intervention, 8 weeks of group training in form focused ChiRunning; 2) active control, 8
      weeks of group training focused on conventional running excluding form; or 3) usual care, a
      self-directed training with educational materials.
