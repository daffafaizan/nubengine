    
      This is a 48-week matched, prospective, observational, cohort study of HIV-infected adults on
      antiretroviral therapy who actively use heroin or who have never used heroin. The overarching
      goals are 1) to define the extent and specifics of immune activation in HIV-infected IV
      heroin users; 2) to define the effect of IV heroin on gut integrity and permeability, and the
      relationship of gut integrity alteration and immune activation; 3) importantly, to study the
      reversibility of immune activation, inflammation, and gut dysfunction after cessation of IV
      heroin, and to that effect, compare strategies for medication assisted
      treatment-buprenorphine/naloxone versus methadone or vivitrol maintenance; 4) to study if
      heightened immune activation associated with active intravenous drug use (IVDU) is associated
      with higher cardiovascular disease risk, including endothelial dysfunction and arterial
      inflammation, and if these effects are reversible with buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone.
