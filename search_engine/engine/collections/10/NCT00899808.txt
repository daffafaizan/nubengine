      Primary

        -  Determine local-regional control in patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer, as
           a function of expression of specific molecular/genetic markers.

      Secondary

        -  Determine complications of radiation therapy for patients undergoing radiation therapy
           for cancer.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed using immunohistochemical staining
      and other molecular/genetic study methods to detect markers, including p53, cyclin D1,
      HER-2-neu, bcl-2/BAX, and EGFR. Patient charts are also reviewed with emphasis on
      local-regional relapse.
