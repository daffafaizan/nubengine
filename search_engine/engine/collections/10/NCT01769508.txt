    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, Phase II study with a lead-in safety cohort. The study
      will evaluate the combination of 5-Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and Lapatinib with radiation
      therapy as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with previously untreated localized HER2
      positive esophagogastric adenocarcinomas. Approximately 12 patients will be enrolled in the
      lead-in cohort to evaluate the safety of the combination. Following the lead-in cohort, Phase
      II will commence and up to 30 additional patients may be treated. The starting doses will be
      administered as follows:

      5-FU 225 mg/mg2 continuous intravenous (IV) infusion Days 1 - 42 during XRT; Oxaliplatin 85
      mg/m2 Days 1, 15 and 29, given by IV infusion, per institutional standard; Lapatinib
      Continuous PO daily dosing during XRT (final dose determined during lead-in cohort).
