      Recently, device-detected SDB events showed a correlation with sleep-disordered breathing
      (SDB) diagnosed by polysomnography. Thus, CIED will facilitate early detection and monitoring
      of SDB in patients with CIEDs. Few studies investigated prognostic value of CIED-detected SDB
      in risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, the primary aim is to determine whether
      device-detected SDB are associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or other
      cardiovascular morbidities using a prospective multicenter registry.
