      management (CBSM) program that will be delivered via mHealth through smartphones and tablets
      (optimized for each). All CBSM content will be integrated into the application, but tailoring
      of information delivery will be derived through algorithm-driven feedback based on user input
      as they respond to integrated assessment and symptom monitoring questions. As a result, users
      of the CBSM-Self Management Intervention (CBSM-SMI) will receive personalized, relevant
      intervention content, when they need it, where they need it. This novel mode of CBSM delivery
      has not yet been provided via an mHealth format to HIV-infected individuals, despite its
      obvious advantages insofar as cost and reach are concerned.
