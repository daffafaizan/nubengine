      incidence is increasing worldwide.Resection of the primary ICC tumor site within the liver
      represents the best curative treatment option. However, the role of lymphadenectomy (LND) at
      the time of surgery remains controversial with some centers considering it standard while
      other surgeons perform LND only in select circumstances. The utilization of LND may not only
      vary among different institutions, but also by geographic region. Specifically, data from
      East and West centers have noted a variation in the utilization of LND ranging 27%-100%.While
      several case series from Asia have noted that most centers do not regularly perform LND,other
      data from the West suggest that LND may be becoming more routine. Despite the lack of
      consensus among surgeons, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging manual
      recommends that the nodal basin be staged. Disease-specific staging for ICC was first
      introduced in the 7th edition of the AJCC staging manual published in 2010. The newly updated
      8th edition of the AJCC staging system now recommends that 6 lymph nodes be evaluated to
      stage a patient with ICC.

      The previous multi-institutional retrospective study from the investigators have showed an
      increasing adoption of LND among patients undergoing curative resection for ICC during the
      last decade. The current prospective and randomized study based on a multi-institutional
      collaboration would investigate whether routine LND would benefit patients in short- and
      long-term survival remains.
