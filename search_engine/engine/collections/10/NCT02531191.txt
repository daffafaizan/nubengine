    
      This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, 2-way crossover designed study. Forty
      non-elderly healthy male subjects will receive an ASP015K small tablet or an ASP015K current
      tablet in each period under fasted conditions. If the bioequivalence between two tablets
      cannot be demonstrated because of an insufficient number, an add-on subject study will be
      conducted as needed. The design of the add-on subject study will be the same with that of the
      initial study.
