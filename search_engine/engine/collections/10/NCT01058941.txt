      limited effects on improving the clinical course of AD. The exponential rise in the
      prevalence, incidence, and cost of care for AD make finding therapeutic agents that can
      either prevent AD or delay disease progression an urgent health care need. Since
      inflammation, lipid dysregulation, and insulin resistance have each been associated with AD
      pathology, the combination of lipoic acid plus fish oil has the potential to maximize
      therapeutic benefit by acting on all three mechanisms associated with disease pathology.
