    
      The Sinovation Laser Ablation System uses robot-assisted, precise, high-intensity laser light
      to initiate necrosis of abnormal brain tissue through thermal ablation while limiting injury
      to adjacent healthy tissue. MgLiTT has the advantages of precision, minimal invasive
      procedure and real-time thermal monitoring.

      Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria and sign the informed consent form will
      undergo the MgLiTT procedure. Subjects, or their caregivers, are required to keep a seizure
      diary throughout the study, beginning after surgery. The study will monitor and record
      subjects' seizure frequency, antiepileptic medications, and physical and emotional health.

      Subjects treated with Sinovation Laser Ablation System will have at least 9 months of
      follow-up. Throughout study participation, the study investigator will continuously monitor
      and document both effectiveness and safety data at study appointments.
