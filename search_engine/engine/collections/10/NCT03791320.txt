      which offline computation of vFFR is compared to conventional invasive, wire based FFR
      measurements. Pressure wire based FFR will be performed in patients with at least one
      intermediate coronary lesion at the discretion of the operator (typically defined as a
      coronary artery lesion with a diameter stenosis of 30-70% by visual assessment). A total of 3
      two-dimensional angiography images, will be recorded and exported to the CAAS workstation 8.0
      (Pie Medical Imaging, Maastricht, the Netherlands): two orthogonal views to create a 3D
      reconstruction of the coronary arteries and one view to ascertain the position of the FFR
      pressure wire. vFFR will be calculated automatically, by using the invasively measured aortic
      root pressure. vFFR measurements will be performed online by the different centers. In
      addition, all angiographic imaging data will be sent to an independent core laboratory
      (Cardialysis, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) for offline analysis.
