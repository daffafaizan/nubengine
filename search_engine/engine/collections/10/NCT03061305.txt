      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens for molecular profiling and a test report will be
      provided back to the investigator. For those participants identified as having molecular
      alterations associated with a Strata-affiliated therapeutic clinical trial and/or approved
      targeted therapy or trials, the Strata reports will provide additional relevant information.

      All molecular profiling will be performed in the Strata Oncology CAP-accredited and
      CLIA-certified laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI). The molecular profiling assays will include
      tumor-only comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) by next generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA
      and RNA covering a range of actionable genomic alterations, such as mutations (e.g. those in
      EGFR and BRAF), copy number alterations (e.g. ERBB2 amplifications), gene expression, gene
      fusions (e.g. ALK fusions), tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability
      status, and may include additional integrative DNA and RNA tests over time.

      Participants may be followed for treatment changes and survival for three years from the time
      of enrollment and/or signed informed consent.
