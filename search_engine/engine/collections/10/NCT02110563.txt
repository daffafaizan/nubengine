      infusion, once weekly for 2 weeks followed by a rest week (3 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients
      with either solid tumor malignancies, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma that have
      not responded to previous treatment. The highest safe dose of DCR-MYC that can be
      administered will be identified. In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, potential
      pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the antitumor activity of DCR-MYC will be evaluated.

      There will be 2 expansion cohorts at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or highest safe dose
      identified for further study which may be lower):

        -  Biopsy Cohort: 6 patients, tumor biopsies to be performed pre-dosing and Cycle 2/Day 11;
           same assessments as dose escalation cohorts

        -  PNET Cohort: Up to 20 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; same assessments
           as dose escalation cohorts, however fewer PD (cytokine) assessments and no PK
           assessments
