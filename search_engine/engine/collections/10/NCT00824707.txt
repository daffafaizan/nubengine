      East-Asian countries.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with 70-90% of PLC cases
      in China. PLC can develop during any stage of the natural course of chronic HBV infection and
      anti-virus therapy should be considered during the management of PLC. However, there is no
      definite guide on when or how to practice the anti-virus therapy, especially in unresectable
      or inoperable PLC. Because of these facts, research on the significant of the anti-virus
      therapy in the HBV-related PLC is urgently needed.

      200 patients will be randomly assigned to anti-virus therapy group and control gruop.The time
      to progression(TTP) and overall survival within two years will be used to evaluate the effect
      of anti-virus therapy on PLC.

      The aim of this study is to research the efficacy and significant of the anti-virus therapy
      in the unresectable HBV-related PLC so as to establish treatment standards of anti-virus
      therapy in PLC.
