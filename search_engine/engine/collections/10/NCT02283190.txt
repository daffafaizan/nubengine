      Erwinaze has been already used in clinical practice for treatment of patients with acute
      leukemia with known side effect profile. For this reason, in this protocol, we use the
      "3+3+3" design for evaluation of safety based on pre-determined dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLT). In the "3+3+3" design, the dose escalation rules proceed by adjusting the dose in
      cohorts of 3 to 9 patients per three dose levels:20,000 IU/m2 (dose cohort -1), 25,000 IU/m2
      (dose cohort 0), 30,000 IU/m2 (dose cohort +1). The goal is to determine the Recommended
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)

      For anti-leukemic activity:

      To evaluate the activity of Erwinaze to reduce the serum glutamine to the desired level, the
      dose will be adjusted according to a pre-defined algorithm based on 48-hour trough serum
      glutamine level (biochemical response) prior to dose 6 of each patient. If the safety profile
      is acceptable, we will enroll up to a total of 15 patients at that dose level to better study
      and analyze the glutamine-reducing effect of Erwinaze at the defined dose.

      In summary, if 9 patients are treated at a certain dose and at least 7 out of 9 individuals
      respond to treatment (per serum glutamine levels) and < 3 develop DLT, this dose level will
      be declared the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Six additional patients (total of 15 to 18
      patients) will be enrolled at the RP2D level to better assess toxicity and to document
      responses.

      There will be no intra-patient dose escalation or reduction.
