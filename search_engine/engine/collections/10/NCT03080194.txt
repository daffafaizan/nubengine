      violence risk under the government supervision will be enrolled in the study. A
      community-based long-acting antipsychotics-treated management model will be applied to the
      experimental group, which means that professional psychiatrists will provide guidance to
      primary-level mental health workers on the psychotic treatment, and monthly-injected
      long-acting antipsychotic, paliperidone palmitate, will be used in the schizophrenia
      treatment. Every subject in experimental group will be equipped with an intelligent robot
      capable at push-to-talk and push-to-view, allowing the patients and caregivers to contact
      doctors for assistance at any time, if they are able to use smart phones.

      The subjects in experimental group will be injected with 150mg eq and 100mg eq paliperidone
      palmitate in the deltoid at the 1st and 8th day, and afterwards a flexible dose of
      paliperidone palmitate from 75 to 150mg eq will be administrated monthly according to
      clinical judgement. Previous oral antipsychotics could be continued or withdrawn in 2-4 weeks
      after first paliperidone palmitate administration according to doctors' clinical judgement.
      Doctors have rights to decide whether a patient needs in-hospital treatment or extramural
      hospital treatment. The study protocol does not limit other medication or treatment measures
      except the injectable paliperidone palmitate. Other medication or treatment measures should
      be decided according to doctors' clinical judgement and negotiation with patients and
      guardians.

      Subjects in control group will be treated with oral antipsychotics or other conventional
      medication.
