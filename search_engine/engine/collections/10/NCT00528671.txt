      risk of developing thromboembolic events and improves long-term survival compared with
      international normalized ratio (INR) control by a general practitioner. Low-dose INR
      self-management (INR values of 1.8.-2.8 for aortic valve recipients and 2.5 - 3.5 for mitral
      or double valve recipients) does not increase the risk of thromboembolic events compared to
      conventional dose INR self-management. Even in patients with a low INR target range, however,
      the risk of bleeding events is still higher than the risk of thromboembolism. We therefore
      perform a prospective, randomized trial in 1,800 patients with mechanical heart valve
      replacement. During the first six postoperative months, low dose INR self-management will be
      performed by all patients (INR measurement once a week). Thereafter, 600 patients will
      continue with this treatment regimen, whereas the other 1,200 patients with perform very low
      dose oral anticoagulation. Out of these 1,200 patients, 600 will perform INR measurement once
      a week and 600 patients will perform INR measurement twice a week. Patients are followed up
      for 24 months.
