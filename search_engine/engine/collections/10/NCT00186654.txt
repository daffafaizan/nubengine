      include two types of acupuncture treatment and perinatal massage. The two acupuncture
      treatments are delivered in a double-blind fashion. Treatments consist of an acute phase
      during which participants receive 12 treatment sessions over a period of 8 weeks. Responders
      and partial responders enter a continuation phase during which they receive weekly treatments
      that end 10 weeks post delivery. At the end of the continuation phase, participants continue
      to be clinically assessed at 3 and 6 months after the end of treatment to detail the natural
      course of relapse to the index episode in the three treatment groups.
