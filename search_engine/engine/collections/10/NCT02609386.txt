      diagnosed, untreated, surgically resectable squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Regimen 1: IRX-2 + cyclophosphamide
      + indomethacin + zinc + omeprazole, or Regimen 2: cyclophosphamide + indomethacin + zinc +
      omeprazole.

      The primary study hypothesis is that the Regimen 1 with IRX-2 prolongs event-free survival
      and overall survival when compared to Regimen 2 without IRX-2.

      Subjects will be randomized to either Regimen 1 or Regimen 2 on a 2:1 basis and treated prior
      to surgery.
