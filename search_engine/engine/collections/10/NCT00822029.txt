      iterative fractures. Classical treatments include physiotherapy, assisted verticalisation by
      orthesis and correct feeding with vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Yet this isn't
      always sufficient and isn't always possible.

      Bisphosphonates, which have been used for years in the treatment of post-menopausic
      osteoporosis or of osteogenesis imperfecta in children, can turn out to be very useful for
      non-walking children with cerebral palsy.

      Studies have been published since 1994 in this indication with encouraging results. Cyclic
      intravenous administration of bisphosphonates every 3 months showed an objective increase in
      bone density and a decrease in pains and fractures after one year of treatment. Cyclic
      intravenous administration nevertheless requires the use of an implanted chamber and
      iterative hospitalizations. Oral administration should allow to treat these children, who
      already have many treatments, in a simpler way.

      The study will concern 40 non-walking children with cerebral palsy aged over 10 years.
