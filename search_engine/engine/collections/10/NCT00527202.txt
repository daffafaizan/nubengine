      will include 30 patients. Botulinum toxin injection will be injected intradermally in the
      painful area (one single injection) following a method adapted from that used in
      hyperhidrosis. The patients will be followed for 6 months after the injection. Primary
      outcome will be self-reported pain from the patients diaries. Secondary outcomes will be
      neuropathic symptoms, quality of life, allodynia to brush and pressure, detection and pain
      thresholds, proportion of responders, pain relief and clinical global impression. Clinical
      assessment will take place before injection then at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.
