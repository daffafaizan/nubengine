      the individual and generates enormous costs for society. Several forms of psychotherapy have
      been found to be effective in the treatment of depression. Among these, behavioral activation
      has a strong empirical base. The efficacy of behavioral activation for treating major
      depressive disorders has been established in a number of studies over the last four decades.

      Moreover face-to-face treatments could benefit from using smartphones as an adjunct to the
      regular sessions, which in the case of behavioral activation treatments for depression could
      facilitate activity scheduling and homework, which are crucial elements of the treatment. It
      may also be possible to reduce the number of sessions.

      Since it has been shown that full behavioral activation is an effective treatment for mild to
      moderate depression, this study will be designed as a so-called non-inferiority study in
      which the treatment group, given fewer meetings face-to-face, but instead support in the form
      of a smartphone application. Instead of a traditional behavioral activation treatment of 10
      sessions, the treatment group will be given four face-to-face CBT sessions and a smartphone
      app as a complement and support to the four sessions. As a control, the investigators will
      give full behavioral activation with 10 sessions of face-to-face therapy.
