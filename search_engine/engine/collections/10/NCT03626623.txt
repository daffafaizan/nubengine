    
      This is a prospective, two-armed, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing
      Cytal Wound Matrix 1-Layer intervention to standard of care (SOC) intervention in patients
      presenting with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Up to one hundred and fifty patients recruited
      from US based medical centers and randomized (using a 2(active):1(control) randomization
      scheme) to receive either Cytal Wound Matrix 1-Layer intervention or standard of care
      intervention.Complete wound closure incidence, wound healing rates, wound recurrence, and
      various health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes will be compared between study arms.
      Additionally, a cost effective analysis (i.e. direct and indirect costs) and review of
      individual and group changes in narcotic prescription patterns will also be evaluated. While
      incidence of wound closure rates will be evaluated through 12 weeks, protocol defined patient
      follow-up is for two years.

      Data will be captured for remaining study objectives during these two years. An independent
      biostatistician will review all participant data for power and futility analysis. In
      addition, a clinical events committee (CEC) will adjudicate all adverse events (AEs) and
      serious adverse events (SAEs).
