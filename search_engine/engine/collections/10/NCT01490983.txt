    
      This is a randomized, controlled pilot study to introduce eMedonline telemonitoring
      technology to CML patients taking Gleevec or Tasigna. eMedonline will be used to
      automatically collect time-dose specific medication data for individual patients, including
      dosing times, missed doses, adverse events and e-diary data. All data will be available to
      research staff for remote review via Web interface. Adverse events and non-adherence will
      prompt interventions including supportive care counseling.
