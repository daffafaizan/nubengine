      Different types of medication are used for treatment of ischemic heart disease. One of
      recently developed drugs is trimetazidine. Although it clinical benefits are clear, mechanism
      by which this occurs is as yet undefined. In few animal studies authors try to define what
      effects trimetazidine has on both fatty acid and glucose metabolism in heart. Data collected
      from human cardiomyocytes are rare. Available data suggest that trimetazidine may act as a
      potent inhibitor of beta oxidation, with no significant effect on glucose oxidation.

      Objective:

      Primary objective: collection of mitochondrial respiration data using human heart ventricular
      samples. Secondary objective: define possible differences in mitochondrial respiration
      depending on preoperative trimetazidine usage.

      Methods:

      Regularly scheduled patients for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery who accept to
      participate in study will be enrolled in further protocol. Patients with inclusion criteria
      and without exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. At the end of operation,
      surgeon will take biopsy sample of left ventricle for mitochondrial function and metabolic
      activity analysis.
