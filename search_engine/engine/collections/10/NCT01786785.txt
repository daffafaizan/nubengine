      the top 10 causes of mortality in children. After stroke, there is a disturbance in cerebral
      blood flow (CBF) autoregulation, and changes in head position may change CBF. Currently,
      practice at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to keep the head of bed (HOB)
      of a child with AIS flat for 24 hours; however, there is no evidence that this practice is
      efficacious in children. Furthermore, maintaining a child supine for 24 hours is
      uncomfortable for the child and is often unenforceable in younger children. This study will
      use a noninvasive optical technique to measure CBF as HOB position is changed to assess the
      effectiveness of head of bed position in increasing CBF in children with acute arterial
      ischemic stroke.

      The primary objectives are to determine the difference in CBF at HOB flat (0 degrees) and HOB
      at +30 degrees in healthy children and in children with AIS. The secondary objectives are to
      examine CBF in healthy children and in children with AIS at other HOB angles (0, +15, and +30
      degrees) compared to the CBF at HOB 0 degrees and to determine if the position that maximizes
      CBF varies over time from stroke onset.
