      orthopaedists can perform large numbers of such surgeries. Thus, we aim to find out if there
      is value of having surgeons with AR fellowship training to perform primary total knee
      arthroplasty. This has an implication in the direction of the training of future AR surgeons
      and in the distribution of operative cases.
