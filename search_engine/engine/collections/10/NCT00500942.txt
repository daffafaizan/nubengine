      on a 0-10 scale. For those who participate in the study, these numbers will be used to
      calculate average pain levels. Study participants will be asked to complete the same 0-10
      pain scale during the recovery period until time of discharge or admission to the hospital.
      According to standard criteria when giving conscious sedation, patients will remain in a
      communicable state throughout the procedure and during the recovery period prior to
      discharge, and thus, will be able to express a pain level during these times. The same
      questionnaire will be given for seven days after the procedure, which will be completed on a
      self-addressed, stamped postcard to be mailed back to UTMDACC. The last postcard will have a
      couple of questions about patient satisfaction. Once the last postcard is mailed in, the
      patient's participation in the study is over. Each questionnaire should take less than 5
      minutes to complete.

      This is an investigational study. About 374 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at UTMDACC.
