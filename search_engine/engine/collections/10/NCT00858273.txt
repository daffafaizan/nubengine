    
      Forty adolescents with T1D will undergo a measurement of blood glutathione concentration and
      markers of oxidative stress (plasma protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine, and urinary 8OH-2-dG, and
      F2-isoprostane excretion, markers of oxidative damage to protein, DNA and lipids,
      respectively) while at near normoglycemia, on two separate occasions:

        -  first, when in poor glucose control (HbA1c>7.5%); and

        -  secondly, after 3 to 9 months months of improved blood glucose control, along with the
           administration of either a placebo, or a mixture of antioxidant minerals and vitamins
           based on a randomization scheme.

      Between the two metabolic study days, patients will receive the same intensified diabetes
      regimen consisting of education and counseling, home blood glucose monitoring, multiple daily
      insulin injections (MDI), diet plan, and frequent phone contact with a certified diabetes
      educator.
