      options to include self-testing for young women, their peers and their sex partners, and by
      facilitating linkage to care. In this study the investigators proposed two phases. The first
      phase, previously completed, is formative and involved two parts: 1) conducting formative
      qualitative research to understand perceptions of HIV testing and HIV self-testing in the
      study population and 2) conducting observed HIV self-testing to better understand any
      challenges with self-testing and the materials needed to make the process clear. The second
      phase of the study is a randomized controlled trial where the investigators will randomize
      approximately 400 young women to receive either 1) CHOICE of self-testing or clinic-based HIV
      Counseling and Testing (HCT) or 2) clinic based HCT. Once young women have been randomized,
      they will be asked to recruit up to 4 peers or male sex partners to test with the method of
      their randomization group.
