    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess and compare progression free survival (PFS) between gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride)/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine and compare overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

      II. Determine and compare the safety profile of gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine
      alone regimens.

      III. Assess and compare PFS at 6 months between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine
      alone arms.

      IV. Determine and compare the clinical benefit rate (CBR) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970)
      and gemcitabine alone arms.

      V. Determine and compare the duration of response (DOR) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970)
      and gemcitabine alone arms.

      VI. Determine and compare cancer antigen (CA)125 reduction by >= 50% between
      gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and gemcitabine alone arms.

      VII. Determine and compare overall survival (OS) between gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) and
      gemcitabine alone arms.

      VIII. Determine the ORR for subjects in the gemcitabine alone arm who cross over to the
      gemcitabine/M6620 (VX-970) arm.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients experiencing disease progression may crossover to Arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride as in Arm I and ATR kinase inhibitor M6620
      IV over 60-90 minutes on days 2 and 9. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
