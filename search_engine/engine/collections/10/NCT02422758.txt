      nursing staff. Despite advances in the development of new technologies for the prevention of
      perioperative hypothermia, this event still happens in the operating room of the health
      services To prevent patient's body temperature loss, passive and active cutaneous warming
      methods can be used. Passive methods prevent loss of body heat through the heat transfer
      block, as blankets, clothes and cotton sheets; however, there is evidence to show that
      although assist in maintaining body temperature, passive methods alone are not effective.

      Active warming methods are effective in keeping the perioperative normothermia. Among the
      different technologies available we emphasize the circulating water mattress, the forced air
      warming system and the carbon fiber resistive heating blankets.

      Based on these and due to the lack of research in the Brazilian reality on effective measures
      for the prevention of perioperative hypothermia, among these, prewarming, and the finding
      guided by the professional experience that just directed investment for the maintenance of
      body temperature patient in the perioperative period, in health services, justified the
      conduct of this study.
