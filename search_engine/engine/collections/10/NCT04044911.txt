      daily living (ADLs). Occupational therapy has been effective in improving ADL performance,
      however, inclusion of multiple tasks means it is unclear which therapy elements contribute to
      improvement.

      This trial evaluates the efficacy of a task model approach to ADL rehabilitation, comparing
      training in making a cup of tea with a stepping training control condition.

      Stroke survivors with AADS participate in a cross-over randomized controlled study.
      Participants attend five 1-hour tea making training sessions in which progress is monitored
      and feedback given using a computer-based system which implements a Markov Decision Process
      (MDP) task model (CogWatch). In a control condition participants receive five 1-hour stepping
      sessions.

      Analysis compares tea making training with stepping training effects on error reduction and
      time taken in making 4 different tea types. A complex tea preparation task (making two
      different cups of tea simultaneously) is used to test for generalisation of training effects.
