      pathophysiological significance. However, the left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony has a
      detrimental effect on LV systolic and diastolic functions in heart failure patients. The
      effects of LV dyssynchrony on cardiac sympathetic activity are not yet fully understood.
      Dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of severe chronic heart failure. Cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a disease modifying device-driven treatment that can
      reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. However, this type of
      treatment does not lead to the expected results in 25% to 30% of patients despite the
      successful implantation of a CRT device. In addition, CRT is associated with high cost and
      potential morbidity. Therefore, the search for new highly informative criteria for selecting
      patients for this type of treatment remains a relevant task of modern medicine. It is
      expected that the results obtained will complement and expand current state of knowledge
      regarding the relationships between cardiac remodeling processes and the state of cardiac
      sympathetic activity. In addition, obtained data will allow to predict LV remodeling dynamics
      after the correction of contractile dysfunction of the heart.
