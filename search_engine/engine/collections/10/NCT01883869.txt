      points to an important role for platelets in inflammation and immunity. Platelet activation
      and sequestration in pulmonary tissue is a key feature in inflammatory or infectious states
      such as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Platelets may mediate acute
      lung injury (ALI) by recruiting neutrophils, triggering neutrophil extracellular DNA nets,
      and releasing granule contents and microparticles. Anti-platelet therapy in this setting may
      prevent platelet activation, platelet - leukocyte aggregate formation, and inflammation.

      The objective of this pilot study is to determine if ticagrelor therapy in individuals with
      pneumonia reduces markers of platelet activation, platelet-leukocyte aggregates,
      inflammation, acute lung injury, and lung mechanics. Because the benefit of anti-platelet
      therapy may the greatest in patients with more significant lung injury, the investigators
      will enroll patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospitalization or
      patients with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) within 48 hours of diagnosis. On study day 1,
      subjects will be randomized to receive ticagrelor (180 mg load and 90 mg BID) or placebo.
      Study medication (ticagrelor or placebo) will be administered twice daily on days 2 - 7 or
      until hospital discharge, if sooner than 7 days. Blood will be collected and assays performed
      on day 1 prior to study medication administration (baseline), day 2, 3, 7, day of discharge
      (if before 7 days), and 30 days for analysis of platelet count, markers of platelet
      activation, platelet - leukocyte interactions, biomarkers of inflammation, and measurements
      of lung mechanics.
