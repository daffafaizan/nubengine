    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) related to the combination of sorafenib tosylate
      (sorafenib) + pembrolizumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time to tumor progression in patients who received the combination therapy of
      sorafenib + pembrolizumab compared to historical data on sorafenib only treatment in patients
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain data on changes in immune cell function and in the tumor microenvironment pre-
      and post-treatment to screen for potential biomarkers that may be able to predict clinical
      benefit.

      - All patients will be followed for survival

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -28 to -1 and 1-21.
      Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      up to 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.
