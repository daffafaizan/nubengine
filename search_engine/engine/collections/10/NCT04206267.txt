      premolar extractions as a treatment modality were included to the study. The patients were
      divided into two groups, 8 in control and 11 in the study. The subjects assigned to study
      group were applied suplementary vibrational forces for 20 min/daily. 3-dimensional digital
      models were generated just before canine distalization and after space closure by 3Shape
      TRÄ°OS R700 (3Shape Inc., Copenhagen, Denmark) device. The linear measurements between molars
      and canines were evaluated. The results were assessed with SPSS 23.0 programme (lBM SPSS
      Statistics for Windows, NY, USA). The amount of tooth movement for all samples were measured
      twice by the responsible investigator at one week interval. Interclass correlation
      coefficient-ICC was used to asses intraobserver accuracy and reliability.Mann- Whitney U test
      was used to assess treatment effect in terms of time to reach canine distalization.
      Correlation between measurements were described with Spearman Correlation Coefficient.
      Interclass correlation was 95%, which is in the range of excellent measurement agreement.
