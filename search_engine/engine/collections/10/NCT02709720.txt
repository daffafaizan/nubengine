      considered a treatment of choice for patients with unresectable stage III tumor selected
      clinically.

      There is at present a systemic considered standard treatment in combination with radical
      radiotherapy. Nor is it established a dose of standard radiation therapy, but it is known
      that should never be less than 60Gy57.

      Vinorelbine has shown a strong radio-sensitizer in-vitro37 effect. In the phase II study, The
      combination of oral vinorelbine with cisplatin as induction therapy and then concomitantly
      with radiotherapy (66Gy) has provided very encouraging efficacy results. Recently in the
      vortex scheme cisplatin study with oral vinorelbine concomitant maintained with radiation
      from the second cycle of chemotherapy was tested.

      It is therefore a priority in this segment pathology seeking treatment regimens that improve
      the effectiveness and toxicity. Metronomic chemotherapy started with the idea of
      administering a cytostatic divided doses, for an extended period without interruption, can
      provide the advantage of exposing patients to significant dose chemotherapy without worsening
      the toxicity profile. All this makes it an attractive treatment strategy, and can also
      maintain radio sensitizing effect during concomitance.
