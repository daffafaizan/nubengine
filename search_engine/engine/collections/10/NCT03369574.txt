      asthma. Some asthma patients receiving reslizumab also have CRS, which might also be improved
      by this drug. Study measures will be obtained from the medical records of eligible subjects
      who consent to participate. The study has no specific procedures per se, because all study
      measures are acquired during the course of standard of care treatment and will be abstracted
      from those medical records.
