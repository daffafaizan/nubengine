    
      This is an investigator initiated prospective open-label, within-patient, masked, randomized
      study in patients with neovascular AMD, DME, or RVO undergoing bilateral anti-VEGF
      injections. Patients will be randomized into two cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) and then
      followed for 3 consecutive injection visits. Treatment will be rendered at each injection
      visit based on the individualized routine established anti-VEGF injection interval for each
      patient.

      Within the respective cohorts, one eye per patient will be randomized to receive either an
      intracanalicular dexamethasone insert or the control treatment at each injection visit.
      Cohorts are as follows:

      Cohort 1:

      Total N= 40 eyes (20 patients). Twenty eyes (one eye per patient) will be randomized to
      receive an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert. The contra-lateral eye (Control) will
      receive a sham dilation.

      Cohort 2:

      Total N= 40 eyes (20 patients). Twenty eyes (one eye per patient) will be randomized to
      receive an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert. The contra-lateral eye (Control) will
      receive topical corticosteroids (prednisolone acetate 1%) QID tapered over 4 weeks (QID/ 1
      week, TID/ 1 week, BID/1 week, QD/ 1 week).

      In eyes randomized to either DEXTENZA or sham dilation, DEXTENZA insertion or sham dilation
      will be performed prior to injection.

      In eyes randomized to either DEXTNEZA or topical steroids, eyes randomized to DEXTENZA will
      receive insertion prior to injection. Eyes randomized to topical steroid therapy (Control)
      will receive 1 drop of prednisolone acetate 1% pre-injection and the remaining 3 drops of
      prednisolone acetate 1% post injection. Control eyes will follow tapered dosing over 4 weeks
      (QID/ 1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/1 week, QD/ 1 week) to ensure dose matching between DEXTENZA
      and Control in Cohort 1.

      Pain will be rated at 6 time points: (1) prior to any treatment, (2) after anesthesia, (3)
      after intravitreal injection, (4) 6 hours by telephone (+/- 2 hours), (5) 24 hours by
      telephone (+/-3 hours) and (6) 3-6 days at assessment visit. Pain will be evaluated by survey
      administrators masked to treatment assignment. Patient comfort (right eye vs left eye) will
      be assessed at each patient visit by masked survey administrator. Anterior cell count and
      anterior cell flare assessment will be conducted at 3-6 days following each intravitreal
      injection visit. There will be a final patient preference survey performed.
