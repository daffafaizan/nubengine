      (DSM-IV-TR, 2004). Impulsivity, a tendency to choose an immediate action despite delayed
      adverse consequences, is a major risk factor for tobacco, psychostimulant, opioid and alcohol
      abuse. In humans, impulsivity can be quantified by presenting subjects with a choice between
      a small immediate monetary reward or a larger but delayed reward. We recently found that the
      val158val allele for the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which is associated with
      more rapid cortical dopamine catabolism and thus lower cortical dopamine levels correlates
      with greater impulsivity and greater fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in
      dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices.

      The first phase of the study will involve healthy controls. The second phase of the study
      will involve abstinent alcoholics matched for age, education, and gender. Subjects will range
      in age between 18 and 50 years old.
