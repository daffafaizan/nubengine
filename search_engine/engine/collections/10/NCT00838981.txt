      Management will have significantly lower cocaine use than the other treatment conditions. We
      also hypothesize that improvements in memory, impulse control, and attention will be a
      significant contributor to the treatment improvements investigated in Specific Aim #1.

      Opioid and cocaine dependence are major problems among veteran and non-veterans and no
      effective pharmacotherapy exists for cocaine dependence. Methadone has not shown robust
      effectiveness in reducing cocaine abuse. Thus, new treatments are needed for the individuals
      who have developed cocaine dependence. This study is designed to test a new pharmacotherapy
      for cocaine dependence and is a placebo-controlled trail.

      Currently this study is in data analysis phase with 90 enrolled and 70 completers.
