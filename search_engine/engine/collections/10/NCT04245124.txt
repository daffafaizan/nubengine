      effectiveness. CR interventions for mTBI typically focus on compensating for subjective and
      functional cognitive complaints. A number of recent studies have examined the use of
      compensatory CR approaches for individuals (primarily military veterans) diagnosed with mild
      cognitive impairment from a likely mTBI. These interventions taught individuals adaptive
      functional skills (e.g., cognitive mnemonics) and highlighted use of external aids such as
      smart phone scheduling/reminder applications. A randomized control trial that included 16
      veterans with TBI (mixed mild and moderate severity), found this compensatory CR intervention
      was effective at reducing overall symptoms, but did not impact cognitive performance or
      work-outcomes. In a secondary study, there was some evidence that the compensatory CR
      intervention improved memory at 6 months post-treatment and quality of life at 12 months but
      there was not a consistent pattern of improvement compared to controls.

      Generalizability from civilian and veteran communities to active duty SMs may pose some
      unique and unexplored factors as the goal of treatment is not remediation of common
      activities of daily living (e.g., remembering appointments) but in contrast, the goal is
      military readiness needed for worldwide deployability to potential wartime environments
      (e.g., "cognitive readiness").
