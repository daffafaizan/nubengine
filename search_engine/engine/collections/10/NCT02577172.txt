      side-effects during and after treatment. Both aerobic and strength exercise have showed
      beneficial effects on side-effects during and after treatment in other cancer diagnosis.
      Knowledge of the effects of physical exercise during and after chemotherapy in TC patients is
      insufficient and studies are needed. The primary aim is to examine the effects of physical
      exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness in TC patients during chemotherapy. Secondary aims are
      to examine the effects of physical exercise on other secondary health outcomes during and
      three and twelve months after chemotherapy.

      The present study is a randomized controlled trial comparing a tailored exercise program
      consisting of aerobic and strength training during chemotherapy to a control group receiving
      one individual lifestyle counseling session during the first chemotherapy cycle. The TC
      patients will be included and assessed before the first cycle of chemotherapy and further
      assigned to either a exercise group or a control group. The intervention will last for 9 or
      12 weeks (depending on the number of bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP)/etoposide,
      cisplatin (EP) cycles received) and it will consists of two-three one-hour sessions per week
      mostly supervised by a personal trainer. All variables will be assessed pre- and
      post-intervention, and at three and 12 months follow-up.
