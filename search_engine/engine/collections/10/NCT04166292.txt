    
      This is a prospective, uncontrolled, single site study with a blinded evaluator assessing the
      efficacy of Stylage速 XL Lidoca誰ne on FVLS and GAIS clinical scoring.

      The study duration by subject is 18 months with a screening visit (V0) before injection, the
      baseline visit (injection of Stylage速 XL Lidoca誰ne, V1) and 5 follow-up visits after 1, 3, 6,
      12 and 18 months (V2 to V6). At 1 month (V2) an optional touch-up may be done (if needed).

      The primary endpoint is the facial volume variation from baseline (D0) to 6 months after
      treatment initiation measured by an independent evaluator on photographs using FVLS (Facial
      Volume Loss Scale).

      Facial volume variation (evaluated by an independent evaluator) & treatment responder rate,
      Global Aesthetic Improvement (evaluated by the patient and the doctor), volume on the
      cheekbones and chin & chin angle (for applicable subjects), subject's satisfaction will be
      measured at all time-point with a FVLS, GAIS,3D QuantifiCare system, FACE-Q questionnaire
      (cheekbones and chin) respectively. Safety will be also assessed.
