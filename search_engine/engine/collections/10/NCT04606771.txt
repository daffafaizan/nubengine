    
      Resistance to EGFR-TKIs is a clinical problem. One of the mechanisms for resistance to
      osimertinib is amplification of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase, which activates downstream
      intracellular signalling independent of EGFR. This study will explore the individual
      contribution of savolitinib to MET mediated osimertinib resistance, by assessing the response
      to dual pathway blockade of EGFRm and MET to overcome MET mediated resistance to osimertinib
      versus inhibition of the MET pathway alone by investigating the efficacy of savolitinib plus
      osimertinib versus savolitinib plus placebo to osimertinib (hereafter referred to as placebo)
      in patients with EGFRm+ and MET amplified, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have
      progressed following treatment with osimertinib. This is a multi centre, Phase II, double
      blind, randomised study.

      Patients will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to receive treatment with savolitinib once
      daily plus osimertinib once daily or savolitinib once daily plus placebo. Randomisation will
      be stratified according to the number ofprior lines of therapy (ie, osimertinib monotherapy
      as first line or â‰¥ second line [which includes patients who received osimertinib monotherapy
      before or after chemotherapy]). All patients confirmed as eligible will begin treatment on
      Day 1 with savolitinib plus osimertinib or savolitinib plus placebo. Treatment will continue
      once daily in 28 day cycles until either objective PD by RECIST 1.1 is assessed, unacceptable
      toxicity occurs, consent is withdrawn, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

      After progression, patients can be unblinded, and patients initially randomised to the
      savolitinib plus placebo arm may cross-over to open-label savolitinib plus osimertinib
      following investigator assessed objective PD to ensure that all patients enrolled may have
      the opportunity to receive the combination of savolitinib plus osimertinib.
