    
      PART 1: This is a Phase 1, multiple-dose, dose-escalation trial of PT2385 Tablets, where
      patients with advanced ccRCC will be assigned to sequential dose cohorts. Patient safety will
      be monitored with frequent physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms
      (ECGs), and hematology and chemistry laboratory studies, and by recording all adverse events
      (AEs). Blood will be obtained for analysis of the concentration of PT2385 and to assess
      biomarkers.

      PART 2: This is a Phase 1 trial of PT2385 Tablets in combination with nivolumab, where
      patients with advanced ccRCC will be assigned to dose cohorts. Patient safety will be
      monitored with frequent physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECGs, and hematology
      and chemistry laboratory studies, and by recording all AEs. Blood will be obtained for
      analysis of the concentration of PT2385 and to assess biomarkers.

      PART 3: This is a Phase 1 trial of PT2385 Tablets in combination with cabozantinib tablets,
      where patients with advanced ccRCC will be assigned to dose cohorts. Patient safety will be
      monitored with frequent physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECGs, and hematology
      and chemistry laboratory studies, and by recording all AEs. Blood will be obtained for
      analysis of the concentration of PT2385 and cabozantinb and to assess biomarkers.
