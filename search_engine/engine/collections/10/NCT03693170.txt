      with mCRC. The preclinical results and preliminary clinical data together justify the
      evaluation of this triple combination in the first-line setting of this population. The
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate the antitumor activity of the combination of
      encorafenib, binimetinib and cetuximab by assessing the overall response rate in adult
      subjects with previously untreated BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. It will
      also assess the effect of the triple combination on the duration of response, time to
      response, progression-free survival and overall survival and assess the effect on quality of
      life. It will also characterize the safety and tolerability of the triple combination as well
      as describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab.
