      traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury is a common problem in our society with
      greater than 1.5 million cases occurring annually and over 50,000 deaths per year in the
      civilian population in the United States. Medical therapy has long consisted of monitoring
      intracranial pressure and supportive measures designed to limit intracranial pressure. Two
      retrospective observational studies completed at the University of Tennessee demonstrate that
      the addition of beta-adrenergic blockage to the treatment of the traumatic brain injury
      lessens mortality. The basis for conducting this study was established by retrospective data
      showing no harm to patients receiving Inderal and potential benefit. Available data,
      including data from the University of Tennessee, are retrospective and are limited to simple
      exposure to the drug. The proposed study will attempt to further quantify the effect by
      dosing with the drug to actual beta-blockade instead of simple exposure to the drug.

      The effect of propranolol at the dosing levels used in this research will be determined by
      measurement of urinary catecholamines in both study arms and comparison of the actual effect
      of the drug on the catecholamine surge that occurs following traumatic brain injury will be
      determined.

      Additionally, the effect of healthcare disparities on outcomes in patients with traumatic
      brain injury will be measured. Outcomes will be stratified by payer status and ethnicity to
      determine the effect each of these variables has on outcomes.
