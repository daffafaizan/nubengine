    
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) represents one of the most important recent
      developments in the effort to prevent recurrent depression. Explicitly designed to modify
      core underlying vulnerability factors among recovered individuals with histories of
      depression, MBCT may have high applicability to the prevention of perinatal depression (PD).

      During this phase of the project the investigators will employ an iterative process to
      develop, within routine obstetric clinical settings, the MBCT-PD program across a two-center
      open trial of pregnant women at high risk of perinatal depression. During this phase, the
      investigators will modify the standard MBCT approach to be sensitive and specific to women at
      high risk of perinatal depressive relapse or recurrence based on previous history of
      depression and will address the following aims:

        -  Specific Aim 1: To examine the feasibility of MBCT-PD with respect to identification and
           enrollment of women at-risk of perinatal depression based on a history of depression.

        -  Specific Aim 2: To examine the engagement of women with the MBCT-PD approach with
           respect to retention, completion of daily practice assignments, and satisfaction

        -  Specific Aim 3: To examine the clinical outcomes including change in depression symptom
           levels and rates of relapse/recurrence over the course of the intervention and through a
           6-month postpartum follow-up.
