      cell function, insulin sensitivity and risk of chronic complications with normal subjects.
      Moreover, we want to examine whether they are at a higher risk of having metabolic syndrome
      and to answer whether we should screen the phenotypes of metabolic syndrome in impaired
      fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) patients. Then, we want to examine
      the association between insulin sensitivity and islet functions.
