      body. Its procedure is invasive and painful. Non-invasive in vivo optical biopsy is thus
      required, which should provide non-invasive, highly penetrative, three-dimensional (3D)
      imaging with sub-micron spatial resolution. Optical biopsy based on scanning two-photon
      fluorescence microscopy (TPFM) is a good method for biopsy of skin due to its high lateral
      resolution, low out-of-focus damage, and intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) section capability.
      However current technology still presents several limitations including low penetration
      depth, in-focus cell damages, and multi-photon phototoxicity due to high optical intensity in
      the 800 nm wavelength region, and toxicity if exogenous fluorescence markers were required.
      We study the harmonics optical biopsy of a human skin sample using a femtosecond
      Cr:forsterite laser centered at 1230 nm. Higher harmonics generation is known to leave no
      energy deposition to the interacted matters due to their energy-conservation characteristic.
      This energy-conservation characteristic provides the "noninvasive" nature desirable for
      clinical imaging. In our study, we will evaluate the clinical applications of optical skin
      biopsy using harmonic generation microscopy.
