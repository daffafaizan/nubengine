      variants. Variants with two different nicotine contents (1 mg/product and 2 mg/product), two
      different nicotine aersol particle sizes and presence/absence of a flavoring system will be
      tested to identify which one would yield plasma nicotine concentrations as close as possible
      to those achieved after smoking a single cigarette. All of the subjects will initially use
      the lowest nicotine content product (P3P 3). Subject will continue the study using the three
      remaining products (P3P 1, P3P 2 and P3P 4) containing 2 mg nicotine/product in a randomly
      assigned sequence.

      Two product use regimens: fixed puffing and ad libitum use will be applied to provide insight
      into nicotine absorption. The fixed puffing regimen with consistent use conditions across
      subjects will be applied in order to minimize variability. The 1 hour ad libitum use period
      will provide information on nicotine PK and product acceptance when subjects use the P3P
      according to their own puffing behavior which is closer to a real-world setting.

      Safety and tolerability will also be assessed throughout the study.
