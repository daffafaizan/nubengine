      to progesterone and progestins as an initial step toward clarifying these relationships. Our
      hypothesis is that direct effects of progesterone on the endocervix, independent of estrogen
      withdrawal, cause contraceptive changes to cervical mucus. To study this, a randomized,
      prospective, crossover study will be conducted by examining cervical mucus changes in a small
      cohort of women in whom investigators will suppress circulating hormonal levels by
      administering a GnRH antagonist. Investigators will then artificially replace Estrogen and
      Progesterone in order to differentiate their effects on clinical and laboratory measurements
      of mucus quality. The investigators will be looking closely at the immediate changes in mucus
      when .35 mg of norethindrone, a marketed drug is administered in this experimental setting.
      Cervical cell samples will also be collected at various time points and perform RT-PCR to
      determine whether genes for membrane bound progesterone receptor are expressed and regulated
      by Estrogen and Progesterone.
