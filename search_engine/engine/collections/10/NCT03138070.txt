    
      This is a single centre, single arm, preoperative window of opportunity study with a
      biomarker endpoint (expression profiling by RNA sequencing). Patients with resectable,
      histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for whom surgical
      treatment is planned as definitive management will be eligible. The median time from
      consultation to major head and neck surgery at our institution is 3.2 +/- 2.0 weeks (1
      standard deviation). To provide the maximal opportunity to achieve a biomarker response and
      potentially observe clinical responses, patients will receive BYL719 orally daily at the
      maximum tolerated dose (400 mg/day) for 14 days. All patients will receive surgery as the
      standard of care. The gene expression profile, including Ki-67, from the surgical specimen
      and mandatory baseline tumor biopsy will be evaluated for primary and secondary
      pharmacodynamic endpoints.
