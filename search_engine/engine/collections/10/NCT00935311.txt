      given once every 6 hours for 12 hours (for a total of 2 doses). Participants were randomized
      to receive placebo or active drug (either experimental drug or comparator). The total dose
      was the same for both groups receiving active drug, but was given as either 1 dose of
      extended-release tablets (experimental drug), or 2 doses of immediate-release tablets (active
      comparator).
