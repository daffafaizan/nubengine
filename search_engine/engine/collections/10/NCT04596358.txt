        -  Clinical assessment and pathological history

        -  Anthropometric measurements;

        -  Haematochemical examinations;

        -  Screening to adherence to Med-Diet by using "MedDietScore" questionnaire

        -  Assessment of the Harvard Cancer Risk Index for the evaluation of risk factors,
           modifiable and not, of the most frequent oncological diseases in Italy (colon, lung,
           breast and prostate). The index provides an estimate of individual cancer risk and is
           not equivalent to a cancer diagnosis. In addition, the Harvard Cancer Risk Index itself
           can allow the doctor to advise the worker on useful measures to reduce it;

        -  Major anthropometric and haematochemical data also allow to obtain one of the most used
           risk indexes for cardiovascular diseases in the scientific literature the Framingham
           Score.
