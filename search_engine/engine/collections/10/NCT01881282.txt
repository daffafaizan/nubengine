      drug assigned by chance), multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team
      work on a medical research study), controlled clinical trial and comparative study of safety
      and efficacy of compound carraghenates cream with Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid ointment in the
      treatment of hemorrhoids, especially regarding the relief of pain. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either of the two treatment groups that are carraghenates cream
      (Titanoreine) group or Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid ointment group. The total duration of the
      study will be 1 Week (7 days). In carraghenates cream group, 3-4 gram (g) cream will be
      administered each time through anal canal, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the
      evening for consecutive 6 days and in the Mayinglong musk hemorrhoid ointment group, 2 g
      ointment will be administered each time through anal canal, twice a day, once in the morning
      and once in the evening for consecutive 6 days. Efficacy will be assessed by using Numeric
      Rating Scale (NRS) and participants' safety will be monitored throughout the trial.
