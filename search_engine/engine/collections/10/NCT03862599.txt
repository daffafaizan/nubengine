      prostatectomy for prostate cancer. At present, this debilitating consequence of surgery is
      managed in a step-wise approach including oral medication, injections and in severe cases,
      insertion of a penile prosthesis. A few small studies have shown that low-intensity shockwave
      therapy may improve sexual performance in men with ED. However, the optimal dosage and length
      of treatment is yet to be determined. The investigators propose a randomised trial evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of low-intensity shockwave therapy in men with ED following
      prostatectomy surgery. Low-intensity shockwave therapy would be a non-invasive treatment to
      preserve and improve patient's sexual function.
