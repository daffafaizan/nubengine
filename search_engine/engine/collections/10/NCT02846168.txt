      differed among patients. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) is an effective
      method to treat AMI. To accurately predict adverse outcomes following pPCI in patients with
      AMI will help doctors develop precise therapeutic strategy in advance. At present how to
      predict adverse events before pPCI is still controversial. In our previous studies, the
      investigators found that glucagon like peptide -1 (GLP-1) can improve cardiac function in
      patients with AMI after PCI, other studies have reported that plasma GLP-1 levels is
      negatively correlated with CK-MB in patients with AMI, but the relationship between plasma
      GLP1 and prognosis of AMI patients after PCI has not been reported, the investigators
      hypothesized that plasma levels of GLP1 is associated with major adverse cardiovascular
      events (MACE) after pPCI. The investigators planned to evaluate the predicting role of plasma
      GLP1 level on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention.
