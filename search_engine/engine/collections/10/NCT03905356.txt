      Aim 1. To determine the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of an exercise intervention
      among cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. The investigators anticipate that >25% of
      approached patients will consent to the protocol; >33% of eligible radiation therapy patients
      who consent will perform the exercise prescribed (based on the response rate from EnACT); and
      <25% of participants will experience a musculoskeletal impairment (without treatment
      alterations) and <5% will experience a musculoskeletal injury with symptoms lasting â‰¥ week or
      requiring medical attention. The investigators' approach will be to include patients
      receiving definitive RT; excluding patients at high risk for side effects from combination
      therapy, including fracture or cardiovascular events.

      Aim 2. To discern the clinical outcomes of patients receiving RT+ET. The hypothesis is that
      adding ET to RT will improve patient reported outcomes and physical functioning. The
      investigators' approach will be to use standardized questionnaires and assessment tools:
      patient reported outcomes will be assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events - Patient Reported Outcomes (CTCAE-PROs), loaded onto tablets that patients use in the
      clinic. Questions will assess global PROs relevant to the ability to tolerate RT, including
      fatigue, pain, nausea, vomiting; and disease-site-specific PROs, including
      genitourinary/sexual symptoms for patients receiving pelvic RT. RT dose alterations will be
      documented. Scores will be compared pre- vs post- RT. The investigators will also use
      standardized measures already used in EnACT, including grip strength, 30-second chair stand,
      timed up-and-go, and 4-stage balance. Scores will be compared pre- vs post- RT.
