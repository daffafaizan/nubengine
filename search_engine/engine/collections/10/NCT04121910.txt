    
      This study will be an open-label, 3-period, fixed-sequence study in non-Japanese healthy male
      subjects conducted at a single study centre.

      The study will comprise:

        1. A screening period of maximum 28 days;

        2. Three treatment periods:

             1. Treatment Period 1 consists of 15 days with admission on Study Day -1, followed by
                a single dose administration of savolitinib on Study Day 1 followed by a washout
                period of at least 14 days. Subjects will be discharged from the study centre on
                Day 3, after the last PK sample is collected.

             2. Treatment Period 2 consists of 4 days with admission on Study Day 14, followed by
                itraconazole administration for 3 days (200 mg BID on Study Day 15, 200 mg QD on
                Study Days 16 and 17).

             3. Treatment Period 3 consists of 3 days, starting immediately after the end of
                Treatment Period 2 comprising of single dose administration of savolitinib (200 mg)
                on Study Day 18 and itraconazole administration (200 mg QD) on Study Days 18 and
                19. The subjects will be discharged from the study centre on Study Day 20 after the
                last PK sample.

        3. The Follow-up Visit will occur at least 14 days after the last dose of savolitinib PK
           sample in Treatment Period 3.

        4. Subjects will be admitted to the study centre on 2 different occasions: Study Day-1
           (Study Day -1) to Study Day 3 of Treatment Period 1 and Day -1 (Study Day 14) of
           Treatment Period 2 to Day 3 (Study Day 20) of Treatment Period 3.

      The study drugs will be administered as follows:

        1. Treatment Period 1: Single administration of savolitinib (200 mg) will occur on Study
           Day 1 after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast followed by PK sampling for 48 hours.

        2. Treatment Period 2: Itraconazole administered BID (200 mg BID) on Study Day 15, and (200
           mg QD) on Study Days 16 and 17, 1 hour before breakfast (and before dinner, when
           applicable).

        3. Treatment Period 3: A single combination of itraconazole (200 mg) 1 hour before
           breakfast + savolitinib (200 mg) after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast on Study Day
           18, and a single dose of itraconazole (200 mg) on Study Day 19, 1 hour before breakfast.

      Each subject will be involved in the study for up to 60 days.
