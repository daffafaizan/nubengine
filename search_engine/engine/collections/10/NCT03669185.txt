      important cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Impaired placental function determined
      by insufficient transformation of the uterine arteries and mal-perfusion of the placenta is
      the leading cause of FGR. So far, there is no treatment option for pregnancy complicated by
      FGR and the clinical management is restricted to close monitoring, assessing for the optimal
      time point of delivering the fetus threatened by intrauterine death. In a prospective
      randomized controlled trial a risk reduction of 38% (relative risk RR=0.609, 95% CI 0.367 to
      1.011) for the development of IUGR and IUGR or death (RR=0.615, 95% CI 0.378 to 1.000) could
      be demonstrated by delivering the organic nitrate pentaerithrityl-tetranitrate (PETN) to
      patients recognized at risk for FGR by impaired uterine artery Doppler at mid gestation
      (Schleussner, 2014). To confirm these results a prospective randomized placebo controlled
      double-blinded multicentre trial was now initiated.

      Eligible patients are pregnant women at risk of developing FGR meeting the inclusion
      criteria: abnormal uterine artery Doppler ultrasound, defined by a mean PI exceeding 1.6,
      singleton pregnancy, informed consent and 19+0 to 22+6 weeks of gestation. The composite
      endpoint of severe FGR (< birth weight below the 3rd centile) and intrauterine or neonatal
      death was defined as primary efficacy endpoint. and perinatal death. Key secondary endpoints
      are development of FGR (defined by birth weight < 10th percentile), severe FGR (< birth
      weight below the 3rd centile), intrauterine or neonatal death, placental abruption and
      preterm birth.
