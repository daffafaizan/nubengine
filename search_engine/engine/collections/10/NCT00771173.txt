    
      This is a randomized clinical trial to determine whether phenazopyridine HCl reduces
      catheter-related bladder discomfort, using mean VAS scores and overall pain medicine
      requirements in women catheterized following in-patient gynecologic surgery.

      Hypothesis and Aims:

      We plan to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in post-operative pain as
      measured by VAS pain scores and pain medication requirements in women with a Foley catheter
      following gynecologic surgery that are given phenazopyridine HCl vs. placebo.

      The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the utility of
      phenazopyridine HCl vs. placebo in reducing catheter-associated discomfort during the
      post-operative period in the gynecologic patient using mean VAS measurements.
