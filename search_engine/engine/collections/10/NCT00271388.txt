      neglect. The procedure involves the delivery of transcutaneous small-amplitude current to the
      vestibular nerves that lie directly below the mastoid bones. With the intention of boosting
      activity in the damaged left hemisphere, positive and negative current is delivered to the
      left and right mastoids respectively. While successfully used to rehabilitate gait and
      balance disorders, the procedure has only once been applied to neglect.

      In the present investigation, we will first confirm and then optimize the conditions under
      which galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) ameliorates neglect. This in turn will justify
      subsequent work (in a later funding cycle) that will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of
      the treatment on a much larger clinical scale, and merit the construction of a miniaturized
      portable device.
