      antibiotics, the incidence of clinical drug resistance has been on the rise significantly in
      recent years. Once drug resistance occurs, we will see a high mortality rate due to scarce
      therapies and a poor prognosis. It is almost impossible to surmount the severe pulmonary
      infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria only by upgrading antibiotics. The commonly used
      supportive therapies clinically, such as glucocorticoids and immunomodulators, also lack
      forceful medical evidence. Therefore, it is urgent to explore new treatments.

      Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal
      stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and
      nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.

      Currently, it has been confirmed that stem cells can visibly improve the pathological changes
      of lungs caused by infection, lighten pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, mitigate
      alveolar inflammation, and remove bacteria. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of
      pulmonary infection caused by extensively drug-resistant bacteria.

      Patients were treated, in the research project, with well-suited noninvasive haMPC-Exos
      aerosol inhalation, in an attempt to verify the efficacy and safety of haMPC-Exos treatment
      with pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative bacilli resistant to carbapenems.
