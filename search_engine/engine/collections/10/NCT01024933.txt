      affect and self affirmation with motivational interviewing in order to increase blood
      pressure control in community based practices that care for large numbers of hypertensive
      black patients. Patients in both the educational and behavioral contract control group and
      would receive a workbook, would make a behavioral contract, and a home blood pressure
      monitor. The positive affect/self-affirmation group would receive the same components as the
      control group. In addition the experimental group would receive a positive
      affect/self-affirmation induction and motivational interviewing.

      Both the control group and the experimental group would be followed at 2 month intervals. The
      outcome blood pressure control in this group will be contrasted to the knowledge/behavioral
      contract group. We hypothesize that we can increase the percent of patients who have blood
      pressure control to 75%.
