      monitoring telephone system used by patients who received chemotherapy for their cancer to
      communicate unrelieved symptoms they experienced to their oncology providers. The symptoms
      monitored in the project were nausea/vomiting, pain, sore mouth, diarrhea, constipation,
      depressed mood, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and fatigue. The study randomly assigned
      participants into either the intervention group or the group that received usual care from
      their oncology providers without alert notifications. All participants called the automated
      system daily to report their symptom presence, severity, and distress. When participants in
      the intervention group rated symptoms at moderate (4-7) to severe (8-10) levels an e-mail
      alert report of their symptom information was sent to the participant's medical oncologist
      and oncology nurse. The usual care group also reported symptoms daily to the automated system
      but their information was not sent to the providers. Participants in the usual care group
      were told daily to call their oncology provider if they had concerns about their symptoms.
      The two study groups were compared over chemotherapy cycles 2 and 3 on symptom presence,
      severity, and distress. Functional status, patient reported degree of symptom interference
      with normal activities, and work attendance if they had indicated that they worked during
      their treatment were also recorded. In addition, the groups were compared for the number and
      purpose of unscheduled patient-provider contacts, visits to the emergency department or
      urgent care facility, and unscheduled hospitalizations.
