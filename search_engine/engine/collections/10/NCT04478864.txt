      by 10 questions focusing on the basic knowledge of gingival appearance, causes and
      consequence of periodontal disease, impact of systemic disease on the progression of
      periodontal conditions, and prevention. Then, periodontal practice will be addressed via
      several questions that evaluate the self-care practices of tooth brushing, flossing, mouth
      rinsing in recent one year, scaling in recent five years, and how to alleviate gingival
      bleeding if there is.

      Periodontal examination using the community periodontal index (CPI) will be done for all of
      the participants to assess the status of periodontal condition. The dentition will be divided
      into sextants and the highest code number corresponding to the worst periodontal condition
      around each of the 10 indexed teeth being recorded.
