      its molecules may contribute to derangements prevalent in critical illness, including
      systemic inflammation, cellular stress, oxidative damage, endothelial dysfunction and
      coagulopathies which precipitate high mortality and morbidity. Investigators will examine
      whether a Psycho-cognitive nursing intervention to induce relaxation can improve patients
      outcomes.

      Sixty ICU patients with or without SIRS will be randomized to receive either standard care or
      a brief Psycho-cognitive Nursing Intervention, plus standard care, up to 5 days during ICU
      stay.
