    
      In 10 healthy subjects with BMI <30 kg/m2 the plasma concentrations of 4 natural compounds
      (nicotinamide riboside, L-carnitine, L-serine and N-acetylcystein) are measured by
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLCMSMS) after individual
      and combined administration, on five consecutive days and at every hour during 9 hours after
      administration. The study will start at 8:00 every morning and at each time point, blood
      samples will be collected.

      The taste and any potential sensing of the co-factors such as vertigo, nausea, bowel movement
      will be recorded.

      Each participant will receive one oral dose of Day 1: 1 g nicotinamide riboside; Day 2: 3 g
      L-carnitine; Day 3: 5 g N-acetylcystein; Day 4: 20 g L-serine; Day 5: combined 1 g
      nicotinamide riboside, 3 g L-carnitine, 5 g N-acetylcystein, and 20 g L-serine

      In addition, untargeted metabolomics analysis as well as O-link proteomics analysis we be
      performed to study effect of the administered cofactors.
