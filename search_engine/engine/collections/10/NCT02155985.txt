      trial to study whether aspirin improves inflammation and immune activation. At study entry,
      participants were randomized between the three study arms: aspirin 300 mg, aspirin 100 mg and
      placebo. The study treatment duration was 12 weeks, followed by a 4 week washout period. The
      study duration was 16 weeks.

      The study clinic visits included pre-entry (within 7 days prior to entry), entry, on
      treatment visits at weeks 2, 11 and 12, and final study visit at the end of the wash-out
      period at week 16. The samples for the primary and secondary outcomes were collected at
      pre-entry, entry, and weeks 2, 11 and 12. The evaluations of safety (clinical assessment for
      signs and symptoms, diagnoses, laboratory tests) were done at entry and weeks 2, 11, 12 and
      16.

      The co-primary objectives used pair-wise comparisons to assess the effects of 300 mg and 100
      mg of daily aspirin for 12 weeks on plasma sCD14 levels.
