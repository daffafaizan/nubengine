      Primary

        -  To determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with relapsed or
           progressive high-grade gliomas treated with bevacizumab and carmustine.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the radiographic response to this regimen as measured by MRI and PET scan
           with image fusion.

        -  To utilize novel brain imaging to differentiate between a radiographic response due to
           tumor shrinkage and a radiographic response due to decreased vasogenic edema.

        -  To evaluate the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on days -7, 8, 22, 36, and 50 of course 1 and on
      days 8, 22, 36, and 50 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive carmustine IV over 4
      hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 56 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.
