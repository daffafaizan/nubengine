        -  To study in vivo detection of breast masses by vibro-acoustography (VA) imaging.

        -  To evaluate the performance of VA imaging in differentiating between benign and
           malignant breast masses identified as BI-RADS 4 or 5.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo clinical mammography of the breast, followed by vibro-acoustography
      (VA) imaging using ultrasonography over 90 minutes. Patients may also undergo further imaging
      using clinical ultrasonography.
