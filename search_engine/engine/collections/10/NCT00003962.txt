      allogeneic T-cell depleted bone marrow transplant in patients with hematologic malignancies
      at high risk of relapse. II. Determine the optimal dose of interleukin-2 in this regimen
      which will result in maximal natural killer cell and lymphokine activated killer cell
      activity in vitro.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive CD34+ stem cell augmented donor
      bone marrow on day 0 on another protocol. Patients then receive interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      subcutaneously on day 30. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of dose limiting
      toxicity. Cohorts of 4 patients receive escalating doses of IL-2 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose prior to that which causes at least
      grade 3 toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
