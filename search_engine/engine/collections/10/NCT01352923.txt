      different agonists are highly variable, within well defined populations of healthy donors.
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding platelet proteins can explain the wide
      range of responses to standard platelet agonists. Yet, numerous SNPs point towards proteins
      with previously unknown function in platelets, wich modulate the complex network of signaling
      events that regulate platelet function and further augment variability. PEAR1 is mainly
      expressed in platelets and endothelial cells. A few studies have linked SNPs in PEAR1 with
      decreased or increased platelet responses to various agonists. However, hitherto, no direct
      functional studies have been carried out to determine whether and how PEAR1 modulate
      intracellular signaling pathways relevant for platelet function.
