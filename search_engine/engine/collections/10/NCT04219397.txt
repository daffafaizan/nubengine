      overdose is the leading cause of injury death in the US. Many of these drugs originate from
      leftover prescription opioids related to postoperative overprescribing, lack of proper
      disposal, and unsafe home storage. Governmental guidelines indicate that leftover
      prescription opioids should be preferentially returned to a drug take back site; however,
      many people do not utilize these programs due to travel distance, lack of transportation, or
      other factors.

      The aims are to quantify the amount of unused opioids in the home following painful pediatric
      surgical procedures, investigate the impact of formal interventions on disposal of residual
      opioids in the home following these surgeries, and to identify current behaviors of
      adolescents and their family members in the handling of unused prescribed opioids.
