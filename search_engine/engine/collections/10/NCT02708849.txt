      open-label ketamine and active lamotrigine, or (b) open-label ketamine with a matched-placebo
      control (i.e., sugar pill). All participants will complete a baseline rs-fMRI approximately
      1-week prior to the ketamine infusion and a follow-up rs-fMRI 24-hours post-infusion. The
      subanesthetic dose of ketamine (0.23mg/kg bolus followed by 0.58mg/kg infusion over
      approximately 60 minutes) will be administered via intravenous infusion to occur during the
      MRS scan. Participants will be administered lamotrigine (300 mg oral dose) or the
      matched-placebo control about 2-hours prior to the start of the infusion.
