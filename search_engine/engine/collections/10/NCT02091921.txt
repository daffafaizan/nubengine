      clopidogrel to ticagrelor in patients with critical limb ischemia.

      Fifty patients with diagnosis of CLI (Rutherford class IV-VI) treated with clopidogrel 75 mg
      and aspirin 81 mg daily will be tested for inhibition of platelet aggregation using the
      VerifyNow P2Y12 and VASP assays before and 6±1 hours after their daily clopidogrel dose. All
      patients will then be switched from clopidogrel to ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily for two weeks
      and the VerifyNow and Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP) platelet reactivity assays
      repeated, samples will be collected before and 6±1 hours after the last ticagrelor dose. For
      exploratory analysis, patients will be divided in two groups based on the P2Y12 reaction
      units (PRU): Group 1. High on treatment platelet reactivity on clopidogrel (HPR), defined as
      P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) ≥208 and Group 2. Appropriate platelet inhibition on clopidogrel
      (API), defined as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) <208. If subjects are withdrawn from the study
      prior to completion due to the high co-morbidity rate of this population, additional subjects
      will be enrolled to reach a total of 50 completed subjects for data analysis.
