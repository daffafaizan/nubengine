      contribute to aging, including but not limited to increased burden of damaged DNA and
      protein, reduction in mitochondrial respiration, and the development of pro-inflammatory
      senescent cells. Developing and testing interventions that interact with multiple points of
      this spectrum may delay the aging process. Based on prior investigations, the study team
      believe the SGLT2 inhibitor class of drugs may target these basic mechanisms involved in the
      aging process and propose testing in a high-risk human population to evaluate their
      effectiveness in ameliorating aging-associated dysfunctions. Specifically, the investigators
      hypothesize that SGLT2i drugs will lead to reductions in oxidative damage to DNA and
      proteins, AGE-RAGE, and cellular senescence, which will be accompanied by improvements in
      mitochondrial function. If the hypothesis is correct, these findings could lead to the
      development of new approaches to increase both health-span and lifespan.

      This is a single center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The target enrollment for
      this pilot study is 20 completed subjects, split evenly between experimental and control
      groups. Each subject will be randomized to either the experimental group of dapagliflozin
      10mg daily for 12 weeks or the control group of nutritional counseling for weight loss.
      Health-span and clinical evaluations will be taken at baseline and at weeks 10-12 of the
      study.
