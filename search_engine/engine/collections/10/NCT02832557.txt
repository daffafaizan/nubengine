      saliva of children identified at risk for developing ASD by the MCHAT-R. Further, this study
      aims to assess the value of the current panel as an adjunctive test that may increase
      specificity of MCHAT-R positive results, or affirm clinical diagnoses alongside the ADOS or
      other objective assessments.

      The primary endpoints of this study are as follows:

        1. Evaluate the diagnostic ability (sensitivity and specificity) of the current a salivary
           microtranscriptome panel for distinguishing children with ASD from their non-ASD peers.

        2. Assess stability of the salivary microtranscriptome diagnosis over time, and interrogate
           longitudinal microtranscriptome levels relative to neuropsychological measures.

      Secondary endpoints are the identification of microtranscriptome features whose
      concentrations correlate with ASD endophenotypes.
