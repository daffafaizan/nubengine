      Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico, with a cohort of 1500 patients , a sample size
      of 206 individuals was calculated. Data collection was performed in a prospective cross
      shape.

      During the interview, written informed consent for inclusion in the study, along with a
      standard query of vascular surgery in which the patient's history as well as cardiovascular
      risk factors. Also, a vascular physical examination including palpation of pulses in upper
      and lower extremities (brachial, radial, ulnar, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and
      dorsalis pedis), femoral murmurs search and determining ankle / brachial indexes with a
      standardized method.

      In determining the ABI was counted with a Doppler ultrasound 8 mHz, transducer gel and a
      sleeve for manual measurement of blood pressure, 20% longer than the largest diameter of the
      arm circumference.

      If the patient is diagnosed with, symptomatic or asymptomatic arterial insufficiency, ABI
      measurements were performed at rest and effort, plus pressure index finger-arm or
      plethysmography. Patients with altered rates were followed in vascular surgery care.

      The data were recorded in a single database unique protected by password. The results were
      analyzed using the statistical program STATA v 9.0.
