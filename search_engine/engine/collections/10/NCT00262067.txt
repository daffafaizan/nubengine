    
      This study includes a blinded treatment phase, an optional open-label post-progression phase,
      and a survival follow-up phase. During the blinded treatment phase, patients receive
      chemotherapy and study drug (bevacizumab or placebo) every 3 weeks until disease progression,
      treatment-limiting toxicity, or death due to any cause. The optional open-label
      post-progression phase consists of chemotherapy treatment (per investigator discretion) and
      optional treatment with open-label bevacizumab. Patients who complete the study or who
      discontinue from treatment (regardless of participation in the optional open-label
      post-progression phase) will be followed for survival and subsequent anti-cancer therapies
      every 4 months until death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination.
      Patients who discontinue from treatment during the blinded treatment phase for reasons other
      than disease progression will have tumor assessments every 9 weeks until documented disease
      progression or death.
