      clinical status in adult cancer patients with solid tumors who are no longer candidates for
      active oncological therapies.

      sessions, 2 to 12 weeks apart, with the Investigational Therapy on healthy body tissue (i.e.
      non-tumor region) of back of the hand and/or foot. Number of treatment sessions and treatment
      frequency will be individualized per patient depending on patient's status as well as per the

      Investigational Therapy. Patients will be assessed for quality of life, pain and patient's
      clinical status according to acceptable clinical evaluations.

      oncological treatment, the principal investigator or designee will inform the Sponsor. The
      Sponsor will decide if the patient will stay or be discontinued from the study.
