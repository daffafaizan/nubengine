      TA CVS at 63 to 76 days post LMP. This study will compare the safety and accuracy of
      transabdominal amniocentesis and TA CVS, each performed during the same modified gestational
      age window of 77 to 104 days post LMP.

      Healthy, pregnant women at 77 to 104 days gestation, whose only indication for prenatal
      diagnosis is advanced maternal age of at least 34 years at enrollment, will be randomized to
      receive either TA CVS or amniocentesis following a baseline ultrasound. Eligible women who
      refuse randomization or for whom a procedure cannot be scheduled by 104 days will also be
      followed. Primary outcomes include fetal loss or preterm delivery before 196 days gestation
      as well as total fetal loss, amniotic fluid loss, gestational age at delivery, perinatal
      morbidity, neonatal morbidity, and congenital abnormalities, including limb reduction
      defects. Success in obtaining a diagnosis from the two procedures will be compared. One
      ancillary study will evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) as a rapid diagnostic method for certain cytogenetic abnormalities;
      another will collect data on amniotic fluid alphafetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase for the
      diagnosis of neural tube defects.
