      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of mutation of genes in congenital heart
      diseases and study the genotype-phenotype correlation.

      Hypothesis:

      The central hypothesis is that a significant percentage of congenital heart disease is caused
      by mutation of genes involved in heart development, and the phenotype with missensed
      mutations is milder than nonsense mutation. Another hypothesis is that a significant
      proportion of patients with cardiac malformations will have mutations in their genes. The
      specific aim is to test the mutations of these genes in patients with congenital heart
      diseases.

      Study Design and Procedures:

      This is a pilot study on mutation of genes in congenital heart diseases and
      genotype-phenotype correlation. Probands and family members are initially evaluated by a
      local physician or at the UCI Medical Center. A clinical diagnosis is made based on clinical
      information, echocardiography, EKG, and/or cardiac catheteration.

      We would like to correlate the mutation the specific type of congenital heart defect. For
      example, if mutations of TBX5 more likely cause atrial-septal defects, ventricular-septal
      defects; mutations PTPN11 is more likely cause pulmonary stenosis.
