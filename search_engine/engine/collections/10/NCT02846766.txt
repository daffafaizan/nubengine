      FGF/FGFR aberration or cancer type in order to test the hypothesis that subjects with
      advanced cancers harboring changes in FGF/FGFR-related genes will respond to the multikinase
      inhibitor lenvatinib at a higher rate than unselected cancer patients, regardless of the
      tumor histological subtype.

      Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits FGFR1-4 as well as VEGFR1-3, RET, KIT and
      PDGFR-beta. It inhibits FGFR1 with an IC50 of 46 nmol/L, which is highly potent at a
      clinically relevant concentration.

      Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and FGF receptor (FGFR) pathway aberrations are common in
      malignancy, making this pathway a potentially appealing target for anti-cancer therapy.
      Clinical trial data suggest that targeting FGFR is indeed effective in cancer. However, the
      majority of such data come from trials in patient populations unselected for FGF/FGFR pathway
      abnormalities. The true response rates or clinical benefits for those whose cancers harbor
      FGF/FGFR abnormalities may be higher than observed in unselected patient populations.
