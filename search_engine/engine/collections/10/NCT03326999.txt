      postoperative analgesia while preserving ambulation and limiting side effects such as nausea
      and vomiting. The clinical team's hypothesis is that the obturator nerve block in addition to
      adductor canal block can target both the anterior and posterior distribution of nerves to the
      knee to provide superior analgesia while not limiting ambulation. To test this hypothesis,
      the clinical team will compare the rate of IV opioid consumption in patients who receive a
      combination of adductor canal block and obturator nerve block at the surgical site versus
      patients who receive adductor canal block alone.
