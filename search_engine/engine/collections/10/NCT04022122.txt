      complex and advanced chronic cardiovascular conditions in high-standard iNtegrated care
      Environments) is an observational, cohort, prospective, multicenter study of consecutive
      patients treated in a comprehensive heart failure (HF) management program, and hospitalized
      by decompensated HF in our healthcare area; aimed at evaluating the impact of socioeconomic
      level on the effectiveness of a comprehensive multidisciplinary program of transitional care
      to patients with HF, both globally and in the various profiles of chronic management of HF.

      In this study we aim to assess the impact of the socio-economic level on the effectiveness of
      a comprehensive multidisciplinary program of transitional care for chronic heart failure
      patients (primary objective); to analyze this specifically in the various chronic management
      profiles of HF patients and to study the associations between NSE and other psychosocial
      aspects (secondary objective).

      All patients will have a detailed assessment by a social worker of a battery of psychosocial
      and functional variables, including educational level, functional status, cognitive status,
      family support, or the existence of a primary caregiver and an assessment of purchasing power
      through the value of monthly income. The events that will be analyzed, both for the primary
      objective of the study and the secondary objective related to the different follow-up
      profiles, will be re-admissions at 30 days (primary event), and mortality at 30, 90 and 180
      days, as well as hospital admission at 90 days and 6 months (secondary events). Using the
      "median" income group as a reference, comparisons will be made between the rates of these
      events among the different groups.

      The researchers hypothesize that the socioeconomic level has an impact on clinical events of
      HF patients so that the effectiveness of comprehensive care programs for HF is attenuated in
      patients with low socioeconomic level.
