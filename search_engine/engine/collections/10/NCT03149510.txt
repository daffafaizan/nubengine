      versus placebo for 12 weeks. The mobile application will provide the participants with a
      reminder to perform self-monitoring, a health status indicator and heart failure education
      for self-management.

      All participants will complete the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire and
      Self-Care Heart Failure Index. Hospital admissions and mortality will also be collected.
