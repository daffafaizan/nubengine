      treat with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is common. Currently, there is no effective
      treatment for RTOM. Ulinastatin, is a kind of natural anti-inflammatory substance. And this
      substance is insufficient when the body's inflammatory response is strongly. There are a
      series of studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of ulinastatin in the treatment of
      body's inflammatory response. From the observation of our previous clinical practice, we
      found that ulinastatin can relieve the severity of RTOM. The present study is undertaken to
      evaluate the efficacy of ulinastatin in the treatment of RTOM in localregionally advanced NPC
      patients treated with CCRT.
