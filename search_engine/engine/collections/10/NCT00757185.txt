      cardiovascular and endothelial function in obese women with and without PCOS. Data have
      indicated an important role for testosterone in influencing the peripheral microcirculation.
      While testosterone can lead to vasodilation in the peripheral microcirculation in both men
      and in women without PCOS, testosterone appears to induce vasoconstriction in women with
      PCOS. The differential response between women with and without PCOS, and between men and
      women may be the result of differential ET-1 actions in the vessel, and regulated by the
      receptor subtype is involved in these actions.
