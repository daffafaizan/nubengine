    
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, non-randomized study in male and female subjects with MDS
      who are naïve, refractory or have relapsed to 5-Azacitidine therapy.

      Primary Objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose,
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of birinapant (TL32711) when administered in combination with
      5-azacitidine (5 AZA) in subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are naïve,
      refractory or have relapsed to 5-AZA therapy.

      Secondary Objectives are to determine the clinical activity using the International Working
      Group (IWG) (Cheson, 2006) Response Criteria for MDS during the Phase 1b dose escalation
      stage of the study and in the Phase 2a expansion cohort, to determine the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of birinapant when administered with 5-AZA in plasma and to assess exploratory
      translational biomarkers of anti-tumor activity of birinapant in combination therapy.
