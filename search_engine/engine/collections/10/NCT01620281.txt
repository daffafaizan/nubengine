      platform that performs angular oscillations. The device is intended to be used at home as an
      accessory for relieving of mild to moderate low back pain (LBP).

      This study is designed to determine the efficacy of daily use home use with the no!no!Back
      device during 3 weeks and to assess the sustained effect 3 weeks later. Up to 30 subjects
      will be randomized to either an immediate treatment (IT) group that will receive the
      no!no!Back device at the baseline visit, or to the wait-list control (WLC) group that will
      receive the device 3 weeks later. The evaluation will include level of pain using the
      numerical rating scale (NRS), functional health status by Oswestry disability index (ODI),
      and subject satisfaction.
