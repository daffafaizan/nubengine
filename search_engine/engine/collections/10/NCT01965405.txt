      3901 Chrysler Service Dr, Detroit, 48201.

      Participants in Phase 1 will be randomized to one of two brief interventions based on
      standard of care guidelines (SoC): A) brief counseling and bupropion (SoC); or B) SoC plus
      brief high-magnitude prize CM (HM-CM). At the end of Phase 1, participants will be classified
      as responders or non-responders on the basis of smoking reduction/abstinence. All
      participants will continue to receive bupropion. Non-responders will enter Phase 2a and be
      randomly assigned to: A) continued counseling and monitoring support to quit smoking (MS); or
      B) MS plus prize CM for abstinence (MS+CM). Phase 1 responders will be entered into Phase 2b
      and randomly assigned to: A) no additional treatment (NAT); or B) Continued monitoring and
      low intensity prize CM (LI-CM). The primary dependent variables will include cotinine and
      carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and longest duration of abstinence from cigarettes. Seven-day
      point prevalence will be used to assess outcome at post-treatment, 6-month and 12-month
      follow-up points.

      Participants will be paid $35 for intake and $25 for each follow-up interview, which will
      occur at post-phase 1, post-phase 2, and 6-months and 12-months after treatment initiation.
      Some assessments as well as treatment sessions will be recorded to ensure data quality.
