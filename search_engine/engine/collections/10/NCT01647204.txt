      of malnutrition estimated to be greater than 40%. Malnutrition is associated with major
      adverse clinical outcomes such as increased mortality, morbidity and length of stay at
      enormous cost to individuals and the health service. There is growing recognition that
      malnutrition is often unrecognised and untreated, and that many patients are discharged from
      hospital in a more malnourished state than when they were admitted. It is not surprising that
      complaints about nutrition and food services are amongst the commonest complaints in NHS
      hospitals.

      The standard of mealtime care in UK hospitals has been an issue of concern for a number of
      years. A report last year from the Healthcare Commission found that one in five patients who
      wanted help eating did not get it. A secondary analysis of data provided by the Health Care
      Commission suggests that in some hospitals two out of five patients who wanted help with
      eating did not get it. Consistent with this, the recent Hungry to be Heard report found that
      nine out of ten nurses indicated they did not always have time to help ensure patients ate
      properly. They also suggested that some patients were not given appropriate assistance to
      eat. This problem is not unique to the UK and has been reported in other countries such as
      Australia and the USA.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate if the use of volunteers employed specifically
      to focus on mealtime assistance in a Care of the Elderly Ward can increase food and nutrient
      intake, impact on body composition and improve clinical outcomes. The findings will inform
      service development in the nutritional care of older people across the Trust and wider.
