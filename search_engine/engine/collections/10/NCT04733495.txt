      I. To determine the feasibility of implementing a group-mediated cognitive behavioral (GMCB)
      personalized resistance exercise (RE) intervention in head and neck cancer (HNCa) patients
      undergoing chemoradiation (CRT).

      II. To examine the effects of GMCB RE intervention upon functional limitations, body
      composition, and quality of life (QOL) in HNCa patients undergoing CRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo personalized resistance exercises over 1 hour daily. Patients receive
      dietary counseling over 60 minutes at week 1 and then over 15-30 minutes weekly for up to 6
      weeks. Patients also receive group-based behavioral counseling twice weekly (BIW) in weeks
      1-8, once a week (QW) in weeks 9-12, and then twice a month in weeks 13-24.
