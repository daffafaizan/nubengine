      expression through immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of 200 formalin-fixed and
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC specimens . The SOX4 high group of patients was associated with
      positive etiology of hepatitis B virus (P = 0.044), tumor size >5 cm (P = 0.014), thrombus
      formation (P = 0.012), higher microvessel density (MVD) (P = 0.012) in tumor lesions, and
      distant metastasis (P <0.001).

      Cox regression analysis showed that patients with elderly age (P <0.001), higher ⍺-fetal
      protein (AFP) (P = 0.045), presence of cirrhosis (P = 0.008), and SOX4 high in tumor specimen
      (P = 0.042) were independent risk factors . The SOX4 high group performed significantly worse
      regarding overall survival (OS) (P = 0.043) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.019) based
      on the Kaplan-Meier analysis.
