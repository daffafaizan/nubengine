        1. to evaluate the remodeling effects that would take place in the bone structures of the
           temporomandibular joint (TMJ) during functional treatment.

        2. to evaluate the possible change that may occur in mandibular movements following
           functional treatment.

        3. to evaluate the possible change in the spatial relationship between centric occlusion
           (CO) and centric relation (CR) following functional treatment
