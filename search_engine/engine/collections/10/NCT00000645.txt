      anti-HIV activity in test tube experiments.

      Each group of eight patients receives a given dose of hypericin by intravenous infusion.
      Doses are given three times per week for 8 weeks. When all eight patients at a dose level
      have been entered and four of the eight patients have completed 3 weeks of therapy without
      evidence of dose-limiting toxicity, additional patients may begin to receive drug at the next
      dose level. Concurrently, six patients wll participate in an oral-dosing bioavailability
      study. NOTE: The initial study was stopped secondary to an MTD being reached.
