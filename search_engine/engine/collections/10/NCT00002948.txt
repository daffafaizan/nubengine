        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicities, and preliminary antitumor activity of
           escalating doses of topotecan, with filgrastim (G-CSF) and peripheral blood stem cell
           support, when administered to patients with refractory malignancies for which no
           effective therapy exists.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Prior to stem cell harvesting, patients receive 1-2 courses of mobilizing salvage
      chemotherapy.

      After stem cell harvest, high-dose topotecan is administered according to an escalating
      dosage scale. Topotecan is given over 30 minutes daily for three days. A minimum of 3
      patients are entered at each dose level. The MTD is defined as the dose immediately below
      that at which 2 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are infused at least 24 hours after treatment with
      topotecan is complete. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously beginning on the day
      PBSC are infused and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.
