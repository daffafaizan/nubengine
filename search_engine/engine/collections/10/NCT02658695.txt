      operator under trans-abdominal US guidance performed by one physician, without any anesthesia
      or sedation with moderate bladder filling. Two embryos will be transferred using the same
      type of catheter which is Labotect embryo transfer catheter. It's a semirigid catheter that's
      less likely to induce endometrial trauma and uterine contractions.

      The tip of the inner catheter will be placed approximately 1.5-2 cm from the fundal
      endometrial surface.The distance between the fundal endometrial surface and air bubbles will
      be measured and categorized as:

        -  Group 1: air bubbles depth <10 mm.

        -  Group 2: air bubbles depth >10 mm. The primary outcome will be biochemical pregnancy
           rate based on serum quantitative beta-hCG level at 14 days after ET. Secondary outcome
           will be clinical pregnancy rate using trans-vaginal US examination at 6 - 8 weeks of
           amenorrhea to detect the presence of fetal sac & pulsation.
