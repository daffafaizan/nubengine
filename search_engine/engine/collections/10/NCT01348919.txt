      addition, after cycle 2, the start of treatment in cycle 3 may be delayed by 1 week if, in
      the opinion of the investigator, the delay is warranted. If a patient cannot receive 75% of
      the planned dose for any of the 3 agents (missing more than 1 dose of CEP-18770, or more than
      5 doses of lenalidomide [either consecutively or separately], or more than 1 dose of
      dexamethasone [either consecutively or separately]), due to a drug-related adverse event, the
      event will be considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), even if the grade of toxicity is
      lower than specified DLT determination. Patients will receive intravenous (IV) CEP-18770 on
      days 1, 8, and 15, oral lenalidomide on days 1 through 21, and oral dexamethasone on days 1,
      8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Treatment with all 3 drugs will continue for up to 12
      cycles (approximately 11 months), or until disease progression or intolerable toxicities.
      Patients experiencing clinical benefit may continue to receive additional treatment at the
      investigator's discretion and following sponsor notification. In part 2 of the study,
      patients will receive CEP-18770 as a slow IV bolus (approximately 1 milliliter per minute) at
      the maximum tolerated dose on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle. Patients who complete
      or discontinue study drug treatment and whose disease has not progressed will have study
      visits every 7-9 weeks during follow-up until disease progression, death, or until they have
      been monitored for 1 year after the first administration of study drug, whichever occurs
      first.
