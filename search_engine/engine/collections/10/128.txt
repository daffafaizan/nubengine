nickel carbonyl.. its detection and potential for formation .recent recommendations for control of nickel carbonyl exposures havebeen considered in the design of a simple, sensitive field method forsampling nickel carbonyl in air and process gases . the method involvescollection in dilute aqueous hcl, ph adjustment, nickel complexdevelopment with alpha-furildioxime, and extraction with chloroform .color intensity is compared visually (or for greater accuracy,spectrophotometrically) with liquid standards . sensitivities on theorder of 0.001 ppm are obtainable . a detailed development of thethermodynamics associated with the formation of nickel carbonyl is alsopresented to show the maximum concentrations of nickel carbonyl that maybe formed over a wide range of co concentrations, temperatures andpressures .
