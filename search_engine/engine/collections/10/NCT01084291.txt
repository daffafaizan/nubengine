      of the more severe diseases dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHS) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS)
      every year. There are four subtypes of the virus, and infection with one offers no protection
      from infection by the others. In fact, most cases of DHS and DSS occur in people infected by
      more than one subtype. In areas of the world where multiple subtypes of dengue are common,
      vaccines must be developed against each of the subtypes of dengue virus. This study will
      examine the safety and immune response of an investigational vaccine for preventing infection
      with DEN1.

      Participation in this study will last about 6 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to be injected with either the investigational study vaccine or a placebo. Participants will
      have a five in six chance of receiving the vaccine. The first study visit will take place on
      the vaccination day, on which participants will undergo a physical examination, blood draw,
      and pregnancy test, and then receive the vaccine. Participants will be given a thermometer
      and temperature card, and be told to record their temperature three times per day for 16 days
      after vaccination. Participants will come to follow-up visits every other day for the 16 days
      after vaccination, and then 3, 4, and 6 weeks after vaccination (Days 21, 28, and 42).
      Assessments completed during these visits will include a questionnaire about how the
      participant is feeling, pregnancy test, review of temperature cards, blood draw, and physical
      exam. Blood drawn will be analyzed to check participants' health, determine the amount of
      vaccine and antibodies in the blood, test markers in white blood cells and genes, and look
      for proteins that are important for fighting dengue infection.
