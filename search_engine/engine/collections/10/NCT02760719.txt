      to two years old. Currently there is no effective treatment so standard treatment remains
      supportive care with supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxia, minimal handling to minimise the
      risk of exhaustion and the provision of fluids.

      In recent years some studies have suggested that nebulised hypertonic saline, which improve
      airway hygiene, may influence the course of the illness and reduce the duration of
      hospitalisation without significant side effects.

      Study protocol: half of the included patients will receive standard treatment for
      bronchiolitis, which includes only supportive care, the other half will additionally receive
      nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution with salbutamol (to avoid potential bronchial
      obstruction) three times daily.
