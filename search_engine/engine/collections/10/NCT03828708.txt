      programming impact of metabolism and disease risks of the host. The early gut microbial
      colonization coincides with the maturation of the infant's mucosal innate immune system and
      research showed that the gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with impaired innate immune
      development. Thus, ensuring proper microbial colonization early in life is critical to the
      maturation of the immune system and long-term health.

      Iron fortification can increase the abundance of pathogenic bacteria and induce inflammation
      in older infants. However, it is still not known what the effect of iron is on a more
      vulnerable population: the newborn infant, who has immature immune system. Infants 0-4 months
      are at a low risk for iron deficiency due to the iron endowment at birth, which is compatible
      with the very low iron content (<0.5mg Fe/L) in breastmilk. However, commercial infant
      formulas are all fortified with â‰¥12mg Fe/L. Whether this striking difference drives adverse
      health effects is unknown/unexamined, especially on early colonization and immune
      homeostasis. The overall objective is to determine the impact of high vs. low iron exposure
      in formula-fed infants during the early post-natal months on gut microbiome.
