    
      Eligible patients receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously (Day 1). On Day 8, patients
      receive donor-derived NK cells via a central venous catheter.

      The NK cell dose is as follows;

      Level 1: 1.25 X 109 cells Level 2: 2.50 X 109 cells Level 3: 5.00 X 109 cells

      Three patients each will be treated on each dose level.

      Two weeks prior to donor NK cell administration to patients, HLA-haploidentical family member
      of the patients undergo leukapheresis after G-CSF injections to collect hematopoietic stem
      cells.

      These donor cells are then taken to the laboratory, where they were differentiated into NK
      cells ex vivo over approximately over 2-week period.
