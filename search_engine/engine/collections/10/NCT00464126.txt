      resuscitative fluid versus another in the setting of post-operative pediatric cardiac
      patients. The two types of fluid being compared are crystalloid solution (normal saline) and
      colloid solution (5% albumin). The primary outcome measurement will be how much volume of
      each type of fluid will be required in order to maintain hemodynamic stability as determined
      by mean arterial blood pressure within predetermined parameters. Other secondary outcomes
      will include determinations of lactate clearance, inotropic support requirements, urine
      output, peripheral and pulmonary edema that occurs post-operatively, and the over all costs
      for each fluid based on number of required boluses and number of hours on mechanical
      ventilation.
