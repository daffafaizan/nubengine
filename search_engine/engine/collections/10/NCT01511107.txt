      in the course of therapy, and a subsequent visit at the end of therapy. Thereafter, they will
      be followed through the end of the respiratory season, and their parents will be encouraged
      to bring their child when concerned about a potential recurrence of AOM. At each recurrence
      subjects will receive the treatment regimen (either standard- or reduced-duration) to which
      they were randomized at study entry (consistent treatment strategy).

      The recruitment of eligible children with AOM of varying degrees of severity from various
      primary care practices in 2 separate geographic regions, i.e. Western Pennsylvania and
      Kentucky, representing urban, suburban and rural demographics will enhance generalizability
      of study findings and encourage translation to clinical practice.
