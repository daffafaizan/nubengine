    
      This is an observational retrospective cohort study using claims data to evaluate the
      long-term safety of paclitaxel-coated devices compared with non-drug coated devices for
      femoropopliteal artery revascularization, with median follow-up time for the population
      surpassing 5 years. A series of supplemental sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess
      and mitigate the potential for unmeasured confounding and to determine the impact of repeat
      interventions and paclitaxel exposure on survival. Finally, sub-group analyses will be
      performed to investigate whether there is differential safety of paclitaxel-coated devices
      across different patient profiles.
