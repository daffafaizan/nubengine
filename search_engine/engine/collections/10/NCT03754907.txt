      using the hand-sewn end-to-end approach. After the introduction of stapled functional
      end-to-end anastomosis (FEEA) in neonates and infants by Powell in 1995, the procedure is
      gradually being accepted among pediatric surgeons. When treating intestinal atresia, great
      discrepancy between diameters of the proximal and distal intestine caused by disuse atrophy
      are often observed, which may cause difficulties and complications. To overcome size
      discrepancy, proficiency in performing anastomosis is required when using hand-sewn
      techniques. in theory, stapled functional end-to-end anastomosis does not require a special
      technique and does not impair the passage of intestinal contents immediately after completion
      because the side-to-side nature of the procedure retains the unique diameter of the target
      intestine and preserves patency. Stapled side-to-side functional end-to-end intestinal
      anastomosis is a potentially useful technique that is not affected by intestinal size
      discrepancy and does not require specialized surgical experience.To date, there have been a
      few studies about the safety and efficacy of stapled anastomosis in neonates and infants,
      which reported the efficacy of stapled over hand-sewn anastomosis, including shorter
      operative time, time to full feeding and hospitalization, and no difference in adverse
      outcomes between both types of anastomoses. These studies compared the clinical outcomes in
      neonates and infants. However,there are no high-quality clinical trials to verify its
      effectiveness. Therefore, the investigators compared the outcomes of stapled FEEA and
      hand-sewn anastomosis in neonate with intestinal atresia.
