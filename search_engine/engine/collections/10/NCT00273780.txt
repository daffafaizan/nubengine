      adult participants beginning HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) for the first time.
      Patients who are eligible to be initiated on HAART at the UW/Coptic Hope Center for
      Infectious Diseases will be referred for enrollment. Eligible patients who are referred will
      learn about the study and be invited to enroll after signing a written informed consent.

      Study participants will be randomized to one of four arms:educational counseling, a pocket
      alarm device, both education and alarm, or neither. Participants will be followed in the
      study for 1 Â½ years after enrollment and randomization. Participants will return to clinic
      every month to pick up a renewal of their antiretroviral prescriptions at which time pill
      counts will be performed. During follow-up visits, blood will be drawn and stored for CD4
      counts and HIV-1 viral analyses.

      Within this trial, the study also proposes to identify sociodemographic and spatial
      correlates of adherence. The study hypothesizes that educational counseling and medication
      alarm devices may significantly improve adherence, and that poor adherence may be associated
      with low socioeconomic standing, increased mobility, and distance from clinic.
