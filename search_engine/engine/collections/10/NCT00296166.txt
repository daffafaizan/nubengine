    
      Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation will be considered for randomisation Patients
      will be randomised to either conventional endocardial catheter ablation or epicardial
      thoracoscopic ablation.

      Objectives of study:

      Primary endpoint:presence of sinus rhythm after 6 months Secondary endpoints: complications,
      cost-effectiveness, structural changes (evaluated by echocardiography), p-BNP and
      inflammatory markers, atrial fibrillation burden evaluated by Holter monitoring
