      (biweekly). Participants will be randomized, or chosen by chance, to enter into one of three
      groups. People in the first group will take 1 g/day or EPA omega-3 fatty acid, those in the
      second group will take 1 g/day of DHA omega-3 fatty acid, and those in the third group will
      take a placebo. This study is double-blind, which means that neither the participant, nor the
      doctor, nor the research staff will know which group each person is in. At the end of the
      study the participant will be offered three months of follow-up care at the Depression
      Clinical and Research Program.
