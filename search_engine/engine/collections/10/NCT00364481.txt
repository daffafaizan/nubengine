      repetitive arousals during sleep due to soft tissue collapse of the pharynx. It is associated
      with chronic daytime fatigue, insomnia, cold extremities, low blood pressure, orthostatic
      intolerance, headaches/migraine/TMJ, and various gastrointestinal condition. Obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA) is different in that once obstruction of the pharynx occurs, there are
      multiple periods of complete (apnea) or incomplete cessation of breathing (hypopnea).
      Untreated, it has been strongly associated with daytime sleepiness, hypertension, depression,
      coronary artery disease, stroke, and even death. One possible mechanism of pharyngeal
      obstruction is that the posterior tongue is susceptible to collapse when supine during sleep,
      which causes further collapse of the soft palate and related structures. Acid reflux is also
      known to frequently coexist with UARS and OSA, possibly by increasing upper airway edema and
      inflammation. Treating OSA has been shown to improve reflux symptoms, and vice versa. Tongue
      exercises are also found to improve snoring and reflux symptoms. This study aims to validate
      via pre and post treatment polysomnograms, the effectiveness of tongue exercises alone, acid
      reflux treatment alone, or a combination of both regimens. Twenty-five patients will be
      randomly assigned to each of the three groups. Measurements include the percent improvement
      of major sleep indices within each group, as well as between groups. Quality of life
      variables as well as acid reflux symptom scores will be addressed as well.
