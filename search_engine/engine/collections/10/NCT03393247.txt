      reliable drugs in Crohn's disease (CD). About one-third of the patients would develop a
      secondary lost of response after initiating IFX therapy in one year follow-up.
      Immunosuppressor was thought to be a useful agent to reduce loss of response rate of
      infliximab.But It remain unclear when should us add immunosuppressor during infliximab
      therapy.This study aim to find the most valuable timepoint to initiate combination therapy to
      maximize therapeutic effect and minimize the adverse effect.
