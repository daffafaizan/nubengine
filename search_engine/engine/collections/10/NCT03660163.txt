      primary root treatments. The samples were analyzed using a fluorescent spectrometer and a
      molecular fluorescent vital dye (Calcein AM).

      Pre-operative and 1-year post-operative periapical radiographs and Cone Beam Computed
      Tomography (CBCT) scans were assessed by two calibrated expert examiners to evaluate the
      outcome of the root canal treatments.

      The use of a chairside bacterial stain can allow the clinician to predict the outcome of
      treatment with confidence. Sampling the root canal space with endodontic paper points
      followed by ex-situ fluorescent staining and analysis provides a patient-friendly, simple to
      use and rapid way of predicting root canal treatment outcome.
