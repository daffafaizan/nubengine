      levels of nevirapine in the neonate at the time of exposure to HIV-1 during parturition,
      decreasing the neonate's risk of infection.

      Pregnant women in active labor receive single doses of oral nevirapine. The neonates of the
      first 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) mothers receive no drug, while the neonates of the
      second 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) patient cohort receive a single dose of nevirapine.
      If neonatal antiviral levels of nevirapine are not sustained for 7 days after the single
      dose, a third cohort of 4-6 (PER AMENDMENT 8/27/96, was 4) pregnant women will receive a
      single dose of nevirapine and their neonates will receive multiple doses of nevirapine to
      maintain an antiviral effect for 7 days.
