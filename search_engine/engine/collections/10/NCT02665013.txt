      provided with individually customized vaccine- related information that addresses their
      unique concerns, values, questions and logistical barriers. Message tailoring is an
      evidence-based health messaging strategy that has been shown to improve compliance with a
      wide variety of preventive health care behaviors among diverse patient populations.

      In this three-armed trial the investigator will examine how providing mothers with multiple
      "doses" of a tailored versus untailored version of our intervention compares with "usual
      care" for the impact on infant under-vaccination. Secondary outcomes will include maternal
      vaccine-related attitudes (including level of vaccine hesitancy), alignment of maternal
      values with provider recommendations, and self-efficacy for overcoming logistical barriers to
      vaccination.
