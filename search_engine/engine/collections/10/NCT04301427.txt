      obese population.

      There will be at least 120 patient included. The study population will be divided in 3 groups
      according to their BMI : the first group has a BMI between 30 and 35 kg/cm² ; the second
      group has a BMI between 35 et 40 kg/cm² ; and the third group has a BMI over 40 kg/cm².

      Patients will be referred by their doctors (rheumatologist and others) to evaluate their bone
      mineral density in osteodensitometry at CHU of Reims. Patients will be informed of the aim of
      the study by the prescriptor of the osteodensitometry.

      The osteodensitometry will be executed by a nurse. Patients will have to complete a
      questionnaire about their medical history and their medications.

      Bone mineral density will be measured twice in osteodensitometry, at the lumbar spine, the
      hip and the femur. This exam lasts approximately 40 minutes.

      Then the smallest significant value will be determined by comparing each measure for every
      patients.
