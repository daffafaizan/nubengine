      epithelial and subepithelial fragility leading to the formation of blisters and spontaneous
      erosions on skin at the slightest contact, with possible mucosal damage.

      The Pain Medicine and Palliative Medicine Functional Unit (UFMDP) of Necker Hospital is
      involved on a daily basis in supporting the complex and multidisciplinary management of
      patients with the most serious forms of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa and their family.

      The care of these patients consists of therapeutic baths leading to renew bandages that
      sometimes covering the entire integument. These are difficult, delicate and painful moments
      that patients experience daily at home.

      The medical and paramedical professionals, from the UFMDP and from the reference center for
      Genetic Diseases with Cutaneous Expression (MAGEC) (Dermatology Department) of the Necker
      Hospital, surrounding these children, note that for an unexplained reason for 70 to 80% of
      them, the weak or strong opioid analgesics, deemed necessary and prescribed for good pain
      control, are not taken on a regular basis as a premedication for baths and dressing changes.

      Care is painful, increasing the vicious circle of anxiety, conflict with caregivers, family
      and ultimately pain.

      The aim of the study is to understand the child's brakes on taking weak or strong opioid
      analgesics at the time of care and the parents' difficulties in giving these treatments by
      means of individual interviews.
