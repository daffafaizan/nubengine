      to assess the comparative bioavailability and food effect of deflazacort. A total of 45
      subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment sequences. Each dosing sequence will
      be enrolled in parallel and will receive all 5 treatments in a crossover fashion.

      Subjects will be screened within 28 days of the first dose of study drug. Subjects will check
      into the clinical pharmacology unit (CPU) on the day prior to dosing (Day -1 for Period 1)
      and will stay in-house through the 24 hour assessments in each study period. Safety
      assessments will be performed at screening, check-in for each period, and at 24 hours after
      each dose per the Schedule of Assessments .Additionally, a safety follow-up phone call will
      be performed on Day 36 (Â± 2 days).

      Subject participation is expected to last approximately 64 days, including a 28-day screening
      period and a 36-day on study period (consisting of 5 treatment periods, washout periods
      lasting 7 days, and the safety follow-up phone call).
