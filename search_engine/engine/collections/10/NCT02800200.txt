    
      We perform a prospective randomized, double-blinded study to investigate the combined effect
      of PRP and ESWT in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.

      Patients were randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention
      group received sono-guided injection with 3cc PRP and one-session active ESWT and control
      group received sono-guided injection with 3cc PRP and one-session sham ESWT. The evaluation
      was performed pretreatment as well as on the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24 week after the
      treatment.
