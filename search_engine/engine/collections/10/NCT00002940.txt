      hydroxyurea. II. Investigate whether levels of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the blood or
      cerebral spinal fluid are correlates of PCNSL disease activity.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label pilot study. Patients receive oral hydroxyurea tid. A course
      of hydroxyurea consists of 4 weeks of therapy. On day 28, after the first course of
      treatment, tumor size is analyzed by MRI. If no reduction in tumor size is seen on day 28,
      hydroxyurea dose is increased. If a CR or PR is demonstrated, patients continue on the same
      treatment at the original dose. MRI evaluation is again taken on day 56 of treatment.
      Patients with progressive disease at this evaluation are considered to have no treatment
      response.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 15-25 patients will be enrolled. Approximately 8-10 patients will be
      accrued annually.
