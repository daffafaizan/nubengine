      initiating an antibiotic therapy, both, in the ambulatory and hospital setting. Mass
      spectrometry and improved sample preparation allows same-day identification of the causing
      agent of an UTI. This could shorten the time of suboptimal and potentially harmful empirical
      therapy. Additionally adverse effects from and the development of resistance against the
      applied antibiotic agent could be diminished. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization
      (MALDI)- Time of Flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS) (MALDI-TOF MS) is already the preferred
      identification method in an increasing number of laboratories since it outperforms
      biochemical identification by speed and precision. This study tries to evaluate this new
      method to identify the causing agent of an UTI and evaluates its clinical implications.

      This research project is a clinical trial that intends to analyse urine of patients with
      suspected urinary tract infections by mass spectrometry. This patient material is
      conventionally processed and not retrieved particularly for study purposes. Health-related
      personal data is collected from patients on the wards of the Clinic for Internal Medicine at
      the University Hospital Basel that have a urine sample analysed during the study period. No
      health-related personal data is particularly collected for this study.
