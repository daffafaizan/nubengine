      selectivity ratio of 1620:1 that provides analgesic and anesthetic effects . Dexmedetomidine
      has various clinical uses in anesthesia such as sedation, and prolongation of the duration of
      postoperative analgesia when used as an adjuvant through intrathecal, epidural, or
      intravenous routes.

      Magnesium sulphate is another commonly used drug in anesthesia. Magnesium sulphate suppresses
      nociceptive impulses through inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels and through
      antagonism of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.

      Although both drugs were reported to prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia, no studies to
      the best of our knowledge had compared the analgesic and hemodynamic profile of both drugs
      when used as intravenously during spinal anesthesia.
