      optimal treatment interventions, these studies will provide critical data needed to identify
      optimal treatment strategies for this severe co-morbid disease using state- of- the- art
      endpoints of BMD, bone microarchitecture and strength. Although both low IGF-1 and
      hypogonadism are associated with increased skeletal fragility in AN, the mechanisms by which
      these factors interact are incompletely understood. Specifically, the increased skeletal
      fragility that is associated with AN is poorly reflected by DXA-derived BMD. Furthermore, the
      magnitude and mechanisms by which IGF-1 deficiency and hypogonadism influence bone
      microarchitecture are not defined. The growing incidence of eating disorders in adolescent
      girls and their long-term effects on skeletal health provide strong rationale for studies
      that will provide a better understanding of these issues and the evaluation of rational
      therapeutic approaches. The studies described in this proposal utilize both cross-sectional
      and RCT approaches to achieve this goal. Additionally, our utilization of sophisticated
      techniques such as high resolution peripheral QCT (HR-pQCT) will improve our understanding of
      the relationship between IGF-1, gonadal steroids and bone quality and will aid in the
      development of effective therapies in the treatment of skeletal fragility in Anorexia
      Nervosa.
