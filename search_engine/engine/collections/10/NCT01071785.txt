      components (International Diabetes Federation-2005 and WHO): blood pressure, plasma glucose,
      triglycerides, HDL, central obesity (waist, BMI),and albuminuria. Secondary objectives are:
      effect of guar gum on serum fatty acids, , PCR, endothelin 1, and fibrinogen. Primary
      outcomes were alterations on MS components.

      Forty-four type 2 diabetic outpatients were included in a randomized clinical trial:
      treatment 1- guar gum (10g/day) + usual diet; treatment 2- usual diet. The duration of each
      treatment was six weeks. Three days weight diet records with concurrent 24h urinary
      collections (protein intake estimative), clinical and laboratory evaluation were performed at
      baseline and after 4 and 6 weeks. Serum fatty acids were measured in total triglycerides
      fractions by gas chromatography.
