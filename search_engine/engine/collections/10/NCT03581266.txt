      arrival, catheters are inserted into a forearm vein of each arm for blood sampling and
      isotope infusion, respectively. A primed followed by a constant-rate infusion of [6,6-2H2]
      glucose are administered. The enrichment of [6,6-2H2] glucose in the blood is then measured
      at different time points after the breakfast. The glucose kinetics can be calculated from
      this.
