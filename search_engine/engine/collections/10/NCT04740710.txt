      the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of a 5-day breathing and attention training (BAT)
      in a sample of 30 adults with cLBP. The secondary objective is to explore preliminary
      clinical efficacy and potential mechanisms of the breathing interventions (focused-BAT and
      standard-BAT), by examining changes in clinical pain outcomes and potential pain-related
      psychological, physiological, and behavioral mediating variables. Both interventions will be
      delivered via an audio recording in order to standardize the interventions across
      participants and to enhance treatment fidelity. Results from this study will inform the
      successful design and implementation of a larger RCT and provide preliminary evidence
      regarding the potential efficacy of this breathing intervention for people with cLBP.
