      the management of childhood atopic dermatitis among pediatricians in Thailand.

      Objective: In order to learn about basic knowledge, natural history, evaluation, diagnosis,
      treatment and prevention for childhood atopic dermatitis in Thailand

      Methods: 900 self-administered questionnaires were randomly mailed to pediatricians
      throughout Thailand, asking about their preferences in the management of childhood atopic
      dermatitis. One hundred and eighty-five of these 900 questionnaires were returned (a response
      rate of 20.6%)
