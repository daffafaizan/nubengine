        1. HEPILOR arm: patients received ZLC solution

        2. Placebo arm: patients received a placebo solution Toxicity was assessed weekly in all
           patients immediately before or after the RT session. Acute toxicity was defined as
           occurring during RT or in 30 days after it ended and assessed using the Common
           Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4.0 scale). Dysphagia was assessed weekly
