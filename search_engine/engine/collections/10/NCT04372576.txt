      (SARS-CoV-2) became a pandemic affecting thousands of individuals worldwide. A considerable
      proportion of CoViD-19 patients require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), although
      limited data are available on their clinical characteristics and course. The results of
      retrospective studies indicate older age, presence of comorbidies and secondary infections as
      predictors of mortality among this population. Further evaluation regarding ICU clinical
      course and predictors of mortality is needed.

      The aim of this study is to determine the risk factors for development of VAP and to identify
      the prognostic factors of VAP among CoViD-19 patients.
