    
      This will be an open label Phase I/II dose escalation study evaluating the combination of the
      CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PD-0332991) and the MEK inhibitor PD-0325901. To determine the
      maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), a 3+3 dose escalation
      protocol will be undertaken. Once the RP2D has been determined, the study will then evaluate,
      in a randomized phase II study design, the combination of palbociclib and PD-0325901 compared
      to PD-0325901 alone and palbociclib alone in KRAS mutant NSCLC.

        -  Phase 1: The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can
           be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that
           have cancer, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same
           dose of the study drug. The dose the participant receives will depend on the number of
           participants who have been enrolled in the study before and how well the dose has been
           tolerated.

        -  Study Drug(s): The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each
           treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which time you will be taking
           the study drug for 3 weeks at a time. The participant will take Palbociclib by mouth
           once a day, every day for 3 weeks. The participant will take PD-0325901 by mouth twice a
           day, every day for 3 weeks.

        -  Clinical Exams: During all cycles the participant will have a physical exam and will be
           asked questions about general health and specific questions about any problems that they
           might be having and any medications they may be taking.

        -  Scans (or Imaging tests): The investigators will assess the participant's tumor by
           either a CT scan or MRI

        -  Blood Tests: These are special tests to check the amount of drug and the amount of tumor
           DNA in the participant's blood at specific points in time.

      Phase II Outcomes:

        -  Determine the response rate, as determined by RECIST 1.1, of the combination of
           palbociclib and PD-0325901 to that of palbociclib or PD-0325901 as single agents in
           patients with advanced KRAS mutant NSCLC

        -  Further evaluate the safety, tolerability and side effect profile for the combination of
           palbociclib and PD-0325901 Phase II Secondary Outcomes

        -  Determine the rate of progression free survival â‰¥ 4 months and the median PFS for the
           combination of palbociclib and PD-0325901 compared to palbociclib or PD-0325901 as
           single agents in KRAS mutant NSCLC
