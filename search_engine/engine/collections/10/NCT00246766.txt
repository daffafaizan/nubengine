      movements from 28 weeks of amenorrhea on a fetus presenting in fetal distress.

      The fetal rhythm will be recorded during 24 hours and a correlation between maternal and
      fetal movements will be studied.

      Specific measures:

        -  The fetal heart rate

        -  The number and extent of fetal movements
