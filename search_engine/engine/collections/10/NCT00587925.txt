      treatment. The hypothesis of this study is that adjuvant chemotherapy increases the risk of
      osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The objective of this pilot study is to describe the
      effects of chemotherapy on bone mineral density and serum markers of bone metabolism.

      There is limited data on the change in bone mineral density due to chemotherapy in
      postmenopausal women. This prospective study will gather data on the effects of systemic
      breast cancer therapy on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant care
      for early stage (0, I, II or III) breast cancer. Postmenopausal women are the focus of this
      study because: (1) they are the largest subgroup of women with breast cancer (2) they are
      expected to have a rate of BMD loss unless disturbed by disease or medications, unlike the
      pre and perimenopausal women whose BMD is dramatically affected by changes in hormonal status
      (3) this group of patients is at greatest risk for acute osteoporotic fractures.
