      antigen, urologists continue to see considerable numbers of patients with locally advanced
      prostate disease. There is a higher risk of treatment failure in any patient with a tumor
      that extends through the prostate capsule, more aggressive pathology (Gleason score of 7 or
      higher), or patients with a PSA of greater than 10 ng/ml. The rationale for adding molecular
      targeted drugs such as Cetuximab (epithelial growth factor inhibitor), with or without
      chemotherapy such as Docetaxel, is that such therapy has the potential to demonstrate tumor
      shrinkage of the prostate and, in addition, micrometastatic cells. Cetuximab alone or
      Cetuximab plus Docetaxel utilizing the preprostatectomy model, with the adjuvant delivery of
      Cetuximab for 6 months, will provide data for the following points:

        1. demonstration of a PSA response prior to prostatectomy;

        2. demonstration whether a change in the natural history, with a delay in the onset of
           metastatic disease in patients with advanced local prostate cancer, can be achieved;

        3. laboratory and tissue correlation to assess changes in proliferative, apoptosis, and
           pathologic parameters; and

        4. metabolic imaging utilizing CT-PET with FDG to assess whether this will be a useful
           modality in exhibiting a response to therapy, compared with conventional radiographic
           imaging.

      This will provide the basis for future development of neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to
      prostatectomy.
