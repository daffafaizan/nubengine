      transthoracic fine-needle aspiration was validated by a phase I study. To further investigate
      the non-inferiority of navigational template-guided lung biopsy to conventional CT-guided
      modality in terms of diagnostic yield, this prospective, randomized, controlled,
      noninferiority trial was conducted.
