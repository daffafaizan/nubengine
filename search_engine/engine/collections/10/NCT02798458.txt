      prominent and, although typically non life-threatening, can frequently cause significant
      morbidity and burden in a patient with Fabry disease. Additional in depth understanding of
      gastrointestinal symptoms pathophysiology in Fabry disease is acutely needed in order to
      develop more specific evaluation of the symptoms and advance the treatment of these patients.

      Hypothesis: Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms will have delayed motility on the
      SmartPill study, abnormal histologic findings on mucosal resection and symptoms that
      correlate with abnormal histologic and SmartPill findings. By gaining additional insight into
      the characterization of symptoms and the relationship to dysmotility, we anticipate improved
      and more focused adjunct therapies for the patients.

      Methods: This study will consist of a screening visit, a SmartPill testing procedure visit,
      and a follow up visit for all subjects enrolled in the study. Fifteen of these patients, who
      clinically warranted sigmoidoscopy, will be asked to also complete an endoscopic mucosal
      resection (EMR) visit in addition to the other aspects of the study. Thus, each subject will
      report to the study site for at least 3 visits and up to 4 visits.
