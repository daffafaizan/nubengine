      circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, continuous complex-fractionated electrogram
      (CFE) ablation and linear ablation was performed by the same operator. The procedural end
      point was termination of persistent AF by catheter ablation, either by conversion directly to
      sinus rhythm or to atrial tachycardia. Left atrial appendage (LAA) peak flow velocities were
      measured with transesophageal echography and averaged within each RR interval of 10
      consecutive cardiac cycles.
