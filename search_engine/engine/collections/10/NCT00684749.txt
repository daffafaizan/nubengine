      augmentations a month and to collect data on at least 300 patients. The enrollment period
      will be 3 months.

      As part of this study, we are having the following steps performed:

        1. Complete a 'general preference questionnaire', designed to document current preoperative
           planning and assessment methods for breast augmentation.

        2. For each study patient, a pre-operative "BodyLogic"TM worksheet will be completed. Then,
           using the provided Implant Selection Booklet, the actual implant will be selected. The
           surgeon will maintain a key of the patients, and will identify them to the investigators
           only by subject number, and return these forms in provided stamped, self-addressed
           envelopes.

        3. The patient returns at 1-3 months and 8-12 months for completion of the respective
           "Body-Logic" post-operative worksheets for each visit and the surgeon will send us the
           data in the provided envelopes periodically.

        4. If during the course of the data collection, the surgeon has to re-operate on any
           patient, he/she will fill the "re-operative form" and send it to us.

        5. Finally, the surgeon will complete a post-study evaluation questionnaire to help us
           understand how the "BodyLogic"TM System worked for him/her and how it could be improved.
