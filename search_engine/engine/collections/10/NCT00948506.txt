      of topical cidofovir for the prevention of hair growth. This proof of concept study will
      evaluate 1% and 3% cidofovir in petrolatum topically applied once a day to the target
      treatment area on the hair bearing area of the face known as the beard area. This target area
      will be of a circular shape with a diameter of three centimeters along the jaw line of one
      side of the face.The first 14 enrolled subjects in the study will be randomized in a 1:1
      fashion to receive either 1% topical cidofovir and placebo or 3% topical cidofovir and
      placebo. The last cohort of subjects to be enrolled in the study to achieve a total of 16
      evaluable subjects will all receive the 3% formulation and placebo. Subjects will also be
      randomized as to which side of their face (left or right) will receive active drug versus
      placebo.

      Subjects will be treated for up to eight weeks. Any subject who achieves 100% alopecia (which
      corresponds to a 0 on the PGA of Hair Density) in the treated area prior to eight weeks will
      be classified as a responder and will discontinue active treatment and begin the four week
      observation period. From the time of discontinuing treatment, subjects will be followed for
      four weeks during which time safety data will be collected.
