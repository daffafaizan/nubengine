      against bone density as measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT).

      Secondary objective: To validate the performance of human saliva sample analyzer LFA
      technique against salivary ELISA method (gold standard).

      Number of sites: Single site at the University of Mississippi Medical Center

      The purpose of this prospective Phase II observational study is to further refine a
      proprietary device and test it in a screening population composed of women 50 years of age or
      older who are at risk for low bone density or osteoporosis (N=200). After screening for
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and obtaining informed consent, participants will provide a
      salivary sample and will undergo quantitative computed tomography (QCT) at the same visit
      (Visit 1, Day 0). No additional visits are planned. Bone mineral density (BMD) will be
      measured by diagnostic radiologists using QCT techniques and serve as the gold standard for
      the study. Salivary samples will be analyzed by a lab at UMMC for concentrations of
      osteocalcin (OC) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
      techniques, while blinded to BMD measurements. De-identified and coded salivary sample will
      be shipped to IOS who will measure concentrations of OC and DPD using lateral flow assay
      (LFA), while blinded to BMD measurements.
