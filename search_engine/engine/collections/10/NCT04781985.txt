    
      Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the gold standard surgical therapy for
      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) owing to senile prostatic enlargement. Following TURP,
      LUTS may persist in a percentage of patients. Persistent LUTS necessitates proper evaluation
      and management (1).

      In a rare case report, delayed occurrence of storage and obstructive voiding symptoms after
      TURP can be caused by dystrophic calcification of the prostatic resection cavity and might be
      misinterpreted as post-TURP infection. The mechanism of dystrophic calcification entails
      minimizing tissue trauma by cautious removal of calcifications rather than performing
      extensive Re-TURP (2).

      In our case, a rare presentation of storage LUTS as result of prostatic cavity stone
      extending into the bladder with same continuum, elicite the core issue of post TURP storage
      LUTS.
