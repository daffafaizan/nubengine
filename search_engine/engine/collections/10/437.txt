175. lysozyme in bonemarrow and periph-eral blood cellsby means of an indirecthistochemical technique,the intracellular lysozyme ofthe formed elements of theperipheral blood and bone marrowwas estimated.  evi-dence is presented that monocytes,as well as matureneutrophils and their precursorsextending back to theprogranulocyte, contain significantamounts of this en-zyme.  a rare mature eosinophildemonstrated a traceof lysozyme activity.  there wasno evidence of lyso-zyme activity in basophils,erythrocytes, megakaryo-cytes, platelets, plasmacells, tissue mast cells orbone marrowreticuloendothelial cells.
