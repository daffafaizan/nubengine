      advocates of ERBT have three goals: to improve resection quality, lower perioperative
      complication rates, and decrease recurrence rates at resection sites. The present study is
      the first to compare the results of laser and electric en bloc resection of bladder cancer
      with respect to the aforementioned goals.

      we aimTo compare the clinical outcome in the form of safety and efficacy between Holmium and
      bipolar transurethral en bloc resection of urinary bladder tumors.
