    
      A cross sectional study to compare the best approach to migraineurs evaluation. For this,
      healthy individuals, after reading and signing the free and informed consent will be
      submitted to a single session to obtain the normal neurophysiological endpoints and thus
      compare with those obtained in individuals with migraineurs volunteers. All volunteers
      (healthy and migraineurs) will be submitted to a neurophysiological evaluation through
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). A visual
      stimulation will be delivered during the assessment of habituation through visual evoked
      potential volunteers (VEP-habituation) and the following measures will be evaluated before
      and after visual stimulation: (i) Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP); (ii) Motor Threshold (MT);
      (iii) Short Interval Cortical Inhibition (SICI); (iv) Intracortical Facilitation (lCF) and
      (v) Phosphene Threshold (PT).
