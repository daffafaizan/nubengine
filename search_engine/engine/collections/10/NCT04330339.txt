        -  It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.

        -  Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments prior to starting the
           intervention.

             -  Baseline assessments include measurements of weight, height, quality of life,
                fatigue, mood, levels of physical activity, and blood markers.

             -  Assessments will be repeated at the completion of the 12-weeks
