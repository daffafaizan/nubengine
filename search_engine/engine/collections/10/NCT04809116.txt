      There is evidence to suggest that pimavanserin, a medication approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease, may improve deep sleep
      and insomnia. This proof-of-concept study preliminarily assesses the feasibility of
      open-label, fixed-dose pimavanserin 34mg at bedtime for 6 weeks for the treatment of chronic
      insomnia in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
