      in addition to routine care is more effective than routine care for the treatment of
      ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in patients with implantable cardioverter
      defibrillators (ICDs) who continue to have episodes of VT despite drug therapy and when
      appropriate, at least one catheter ablation procedure.

      The CSD procedure involves removal of part of the cervical stellate ganglia and thoracic
      ganglia of level 2 to 4. These ganglia house the left and right sided nerves that feed the
      heart and have been implicated in the occurrence of fast abnormal rhythms that cause
      defibrillator shocks and sudden death. Stimulation of these nerves has been shown to increase
      the incidence of sudden death and fast abnormal heart rhythms that lead to internal
      defibrillator shocks called ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. Removal of the
      ganglia of these nerves in animal and human studies has been shown to decrease the incidence
      of life threatening abnormal rhythms and sudden death.The procedure takes less than 45
      minutes on each side and can be performed endoscopically.

      We are inviting patients to participate in this clinical trial who have undergone at least
      one catheter ablation procedure for ventricular tachycardia but have continued to experience
      recurrent arrhythmias (ICD shocks) or who have a type of ventricular tachycardia or
      fibrillation that can not be treated with catheter ablation procedures. Patients will be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either routine care + cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) or
      routine care without cardiac sympathetic denervation. We are asking 40 individuals
      (approximate age range 18-80 years) who continue to experience ICD shocks to participate in
      this research study but only half these individual will be randomized to cardiac sympathetic
      denervation (CSD) surgery.
