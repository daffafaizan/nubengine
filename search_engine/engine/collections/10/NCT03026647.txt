      approximately 1 out of 3 births are completed by cesarean delivery. In 2014, 1,284,551
      cesarean deliveries were performed. Unfortunately, even with this being a very common
      procedure some surgical topics have not been fully evaluated. One of these topics is the
      choice of suture for repair of the hysterotomy (uterine) incision. Several suture materials
      are available, yet only polygatactin-910 and catgut have been evaluated in a single study. In
      this study, only surgery complications were evaluated. Catgut was found to be associated with
      less risk of receiving a blood transfusion, otherwise no differences were found. One of the
      most common suture materials used at our institution is poliglecaprone 25, however no long
      term studies have been completed for this indication. In addition, no studies have evaluated
      the risk of uterine rupture with trial of labor after cesarean after using poliglecaprone 25
      to repair the hysterotomy. This information could be very useful in counseling for patients.
      As the cesarean delivery rates continue to climb, information on appropriate technique for
      surgery are needed.
