      reproduction. Complications of OHSS include vascular thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, renal
      failure, electrolyte disturbances, ascites, hydrothorax ,torsion of the ovary, abortion or
      rarely death.

      Previous studies revealed that converting a long GnRH agonist cycle to an GnRH antagonist
      cycle (GnRH antagonist rescue) reduced the risk of OHSS. Other studies revealed that
      cabergoline (potent dopamine receptor agonist on D2 receptors)was effective in preventing
      OHSS.

      The aim of study is to compare the efficacy of GnRH antagonist rescue combined with
      cabergoline with cabergoline in the prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in high
      risk patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF-ET with long GnRH agonist protocol.
