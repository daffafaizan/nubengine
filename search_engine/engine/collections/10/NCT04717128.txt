      of Nursing (JHUSON), and Michigan State University (MSU) are collaborating with
      LiquidGoldConcept (LGC), a company focusing on simulation-based training in maternal-child
      care, to evaluate the impact of high-fidelity simulation on health professional learner
      outcomes. For the Phase I SBIR, LGC is developing a high-fidelity newborn simulator for
      healthcare professional education in clinical lactation.

      Evaluating newborn positioning and attachment is a key skill for maternal-child healthcare
      providers. Trainees have limited opportunities to practice this skill in their clinical
      rotations due to a lack of access to lactating patients. Thus, positioning and attachment
      training is traditionally conducted through passive modalities, primarily videos.

      Investigators aim to evaluate the impact of an interactive breastfeeding skills workshop
      using a baby doll on health professional learners' ability to identify effective and
      ineffective positioning and attachment at the breast.
