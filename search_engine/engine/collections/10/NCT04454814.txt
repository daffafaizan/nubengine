      occurrence and intensity of postoperative pain in patients with asymptomatic mandibular molar
      teeth with periapical lesions.A hundred twenty patients who had an asymptomatic mandibular
      molar teeth with periapical lesion were included. For each patient, teeth were prepared with
      Reciproc Blue or Protaper Universal instruments. Each tooth was obturated with gutta-percha
      and resin-based sealer using single cone technique for mesial roots and for distal roots
      single cone and cold lateral compaction technique. Root canal treatment was performed in a
      single visit. Postoperative pain was assessed as no, mild, moderate, or severe at 6, 12, 24,
      48, 72 hours and 7 days after obturation.For the comparison of pain scores between the tested
      instrumentation systems, the Mann Whitney test was used. Differences between postoperative
      pain intencity for each instrumentation technique, at different time intervals, were assessed
      by the Friedman test. For the association of pain and an analgesic intake with gender, the
      chi-square test was performed. For the association of pain with age and an analgesic intake
      were calculated using Mann Whitney test. A P value < .05 or less was considered significant.
