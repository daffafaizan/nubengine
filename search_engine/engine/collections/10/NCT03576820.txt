      provide fast-acting pain relief in pediatric patients presenting with migraine to an urban
      pediatric emergency department (ED). Typically, abortive therapy for migraine in many
      emergency departments begins with oral analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
      However, many patients with inadequate pain relief after oral analgesics will require
      intravenous (IV) medications to abort their migraine symptoms. These medications can take up
      to thirty minutes or more for the onset of action to begin, potentially leaving patients in
      significant pain during that time. Also, obtaining IV access in children can be
      time-consuming and technically difficult, further delaying time to pain relief. Subjects will
      be given either intranasal lidocaine or placebo while awaiting IV placement and IV
      metoclopramide administration. Pain scales and associated migraine symptoms will be compared
      between the two arms before study medication administration and again at 5, 10, and 20
      minutes.
