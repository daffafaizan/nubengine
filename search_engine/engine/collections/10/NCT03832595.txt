      Health Management (PHM) intervention to improve the delivery of evidence-based Chronic Kidney
      Disease (CKD) care in patients with high-risk CKD. Investigators will perform a 42-month
      pragmatic, cluster randomized (at the practice level) controlled trial in 1,650 patients with
      high-risk CKD (as defined by validated risk prediction models or by current estimated
      Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) value or recent decline in eGFR values) managed by their
      Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) to determine whether EHR-based PHM improves key processes of
      care and clinical outcomes.

      The investigators hypothesize that EHR-based PHM will improve hypertension control, use of
      renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), and avoidance of renally
      contraindicated medications (Aim 1a-1c) and delay CKD progression (Aim 2).

      Investigators will also characterize the acceptability and experience of Primary Care
      Physicians (PCPs) in the intervention arm of the CKD PHM study (Aim 3).
