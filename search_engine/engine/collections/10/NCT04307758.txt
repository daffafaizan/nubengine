      "break test" and the "make test" . During these tests, the examiner and subject play opposite
      roles. During the make test, the subject applies maximal force against the examiner and the
      position is maintained by the examiner. During the break test, the subject holds the position
      of the muscle being evaluated and the examiner pushes until the subject's maximal force is
      overcome. In the two tests, force is applied differently; the dynamometer receives different
      amounts of force, and different results may be generated. Therefore, the aim of this study
      was to compare the reliability of intrinsic foot muscle strength assessment with break and
      make test in healthy young subjects.
