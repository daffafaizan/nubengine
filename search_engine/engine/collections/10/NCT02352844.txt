      common and overlapping pathways. Somatic inactivating mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex
      1 (TSC1) gene were recently identified as potential markers of response to mTOR therapy.
      Everolimus is an oral derivative of rapamycin. At the cellular and molecular level,
      everolimus acts as a signal transduction inhibitor, and selectively inhibits mTOR. We
      hypothesize that everolimus will exhibit clinical activity in solid malignancies harboring
      TSC1, TSC2, NF1, NF2, or STK11 mutations.
