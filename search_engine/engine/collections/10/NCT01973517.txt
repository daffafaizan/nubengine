      Feraheme (ferumoxytol) is FDA-approved for iron supplementation and is composed of iron oxide
      nanoparticles classified among the ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxides (USPIO). After
      IV injection, the particles are taken up by the monocyte-macrophage system and can also be
      used to track macrophage infiltration by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after systemic
      injection owing to the strong image contrast of the iron-loaded macrophages. Approximately 24
      hours after their IV injection, free particles are cleared from the circulation and MR signal
      alterations are thought to arise from the capture of particles by circulating phagocytic
      cells that are attracted to inflammatory lesions.

      In this project we hypothesize that Feraheme could become a sensitive and specific marker of
      active inflammation in multiple sclerosis. We will explore this hypothesis by taking
      advantage of ultra high field strength (7T) MRI to further increase the effectiveness of the
      contrast agent Feraheme at revealing inflammatory activity.
