      average, half of all HIV-infected persons suffer pain. Chronic pain can lead to heavy alcohol
      use among HIV-infected persons, which may in turn be a barrier to treatment/control of HIV
      and contribute to spread of HIV. Thus there is an urgent need to address pain among persons
      with HIV. Opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone and nalmefene, which are licensed
      for treatment of alcohol use disorders, show promise as being effective and safe treatments
      for chronic pain among persons with HIV. This study will pilot test novel pharmacotherapies
      (opioid receptor antagonists) to improve chronic pain among HIV-infected heavy drinkers. The
      specific aims of the research is to assess the feasibility, tolerability and safety of using
      opioid receptor antagonists (low-dose naltrexone and nalmefene) to treat pain among
      HIV-infected persons with heavy alcohol use and chronic pain.
