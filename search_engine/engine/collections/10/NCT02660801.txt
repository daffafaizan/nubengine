      mobilization, there is no study that compares the neuromechanical effects of these manual
      therapies in a experimental context and with the standardization of both interventions.
      Therefore, the objective of the present study is to compare the neuromechanical responses to
      spinal manipulation (low-amplitude and high-velocity dynamic thrust) and spinal mobilization
      (repetitions of a low-amplitude and low-velocity nonthrust movement) in participants with and
      without chronic nonspecific back pain.
