    
      In Module 1 Part A (dose-setting), this study module will initially explore once weekly
      administration of AZD4573 at up to three target dose levels in combination with oral
      acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily and will enroll participants with Diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL), based on the observation of complete and partial responses amongst DLBCL
      patients treated with monotherapy. The primary objective of Part A will be to identify the
      maximum tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for further evaluation in Part
      B.

      In Module 1 Part B (expansion), separate expansion cohorts for participants with Germinal
      Centre B-cell (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL subtypes will be opened at the RP2D.
