      were involved . They were grouped in to two groups. Group I included ten intrabony posterior
      defect received beta tri calcium phosphate (β TCP) bone substitute. Group II included ten
      posterior intrabony periodontal defect and they received a mixture of gingival fibroblast(GF)
      and gingival mesenchymal stem cells(GMSCs) carried on a vehicle of β TCP covered by a
      resorbable collagen membrane. CBCT was used preoperatively and after 6 months for hard tissue
      evaluation. PDGF and BMP were measured in GCF at days 1,3,7,14.
