      different types of organisms, such as bacteria and fungi. Yearly, these infections cause at
      least 2 million patients in the USA to enter the early stages of the sepsis pathology
      (pre-sepsis) which will lead to more than 750,000 cases of sepsis that can deteriorate into
      life-threatening severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and septic shock with multiple organ
      failure and result in more than 250,000 deaths per year. At present, an accurate clinical lab
      test to predict the onset of the sepsis pathology does not exist. Thus, there is a large
      unmet clinical lab need for a test that can aid physicians in assessing the risk their
      hospitalized patients have for developing the sepsis pathology. A reliable test for
      predicting very early the onset of sepsis would be a major medical breakthrough. However, a
      reference level for normal healthy individuals is needed against which plasma levels can be
      compared for increased (or decreased) levels of iNOS.
