    
      The Phase Ib study is the first clinical study with the new lung cancer vaccine CV9202. The
      vaccine is composed of 6 RNActive compounts, each encoding for a different antigen which is
      overexpressed in NSCLC compared to healthy tissue.

      In order to enhance the immunogenic effect of the cancer vaccine, the study treatment will
      include local radiation (4 x 5 Gy), which is a well-established palliative radiation regimen
      that can be safely applied to metastatic lesions in the lung, bone, and soft tissue, and is
      well tolerated.

      Patients will be enrolled into 3 strata based on histologic and molecular subtypes as
      follows:

      Stratum 1: Patients with metastatic stage IV NSCLC and non-squamous histology, without
      activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, who have achieved partial
      response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after at least 4 cycles of platinum- and
      pemetrexed-based first-line chemotherapy, and an indication for maintenance therapy with
      pemetrexed.

      Stratum 2: Patients with stage IV NSCLC and squamous cell histology, who achieved PR or SD
      after at least 4 cycles of platinum-based and non-platinum compound first-line chemotherapy.

      Stratum 3: Patients with stage IV NSCLC and non-squamous histology, harboring an activating
      EGFR mutation, who have achieved PR after up to 6 months or SD after 3 - 6 months of
      treatment with an EGFR TKI.

      In each patient, the vaccine will be administered until progression and the need to start a
      subsequent systemic second-line treatment, or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity requiring
      treatment discontinuation, whichever comes first.
