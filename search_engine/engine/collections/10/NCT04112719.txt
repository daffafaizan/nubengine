      pregnant women undergoing caesarian delivery or regional anesthesia when placed in the supine
      position. It is believed that this phenomena happens when the gravid uterus compresses the
      inferior vena cava (IVC)resulting in decreased venous return and hence cardiac output (CO)
      leading to low placental perfusion and associated fetal heart rate changes.

      Hence, due to these concerns, left lateral tilt is currently a common practice in obstetrics
      and it is believed to relief aortocaval compression and to improve blood flow to the fetus.

      Supporting evidence for this intervention remains controversial, and shows conflicting
      results. Some studies suggest that lateral tilt does not affect neonatal outcomes (1) or
      changes in cardiac output in patients with no regional anesthesia (2). While others suggest
      it can actually increase the volume of the IVC, especially when the patient is tilted 30
      degrees or more (3) and may lead to increases in CO (4).

      Non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring (NICOM, Cheetah Medical), an FDA approved device, is
      currently being used to detect changes in CO in the United States. Its use has been validated
      in different clinical settings (5,6).

      Our hypothesis is that CO is increased in pregnant women that were placed in the lateral tilt
      position.

      We intend to compare CO measurements using the non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring among term
      pregnant patients in supine vs lateral tilt position.
