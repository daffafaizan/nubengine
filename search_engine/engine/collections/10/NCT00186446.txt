      nicotine dependence (cigarette smoking) and acute depression. Participants who meet DSM-IV
      criteria for both nicotine dependence and acute major depression will be given
      pharmacological treatment for both disorders at the same time, along with a brief behavioral
      intervention for smoking cessation.
