      the treatment of locoregionally-advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), with docetaxel,
      cisplatin (DDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) shown to be an effective regimen. Capecitabine is
      the precursor drug of 5-fluorouracil, and has been used in replace of 5-fluorouracil in NPC
      patients. Nab-paclitaxel (Nab-PTX) is a novel albumin-bound paclitaxel with a superior
      therapeutic index to docetaxel. It was developed to reduce toxicities associated with
      paclitaxel whilst maintaining or improving its chemotherapeutic effect. In vivo preclinical
      experiments have shown greater volume of distribution of nab-paclitaxel than paclitaxel, with
      similar half-life and clearance. The efficacy and optimal dose of Nab-PTX combined with DDP
      as doublet has been explored in metastatic NPC patients and locoregionally advanced patients,
      and it showed encouraging anti-tumor effects and manageable toxicities. However, what is the
      optimal dose of Nab-PTX and the efficacy of it in three-drug triplet (Nab-PTX, DDP and
      capecitabine) needs to be discovered. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Nab-PTX plus cisplatin and capecitabine neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by
      cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the patients with locoregionally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, to provide new evidence for the use of Nab-PTX in NPC.
