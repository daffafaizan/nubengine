      acids (Omega-3FA) on the association between C-peptide (CP) and the glycated hemoglobin
      (HbA1c) is scarce, conflicting and nothing published in the literature review on the combined
      effect of VD3 and Omega-3FA as a combination on the association of CP with glycemic control.

      This study will be conducted to investigate the effects of (VD3) alone and as a combination
      with Omega-3FA on the association between CP as an insulin secretion marker, and glycemic
      control parameters represented by glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c), on people with vitamin D
      deficiency (VDD).

      This randomized, placebo-controlled trial is designed to test the effects of (50,000 IU VD3/
      weekly) and (300mg omega-3FA/daily) separately and as a combination for eight weeks, on the
      serum levels of CP, 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) and HbA1c. this study will be carried out
      during winter on 120 healthy Jordanian males and females with VDD with age range (25-50)
      years. Fasting serum levels for 25OHD, CP, HbA1c, PTH, Calcium, Phosphate, ALT (Alanine
      aminotransferase) and Urea were assessed at baseline and at the end of the trial.
