      heparin therapy in pregnant women with the heterozygous Factor V Leiden and G20210A
      prothrombin gene mutations thrombophilia and a history of severe preeclampsia and/or severe
      fetal growth restriction reduces the risk of the composite outcome of preeclampsia, fetal
      growth restriction, or both. We also will assess the effect of treatment on other indicators
      of maternal and neonatal complications, and the growth of fetal body composition in terms of
      fat and lean body mass.
