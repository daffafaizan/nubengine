      diameter and the absence of mechanical obstruction. Chronic megacolon in adults is an
      acquired uncommon condition that generally is associated with constipation. It has to be
      distinguished from other forms of megacolon such as acute toxic megacolon, acute non-toxic
      megacolon (OgilvieÂ´s-syndrome) and congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung disease). Regardless of
      concomitant diseases and causes, most patients with chronic megacolon were treated by
      laxative measures. Less is known about the optimal conservative therapy . If conservative
      measures fail, there are several surgical options, depending upon anorectal function.
      However, less in known about the optimal surgical therapy of patients with chronic megacolon.
      The aim of this retrospective cohort study is to analyze all available data of patients with
      chronic megacolon in three clinical centers with respect of conservative and surgical
      therapies.
