      Alzheimer's dementia and was originally described as a motor disease. The diagnosis of PD is
      still based on the core motor features of bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity,
      primarily as a result of degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. In addition to
      the classic motor symptoms, however, PD is increasingly recognized as a multisystem disorder.
      A variety of non-motor symptoms, including cognitive deficits and dementia, are commonly
      observed in patients with PD.

      In this study, we aim to investigate which intranasal insulin dose out of three doses and
      placebo, administered at three different doses or placebo over a 21-day period, is the
      optimum dosage based on safety and tolerability in Parkinson's disease. A similar design was
      used in a trial investigating intranasal oxytocin in frontotemporal dementia. Dosing for the
      first two groups of this study is based on previously conducted intranasal insulin studies in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using daily doses on 20 and 40
      IU of intranasal insulin. Higher dose have been found to be safe in healthy adults. Prior
      studies performed have demonstrated favorable effects of this regimen in the MCI/AD
      population without peripheral hypoglycemia.
