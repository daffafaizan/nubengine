    
      This trial is designed as an open-label, uncontrolled, repeated cycle trial to assess the
      non-immunogenicity and safety of corifollitropin alfa in participants undergoing repeated COS
      cycles for in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using a
      multiple dose GnRH antagonist protocol. The trial period per participant will cover 1, 2 or 3
      COS treatment cycles and no more than three (in-between two stimulation cycles) Frozen-Thawed
      Embryo Transfer (FTET) cycles following either or both of the first two treatment cycles. In
      each stimulation cycle, participants receive a single injection of corifollitropin alfa and
      one week later, treatment is continued with a daily dose of any FSH-containing preparation up
      to the day of (rec)hCG administration for final oocyte maturation. Assessment of
      anti-corifollitropin alfa antibodies and local tolerance after corifollitropin alfa injection
      are important safety endpoints in this trial.
