        1. Sport specific questionnaire, patient history and physical examinations - In our
           detailed questionnaire, specific information is collected about quantity and quality of
           training, personal and family history and presence of sport specific and general
           symptoms.

        2. Laboratory biochemical examination - Besides the regular routine laboratory parameters,
           several specific parameters associated with physical exercise are planned to be
           measured, such as cardiac biomarkers.

        3. 12-lead ECG - Resting standard 12-lead digital ECG will be recorded. Extended analysis
           will be performed according to the latest recommendations.

        4. Holter ECG - 24 hour Holter ECG will be recorded. Extended Holter ECG analysis will be
           performed.

        5. Detailed echocardiography

        6. Detailed CMR examination

        7. Body composition analysis - With a sophisticated bio-electrical impedance analysis,
           comprehensive whole body composition and hydration analysis will be performed.

        8. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing - Sport specific protocols will be used on both
           treadmill and bike ergometers.
