      primary mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is a Class I recommendation. Recent evidence
      indicates that valve replacement is at least as effective as repair in both primary and
      secondary MR patients. However, many patients are not referred for surgery as they are
      considered to be too high of a risk to undergo on-pump, open-heart procedures. Percutaneous
      aortic valve replacement has made treatment of stenosed aortic valves available to high-risk
      surgical patients who would have otherwise been medically managed. Percutaneous mitral valve
      (MV) replacement offers similar advantages. The feasibility of percutaneous MV replacement
      has been demonstrated in early feasibility studies. To meet this medical need, Caisson
      Interventional has developed a percutaneous delivery system for a bioprosthetic mitral valve.
      As with patients with aortic valve (AV) deficiencies, this device can be used to provide
      needed therapy to patients who might not otherwise receive treatment beyond medical therapy.
      This study will provide information on the safety and performance of this system.
