      to analyze the association between these hormone levels and the retrieved metaphase II
      oocytes quantity; c) to analyze the association between these hormone levels and quality
      embryo score d) to analyze the association between these hormone levels and the number of
      gestational sacs per transferred-embryo (implantation rate); e) to analyze the association
      between these hormone levels and the pregnancy rate; f) to make a prediction model for
      pregnancy rate by using a multivariable regression analysis.

      Patient participation includes signing the consent and having additional tubes of blood drawn
      at a regularly scheduled blood draw. This blood is used to run the study tests (AMH and
      inhibin levels).
