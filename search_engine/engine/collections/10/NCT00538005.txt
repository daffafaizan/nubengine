        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate when administered with
           bevacizumab and oxaliplatin.

        -  To determine the effect of this treatment regimen on the complete and partial response
           rate in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  To determine the effect of this treatment regimen on the progression-free and overall
           survival of patients with metastatic melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate followed by a phase II
      study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2
           hours on day 1. Patients also receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-14.
           Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate at the maximum tolerated dose and
           bevacizumab and oxaliplatin as in phase I.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for at least 5 years.
