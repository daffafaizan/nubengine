        1. Informed consent and permission to use or disclose you/your child's health information
           for reserve purposes will be obtained by the research team. You will receive a copy of
           the consent form.

        2. You/your child will be examined by a physician from the research team and interviewed
           about your medical background and condition every year for five years.

        3. You/your child will have photographs taken of the affected area at each visit.

        4. You/your child will have two, one time biopsies or skin samples taken by a
           dermatologist. Skin areas will be numbed with lidocaine and a 4 or 5 millimeter (or
           approximately 0.15 to 0.19 inch) sample will be taken in two different locations. The
           dermatologist taking the skin sample will use every effort to choose an area that can be
           covered by clothing or kept out of sight to others. The doctor will either use gelfoam
           or one stitch/suture per biopsy to seal off the area, which helps with healing and
           preventing bleeding. If a stitch is placed in the biopsy site, another visit about 7-10
           days following the procedure will be necessary to remove the stitch.

      5. You may still participate in the study if you consent to having only one biopsy taken of
      your affected (lesion) skin and not one of your unaffected (normal) skin.
