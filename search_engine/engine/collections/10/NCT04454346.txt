      catheter group and 76 Cook cervical riphening catheter group. All pregnant women will be
      randomly allocated into three groups: the single Foley, Double Foley Catheter or Cook balloon
      catheter. Removal of the catheters is planned approximately 12 h after insertion if
      spontaneous expulsion were occurred. The main outcome measures include changes in Bishop
      score, insertion to delivery time, mode of delivery and occurrence of adverse effects.

      Double Foley Catheter is new methot for cervical ripening that Two 18-Fr Foley catheters are
      connected with sterile suture from the hole end and where the balloons borders end. Both
      catheters are pushed above the internal cervical os the uterus. One of 18-Fr Foley catheter
      full with 60 mL of normal saline. The other Foley catheter is pulled into the vagina by
      applying traction and full with 60 mL of normal saline. The cervix between two baloons of
      Foley catheters exposed to pressure from both sides from Foley catheter's balon's similar to
      Cook baloon.
