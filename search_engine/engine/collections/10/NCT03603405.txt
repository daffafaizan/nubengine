    
      This is a prospective, phase I-II study to assess the efficacy and toxicity of HSV-tk +
      valacyclovir gene therapy in combination with radiotherapy and standard of care chemotherapy
      for anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This study is comprised of
      newly diagnosed patients with AA or GBM.

      Clinical response will be evaluated by neurological evaluation, neuropsychological testing,
      and imaging studies as well as by histological examination. Blood samples will be taken for
      systemic immunological response, blood counts, and liver functions tests. Genetic testing of
      tumor tissue will be performed, including genetic analysis and cell cultures. Toxicity will
      be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 and Radiation
      Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) neuro-toxicity scores (see Appendices). Patients will also be
      followed to assess median time to progression and median survival.
