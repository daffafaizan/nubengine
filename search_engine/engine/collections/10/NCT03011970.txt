      effects on blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD
      fMRI) in the amygdala vary as a function of dose and latency. In particular, the
      investigators plan to compare effects of three different IN-OXT doses (12, 24, and 48
      international units, IU) and three different dose-test latencies of IN-OXT administration
      (task starting at 15, 45 and 75min after administration) on established neural and
      behavioural correlates of emotion processing. As effects of OXT are particularly promising in
      autism, the investigators further want to investigate how autistic-like traits influence the
      OXT effects in exploratory post-hoc analyses
