      the recommended two hours of daily physical activity (PA). The decline in PA, increase in
      screen-based behaviors, and onset of obesity during preschool years have been linked to
      lifetime risk of obesity and related comorbidities. However, emerging evidence indicates that
      "screen time" can actually be leveraged as a tool to increase children's PA and promote
      healthy weight. Specifically, PA interventions delivered over digital devices can provide
      real-time encouragement for children to be physically active. Prior interventions delivered
      over mobile devices were effective in increasing PA levels, including our own P-Mobile study
      that provided behavioral strategies to parents of children aged 6 to 10 years.

      When considering how to support and motivate parents whose children are preschool-aged,
      teaching and modeling fundamental motor skills (FMS) are critical to enable children's PA.
      FMS like running, jumping, or throwing a ball, are basic, goal-directed movement patterns
      developed in early childhood that provide a foundation for children to be physically active
      and competent movers. These skills enable a child to function independently in their
      surrounding environment, engage with peers, and contribute to their ability to be physically
      active. Evidence has shown that children must establish a minimal level of FMS proficiency to
      continue participating in PA opportunities as they age. FMS and PA behaviors have a dynamic
      and reciprocal relationship. Children with higher levels of FMS are more physically active
      both during childhood and into adolescence. Therefore, a PA intervention for preschoolers
      should focus on developing FMS competence.
