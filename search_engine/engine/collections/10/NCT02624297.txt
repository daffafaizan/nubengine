      apnea will be studied. A healthy control, age-paired group (n=10) will be also evaluated. The
      patients will be submitted to a polysomnography and randomized for clinical follow-up or
      exercise training for four months. It will evaluated the autonomic function, chemoreflex
      control of sympathetic activity during hypoxic and hypercapnic maneuvers, endothelial
      function and inflammatory markers.
