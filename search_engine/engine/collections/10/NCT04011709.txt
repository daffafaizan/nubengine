    
      At the initial visit (Visit 1), eligible subjects (i.e., children) and their parent(s)/legal
      guardian(s) will be approached to ascertain their interest in trial participation. Interested
      subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will proceed to a nebulizer familiarization
      session. After informed consent has been obtained from the subject's parent(s)/legal
      guardian(s), the subject will proceed to Nebulization Assessment 1.

      At Nebulization Assessment 1 (Visit 1), all subjects will perform 3 attempts of 19
      inhalations, each inhalation of 3 seconds duration. Nebulization Assessment 2 (Visit 2) will
      occur 4-8 days after Visit 1. Subjects, who failed to achieve nebulization success at Attempt
      3 during Visit 1, will perform 3 attempts of 28 inhalations, each inhalation of 2 seconds
      duration at Visit 2. Subjects, who achieved nebulization success at Attempt 3 during Visit 1,
      will perform 3 attempts of 14 inhalations, each inhalation of 4 seconds duration at Visit 2.

      At each visit, Attempts 1 and 2 will be made with air only. Attempt 3 will be made with
      isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl). Nebulization success will be assessed at Attempt 3.
