      sleep restriction compared to habitual sleep on adipose tissue and skeletal muscle insulin
      sensitivity in vivo and ex vivo. The investigators will randomize up to 10 healthy
      postmenopausal women with overweight/obesity and â‰¥6.5 hours of self-reported habitual nightly
      sleep to 4 nights of each sleep condition (sleep restriction and habitual sleep). After the
      fourth night of each sleep condition, the investigators will administer a two-step
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and collect skeletal muscle and adipose tissue samples
      prior to insulin infusion.

      The overarching hypothesis is that sleep restriction will reduce skeletal muscle and adipose
      tissue insulin sensitivity compared to habitual sleep.
