    
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A (HIGH DOSE TREOSULFAN): Patients receive high dose treosulfan intravenously (IV) over
      120 minutes on days -6 to -4 and fludarabine IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -2. Patients
      then undergo total-body irradiation on day -1 and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation on day 0. Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days
      3-4. Beginning on day 5, patients receive cyclosporine IV twice daily (BID) or three times
      daily (TID) over 1-2 hours or orally (PO) (after 3 months, in the absence of GVHD,
      cyclosporine tapering will start by 5-10% per week, until drug withdrawal at 6 months
      post-transplant). Beginning on day 5, patients also receive mycophenolate sodium PO TID or
      mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO TID until day 35 (may be continued if active GVHD is present).
      Beginning on day 5, patients also receive filgrastim until the absolute neutrophil count is >
      1,000/uL for 3 consecutive days.

      ARM B (LOW DOSE TREOSULFAN): Patients receive low dose treosulfan IV over 120 minutes on days
      -6 to -4 and fludarabine IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -2. Patients then undergo
      total-body irradiation and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and receive
      cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate sodium or mycophenolate mofetil, and filgrastim
      as in Arm A.

      After completion of transplant, patients are followed up at 28, 56, 84, 365, and 730 days.
