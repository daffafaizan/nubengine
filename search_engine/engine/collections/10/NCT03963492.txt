      walking. In general, this includes training to build walking endurance by having the person
      with MS walk until he/she becomes tired and needs to stop. Although this model has been used
      successfully to treat people with other diagnoses, it has limited effectiveness in improving
      walking ability and endurance in people with MS because of fatigue. Recently, a different
      model has been considered: intermittent or interval walking training. Interval walking
      training is organized such that seated rest breaks are intentionally interspersed between
      walking training bouts that end before the person with MS becomes too tired to continue.
      Exploratory research has shown that people with MS can walk faster and farther when using
      interval walking training, and may have more improvements in walking ability and endurance
      after using interval walking training. This study will compare the effectiveness of the
      traditional model of continuous walking training to the promising new model of interval
      walking training. This will help to determine whether interval or continuous walking training
      is superior in improving walking ability and endurance in people with MS.
