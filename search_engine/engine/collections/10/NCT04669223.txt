      and its associated symptoms are frequent causes of hospitalizations and morbidities in
      patients with disseminated cancers. Chest tube drainage is often performed for symptomatic
      relief. Recent clinical trials had shown that large-bore chest drains (>14 French) caused
      significantly more pain than smaller drain during the insertion procedure and when the drain
      was in situ, which prompts the shift of preference towards smaller chest drains in guideline
      and clinical practice. Chest drains as small-bore as 7-8 French have been used in many local
      centers for drainage of MPE, though little attention has been made to the possible higher
      occurrence of drain blockage, kinking or dislodgement before optimal effusion drainage is
      achieved, which may lead to a second procedure for drain replacement. Currently, there is no
      data informing the efficacy and complications of ultra-small chest drains in clinical use.
      Therefore, it is imperative to call for further research on the optimal size of the chest
      drain which can achieve satisfactory drainage and at the same time, of minimal complications.

      Study design: Single-center, parallel group, single blinded, randomized controlled study
      Study site: Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital Target study participants: Subjects
      with symptomatic MPE requiring chest drainage

      Method and analysis: This randomized controlled study to compare the efficacy of ultra-small
      bore chest drains (8 Fr) with standard small bore chest drain (14 French) as the reference.
      Primary outcome is drain success defined by nearly complete drainage of MPE on chest
      radiograph on day 5 of the drain. Other secondary outcomes include pain according to the
      visual analogue scale, dyspnea relief and complications during the procedure and post - chest
      drain insertion.
