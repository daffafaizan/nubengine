      Primary

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of gemcitabine and topotecan in patients
           with recurrent or persistent platinum-refractory ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
           peritoneal cavity cancer.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond
      documentation of CR.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of courses 2, 4, and 6, and then at 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3
      years.
