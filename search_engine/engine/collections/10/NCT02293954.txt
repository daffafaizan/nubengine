    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ability of 64Cu labeled M5A antibody (copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal
      antibody M5A) to localize CEA positive cancers (such as gastrointestinal, lung, medullary
      thyroid and breast cancers), as determined by PET imaging.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the frequency of titer of the human anti-human antibody (HAHA) response to
      64Cu labeled M5A antibody.

      II. To determine the safety of administration of 64Cu labeled M5A antibody.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive copper Cu 64 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A intravenously (IV) on day 0
      and then undergo PET on day 1 and day 2.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.
