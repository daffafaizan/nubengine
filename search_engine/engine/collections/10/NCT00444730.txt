    
      The objective of this study is to initiate and maintain a patient information database that
      will be used to study the impact of each surgical procedure on patients' overall health,
      quality of life, and bowel/bladder/sexual function.

      The study coordinator will, on an ongoing basis, abstract needed medical information from
      inpatient hospital and physician office records for inclusion into the database.
