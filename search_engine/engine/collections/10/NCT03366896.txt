           The research panel, who consisted of experts in the clinical field of anesthesia, did
           the meticulous process of translation and cultural adaptation of 3D-CAM.

           This process included independent translation by the research panel, reconciliation of
           two independent translated 3D-CAM, ethics approval prior to pilot study on 20 relevant
           subjects, back translation into English and finalizing the Malay version of 3D-CAM for
           the next phase of testing.

        2. Testing for Validity and Reliability of the translated 3D-CAM tool

      Patients were recruited pre-operatively after reading the patient's information sheet and
      signing the informed consent.

      Post-operatively, two trained assessors separately administered the Malay 3D-CAM on the
      recruited patients. One of the trained assessors administered the original 3D-CAM on the same
      patients at a different time. Standard reference of diagnosing delirium was made by a
      psychiatrist using the DSM V criteria, after interviewing the patients.

        1. For validity, the diagnosis of delirium made using the Malay 3D-CAM tool was tested
           against the standard reference for diagnosing delirium according to the DSM V criteria
           made by a psychiatrist

        2. For inter-rater reliability, the diagnosis of delirium made by two trained assessors
           using the Malay 3D-CAM tool were statistically compared.

        3. For parallel reliability, the diagnosis of delirium made using the Malay 3D-CAM was
           compared to the original English version of 3D-CAM.
