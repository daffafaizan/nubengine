      especially cause severe sarcopenia and metabolic change. Osteoporosis after gastrectomy,
      which is characterized by both the loss of bone mass and the deterioration of bone
      architecture, is a serious complication in the long course after gastrectomy. The primary
      tools for assessing volumetric density and bone structure are quantitative computed
      tomography (QCT) and more recently, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
      tomography (HR-pQCT). However the validation of osteoporosis with HR-pQCT in the long course
      after gastrectomy remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to evaluate osteoporosis
      by using HR-pQCT in the long course after gastrectomy. In total gastrectomy and distal
      gastrectomy groups, at least 5 years should have elapsed since gastrectomy.
