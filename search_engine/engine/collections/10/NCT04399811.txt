      to the near-infrared vision to collect heat distribution information of limbs. Then, the
      machine learning method will be performed to recognize the subtle differences between images.
      Due to lack of golden standard of microcirculatory status, indirect parameters (such as
      lactate clearance, capillary refill time) and clinical outcomes will be recorded to evaluate
      the performance of maching learning model.
