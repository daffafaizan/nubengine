    
      Three blood samples per patient will be collected once at the time of progression, assessed
      by CT Scans according to RECIST criteria v.1.1 and before the patients start a new treatment
      The blood samples (5-10 mL each) will be collected in one Cell-Free DNA BCT Streck速 and 2 PTT
      EDTA K2 (BECTON DICKINSON) collection tubes.

      All samples will be labeled properly with the patient identification number and date of
      extraction. These samples will be stored and distributed through the 3 participating
      laboratories until completion of all the analyses, according to the flowchart in Figure 1.
      These samples will be registered in the samples collection of the Institute of Health Carlos
      III Registry. These samples will be kept in each participant laboratory after the completion
      of the RING study and the patient will be informed of that in the patient information sheet
      and informed consent.

      cfDNA will be extracted using as starting volume 1 ml of plasma with a Maxwell速 RSC
      instrument (Promega), using the Maxwell速 RSC cfDNA Plasma Kit (MR), as specified by the
      manufacturer or with a Qiasymphony instrument (Qiagen company). Additionally, for BEAMing
      analysis, 3 ml of plasma will be used for cfDNA isolation using the the QIAamp速 Circulating
      Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen company), following the manufacturer instructions.

      Circulating free DNA from peripheral blood sample is an adequate source for T790M resistance
      mutation testing. However, comparison across different platforms has been scarcely reported.
      Discordant results for EGFR biomarker testing could impact patient management.
