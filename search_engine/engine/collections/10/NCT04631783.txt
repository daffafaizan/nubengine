      underlying physiological abnormality and associated with higher prevalence of comorbid
      conditions such as diabetes, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Daytime sleepiness is also
      the cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. How to identify the high risks patients
      with obstructive sleep apnea for further polysomnography is a difficult problem for doctors
      in out-patient department. Different methods have been proposed for measuring sleepiness and
      the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is the measure of sleepiness most commonly used in sleep
      research and clinical settings.

      However, whether Epworth sleepiness scale is a good tool with high predictive value of
      obstructive sleep apnea is not evaluated in the population of Taiwanese. This observational
      study is set up to document these practices.
