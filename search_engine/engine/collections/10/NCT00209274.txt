    
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized study of the safety and effectiveness of an
      endovascular approach to the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation using the Evalve
      Cardiovascular Valve Repair System (MitraClipÂ® implant).

      A minimum of 279 evaluable patients randomized 2:1 to MitraClip or mitral valve surgery,
      respectively, are required to test the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints of the RCT.
      Enrollment in the RCT is now complete. 60 roll-in patients were enrolled under EVEREST II
      RCT.

      38 clinical sites throughout the US and Canada have participated in the RCT and HRR. 37 US
      sites are participating in REALISM.

      The RCT is powered to test the hypothesis MitraClip has both superiority of safety and
      non-inferiority of effectiveness compared to mitral valve repair or replacement surgery. The
      HRR is powered to show lower mortality at 30 days with the MitraClip than predicted surgical
      mortality.
