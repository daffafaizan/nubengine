    
      Study Phase I is from index procedure to 1 year. This prospective, open-label, multi-center,
      observational, single-arm study is designed to evaluate XIENCE V EECSS safety and
      effectiveness in real world settings up to 1 year after implantation. The primary endpoint is
      the stent thrombosis (definite and probable) rate up to 1 year as ARC. The co-primary
      endpoint is the composite rate of cardiac death and any MI at 1 year. Up to 8,000 patients
      are planned to be consecutively enrolled at up to 275 sites in the U.S. Clinical follow-up
      will occur at 14, 30, 180 days and 1 year.

      All patients enrolled in the XIENCE V USA who have completed Study Phase I will be evaluated
      at 1 year to determine whether they are eligible to participate in one of the following
      cohorts in Study Phase II: XIENCE V USA Long Term Follow-up (LTF) Cohort, Harvard Clinical
      Research Institute (HCRI) DAPT Cohort, or Abbott Vascular (AV) DAPT Cohort.
