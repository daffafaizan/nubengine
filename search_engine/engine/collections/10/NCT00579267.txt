    
      The MINI-KID is a short, structured diagnostic interview used to assess the presence of 24
      DSM-IV child and adolescent psychiatric disorders as well as the risk of suicide.

      To achieve adequate representation of the major psychiatric disorders and sufficient normal
      controls, we propose recruiting 230 children and adolescents (ages 6 to 17 years 11 months),
      comprised of 200 subjects identified as having one or more psychiatric disorders and 30
      normal controls in the community. These subjects will be from diverse socioeconomic, racial
      and ethnic backgrounds. We will assess the inter-rater and test-retest reliability of the
      MINI-KID and examine its validity with the "gold-standard" diagnostic interview for children
      and adolescents as well as expert opinion.
