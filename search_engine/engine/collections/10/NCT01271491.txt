      bronchiolitis to determine if genetic polymorphisms in a number of likely candidate immune
      response related genes are positively associated with respiratory failure in this population.
      Respiratory failure will be defined as requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. We
      plan to enroll two groups of children, those admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due
      to bronchiolitis (cases) and those children admitted to the ward with less severe
      bronchiolitis infection (controls). In special circumstances, we will also enroll pairs of
      twins who are hospitalized with bronchiolitis (in the ICU or the ward), for whom either one
      or both twins do not meet inclusion criteria as a case or a control and/or for whom we are
      not able to obtain a DNA blood sample while hospitalized (twin inpatient population).

      Demographic data, and data regarding the hospital treatments and course of these children
      will be collected. Blood, saliva or sputum for genotyping will also be obtained. If a patient
      enrolled as a control needs to be intubated, these children cannot be control patients, but
      instead would be considered cases.

      We propose to compare a population of 100 children with respiratory failure due to
      bronchiolitis to a population of 100 children with bronchiolitis without respiratory failure.
      Clinical characteristics and genetic markers will be compared. We will also compare clinical
      characteristics and genetic markers of any twin pairs who are enrolled.
