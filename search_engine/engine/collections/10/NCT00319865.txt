      autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplantation,it remains as a incurable disease. Most
      patients ultimately relapse. Recenlty, targeted therapy using novel agents, such as
      bortezomib and thalidomide, shows the possibility of improved in this situation. Among them,
      PAD (Velcade, Adriamycin,Dexamethasone) showed highest response rate. PAD does not show any
      cross resiatance with another effective combination, thalidomide plus dexamethasone.

      We desined prospective multicenter phase 2 study using these combination sequentially.
