      the patients with newly-diagnosed gallbladder carcinoma. The controls will be matched （1：1）by
      sex，race and age which will be selected from the patients receiving cholecystectomy due to
      gallstones from the same hospital with the cases.

      There will be 100 cases with gallbladder carcinoma, 100 controls. The investigators will
      interview participants about known and potential risk factors for gallbladder carcinoma and
      obtain information on diet. The investigators will obtain the blood and urine samples for
      further analysis of metabolomics studies. The investigators will use logistic regression to
      determine odds ratios for disease with various exposures.
