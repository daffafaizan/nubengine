      biodegradable coating sirolimus-eluting stents with Firebird2 drug-eluting stents from
      MicroPort Medical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOYA CoCr
      biodegradable coating sirolimus-eluting stents in treating coronary artery lesions.
      Appropriate patients judged by inclusion and exclusion standards will be preformed stent
      implantation, and after that all patients will be clinically followed up at 30, 90, 180,
      270,365 days,2 years,3 years,4 years and 5 years. Especially, standard quantity coronary
      angiography (QCA) will be conducted at 270 days (Â±30days) through which the main therapeutic
      indicator of late luminal loss (LLL) is obtained so as to evaluate the efficacy of tested
      stents. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) found in following-up period as key indicators
      to evaluate the safety of stents. The arrangement, conclusion and statistical analysis of
      trial data including clinography and angiography will be fulfilled by independent Data
      Management Center(DMC) and radiography core laboratory.
