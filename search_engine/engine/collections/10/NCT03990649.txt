      people with chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). This study will look at the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TAK-935 as an adjunctive therapy in participants with
      CRPS.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) in 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups-which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

      TAK-935 100 mg tablets, 100, 200 or 300 mg BID Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a
      tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      Participants will receive 100 mg TAK-935 tablets or placebo-matching TAK-935 tablets, BID for
      Week 1, 2x100 mg TAK-935 tablets or placebo-matching TAK-935 tablets, BID for Week 2 and
      followed by 3x100 mg TAK-935 tablets or placebo-matching TAK-935 tablets, BID for Week 3.
      Dose will be uptitrated based on safety and tolerability in titration period. Participants
      will continue to receive the same dose in maintenance period. Dose adjustments during
      maintenance period may take place due to safety and tolerability.

      Participants will then enter Part B (optional) or taper period. In Part B all participants
      will receive TAK-935 2x100 mg tablets, BID for 1 Week, followed by TAK-935 3x100 mg tablets,
      BID for 1 Week. Dose will be uptitrated/downtitrated based on safety and tolerability in
      titration period (Part B), participants will continue to receive the same dose in maintenance
      period (Part B) and followed by a taper period.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 36 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      and will be contacted by telephone 15 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
