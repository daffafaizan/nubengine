    
      This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study, approved by the local ethics committee
      and carried out in a single center in accordance with the ethical principles of the Helsinki
      Declaration (E-18-2165).

      The inclusion criteria of the study for patients were determined as; (a) male and female
      patients aged 18 to 60 years, (b) unilateral or bilateral subjective tinnitus, (c) with a
      history of severe subjective tinnitus for at least one year, (d) patients with severe
      tinnitus according to the THI questionnaire result (over 38 points), (e) the patients who
      could not detect etiology of tinnitus in the otolaryngology examination, (f) not having
      received any treatment within the last six months. The patients who applied to the
      otorhinolaryngology clinic of our hospital were included in the study.

      According to the randomization method, the group to which each participant was assigned was
      only known to the researcher who applied acupuncture therapy. The participants and the
      remaining researchers that administered THI to the participants were blinded to the groups.

      The data were obtained from the patients' responses to VAS and THI questionnaires. Each
      participant completed the VAS and THI questionnaires seven times during the course of the
      five-week treatment and the three-month follow-up after treatment.
