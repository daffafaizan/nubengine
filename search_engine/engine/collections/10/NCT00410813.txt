        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients with stage IV bone
           metastasis-predominant breast cancer treated with 1 of 2 treatment schedules of
           dasatinib.

        -  Compare the response rate (complete and partial, confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the MUC-1 antigen response rate (CA 15-3 or CA 27-29) in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the circulating tumor cell response rate in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the anti-osteoclast activity, as measured by changes in bone turnover markers,
           in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the frequency and severity of toxicities of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the pain profiles of these patients and explore changes over time.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      concurrent trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) treatment (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dasatinib once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily. In both treatment arms, treatment
           continues for at least 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Blood samples are acquired from patients once weekly in weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24. Samples
      are analyzed for tumor markers, circulating tumor cells, and bone markers.

      Patients complete a self-reported brief pain inventory questionnaire at baseline and once in
      weeks 8, 16, and 24.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
