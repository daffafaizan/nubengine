      Primary

        -  Assess relapse locally or remotely using biomarkers collected from primary tumor and
           blood samples from women with breast cancer during the first 2 years after diagnosis.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate all relapses.

        -  Assess survival without relapse.

        -  Determine correlation between biomarkers and relapse.

      OUTLINE: Primary tumor and blood samples collected during usual care of patients during the
      first 2 years after diagnosis are analyzed for biomarkers useful in monitoring and diagnosing
      breast cancer.
