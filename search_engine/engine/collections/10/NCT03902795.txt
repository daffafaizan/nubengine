    
      Background:

      To examine morphological and functional results after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with SF6
      gas tamponade due to macula-on and macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) during
      six months of the follow-up.

      Methods:

      The study included 62 eyes that underwent successful PPV with SF6 tamponade with macula-on
      (34 eyes) and macula-off (28 eyes) RRD preoperatively. The best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA), Amsler test, M-charts, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and microperimetry were
      performed at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
