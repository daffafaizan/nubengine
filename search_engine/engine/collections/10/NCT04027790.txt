    
      The objective of this Clinical Sample Collection Study is to develop a biobank of
      appropriately collected plasma samples from colorectal cancer patients (i.e. AJCC/UICC stages
      0, I, II, III) prior to therapeutic intervention, and from people reporting for colorectal
      cancer screening by colonoscopy, prior to bowel preparation. Samples in the colorectal cancer
      biobank will be used to: 1) assess the clinical performance of novel biomarkers for
      colorectal cancer screening; 2) develop improved processing workflows for the Epi proColonÂ®
      test; 3) develop an automated Epi BiSKit workflow.
