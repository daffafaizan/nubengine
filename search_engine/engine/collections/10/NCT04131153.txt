    
      Hepatic hemangioma is the most common benign tumor of the liver, with an incidence of 0.4-20%
      in the general population.For small and asymptomatic patients with hepatic hemangioma,
      regular reexamination is necessary without medical intervention.However, patients with giant
      hepatic hemangioma(diameter â‰¥ 5cm) may have symptoms such as abdominal pain, indigestion,
      jaundice, or rapid increase in lesion volume, or even spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage,
      which require active treatment.Currently, surgical resection is the most effective method for
      the treatment of hepatic hemangioma, but the incidence and mortality of related complications
      have been reported as high as 27% and 3% respectively

      .Other alternative therapies, such as transcatheter arterial embolization, radiotherapy and
      steroid therapy, have also been reported for the treatment of hepatic hemangioma, but the
      efficacy is not satisfactory .

      Percutaneous ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation is a safe and minimally invasive
      treatment with reliable efficacy. In recent years, this technique has been successfully
      applied in the treatment of hepatic hemangioma with a diameter of < 5cm.For huge liver
      hemangioma, however, need to use the conventional radiofrequency ablation can increase
      one-time ablation volume of radiofrequency electrode or enhance ablation power and extend the
      melting time, not only bring patients suffering discomfort, but easy to damage the adjacent
      organs, causing serious complications such as hemorrhage, perforation of gastrointestinal
      tract, acute renal failure .Therefore, the investigators have developed a new,standardized
      radiofrequency ablation for giant hepatic hemangioma to shorten the duration of treatment,
      reduce surgical complications and improve the surgical success rate.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of the new
      radiofrequency ablation (" three-step "radiofrequency ablation) in the treatment of giant
      hepatic hemangioma.
