      Vitamin D binding protein (the major transporter of Vitamin D metabolites).

      Gc, also known as Vitamin D binding protein (DBP), group specific component, or Gc globulin,
      is a 52-58 kDa multifunctional plasma protein, synthesized in the liver. The gene encoding
      for Gc is located on chromosome 4, and three common co-dominant alleles give rise to three
      phenotypes (Gc1s, Gc1f, and Gc2). Gc binds actin, recruits neutrophil leukocytes and converts
      into a macrophage- and osteoclast- activating factor. It also is the major transporter of
      Vitamin D and its' metabolites. Lauridsen et al. showed that Gc phenotype correlates with
      25(OH)D levels in a group of postmenopausal women.

      This study proposes that Gc phenotype accounts for some of the variation in response of
      25(OH)D levels after treatment with oral Vitamin D.
