      neurologic patients who will serve as contrast groups for neuropsychological studies of
      patients with schizophrenia. These include studies of Alzheimers disease to dissociate size
      and organization of lexicon and ADHD to understand error patterns on CPT-type tests of
      attention and vigilance. However, the majority of studies will examine schizophrenia in
      relation to normal controls.

      In addition, we propose to obtain test results from a local sample of normal subjects of
      varying ages and educational backgrounds to further delineate degree of impairment in these
      clinical groups. As well as assessing adults we wish to assess normal children. In
      particular, we wish to identify in children the size of their lexicon and their degree of
      semantic organization within their lexicon.
