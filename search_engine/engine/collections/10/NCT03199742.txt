      randomized (by computerized coin flip) to one of two versions of the mobile app. All versions
      of the app will provide comprehensive information and tools for managing trauma symptoms, but
      one version of the app will provide personalized, confidential coaching messages delivered by
      either a Veteran peer or clinical psychologist. Participants will be asked to complete an
      online survey before using the mobile phone application and again 8 weeks later. Participants
      will be provided with the option to complete a telephone interview after 8 weeks of using the
      mobile phone application. To be eligible, participants must be a U.S. military Veteran, age
      18 or older, have received a previous diagnosis of PTSD, and own an iPhone or iPad device.
