      and more emphasis on its comprising foods. A particular public health concern involves the
      consumption of foods that result from extensive industrial processing. Ultra-processed foods
      have become increasingly common and now contribute the majority of calories consumed in
      America. The rise in the prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome over
      the past several decades is believed to have been caused, in part, by the parallel increase
      in production, advertising, and consumption of ultra-processed foods. However, the metabolic
      effects of industrial processing per se, independent of diet calories or macronutrient
      composition, have not been carefully investigated in a controlled feeding study. Therefore,
      we will conduct an inpatient controlled feeding study in 20 overweight and obese adult men to
      investigate the changes in multi-organ insulin sensitivity and hepatic triglyceride content
      resulting from consuming two test diets for a pair of 3 week periods. The test diets will be
      implemented in a randomized, crossover design with each test diet following a 1 week run-in
      period of inpatient controlled feeding of a standard metabolic diet. The test diets will be
      matched for calories, macronutrient composition, sugar, fiber, and sodium, but one diet will
      be composed of ultra-processed foods whereas the other diet will be unprocessed foods.
      Multi-organ insulin sensitivity and hepatic triglyceride content will be measured at the end
      of each 1 week run-in period as well as at the end of each 3 week test diet period.
