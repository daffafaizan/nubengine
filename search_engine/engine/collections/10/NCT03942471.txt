      design to measure the effects of the learned MBSR intervention over time. MBSR will be the
      independent variable. Dependent variables include mindfulness, diabetic quality of life and
      HbA1c. Adolescents with Type 1 diabetes will be randomly assigned to an intervention group or
      a wait list/control group that will be taught MBSR after all data has been collected. The
      study will utilize a 2 (experimental versus wait-list control group) by 3 (pretest [Time 1],
      posttest [Time 2], and 3 month follow-up [Time 3]) to examine within and between group
      differences overtime on two psychosocial measures including mindfulness and quality of life.
      The physiological measure understudy, HbA1c, reflects glucose control over the previous three
      month period and will be measured at Time 1 and Time 3. MBSR training will be provided via an
      online website and secure data collection site called MySweetMind.org.
