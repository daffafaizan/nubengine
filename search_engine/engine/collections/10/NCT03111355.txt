      functions in human physiology.

      Selenium status can be measured by the quantification of biomarkers in the blood. Previous
      studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms can affect Se status and modulate risk for
      chronic diseases. In this study, five biomarkers will be quantified in the blood, before and
      after supplementation with Brazil nuts. The genetic variants will be used to stratify the
      biomarkers and multivariate linear regressions will be used to explore the influence of the
      polymorphisms on concentrations of the biomarkers .
