      Mirtazapine is a potent blocker of 5-HT2A receptors and was found to be effective in reducing
      the number and intensity of hot flushes in preliminary trials. Also several Selective
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and other similar compounds have been investigated to
      manage hot flushes, confirming the role of the serotonergic system. In the present trial, the
      efficacy and safety of four different doses of esmirtazapine compared to placebo were
      investigated in women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the
      menopause. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate superior efficacy in at
      least one of the four doses of esmirtazapine as compared to placebo on the four following
      co-primary endpoints: 1) the mean change from baseline in average daily frequency of moderate
      and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 4; 2) the mean change from baseline in average daily
      frequency of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 12; 3) the mean change from
      baseline in average daily severity of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 4; 4)
      the mean change from baseline in average daily severity of moderate and severe vasomotor
      symptoms at Week 12. The number and severity of hot flushes was recorded by means of
      electronic diary by the subjects.
