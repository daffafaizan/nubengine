    
      This study has 2 components: a 4-week run-in period during which participants are treated
      with prolonged-release fampridine and undergo subjective and objective assessments of walking
      ability, the results of which are used to determine who responded to study treatment, and an
      observational period, during which treatment responders will continue prolonged-release
      fampridine treatment. The participants who do not meet the criteria to continue study
      treatment will be offered the opportunity to continue study participation but will not
      continue prolonged-release fampridine treatment.
