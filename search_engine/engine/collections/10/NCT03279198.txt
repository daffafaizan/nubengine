      colorectal and breast cancer - two cancers that have the greatest impact on female cancer
      mortality in the United States.The cancer burden in women could be significantly reduced by
      increasing participation in recommended screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast
      cancer (BC) in all eligible women. This research tests intervention to simultaneously
      increase both CRC and BC screening using behavior change strategies, and also estimates the
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Two groups of women, Group A (adherent
      to BC screening guidelines, but NOT to CRC screening guidelines) and Group B (non-adherent to
      BC & CRC guidelines) are randomized to 1. Usual Care, 2. TIWeb, 3. CSC and 4. TIWeb +CSC.
