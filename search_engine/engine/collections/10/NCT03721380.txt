      was developed by research team. BDRC consists of 12 sessions, including an initial session, 3
      drug education sesssions, psychosocial counseling and behavioral skills. This initial session
      is designed to introduce the counselor, review the purpose and expectations of counseling,
      review the rules of confidentiality, agree on attendance times and rescheduling rules, and to
      begin to collect information from the participant on their drug use and risk behaviors.
      Behavioral contracting is a key component to this counseling approach. Drug education focuses
      on how heroin may influence patients' cognitive function and their HIV/HCV risk behaviors.
      Counseling and behavior skills trained patients to reflect their thoughts and learned new
      life skills in order to delay or abstrain from heroin use.
