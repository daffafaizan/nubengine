      immediate postpartum period is a high risk time for VTE, and cesarean delivery is an
      additional risk factor. In the United States, use of postpartum VTE prophylaxis with
      low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is commonly used but without a standard protocol or dose
      across all hospitals. A fixed-dose of LMWH is frequently used based on data from
      non-obstetric studies. However, there are concerns that in the postpartum population this
      fixed dose may not be adequate for prophylaxis.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of fixed dose versus weight-based LMWH to reach
      prophylactic anti-Xa levels in post-cesarean delivery women. This will be a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) with half of participants receiving a fixed dose of LMWH and half of
      participants receiving a weight-based dose of LMWH. The hypothesis is that the use of a
      weight-based LMWH compared to a fixed dose will result in more women achieving prophylactic
      anti-Xa levels.
