      randomized into 2 groups, paraffin wax and prolotherapy group.Paraffin group patients will be
      told to take of jewellery and dip their hands into the bath of melted wax (52 ÂºC) with hands
      open and hand wrist in neutral position for 10 times .In paraffin wax group, patients will be
      treated 5 days a week for 2 weeks period. Paraffin wax bath will be applied for 20 minutes in
      every physical therapy session. Prolotherapy is a nonsurgical regenerative injection
      technique that introduces small amounts of an irritant solution to the site of painful and
      degenerated tendon insertions (entheses), joints, ligaments, and in adjacent joint spaces
      during several treatment sessions to promote growth of normal cells and tissues.Hypertonic
      dextrose solution is most common used agent. In prolotherapy group, %15 dextrose solution
      will be applied to medial and lateral aspect of proximal interphalangeal joints (PIJ), distal
      interphalangeal joints and carpometacarpal joint of thumb for 3 sessions once a week period.
      Grip strength, lateral pinch, two point pinch, three point pinch strengths, Visual analog
      scale (VAS), Duruoz Hand Index scales will be assessed before the intervention and after two
      weeks, 4 weeks and 3 months after intervention .
