      (SMA1) patients. SMA is caused by low levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, and
      affects all muscles in the body. There is no effective treatment for SMA and current drug
      therapy has been unsuccessful in stabilizing or reversing this disease. Only supportive care
      is currently possible.

      Open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial of AVXS-101 injected intravenously through a
      peripheral limb vein. Short-term safety will be evaluated over a two year period. Patients
      will be tested at baseline and return for follow up visits on days 7, 14, 21, 30, followed by
      once every month through 12 months post dose, and then every three months through two (2)
      years post infusion. Unscheduled visits may occur if the PI determines that they are
      necessary.

      The primary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 13.6 months of age
      (a database lock will be performed at the time point at which all patients reach 13.6 months
      of age). A follow-up safety analysis will be completed at the time point at which the last
      patient reaches 24 months post-dose.

      Upon completion of the 2-year study period, patients will be monitored annually as per
      standard of care for up to 15 years.
