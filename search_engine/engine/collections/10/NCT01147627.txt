      Exenatide targets multiple metabolic disturbances in type 2 diabetes and exerts direct
      effects on β-cell, which indicates that it may not only contribute to the glucose control but
      also delay disease progression. There are trials demonstrated efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of exenatide. However, no study has compared the effects of exenatide with other
      hypoglycemic therapies with β cell protective function in newly diagnosed and drug-naïve type
      2 diabetic patients. This current study is thus designed to evaluate the effects of
      exenatide, insulin and pioglitazone on glycemic control and β-cell function in newly
      diagnosed drug-naïve type 2 diabetic patients.
