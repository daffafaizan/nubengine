      vomiting (CINV) are still common and are among the most distressing side effects of
      chemotherapy. In a recent survey, parents of children receiving chemotherapy in Ontario
      centres identified nausea as the fourth most prevalent and bothersome treatment-related
      symptom experienced by their children. Aprepitant is commercially available in Canada as
      capsules. An oral liquid aprepitant formulation would be ideal for oral administration to
      children.
