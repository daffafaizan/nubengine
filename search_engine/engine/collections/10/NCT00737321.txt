      models can not simulate the complex set of pre-existing conditions in each individual that
      results in failed wound healing. Therefore, human subjects must be used to obtain valid data.
      Adequate wound vascularization that permits blood vessels to deliver oxygen to the wound is a
      requirement for wound healing to occur. This protocol will attempt to gain greater
      understanding of the mechanisms of chronic wounds through 3 specific aims: 1) identify the
      angiogenic mechanisms in wound site macrophages, which are required for healing, 2) determine
      the impact of stress and glucocorticoid resistance on endothelial cell and macrophage biology
      and ultimately wound healing outcomes, 3) identify patterns of gene expression in wound
      endothelial cells that are found in healing versus non-healing wounds. This data will be
      correlated with the wound oxygenation status to determine the impact of wound vascularization
      on the observed biological responses.
