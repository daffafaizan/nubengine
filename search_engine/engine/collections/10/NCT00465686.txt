      trial to study the efficacy of ergonomic school furniture as a remedial handwriting
      intervention for young students with cerebral palsy. We will conduct the study in two parts.
      In the first part, 30 children with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Level
      I and II cerebral palsy will each provide manuscript handwriting samples using two different
      school furniture configurations. A blinded assessor will score the legibility of handwriting
      samples using the Minnesota Handwriting Assessment (MHA) as a primary outcome measure. In the
      second part, seven occupational therapy experts will attend a focus group to help us
      determine the minimal clinically important difference score for the MHA. We will use the data
      collected to determine the sample size requirements for a proposed randomized controlled
      trial.
