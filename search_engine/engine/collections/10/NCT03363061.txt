      aging global population. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide.
      Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database suggests that over 915 000 people in
      the UK have suffered a myocardial infarction and over 1.3 million are living with angina in
      2013. Two percent of people in developed countries are on long-term anticoagulation and up to
      10% in the elderly population. Management of antithrombotics in patients undergoing invasive
      procedures including gastrointestinal endoscopy remains a challenge. Management approach
      includes taking a precarious balance between the risk of thromboembolism after interruption
      of antithrombotics and risk of bleeding with the continuation of antithrombotics. The
      availability of new antithrombotic agents adds to the complexity of antithrombotic management
      during endoscopy. Warfarin has been the only oral anticoagulant available until the
      introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Newer antiplatelet agents (prasugrel and
      ticagrelor, vorapaxar) are becoming more commonly used for the treatment of the acute
      coronary syndrome.

      There remain gaps in the management approach of patients receiving antithrombotics and
      requiring endoscopy. It is still uncertain of the actual bleeding risk associated with
      antithrombotic use during endoscopy. Colonoscopy remains one of the commonest endoscopic
      procedures performed. It is the gold standard for direct evaluation of the colon for patients
      with the suspected colonic disease. It is also used as a screening test for prevention of
      colorectal cancer by colonoscopic polypectomy of precancerous polyps.The optimal management
      strategy of different antithrombotics during colonoscopy remains unclear.
