      elastic wrap or Game Ready® set at medium pressure, decreases tissue temperature the most
      during a 30-minute treatment. Due to the convenience of Game Ready®, it is being used as an
      immediate care intervention. Findings in the literature have indicated wetted ice cools
      tissue temperature more than cubed or crushed ice based on the assumption that colder is
      better. Conversely, research on Game Ready® has revealed ice bags and slush buckets cause a
      greater reduction in tissue temperature compared to Game Ready®. However, no study exists
      comparing the effects of Game Ready® versus wetted ice on intramuscular tissue temperature
      reduction as immediate care interventions. Based on the results, this study may help
      contribute to the existing literature on tissue temperature reduction of both Game Ready® and
      wetted ice to determine the better modality to use for immediate care. The research questions
      guiding this study will be:

        1. Which cryotherapy method, Game Ready® or wetted ice with elastic wrap, will be the most
           effective at decreasing intramuscular tissue temperature during a 30-minute application
           in patients aged 18-40 years old?

        2. Which cryotherapy method, Game Ready® or wetted ice with elastic wrap, will achieve an
           intramuscular tissue temperature reduction the fastest?
