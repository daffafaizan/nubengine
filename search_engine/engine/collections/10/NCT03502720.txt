      acute fracture of the Scaphoid bone type B1 and B2 (Herbert Classification).

      A CT Scan will be performed and a 3D exoesqueleton model printed, previously deciding the
      position of the fixation screw inside of the bone and adding a cannulated sleeve in the volar
      aspect of the exoesqueleton to insert the initial positional guide wire for surgery.

      Surgery time, surgery radiation exposure and screw positioning will be recorded and compared
      to 10 control patients operated following standard procedure.
