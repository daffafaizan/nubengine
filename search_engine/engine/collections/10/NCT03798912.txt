      a microtablet (payload/drug) into the intestinal wall. This is a phase I (first-in-human)
      open-label study in healthy volunteers. In 6 subjects, 100 mcg of octreotide (SandostatinÂ®)
      will be injected intravenously. Three versions of the RaniPill (A, B and C) will be tested in
      additional three groups of healthy volunteers (N=20 each). All devices will contain 100 mcg
      of octreotide. The bioavailability of octreotide will be determined by serial blood sampling
      in Groups A and B. Performance of the RaniPill will be evaluated in all groups.
