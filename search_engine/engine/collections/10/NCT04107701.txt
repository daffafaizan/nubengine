    
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common respiratory disease affecting children
      born prematurely and leads to long-term respiratory symptoms and lung function impairment
      throughout childhood. This study will, evaluate the contribution of indoor sources of
      respiratory irritants to respiratory health impairment in school-aged children with BPD.
      State-of-the-art measures of indoor air quality constituents will assess the relationship of
      nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), as well as, concentrations of allergens
      (mold, mouse, cockroach, pet), endotoxin, air temperature and humidity with concurrently
      measured respiratory symptoms and lung function in a well-characterized cohort of children
      with BPD. This research will identify specific harmful components of the indoor environment
      associated with respiratory morbidity and poor lung function in children with BPD.

      Investigators will ask the participants to come in for a one time clinic visit for undergoing
      procedures as well as answering questions regarding health and home environment. During the 1
      year of participation there will also be 2 home assessment visits where investigators will
      take a sample of the home environment as well record home characteristics.
