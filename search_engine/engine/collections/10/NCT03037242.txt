      strain when the tibiofemoral joint is loaded. This loss of hoop strain is responsible for the
      increased pressure on the articular cartilage.

      This new awareness has prompted surgeons to consider surgical repair for treatment of
      meniscal root avulsions. Despite this recent focus on results of surgical repair, prospective
      studies are lacking, and the optimal surgical indications and technique have not been
      optimized.
