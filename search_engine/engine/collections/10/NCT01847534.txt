        1. To determine whether the supplemental Parenteral Nutrition (PN) strategy leads to the
           delivery of increased amounts of total nutrition (measured as energy delivered), and is
           safe in regards to adverse effects.

        2. To measure the clinical outcomes in patients receiving both study strategies to provide
           information to assist design of a larger randomized controlled trial.

           Secondary objectives in a sub-set of patients are:

        3. To determine whether the supplemental PN strategy leads to improved nitrogen balance.

        4. To determine both the nutritional requirements and nutritional intake of critically ill
           patients during the period of hospitalization after transfer from the Intensive Care
           Unit (ICU).
