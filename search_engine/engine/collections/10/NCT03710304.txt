      sequence into one of two groups: one group received a pre-prepared sealed and opaque packet
      containing 400 μg of misoprostol (2 tablets of 200 μg), 2 ampoules of TA (1 gm for infusion)
      and separate placebo ampoule (distilled water). The other group received similar packets
      containing two placebo tablets, two placebo ampoules (distilled water) and separate 2
      ampoules of oxytocin (10 IU in each ampoule for infusion) for slow intravenous injection. The
      misoprostol and placebo tablets were similar in size, shape, and color, and ampoules of
      oxytocin will be also similar to placebo. Randomization was done by the investigator
      immediately before transfer to the theater, whereas the preparation of packets and
      confidential record maintenance was done by the labor room nursing staff.

      Study drug administration 400 μg misoprostol (2 tablets of 200 μg) or two placebo tablets
      were given buccally after spinal anesthesia and few minutes before skin incision; then 1 gm
      TA or separate placebo will be diluted in 100 mL normal saline and administered slowly (over
      30-60 s) intravenously before skin incision, in group 2 20 IU oxytocin or placebo ampoules in
      500 mL of intravenous solution infusion over 15 min after delivery of baby.
