      when performing a nasal intubation with either conventional DL or VL with a C-Mac.
      Secondarily the investigators will also examine the time to intubate (TTI) for both methods
      as well.

      Once the patient is recruited, the patient will then be randomized to either intubation using
      DL or VL with a C-Mac. Once the patient is under anesthesia, the intubation will be performed
      by an attending pediatric anesthesiologist or experience pediatric CRNA who has experience
      both DL and with the C-Mac and will attempt to intubate the patient with or without Magill
      forceps as needed.

      The investigators will record the time to intubation (TTI) from the time the laryngoscope or
      C-Mac is placed in the mouth to the first appearance of end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2). the
      investigators will record the presence or absence of nasal bleeding, and the grade of
      laryngeal view. The investigators will also record any general narrative comments about the
      ease or difficulty of intubation in both groups.

      The study will be performed at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.

      Patients between the ages of 3 and 14 scheduled for comprehensive dental treatment under
      general anesthesia will be included.

      Normal appearing airway upon pre-operative assessment. The investigators have calculated a
      sample size of 35 patients in each group to be able to detect a significant difference in the
      rate of use of Magill forceps to place a nasal RAE ETT in this patient population.
