      and maintenance or at a higher dose for induction than for maintenance. Induction consists of
      two consecutive weekly doses followed by maintenance every other week. All patients receive
      concomitant probenecid and saline hydration. Treatment continues until retinitis progression,
      as assessed by retinal photographs, or treatment-limiting toxicity occurs.
