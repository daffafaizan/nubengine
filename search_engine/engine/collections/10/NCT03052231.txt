      service in supporting clinic staff (i.e., nurse practitioners, case managers and care
      coordinators) at a Cystic Fibrosis Center clinic to connect with patients and create
      conversations around behavior-centered goals. The interactive mobile health information
      service has been designed to supplement the standard of care by supporting
      patient-empowerment strategies through:

        -  educating participants,

        -  encouraging behavior change, and

        -  promoting adherence with their treatment protocols.

      The project will adapt the iCAN program content as an educational tool to be incorporated in
      the educational material. iCAN is an electronic platform aimed to provide an engaging
      environment for diabetic outpatients to self-manage, gain control over their health, and
      ultimately adhere to their medical appointments and regimen. Similar to diabetes, CF is an
      all-encompassing chronic disease that requires coordinated efforts among patients,
      caregivers, and health-care providers across treatment adherence, nutrition, lifestyle
      choices, and social support systems. Central to the mobile health information service is the
      interactive and personalized text-based message system that delivers actionable and tailored
      health content to participants: office visit appointment reminders; medication adherence
      reminders; and general health education messages. While a number of technically sophisticated
      applications exist, our approach will involve a less sophisticated and complex approach. Our
      primary objective is to get the information to the patients, some of whom are members of
      lower income minority communities. If "simple" interventions prove effective, then the
      groundwork will have been laid for considering more tailored albeit complex systems.
