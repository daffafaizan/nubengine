studies of the changes in growthand dna synthesis in the rat kidneyduring experimentally inducedrenal hypertrophythere is a high rate of accumulation ofnewly synthesized dna in the kidney after folicacid injection, compared with the small increaseduring the first few days after unilateral nephrectomy.there is a large increase in the water contentof the kidney after folic acid which does notoccur after unilateral nephrectomy.  the changesin the wet and dry weight and the rna and dnacontent of the kidney have been compared afteradministration of folic acid, unilateral nephrectomyand unilateral nephrectomy followed by folicacid 24 hr later in an attempt to study the natureof these differences.  after unilateral nephrectomythere was a steady increase in wet weight, dryweight and rna content of the kidney, each parameterreaching about 35 to 40% above normal by14 days, by which time the dna content had increasedby only about 25%.  an increased rate ofdna synthesis was found between 2 and 4 days,returning almost to normal by 7 days.  after folicacid injection there were very large increases inwet weight (60%), rna content (100%) and dna content(70%) during the first 4 days accompanied bya smaller increase in dry weight (30%).  thereafterthese parameters declined, relative to body weight,returning almost to normal by 14 days.  the rateof dna synthesis was greatly increased as earlyas 24 hr after injection and reached a much higherlevel than that found after unilateral nephrectomy,before returning to the normal level by 7 days.when unilateral nephrectomy was followed 24 hrlater by folic acid injection, the increases inweight, nucleic acid content and rate of dna synthesiswere greater than at the correspondingtimes after either treatment alone.  marked differenceswere found in the labeling indices of kidneycells after either unilateral nephrectomy or folicacid injection.  the latter treatment resulted in verylarge increases in all three zones of the kidney,whereas after unilateral nephrectomy the responsesof the cortex and outer medulla were much lower,with no significant increase in the inner medulla.when both treatments were combined, the responseof the remaining kidney was similar to, thoughmore exaggerated than, that of the normal kidneyafter folic acid injection.
