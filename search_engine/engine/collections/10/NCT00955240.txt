      Primary

        -  Evaluate the objective response (complete and partial) 8 weeks after completion of study
           treatment comprising radiotherapy, chemotherapy (fluorouracil and cisplatin), and
           cetuximab followed by additional radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced anal
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate colostomy-free survival.

        -  Evaluate the local control rate (objective response and stabilization) at 8 weeks.

        -  Evaluate relapse-free survival at 5 years.

        -  Evaluate the intermediate objective response at the end of week 5 of radiotherapy.

        -  Evaluate overall survival at 5 years.

        -  Evaluate the duration of response.

        -  Evaluate acute toxicities according to CTCAE v3.0.

        -  Evaluate late toxicities at 5 years according to CTCAE v3.0.

        -  Study the tumor markers associated with response (survival without relapse) and
           toxicity.

        -  Study the genotypes of Fc-receptor immunoglobulins (FCGR2A and FCGR3) and their
           association with skin toxicity, objective survival, and relapse-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35; fluorouracil IV on days 7-10
      and 35-38; and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 7 and 35. Beginning on day 7, patients also
      undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks (weeks 2-6). Two weeks after finishing this
      treatment, patients undergo additional radiotherapy* 5 days a week for 2 weeks (weeks 9 and
      10).

      NOTE: *Some patients may undergo brachytherapy.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected for further analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 years.
