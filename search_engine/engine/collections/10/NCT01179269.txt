      in combination with paclitaxel in the treatment of subjects with advanced NSCLC. Tumor
      response will be assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1). A subject is defined as a responder if he/she sustains a
      complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) for at least 4 weeks at any time during
      treatment. A subject without a post-baseline assessment of response will be considered a
      non-responder.

      A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pazopanib
      in combination with paclitaxel in the treatment of subjects with advanced NSCLC. Safety and
      tolerability endpoints will consist of the evaluation of adverse events (AEs), exposure,
      withdrawals due to AEs, dose reductions or interruptions, and changes from baseline in vital
      signs and clinical laboratory parameters.
