      birthmark and later in infancy with seizures and strokes that result in weakness on one side
      of the body, cognitive disabilities, glaucoma, and visual field deficits. Approximately
      10-50% of infants born with a facial port-wine birthmark on the upper part of the face will
      also have SWS brain and/or eye involvement. Early detection and treatment of the disease is
      necessary to improve an SWS patient's outcome, and early biological indicators need to be
      discovered to make this possible. We believe the following tests can serve as non-invasive
      biomarkers to improve early diagnosis, monitor response to treatment, and to predict outcome:

        1. Quantitative EEG

        2. Transcranial Doppler

        3. Medical Rehabilitation Scales

        4. Optical Coherence Tomography The first step of this process is to determine how much the
           results of these tests vary between individual tests.
