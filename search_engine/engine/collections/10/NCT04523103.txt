      calcium oscillations to activate oocytes. Mechanical and chemical activation are the most
      commonly used methods for artificial oocyte activation, which can mimic calcium oscillations
      saving fertilization failure.

      Control group, a single spermatozoon was injected into the failed fertilization MII oocyte in
      conventional IVF cycle. What to do when ICSI fails? The investigators collected the
      unfertilized MII oocytes and divided them into 3 groups to perform different activation
      methods, including chemical calcium ionophore activation (experiment group 1), CaCl2 injected
      combined with calcium ionophore activation (experiment group 2), and mechanical stimulation
      combined with calcium ionophore activation (experiment group 3). Calcium ionophore A23187
      (Sigma) was used for assisted activation. The final solution was 10 μmol/L. The oocytes were
      exposed to the calcium ionophore A23187 for 10 min at 37°C in 5% CO2. The oocytes were
      checked for pronucleus formation at 16-20 hours after activation. Fertilized oocytes were
      cultured in vitro for 3-5 days, the developmental potential of the activated embryos were
      observed.

      This study want to explore the effective of different artificial assisted activation methods,
      to improve the fertilization outcome of unfertilized oocytes after ICSI or IVF.
