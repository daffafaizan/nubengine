      instrument into the body of a healthcare professional, exposing them to high-risk body ﬂuids.

      Cutaneous injuries are the most common cause of infection transmission from patient to
      dentist. The causes of such injuries have been reported as 37% from dental burs , 30% from
      syringes , 6% from orthodonticwires , 3% from suture needles, 1% from blades and 2% from
      other sharp instruments .

      Since high-risk exposure is unavoidable, dentists should be aware of post-exposure protocols
      to prevent infection .
