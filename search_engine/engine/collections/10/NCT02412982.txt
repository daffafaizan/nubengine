      with normal (>= 0.1 IU/mL) versus subtherapeutic (<0.1 IU/mL) anti-Xa trough concentrations
      when placed on enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis.
      Secondarily, this study will compare two enoxaparin dosing strategies: standard 30 mg twice
      daily and a dosing strategy based on trough anti-Xa values in high-risk trauma patients.

      Specific aims include: 1) to compare the extent of reduced AT-III activity between patients
      with trough anti-Xa >= 0.1 IU/mL and < 0.1 IU/mL upon initial assay; 2) to determine the
      proportion of patients who reach goal anti-Xa and the time to goal anti-Xa achievement
      between two interventional dosing strategies: enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 hours (with
      consideration to increase to 50 mg every 12 hours if recheck anti-Xa is not at goal) and
      enoxaparin 30 mg every eight hours; 3) to compare anti-Xa enoxaparin dosing strategies based
      on VTE, bleeding rates, transfusion requirements, drug discontinuation rate and
      bioaccumulation, and 4) to determine patient-specific factors that correlate to
      subtherapeutic anti-Xa such as serial AT-III activity, weight, body mass index, age,
      cumulative fluid administration, and thromboelastography (TEG).
