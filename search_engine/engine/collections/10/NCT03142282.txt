      be treated with palliative chemotherapy. And patients who achieve a partial response or
      stable disease by imaging criteria will receive maintenance chemotherapy. In our study, these
      group patients will be randomized to maintenance chemotherapy or consolidative radiotherapy
      to all sites of disease (followed by maintenance chemotherapy at the medical oncologist's
      discretion). Choices of palliative and maintenance chemotherapy will be determined by the
      medical oncologist based on clinical appropriateness.
