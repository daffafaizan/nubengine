      situations of acute pain and inflammation - as a consequence of fractures and incisions in
      the mucosa. The inadequate management of soft tissue and prolonged surgical time could be the
      causes of acute facial oedema, hematoma and ecchymosis in the face and neck, as well as
      functional disorders involving swallowing and breathing, which can affect patients'
      integrity.

      Despite the fact that decreased muscular extensibility and strength, increased muscular
      fatigability, hipomobility, and alteration of the biomechanical efficiency and length of the
      masticatory muscles are documented clinical consequences, no systematic method of obviating
      such problems through muscular rehabilitation has yet been published
