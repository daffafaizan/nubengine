      biomarkers to decrease the number of allograft biopsies during the first year after
      transplantation. 300 new transplanted patients in the 7 clinical transplant sites will be
      included in the prospective multicentre EU-TRAIN Impact study with centralized storage of
      samples in CHUN (blood mRNA), ICS (blood cellular assays), Saint -Louis Hospital (blood
      anti-HLA DSA, and non-HLA antibodies), INSERM (Biopsy mRNA). Recruitment of patients will
      start on the day of transplantation (d-8 for transplantation from living donors) and
      data/samples collected over the first year following transplantation. Realization of all the
      acts for the research are representing the usual medical practice (Standard Of Care: SOC)
      except six additional blood samples that will be collected and analyzed specifically for the
      research and additional analysis done specifically for the research on half of one of the two
      biopsy cores from the recipient. 3 additional blood samples from the living donor will also
      be collected and analyzed specifically for the research (timepoint of the sampling: anytime
      from 8 days to the day of transplant.
