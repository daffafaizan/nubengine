      women are under forty years of age. The emotional aspects of hair loss for females include
      anxiety and depression, frustration and poor self-esteem. Androgenetic alopecia is a common
      cause of female balding and the most likely reason for excessive hair loss.

      It is believed that light therapy of the scalp will provide an effective means to reduce hair
      loss and/or stimulate hair growth in females with androgenetic alopecia. Results of previous
      studies on low level laser therapy (LLLT) have demonstrated a variety of in vitro and in vivo
      effects including increased blood flow, accelerated wound healing, enhanced production of
      cytokines and other cellular mediators, increased cellular proliferation, among a panoply of
      other effects. Enhanced hair growth has been observed adjacent to treated areas in various
      animal models investigating the effects of LLLT. Uncontrolled studies in humans and spa-based
      therapies in Europe appear to show that the periodic application of low intensity light
      therapy reduces hair loss and appears to increase hair growth. The majority of these
      applications utilize light in the red and near-infrared portions of the spectrum.

      The Erchonia MLS low level laser is being evaluated for its potential to improve the quality
      and quantity of hair on the female scalp. This may improve the quality of life as a result of
      improved self-image and may potentially delay or reduce the need for surgical procedures such
      as hair transplantation. A successful local therapy would mitigate or reduce the need for
      systemic agents such as minoxidil and finasteride, thereby minimizing the potential side
      effects of these therapies.
