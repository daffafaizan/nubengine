      periods: screening, treatment and follow-up.

      All eligible patients will be randomized into 3 groups (groups A, B and C) in a 1:1:1 ratio:

      Group A - XC221 100 mg daily (40 patients); Group B - XC221 200 mg daily (40 patients); Group
      C - Placebo (40 patients).

      During the treatment period (3 days), patients will receive XC221 / placebo daily on a
