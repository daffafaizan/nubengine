      brain scan and possibly a follow-up brain scan two years later.

      The data collected in this study will help explain amyloid deposits in several groups of
      participants including adults with and without signs of memory impairment. The information
      collected will help find out who is more likely to have brain amyloid and when it increases
      the risk for developing memory problems. Research studies suggest that people with elevated
      levels of brain amyloid are at an increased risk for memory decline, but this does not mean
      that every person with amyloid build up will develop AD.
