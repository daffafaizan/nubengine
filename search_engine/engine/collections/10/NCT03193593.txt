      in patients undergoing surgical breast augmentation with subpectoral placement of the
      implants. Intramuscular (IM) injection of EB-001 into the PM bilaterally during surgery may
      decrease pain related to stretching of the PM by the implants.

      The safety objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of single intraoperative
      treatment of EB-001 IM injections into the PM in subjects undergoing breast augmentation with
      subpectoral implants.

      The efficacy objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative administration of EB-001
      IM into the PM in reducing the pain and use of rescue pain medications in subjects undergoing
      breast augmentation with subpectoral implants.
