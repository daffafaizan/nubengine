      USF Health Morsani Center after receiving approval from the USF Institutional Review Board.
      Patients will be evaluated Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and screened as candidates for Carpal
      Tunnel Release surgery, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Medical Record
      Number (MRN) will be used to randomly assign into treatment interventions. Group 1 and group
      2 will receive 10cc and 20cc of intra-operative intra-carpal tunnel anesthetic injection,
      respectively. Postoperatively, patients will be prescribed an opioid pain medication in
      congruence with current standard medical practice. Patients will be contacted at 24-hours,
      48-hours, 72-hours, and at 2-week clinic follow-up by research staff and will be evaluated
      for pain levels through the LIKERT scale and pain management through use of prescribed and
      supplemental pain medications. All data will be analyzed through SPSS v25.
