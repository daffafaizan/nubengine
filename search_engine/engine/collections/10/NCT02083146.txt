      contribute to the development of obesity-related disorders including cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). Adiponectin is the insulin-sensitizing adipokine with anti-inflammatory and
      anti-atherogenic properties. Hypoadiponectinemia has been associated with an increased risk
      of coronary artery disease (CAD) in several though not all studies. Recently, a new family of
      secreted proteins, C1q/TNF-related protein (CTRP), was cloned on the basis of sequence
      homology with adiponectin. This family of adiponectin paralogs might have pivotal
      implications in energy homeostasis and obesity-related inflammation. Each CTRP family member
      has its own unique tissue expression profile and function in regulating glucose and/or fat
      metabolism. In the present study, we evaluated the role of CTRP in patients with CAD and
      investigated whether CTRP family is significantly associated with CAD prevalence after
      adjustment for well-known CAD risk factors.
