    
      The aim of this intervention is to improve the quality of care for institutional births with
      a special focus on improving the quality of Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC).
      This intervention will focus on improving the skills and practices of providers and through
      the improvement of referral networks, ensure timely and appropriate management of
      complications.

      The specific objectives include:

        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of an FRU-level Basic and EmONC Skills and Drills
           intervention combined with the existing primary health centre (PHC) based nurse
           mentoring intervention in improving appropriate diagnosis and management of obstetric
           and perinatal complications.

        2. Assess the additional benefit of the EmONC Skills and drills intervention at FRUs in
           terms of improvement of obstetric and perinatal outcomes compared to the PHC-level
           intervention alone.

        3. Estimate the appropriateness and effectiveness of referrals in intervention facilities
           compared to controls.

        4. Calculate the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of the EmONC skills and drills
           intervention
