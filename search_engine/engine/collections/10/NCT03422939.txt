      consumers. During the last update of the French FBDG, a survey with a representative sample
      of dieticians investigated 1) how to communicate portion sizes and 2) the most relevant time
      frame when delivering dietary guidelines.

      Objective: To determine how to express portion sizes and time frame for Food Based Dietary
      Guidelines (FBDG) using the feedback of dietitians.

      Design: Data were obtained from an internet-based survey of 441 French dieticians (collected
      from November 24, 2013 through January 2, 2014).
