    
      This study is a multi-institution, open-label, phase I/II study designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of R-CHOP + ME-401 for participants with newly diagnosed DLBCL.

      Objectives for the phase I portion of this study are as follows:

      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ME-401in combination with R-CHOP for
           participants with newly diagnosed DLBCL.

        -  To describe tolerability of ME-401 in combination with R-CHOP for participants with
           newly diagnosed DLBCL.

      Objectives for the phase II portion of this study are as follows:

        -  To estimate the clinical activity of ME-401 in combination with R-CHOP in participants
           with newly diagnosed DLBCL, as measured by 1 year PFS rate

        -  To estimate the response rates (complete and partial remission),duration of response
           (DOR), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) with ME-401 plus R-CHOP.

        -  To characterize treatment-related AEs in participants treated with ME-401 plus R-CHOP.
