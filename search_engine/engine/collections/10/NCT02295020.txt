      receive standard treatment only and will not be prescribed a knee brace. Group B patients
      will receive standard treatment and the Bioskin Ten-7 knee brace. On Day 0, the patient will
      be assigned to one of the 2 groups using a 1:1 assignment. VAS, WOMAC, Oxford Knee Score,
      KOOS questionnaires will be administered and a sample of the patient's synovial fluid will be
      sent to labs for cytokine and cell count analysis. All patients will record use of NSAIDs and
      for Group B, the start and end time of brace use will be recorded. All patients will return
      in 8 weeks to assess efficacy of treatment. All patients will return their diaries, complete
      the same validated outcome measures as Day 0 and undergo a repeat synovial fluid analysis.
