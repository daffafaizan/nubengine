      in more than 60 languages and includes 42 items. However the questionnaire is not easy to use
      in the clinic : complicated questions, long to answer for the patient and not easy to score
      for the doctor.

      The HAQ-II is a reliable and valid 10-item questionnaire that performs at least as well as
      the HAQ and is simpler to administer and score. It includes 5 items already translated in
      English and 5 new items not yet translated.

      The aim of the study is the validation of the French version of the HAQ-II for rheumatoid
      arthritis.
