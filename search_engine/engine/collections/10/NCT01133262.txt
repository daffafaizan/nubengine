      effectiveness of this novel imaging device in detecting small lesions and lymph node
      involvements in the head and neck region, and compare its results to those obtained from a
      clinical PET/CT scanner. More specifically, we propose to (1) recruit 5 patients who have
      confirmed head and neck cancer and are scheduled to receive a whole-body PET/CT scan followed
      by surgical operation to remove the primary tumor and the regional lymph nodes. These
      patients will be imaged by a state-of-the-art PET/CT scanner using the standard whole-body
      PET/CT imaging protocol as standard of care for initial staging. On another day, following
      consent to participate in this research protocol, A patient will undergo images of the head
      and neck region using the same type scanner with and without our novel PET insert device
      attached; (2) The images obtained from the PET insert device will be reviewed by experienced
      nuclear medicine physicians to identify the extent of lymph node involvement. The PET insert
      images will be compared to the standard clinical PET/CT images. A detailed image obtained for
      purposes of research, centered at the level of the head and neck, acquired for approximately
      3 times the length of time the standard clinical image is obtained for will also be compared
      to the PET insert image. Images will also be compared to the pathology report of the
      surgically removed specimen. (3) Estimate the performance of lesion detection for different
      sizes of tumors using the standard PET/CT scanner as well as the PET insert device.
