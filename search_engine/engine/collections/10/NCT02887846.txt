    
      Purpose is to show that HHHFNC method is as effective and safe as nCPAP and even more
      comfortable than it as non-invasive respiratory support for the prevention of extubation
      failure in preterm with gestational age of 26-32 weeks.

      Method

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      The effectiveness of HHHFNC and nCPAP techniques for the prevention of extubation failure
      within 7 days following the first extubation in preterms in need of mechanical ventilation
      within the first 7 postnatal days

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  the total duration of invasive and non-invasive respiratory support and the duration of
           free oxygen demand of patients

        -  Premature morbidities such as PDA, NEC, ROP, IVH, BPDand sepsis

        -  The degree of nasal trauma score and the degree of nasal mucosal injury

        -  FiO2 levels first before extubation and 6 hours after extubation

        -  The causes of reintubation such as apnea, acidosis, and increased need of FiO2

        -  The reintubation predisposing factors such as pneumothorax, atelectasis, PDA after
           extubation

        -  The weight change in the first 7-day period after extubation

        -  The two groups in terms of neurodevelopmental changes

      Study design Patients requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 6 hours on the first 7
      postnatal days will be included in the study. When patients were Fi O2 < 0,40, Pa CO2 < 65
      mmHg, pH> 7.20, MAP (mean airway pressure) <7 cm H2O, they will be extubated if statistically
      stable. Oxygen-air mixture of 4-6 l / min flow rate will be set in HHHFNC group, and pressure
      will be set to 5-8 cm H2O in NCPAP group. When flow is 2 l / min, FiO2 is<0.30 at 24 hours
      and above, free oxygen will be introduced. In NCPAP group, when pressure is 5 cm H2O and FiO2
      < 0.30 at 24 hours and above, free oxygen will be introduced.

      Reintubation criteria is set as;

        -  FiO2 of â‰¥ 0.50 in order to keep oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry above 90 %
           and higher,

        -  Apnea requiring more than 6 alerts in a 24 -hour period in 6 consecutive hours or more
           than 1 apnea requiring positive pressure ventilation,

        -  Persistent acidosis; presence of pH < 7.20 and PCO2 > 65 mmHg in two different blood
           gases drawn with an interval of at least 30 minutes or treatment-resistant metabolic
           acidosis,

        -  Severe respiratory distress,

        -  Pulmonary haemorrhage and cardiopulmonary arrest.
