    
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of
      SGN-CD48A in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This study will be
      conducted in 2 parts:

        1. Dose escalation: This part will evaluate increasing doses of SGN-CD48A to identify the
           maximum tolerated dose.

           The first group of patients enrolled on the study will receive the lowest dose of
           SGN-CD48A. Once this dose is shown to be safe, a second group of patients will be
           enrolled at the next higher dose. Patients will continue to be enrolled in groups
           receiving increasing doses until the maximum tolerated dose level is reached. Patients
           can only be enrolled into a higher dose level once the lower doses have been
           demonstrated safe. Dose escalation will be conducted using a modified toxicity
           probability interval (mTPI) study design.

        2. Dose expansion: This part will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumor
           activity of up to 2 dose levels of SGN-CD48A shown to be safe in the first part of the
           trial.
