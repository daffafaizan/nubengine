      treated with orally administered anti-Xa anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism (VTE,
      including either pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis). In particular, recent evidence
      has suggested an increase in length and severity of menstrual bleeding for women treated with
      rivaroxaban, and this effect may be less severe apixaban treatment.(1;2) Increase in uterine
      bleeding with rivaroxaban has necessitated hysterectomy in rare cases.(3) Other complications
      of HMB include reduced drug adherence, decreased perception of wellness (quality of life) and
      anemia.(4;5) The anti-Xa agents may increase HMB more than vitamin K antagonists.(1) However,
      in the principal investigators' experience treating over 100 women of menstruating age with
      rivaroxaban for VTE with varying degree of HMB, no woman has expressed desire to switch to a
      VKA even when offered this option (unpublished data). We have successfully reduced perception
      of HMB by switching from rivaroxaban to apixaban in six patients. Comparison of published and
      supplemental data from AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY Extend to EINSTEIN and EINSTEIN extend trials also
      support a lower rate of uterine bleeding with apixaban compared with rivaroxaban, although
      exact comparisons are difficult to make.(6;9) Myers et al recently reported a 9.4% rate of
      HMB with apixaban, compared with a 25% rate of HMB with rivaroxaban.(2) Accordingly, we
      hypothesize that women with menstruating potential with newly diagnosed VTE or atrial
      fibrillation/flutter, treated with apixaban will have less menstrual blood loss than patients
      randomized to rivaroxaban.
