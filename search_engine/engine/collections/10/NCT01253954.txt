      The incidence of invasive candida infection (ICI) in critically ill patients is increasing
      day by day. The crude mortality of ICI in ICU could be as high as 25%-75% depending on their
      age, underlying conditions, and so on. Candida albicans was by far the predominant species in
      most countries, causing up to two thirds of all cases of invasive candidiasis. However, a
      shift toward non-albicans Candida species has been observed. Although the studies of ICI
      cause universal attention recently, there is still no large-scale, multi-center
      epidemiological research in China focusing on IFI in critically ill patients, therefore we
      conducted a large-scale multi-center observational study of IFI in critically ill patients
      named "China Scan" (CHINA Survey of Candidiasis in ICU) to assess the current incidence,
      mortality, pathogen spectrum, management, and risk factors for ICI in China ICUs.

      Objective of the study:

      Determine the current incidence of IFI in ICUs in China. Describe the risk factors for IFI in
      China ICUs. Explore the pathogen spectrum of IFI in ICUs in China. Describe the in vitro
      antifungal susceptibility of Candida isolates. Describe the antifungal treatment for ICU
      patients with IFI. Evaluate in-hospital mortality among patients with IFI in ICUs.
