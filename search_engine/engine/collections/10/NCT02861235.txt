    
      This study will be conducted in Nuclear Medicine departments (Nancy Hospital, Bichat Hospital
      in Paris, Pasteur private hospital in Toulouse), with D.SPECT camera (Cyclopharma). The
      D.SPECT camera recording will be realized following the conventional camera recording and
      will not modify the routine programmed examination. Recording times of D.SPECT camera will be
      maximum 2 minutes for imaging with a strong activity of technetium-99m labeled dye and
      maximum 4 minutes for imaging with thallium-201 or with a low activity of technetium-99m
      labeled dye.6 study groups will be analyzed: 4 groups of patients initially doing stress
      tomoscintigraphy with thallium-201 (group 1) or with technetium-99m labeled dye and then
      testing 3 principal injection sequences (group 2, 3, 4), and 2 groups of patients initially
      doing "myocardial viability" assessment with rest tomoscintigraphy with thallium-201 (group
      5) or technetium-99m labeled dye.

      Recording comparison obtained with 2 cameras will be done according to qualitative and
      quantitative criteria on image quality and analyzing diagnosis concordance (presence, type
      and severity of observed abnormalities).
