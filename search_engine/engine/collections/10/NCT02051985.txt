      evidence-based justification in the acknowledged long-term positive effects of aerobic
      exercise training on both functional capacity and prognosis in this population. In recent
      time, evidence has accumulated in normal subjects about short-term favorable effects of
      aerobic exercise training on sympatho-vagal balance and flow-mediated vasodilation, two
      physiological mechanisms known to be profoundly altered in the setting of acute hemodynamic
      decompensation of chronic heart failure. The possible extension of aerobic exercise training
      indication to chronic heart failure patients admitted for recent acute hemodynamic
      decompensation not stabilized as yet, may thus provide a valuable, low-cost tool to
      effectively manage such a high-risk and resource-absorbing population.
