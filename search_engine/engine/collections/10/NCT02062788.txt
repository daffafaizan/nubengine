           introduced in the early 2000s by Kehlet et.al., and was applied primarily to patients
           receiving colectomy. As the knowledge and understanding of this concept continues to
           grow, we are now able to change the way we treat pre- and post- operative patients. In
           Europe, it has been proven that applying this concept to patients resulted in decreased
           length of post-operative hospital stay, post-op complications and overall hospital
           costs.

        2. The change in HOMA-IR with shorter preoperative Nothing by mouth (NPO) period in ERAS
           patients

             1. HOMA-IR Index equation (evaluation of Insulin resistance)

                = Insulin (Î¼U/ml) X blood glucose (mg/dl) / 405

             2. HOMA-IR was statistically proven to have been lowered in patients who received ORS
                2hr prior to surgery.

             3. Reference

                  -  Increased insulin resistance induces hyperglycemia

                  -  Toxicity of post-op hyperglycemia and their relation to post-op complications

                  -  Insulin resistance increases in procedures such as herniorrhaphy or
                     laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Administration of preoperative carbohydrates
                     decrease post-op nausea and vomiting

                  -  Conventional pre-op 8hr fasting increases insulin resistance and influences
                     increased glucose levels

        3. Additional benefits of shorter preoperative fasting

             1. Relieve of stress of fasting

             2. Help stabilize post-op triglyceride, cortisol, and glucose levels

             3. Reduce infectious complications
