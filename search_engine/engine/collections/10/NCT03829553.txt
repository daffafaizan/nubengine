      conventional radiotherapy in breast cancer patients with an indication for regional nodal
      irradiation. Eligible breast cancer patients are randomized 1:1 into the following two
      groups: hypofractionated radiotherapy of 2.67 Gy for 16 fractions (and sequential tumor bed
      boost of 2.67 Gy for 4 fractions in patients with intact breast) and conventional
      radiotherapy of 2Gy for 25 fractions (and sequential tumor bed boost of 2 Gy for 5 fractions
      in patients with intact breast). The dose was prescribed to ipsilateral chest wall or whole
      breast and regional lymph regions (including supraclavicular and internal mammary lymph
      nodes). All patients are treated with IMRT. The primary endpoint is locoregional recurrence.
      Patients will be followed at least 5 years after radiotherapy to evaluated over survival,
      distant metastasis, toxicity and life quality.
