      and pulmonary embolism especially when undergoing certain high risk procedures. Antithrombin
      replacement therapy is often administered during these periods, with or without low molecular
      weight heparin. Prior to assessing the efficacy of KW-3357, a new recombinant human
      antithrombin, the present study will determine it's pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability
      in subjects who have Congenital Antithrombin Deficiency but who are currently asymptomatic
      and not undergoing a high-risk procedure. Up to 16 evaluable subjects will be enrolled at
      multiple investigational sites over a period of approximately 7 months.
