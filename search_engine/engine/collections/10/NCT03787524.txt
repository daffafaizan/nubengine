      health status in patients with acute stroke, video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) will
      be performed to the patients who will be referred for VFSS among stroke patients who would be
      diagnosed by Brain MRI / CT. When any type of dysphagia is found, participant will be
      assigned to the test group (DYS), and when no dysphagia is found, they will be assigned to
      the control group (NOD).

      Numerous kinds of assessment will be conducted before and after VFSS, before discharge, and
      3, 6, and 9 months after the stroke onset.
