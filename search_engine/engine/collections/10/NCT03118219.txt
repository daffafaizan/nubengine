      couples receive a medical treatment each year in Germany, which is experienced as "roller
      coaster of emotions". The positive effect of "face-to-face" counseling for couples with a
      desire for children has been proven. However, this does not yet apply to a variety of other
      forms of intervention, e.g. telephone or online counseling.

      In this study, the effectiveness of a smartphone-supported psychosocial intervention for
      women and men in reproductive treatment will be examined in a randomized controlled pre-post
      design.

      For this purpose, an intervention group and a comparison intervention group of each n = 60
      couples in reproductive treatment will be examined at two points during a four-week interval
      using the ScreenIVF questionaire. The ScreenIVF will be completed paper-pencil before the
      intervention and online after the intervention. In the fourteen-day waiting period between
      oocyte puncture and pregnancy test (or the reappearance of menstruation), both groups receive
      either positive adjustment techniques or brainteasers.In addition, both groups are questioned
      one month after the post-measurement date on the perceived effectiveness and practicability
      of the intervention techniques.

      Sociodemographic variables (such as age, education) and medical data (such as diagnosis,
      previous treatment cycles) as potential moderators, as well as possible pregnancies at the
      second measurement time will be reported.

      No adverse effects or other risks are expected for the study participants.
