      African adults have been tested in many settings and a drop-off occurs at each step from HIV
      and CD4 testing, remaining in pre-ART (antiretroviral therapy) care, ART initiation, and
      adherence over the long term.

      This study aims to determine the effects of Point-of-Care (POC) CD4 testing, POC viral load
      (VL) testing and several linkage strategies (lay-counselor follow-up, accompaniment to HIV
      clinic by lay counselor, or clinical referral) on linkage to care and treatment adherence for
      HIV positive persons.

      This study also aims to determine the uptake of voluntary circumcision among HIV uninfected
      males with either promotion at point of HIV testing, Short Message Service (SMS) follow-up or
      lay counselor follow-up visits.
