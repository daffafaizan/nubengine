      is not known. This study aims to determine the minimum effective dose of bupivacaine 0.5%
      using a biased coin design up-and-down sequential method. Patients will receive real-time
      ultrasound guided spinal anesthesia using Taylor's approach. The initial dose is chosen as 15
      mg on the basis of clinical experience. Subsequently, if a patient has an inadequate block,
      the bupivacaine dose is increased by 2 mg in the next subject. If a patient has a successful
      block, the next subject is randomized to receive either a lower dose (with a decrement of 2
      mg), with a probability of b = 0.11, or the same dose, with a probability of 1 - b = 0.89.
      Forty five successful blocks will be accomplished. MED90 will be calculated by isotonic
      regression.
