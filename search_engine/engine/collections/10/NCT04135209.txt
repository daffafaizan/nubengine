    
      High myopia is defined as a refractive error equal to or more than -6 D, and/or axial length
      equal to or more than 25.5 mmÂ².Axial elongation of the globe and subsequent stretch of the
      retina leads to sight threatening complications.

      Quantitative measurements of retinal vasculature in the healthy eye have been reported using
      several in vivo and in vitro techniques, including confocal microscopy, fluorescein
      angiography (FA), and swept-source optical coherence tomography (ssOCT) angiography.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the macular microvascular network alterations in high
      myopic eyes using optical coherence tomography angiography.

      This cross-sectional prospective study included 75 eyes of 54 patients, they were recruited
      from the outpatient clinic of ophthalmology department of El-Minia university hospital.They
      were divided into two groups, group A included 25 normal eyes of 25 patients. Group B
      included 50 myopic eyes of 30 patients.

      All patients subjected to history taking and full ophthalmological examination in addition to
      axial length measurment before performing OCTA.
