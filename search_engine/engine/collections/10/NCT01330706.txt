      antiseptic efficacy of intraoperative scrubbing methods during nail avulsion surgery. The
      investigators compared intraoperative antiseptic scrubbing using 0.9% saline solution and
      0.1% polihexanide. Swab samples were taken from each patient at 5 distinct stages throughout
      the surgical procedure, and bacterial culture analysis was performed (positive culture rate,
      total inocula count, reduction of bacterial load, and identification of specific
      microorganisms).
