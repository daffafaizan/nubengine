    
      The aim of the SCIENCE study is, in an international multicentre double-blind
      placebo-controlled study, to investigate efficacy of direct intra-myocardial injection of 100
      mio. allogeneic Cardiology Stem Cell Centre_adipose derived stem cells (CSCC_ASCs) in
      patients with reduced left ventricular EF (≤45%) and heart failure.

      The primary objective is to investigate the regenerative capacity of direct intra-myocardial
      injection of 100 mio. allogeneic CSCC_ASCs in patients with reduced left ventricular EF
      (≤45%) and heart failure in a double-blind placebo-controlled design.

      A total of 138 patients with will be enrolled in the study and treated in a 2:1 randomization
      with either CSCC_ASC or placebo (saline).
