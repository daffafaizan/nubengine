    
      The study is a phase I, open, randomised, crossover, single dose pharmacokinetic study
      performed in a single centre. The study consists of 2 treatment periods, during which the
      study subjects will receive the test product and the reference product in a randomised order.
      During both treatment periods, the study subjects will receive 1 mg of alprazolam as a single
      oral dose. The study treatments will be administered after an overnight fast (at least 10 h).
      Blood samples will be drawn during both treatment periods. The planned duration of the study
      per subject will be 4-5 weeks including a screening visit, 2 treatment periods with a
      wash-out between the study treatment administrations and a post-treatment period.
