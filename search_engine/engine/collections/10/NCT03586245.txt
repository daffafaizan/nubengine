      Consequences such as decreased cognition, growth impairment, and morbidity and mortality
      arise from inadequate iron intake. Many technological challenges are presented in fortifying
      foods with iron, as inorganic iron salts are known to cause organoleptic problems in the
      food. As a result, finding an iron fortificant that doesn't alter taste, smell or stability
      of the food is ideal, however most suitable iron fortificants contain low bioavailability.
      Thirty-five non-anemic female subjects with ferritin ≤ 40 µg/L were recruited for both
      studies (17 in study I; 18 in study II). In both studies, each meal contained a total of 4.2
      mg of added iron fortificants to a test meal containing 6.6 g of chicken bouillon.
      Participants were randomized to consume either meal A or B, followed by B or C. In study I,
      subjects consumed a total of 10 mg 57Fe as FePP and 2 mg 58Fe as ASP-p each over three
      consecutive days. Study II, subjects consumed a total of 10 mg 57Fe as FeSO4 and 2 mg 58Fe as
      ASP-p over 2 weekends. Blood samples collected at baseline were used to measure iron status
      indicators such as serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, hepcidin and hematocrit. Fourteen days
      following final isotope dosing, whole blood samples were collected and the fractional iron
      absorption of each iron fortificant containing labelled stable isotopes was measured via
      thermal ionization mass spectrometry with estimation of 80% incorporation into the
      hemoglobin.
