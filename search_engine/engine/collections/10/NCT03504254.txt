      spinal cords longitudinally after surgical decompression in vivo. Three kinds of MRI
      techniques will be used in this study. These are (1) axial T1-weighted (T1WI) and T2-weighted
      imaging (T2WI), UTE MRI, (2) BOLD-based fMRI, and (3) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To
      quantitatively investigate the structural deficits, T1/T2 MRIs will delineate the gross
      morphology of the spinal cord, CSF, and surrounding anatomical structures, while DTI will
      quantify the fiber orientation and integrity within the spinal cord. BOLD-based functional
      MRIs will assess the local hemodynamic changes and neuron activities in response to the motor
      or sensory stimulation along the C3 to C8 spinal nerve levels. The MRI evaluations will be
      applied to the same cervical myelopathy (CM) patient before surgery and 3 and 6 months
      post-surgery, when clinical recovery reaches a plateau9. Clinical examination will include
      neurological evaluation, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scoring assessment, and
      clinical electrophysiological evaluation.
