      country, a third of the population is affected by the 6th decade and two-thirds by the 9th
      decade. Fortunately, a majority of patients with diverticulosis remain asymptomatic;
      diverticulitis, the most common presentation of complicated diverticular disease, has an
      estimated incidence of 10 patients per 100,000/year.

      Colonic diverticular disease is usually restricted to the sigmoid colon, and conservative
      treatment with antibiotics is indicated in cases of a first attack of uncomplicated
      diverticulitis, the rationale being that a majority of patients treated for a first episode
      of acute inflammation will eventually recover and have no further problems.

      Elective sigmoidectomy is currently recommended in the following clinical situations:

        1. Patients who had two episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

        2. Patients who had one episode of complicated (perforated) diverticulitis, with either
           pericolic of pelvic abscesses (Hinchey stage I and II respectively), fistula formation
           and/or stenosis.

      Resection of the sigmoid colon is now commonly performed by laparoscopy, and a number of
      non-randomized publications have demonstrated that this approach is safe and feasible in
      patients with diverticular disease. The theoretical advantages of celioscopy over the open
      techniques include decreased postoperative pain, a shorter duration of postoperative ileus
      and hospital stay, and improved cosmetic. Surprisingly, however, most published data on the
      topic are restricted to case-control series, and so far the putative advantages of
      laparoscopy have not been substantiated through a prospective randomized trial.
