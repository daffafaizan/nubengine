      study. In study A they will receive a single dose of sitagliptin 100mg od. In study B they
      will receive placebo. A nasoduodenal tube will be sited under fluoroscopic guidance the day
      prior to the study. On the day of the study regular liquid formula (Great shake plus) will be
      infused from 4am through the tube to maintain a constant fed state. A pancreatic clamp
      (octreotide with replacement glucose, insulin and growth hormone) along with
      saline/sitagliptin will be started at 7am. From 9am an iv bolus of deuterated-glycerol
      (d5-glycerol) along with a regular infusion of deuterated leucine (L-[5,5,5-2H3]. Regular
      blood samples will be drawn to assess lipoprotein kinetics.
