      is a difficult -to-treat acid reflux condition even with PPI compared to reflux
      esophagitis(RE). In addition, the quality of life of NERD patients is quite low, NERD
      patients need quicker and more effective treatment options. At present, PPI-based step-down
      treatment is recommended for GERD patients. Doubling th PPI dose has become a commonly
      practiced therapeutic strategy in patients with GERD who failed PPI once daily. In patients
      with symptomatic GERD who failed the one dose PPI can increase the rate of overall symptom
      improvement by 22-26%. There are various mechanisms for standard dose PPI failure in GERD
      patients. Esophageal hypersensitivity is likely the underlying mechanism in a significant
      number of patients. Patients with the sensitive esophagus (normal endoscopy and pH test but
      positive symptom index) were more likely to respond to PPI twice a day. It is thus of
      clinical interest to determine whether an increased dosage of PPI can achieve rapidly the
      control of symptoms for patient with NERD patients.
