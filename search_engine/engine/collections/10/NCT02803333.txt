      patients' quality of life, treatment toxicities, and clinical measures over a 6-month period.
      The ultimate goal of this research is to improve patient-physician treatment decisions, so
      that the patient's personal treatment goals and quality of life have the highest chances of
      being fulfilled.

      Aim 1. To track the toxicities/side-effects of FDA approved molecular targeted agents,
      immunotherapies, and combinations of treatments for NSCLC in a clinical setting for six
      months.

      Aim 2. To assess the impact of these treatment regimens on patient toxicities, symptoms,
      function, and quality of life, after adjustment for clinical factors and patient
      characteristics during the 6 month follow-up period.
