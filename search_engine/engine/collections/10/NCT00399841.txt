      placed at T8-T9 vertebral levels. Recently published studies as outlined in a letter to the
      editor of Neuromodulation suggest that a "well placed single lead will generally perform
      better than a dual lead." Furthermore, anecdotal reports suggest that lead placement at T7
      will capture axial back pain with greater success compared to lead placement at alternative
      sites.

      This study aims to achieve better pain treatment and paresthesia coverage by placing a single
      lead at T7.
