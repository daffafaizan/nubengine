        -  Determine whether the use of sargramostim (GM-CSF) after T-cell depleted, CD34-positive
           cell-supplemented allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can reduce leukemic relapse in
           patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive myeloablation with busulfan and cyclophosphamide on an approved
      protocol. Allogeneic bone marrow is harvested and treated in vitro with anti-CD34 antibody.
      T-cell depleted, CD34-positive cell-supplemented bone marrow is infused on day 0. Patients
      receive high-dose sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 5 and continuing
      until blood counts recover and then low-dose GM-CSF SC continuing until day 60.

      Donor lymphocyte infusions or second unmodified allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
      without GM-CSF is considered in case of primary or secondary engraftment failure.

      Patients are followed every month for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for
      1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      6-10 years.
