      with an estimated prevalence of 36%. However, clinicians have limited tools to preoperatively
      identify patients at risk for AKI and/or progression to chronic kidney disease, particularly
      in patients with normal resting glomerular filtration rate (rGFR). Renal functional reserve
      (RFR) describes the capacity of the intact nephron mass to increase GFR from baseline in
      response to stimuli (e.g., protein load). We hypothesized that the presence or absence of RFR
      could separate patients at risk for developing AKI from patients with better-preserved renal
      function and a more favorable short- and long-term prognosis despite identical rGFR. The aim
      of this study is to examine whether preoperative assessment of RFR is able to predict risk
      for AKI after cardiac surgery.
