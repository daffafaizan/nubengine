      sudden unexplained death, initially in San Diego County with plans to expand nationally and
      internationally as funding allows. Genetic testing of the index subjects and their parents
      (or other biological family members if parents are not available) will be assessed for
      potential heritable causes of sudden death. By combining the wide catchment base of the San
      Diego Medical Examiner's Office, sequencing expertise of SD-based collaborators, computing
      power of the San Diego Supercomputer Center and in-house and external genomic analytics, the
      Scripps Translational Science Institute aims to provide a more complete characterization and
      understanding of the genetic causes of sudden death. Ultimately, findings from this study
      will be utilized to identify previously unrecognized mechanism of sudden death allowing for
      the development of preventative screening programs and potentially life-saving interventions.
