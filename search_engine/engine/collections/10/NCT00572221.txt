      cost-effective methods to improve quality, particularly in poor and average facilities. In
      our prior work, we found that better performing facilities make more extensive use of CQI
      mechanisms, have more protocol driven problem advanced resolution mechanisms and
      systematically address multiple areas Both arms of the study apply the same standardized
      approach to CQI, while one arm will include specific best-practice care strategies targeted
      at identified problems. The study will evaluate whether the CQI program improves quality
      indicator scores in multiple domains, relative to control facilities, and whether improvement
      is greater in facilities that also utilize the study's best-practice protocols.

      The study consent form describes the MDS assessment (used to evaluate the reliability of the
      facility's assessment), including items to be reviewed and how information will be obtained.
      The subject is informed that there is no known risk for participating in research, the
      purpose of which is to determine if the intervention improves nursing home care in
      Massachusetts

      The outcomes will be reviewed by means of a change in twelve quality indicator scores: ADL
      decline, ADL decline following improvement, Mobility change, walking improvement, cognitive
      change, communication change, bowel continence change, bladder continence change, depressed
      mood change, new insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter, infection prevalence, worsening
      pain.
