    
      30 healthy civilians volunteers will be recruited and divided randomly into 2 groups: RIPC
      group and control group.

      The experiment protocol consist 2 series (with a month between them), both series include the
      described 3 days:

      Day 1 - anthropometry measurements and VO2max test (BRUCE protocol). Day 2 - steps test
      (heled protocol). Day 3 - anaerobic test (wingate protocol), 1 hour rest and time to
      exhaustion test (heled protocol).

      The first series will be performed without applying any intervention and is considered as
      baseline measurements for both groups. the second series will be performed as follows: a.
      RIPC group: applying RIPC exposure (placing a sphygmomanometer on the non-dominant hand and
      applying pressure of 200 mmHg for 5 min followed by 5 min without pressure X 4 repeats) at
      the beginning of every meeting. b. control group: with placebo (false) exposure (placing a
      sphygmomanometer on the non-dominant hand and applying pressure of 100 mmHg for 5 min
      followed by 5 min without pressure X 4 repeats) at the beginning of every meeting.

      Blood ample, lactic acid and urine sample will be tested at the beginning and end of every
      meeting (testing for muscle, skeleton and kidney function markers).
