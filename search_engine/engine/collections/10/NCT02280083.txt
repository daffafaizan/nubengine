    
      The primary purpose is to prove the efficacy of treatment administration with Botulinum Toxin
      Type A for Injection (HengLi®) beyond placebo in subjects with post-stroke upper limb
      spasticity of both wrist and fingers flexors as measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale
      (MAS).

      Subjects will receive a single treatment session of intramuscular HengLi® 200U or 240U (if
      thumb spasticity is present) or placebo after they first enroll the core phase randomly.
      Totally 180 subjects will be recruited in this part. Each completed subject should finish 8
      (visit 0 to 7) clinic visits. Subjects will receive a single intramuscular treatment with
      either HengLi® or placebo at day 0 (visit 0). The else 7 visits are at week 1, 4, 6, 8, 12,
      16 and 18 (visits 1 to 7) and week 6 (visit 3) is appointed as the primary visit to determine
      efficacy.

      The primary endpoint is the change from baseline at week 6 for wrist flexor muscle tone as
      measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The secondary endpoints involve the area under
      curve (AUC) for the MAS wrist score change from baseline, change from baseline for
      wrist/finger/thumb flexor muscle tone as measured on MAS, DAS and GAS. The safety measures
      involve adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and pulse, blood pressure.
