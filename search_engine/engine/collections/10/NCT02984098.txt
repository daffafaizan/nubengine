      hospital. Five to 7 term neonates were assessed weekly by the principal investigator (PI) for
      study eligibility. The parents of neonates who met the inclusion criteria received
      information about the study after which they were invited to participate. Written informed
      consent from parent was obtained. The PI entered data into the online Research Randomizer
      which provided a randomization number corresponding to a numbered treatment pack containing
      two syringes, each containing 2ml of an identical and therefore blinded liquid. Study
      investigators, clinical staff, parents and monitors remained blinded to treatment allocation
      until data analysis was completed. To ensure standardization the included term infants were
      not breastfeed 30' prior to the heel stick and a standardized heel lance was used.Each infant
      was taken to a separate room with the mother by the assigned nurse to provide a quite
      environment. All infants were awake at the time of the procedure. Their clothes were removed
      and wet diapers were changed. In both groups, the infants were placed in a supine position on
      a changing table. Dextrose administration and the heel stick were undertaken by an
      experienced staff neonatal nurse. The heel was warmed with a warm wet towel up 2' minutes
      before the procedure. The heel was disinfected shortly before the procedure started.
