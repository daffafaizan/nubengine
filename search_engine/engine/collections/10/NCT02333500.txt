      desire to eat (wanting) following olfactory stimulation. Oxytocin is an hormone involved in
      the neuromodulation of eating behavior, but also involved in olfactory perception in
      schizophrenia patients, and in social cognition in patients with autism. Its plasma level was
      found low in anorexic patients compared to control subjects.

      Because of the similarity in disorders of social cognition between these three diseases, we
      assume that the desire to eat evoked by olfactory perception varies with the plasma oxytocin
      levels.

      With a prospective pilot study we will compare patients with AN who participated for 3 months
      at olfactory workshops, AN patients who did not, and healthy patients.

      The groups will be evaluated before the workshops and after three months, with the wanting
      score after olfactory stimuli and with serum oxytocin level.

      One application of this study will be the use of ocytocyne nasal spray to increase the eating
      desire and to allow weight regain
