    
      Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a rare clinical condition characterized by proteinuria exceeding
      >3.5 g/24h, hypoalbuminemia, dyslipidemia and edema and is associated with hypercoagulable
      state. In severe cases, with serum albumin â‰¤2.5 g/dL, the risk of venous thromboembolic
      events (VTE) is particularly high, and pharmacological prophylaxis is recommended. However,
      there is a limited evidence of its efficacy and optimal dosing.

      The study is designed as 3 arms clinical trial, with 2 study groups and a single control
      group. The study groups will include patients with severe NS parallelly, alternately assigned
      (1:1) into two enoxaparin dosing regimens. The control group will consisted of individuals
      without proteinuria and edema, similar in terms of age, anthropometric features and renal
      function to NS patients, who will be administered a standard enoxaparin dose. A peak anti-Xa
      activity at the steady state will be measured to determine the plasma concentration of
      enoxaparin. Additional laboratory tests for markers of NS severity, renal function and
      coagulation system proteins will be performed. The overhydration and body water compartments
      will be assessed using bioimpedance spectroscopy technique. Nephrotic patients will be
      followed up by 12 months to assess overt VTE and adverse events associated with enoxaparin
      use.
