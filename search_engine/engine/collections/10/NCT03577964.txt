      associated with a higher incidence of infection and consecutive increased morbidity and
      mortality. The underlying mechanisms in detail are not completely understood. So far it is
      not clear whether systemic increased glucose levels are caused by a stress reaction of the
      body through a catabolic metabolism situation as well as a "stress-induced insulin
      resistance", or infections are promoted by hyperglycemia. From in vivo and in vitro studies,
      a glucose threshold for the lung is known (147 mg / dL), similar to that in the kidney. It
      can be hypothesized, that an intra-alveolar glucose in turn promotes bacterial growth as a
      nutrient substrate. The aim of the study is to determine the concentration of glucose in the
      alveolar space in connection with hyperglycemic conditions, and to demonstrate a higher
      incidence of pneumonia in this patient group. The study will enroll cardiac surgery patients
      receiving surgical treatment and expected postoperative ventilation. Systemic blood glucose
      monitoring is recorded throughout hospitalization, as well as the removal of bronchial
      aspirates intraoperatively and during ventilation to measure glucose levels and bacterial
      levels. The incidence of pneumonia is recorded during the postoperative period by means of
      radiological examinations and / or microbiological examinations.
