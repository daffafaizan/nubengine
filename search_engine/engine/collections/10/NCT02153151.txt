      I. To evaluate the in-vitro effect of AMP-514, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, on
      peripheral blood T cell proliferation and cytokine production from patients with solid
      malignancies, treated with radiotherapy (RT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline, during the second week of RT, at the
      end of RT, and at 1 month after the end of RT.
