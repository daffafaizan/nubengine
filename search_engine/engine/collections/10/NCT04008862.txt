      pulmonary disease (COPD), and the wide ranging burden that the disease induces to
      individuals, families and societies, has spurred concerted efforts to develop new healthcare
      for these people. Outpatient clinics are receiving increasing recognition, particularly those
      managed by nurses. An out-patient nursing clinic based on theoretical premises of partnership
      as practice has been established at Landspitali University Hospital. Initial research has
      shown effectiveness of the practice on the use of healthcare, health status, health related
      quality of life as well as increased capacity of families to live a meaningful life with the
      disease. There is a need to substantiate knowledge of the effectiveness of the
      partnership-based practice by focusing on use of healthcare resources, health and the
      experience of patients and families, as well as developing educational material for nurses.

      Investigators hypothesize that the holistic, inclusive -taking account of the challenge of
      multi-morbidity and the long-term relationship that patients with COPD and their families
      have with the nurses along with the open structure of whatever kind of services is needed in
      each patient-family case, often in interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration- ,
      is beneficial as regards use of healthcare, health characteristics, HRQL, use of inhaler
      medications, sense of security in care and illness intrusiveness. The experience of patients
      with COPD and their families of living with the disease and receiving the care will
      substantiate the previously indicated variables. To this study a multi-dimensional approach
      is needed which includes both a holistic evaluation (qualitatively studying the experience of
      participants) and which measures variables prevalent in studies on self-management and
      palliative care (quantitative use of instruments and demographic variables).
