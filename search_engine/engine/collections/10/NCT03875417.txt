      usually develops in cirrhotic liver with high recurrence rates. More than 2/3 of patients are
      elderly, often excluded from surgery and follow-up protocols. Aim of this study is to
      evaluate whether treating HCC recurrences in resected elderly patients is advantageous or
      not.

      Materials and methods- 126 patients, aged between 65 and 90 years, submitted to liver
      resection for HCC were enrolled. They were divided into three classes. Class 1 included
      patients submitted to major resections, Class 2 to minor resections and Class 3 to minor
      resections associated with thermoablation. All of them were clinically and radiologically
      followed up. Patients who developed recurrences (Group A) were referred to further treatments
      (surgery, interventional radiology or pharmacological therapy). Mortality, disease-free
      survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated and compared
      with non-recurrent patients (Group B).

      Used interventional radiology means were Radiofrequency ablation (RF), microwaves ablation
      (MWA) or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).
