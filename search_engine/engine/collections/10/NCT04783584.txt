      video airway evaluation and an inpatient person-to-doctor airway assessment.

      Patients will be referred for virtual preoperative assessment clinic by the gynaecology
      outpatient department based on inclusion criteria and a patient information leaflet and
      consent form is supplied at this time. During the virtual assessment consent is taken,
      followed by a standard history and airway examination. The airway assessment will be
      performed by an investigator of >5 years anaesthetic experience and will have to undergo a
      standardised airway assessment training. This airway evaluation is also documented separate
      to the remainder of the history, sealed in an envelope and labelled a designated number. On
      the date of surgery, the patient is assessed again by an investigator in the ward/theatre
      prior to surgery. This airway examination is documented on the standard anaesthetic record
      sheet as well as on a separate in-person evaluation form. This airway assessment form is then
      sealed in an envelope and labelled the same designated number as the virtual assessment. The
      evaluations will be entered into a database and analysed.

      If the evaluation is found to show predictors of a difficult airway in the virtual clinic,
      the patient is scheduled for an in-person outpatient appointment. The airway is then assessed
      by an investigator in-person at the clinic. The airway is then assessed by an anaesthetic
      consultant and documented on the anaesthetic record sheet. Investigators will have no further
      involvement in the clinical management of the patient.
