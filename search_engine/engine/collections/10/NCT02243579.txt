    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the clinical activity of MK-3475 in subjects with relapsed/refractory MF and SS
      with respect to the following endpoints: duration of response (DOR); progression-free
      survival (PFS); overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (6 months for patients achieving complete response [CR]) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
