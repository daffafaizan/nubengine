      cycle (freeze-all policy) would eliminate the risk of controlled ovarian stimulation and
      resulting in better endometrial receptivity and lower uterine contractility as compared with
      fresh intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.

      RIF refers to women who fail to achieve a clinical pregnancy, in a minimum of three embryo
      transfer cycles with at least four good-quality embryos were transferred in a woman < 40
      years. It affects approximately 10% of ICSI cases. Many management protocols aimed to enhance
      ICSI outcome in cases of RIF, however, none of them examined the effect of freeze all policy
      in this category of patients.
