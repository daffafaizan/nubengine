      Primary:

      Detection of one or more episodes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter â‰¥30 seconds as
      assessed at the 30 day follow-up.

      Secondary:

        1. Proportion of patients prescribed oral anticoagulation, as assess at the 30-day follow
           up.

        2. Patient adherence with 30-day smartphone ECG monitoring, and percentage of patients
           using the monitor >75% of the target in 30-day period

        3. Time to first detection of AF within 30 days (days)

        4. One year rate of recurrent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, death,
           hemorrhagic stroke, major adverse bleeding events, detection of AF outside the study
           protocol.

      Exploratory:

      To explore the feasibility and cost effectiveness of 30-day smartphone ECG recording for
      detecting occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
