      (including hepatic safety), tolerability and pharmacodynamic effects of two dose levels of
      MEDI0382 in obese subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH). The subjects will have biopsy-confirmed NAFLD/NASH with liver
      fibrosis stage F1, F2 or F3. Approximately 72 subjects will be randomized across multiple
      study sites.
