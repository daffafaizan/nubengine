      liver endothelial cells and studies involving blockage of VAP-1 activity have demonstrated it
      is involved in a reaction where break down products such as hydrogen peroxide and ammonia
      active signalling pathways to assist in the movement of cells from blood vessels to the
      liver. VAP-1 levels become elevated during chronic inflammation in blood vessels of the gut,
      tonsils, skin and synovium albeit most selectively in liver. Recently, circulating VAP-1 has
      been demonstrated to be elevated in certain liver diseases particularly alcoholic liver
      disease. Initial animal studies have shown that activity of the enzyme SSAO
      (Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase) can be effectively blocked by caffeine administration
      and that caffeine also blocks the activity of fat cells, known as adipose cells, thus
      protective against obesity too. SSAO arises from the same family of enzymes as VAP-1 thus
      importantly shares transferable properties. This information led to small, experimental
      studies in human liver that corroborate these findings but did not show how caffeine was
      affecting VAP-1 in the blood.
