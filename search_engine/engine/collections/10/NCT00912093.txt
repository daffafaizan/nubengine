    
      This Phase III study consisted of two parts: A controlled phase and an open label extension
      (OLE) phase.

      The controlled phase describes the double blind part of the study and was intended to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of icatibant compared with placebo for the first treated
      cutaneous and/or abdominal attack.

      Patients with moderate to severe abdominal or cutaneous attacks were randomized to receive a
      single, blinded, subcutaneous injection of icatibant (30 mg) or placebo. After a protocol
      amendment, patients with mild to moderate laryngeal HAE attacks were also randomized to
      receive a single, blinded subcutaneous injection of icatibant (30 mg) or placebo in order to
      obtain blinded, controlled efficacy and safety data for this subset of subjects. Patients
      experiencing severe laryngeal attacks (post-amendment) or mild to severe laryngeal attacks
      (pre-amendment) were to receive open-label icatibant.

      After treatment of the first attack in the controlled phase, patients were eligible to enter
      the OLE phase. In the OLE phase, patients who experienced angioedema attacks severe enough to
      warrant treatment were to be treated with s.c. icatibant as appropriate until the study was
      discontinued or the product was commercially available.
