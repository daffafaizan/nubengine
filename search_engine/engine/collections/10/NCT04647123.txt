      Catalase (CAT), Glutathione (GSH) and Adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in gingival crevicular
      fluid, serum and saliva of periodontally hopeless, periodontitis and gingivitis teeth with
      healthy control groups.

      In this study, 25 periodontally healthy individuals (control group) and 25 individuals with
      various levels of periodontal disease in different teeth will be included.

      Gingival crevicular fluid, saliva and blood samples will be taken from patients with
      periodontally healthy teeth without any treatment.

      In patients diagnosed with periodontal disease, teeth will be divided into 3 subgroups as
      hopeless, periodontitis and gingivitis. In patients with a diagnosis of periodontal disease,
      saliva and blood samples will be taken twice, before and after the training of scaling and
      root planing, desperate tooth extraction, oral hygiene motivation.
