      negative physical and mental health consequences, including increased risk of depression and
      worse reported health-related quality of life. The proposed project aims to develop and
      translate an evidence-based, multi-component intervention into a mHealth App that has the
      potential to increase dementia caregivers' access to support and care.

      The investigators will conduct a feasibility trial, in which 40 dementia caregivers will be
      randomized to receive a computer tablet preloaded with the CARE-well App or preloaded with
      internet links relevant to dementia and caregiving. Paper outcome measures will be assessed
      at baseline and end of intervention (3 months) during each study visit. To measure
      sustainability of the App, the first 10 caregivers from each group will be offered the
      tablets for an additional month to monitor usage of the App outside the formal trial. The
      goal of this aim is to determine feasibility of the intervention, study procedures, and
      outcome measures.
