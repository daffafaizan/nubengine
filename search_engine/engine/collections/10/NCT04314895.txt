      administered intravenously in a number of types of cancer. These submicron particles are
      injected directly into solid tumors to target cancer at the site of disease with less
      systemic exposure than intravenously administered chemotherapy. In this study, the submicron
      particle paclitaxel will be injected directly into tumors in the lungs of people with small
      cell or non-small cell lung cancer. All subjects in this study will receive NanoPac and will
      be evaluated to see if NanoPac is safe and has an effect on the tumor within the lung.
