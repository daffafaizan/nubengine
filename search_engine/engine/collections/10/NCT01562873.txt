      Primary

        -  The primary objective of this two-stage, phase II study is to estimate the objective
           response rate to ruxolitinib in patients with metastatic or unresectable locally
           advanced breast cancer which is pStat3+ and which has progressed on at least one line of
           chemotherapy for advanced disease, and/or has recurred within 12 months of completion of
           neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the toxicity profile

        -  To evaluate clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD >/= 24 weeks)

        -  To estimate progression-free and overall survival

      Exploratory

        -  To explore whether baseline hs-CRP level higher than the group median is associated with
           objective response

        -  To explore whether baseline IL-6 level higher than the group median is associated with
           objective response

        -  To describe hs-CRP level over time, and to describe the proportion of patients with a)
           hs-CRP > 3mg/L at baseline, on treatment, and at time of progression, and b) hs-CRP >
           1mg/L at baseline, on treatment, and at time of progression

        -  To describe IL-6 level over time, and to describe the proportion of patients with IL-6
           level above the upper limit of normal at baseline, on treatment, and at time of
           progression

        -  To describe pStat3 status by IHC in baseline metastatic biopsies

        -  To describe pStat3 status by IHC in on-study biopsies

        -  To describe pStat3 status by IHC in the time of progression biopsy samples

        -  To characterize archival and metastatic biopsy samples using triple immunofluorescence
           for CD44, CD24, and pStat3

        -  To characterize archival and metastatic biopsy samples using a previously characterized
           pStat3 gene signature

        -  To characterize circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for CD44, CD24, and pStat3 at baseline
           and time of progression
