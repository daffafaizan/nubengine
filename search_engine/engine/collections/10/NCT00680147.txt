      the U.S. and globally. However, because the vaccine is recommended for children and early
      adolescents, vaccine awareness and acceptance among parents is critical to insuring vaccine
      uptake and public health benefit. Although culturally specific concerns may reduce HPV
      vaccination among African-American youth, research has not addressed this possibility.
      Accordingly, the proposed study will enroll 300 mothers in a study to identify barriers to
      HPV vaccination among low-income, African-American teens. Surveys assessing
      culturally-specific barriers to HPV vaccination acceptance will be administered to both
      parents and their vaccine-eligible children. Upon completion of the survey, parents with
      vaccine-eligible daughters will be invited to receive a free HPV vaccination for their child
      through a local, teen-friendly health clinic. Outcome analyses will focus on identification
      of predictors of completed vaccinations among girls and barriers to vaccine acceptance among
      mothers of teenage sons. Our study will provide critically important behavioral outcome data
      linking barriers to vaccination to subsequent vaccination decisions in a real-world, health
      care setting.
