    
      -  To enroll in the study, a sample of the participant's tumor tissue, stored from an
           earlier study, must be sent to a lab at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center for
           diagnosis and special testing.

        -  Prior to starting the study medication, participants will undergo a Octreotide scan.
           This is a special type of scan used to obtain information about certain tumors.

        -  Participants will receive the study medication, SOM230C, via an injection into the
           buttocks every 28 days. Therefore, each treatment cycle lasts 28 days.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be done prior to the first, second and third
           treatment cycles, and every three treatment cycles thereafter: Complete physical
           examination including neurological exam; vital signs; current medication and symptom
           review; blood samples and a pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential).

        -  About 2/3 through the first treatment cycle (around day 22), participants will visit the
           research doctor for a complete physical examination including a neurological exam and
           blood work.

        -  Participants will have ECGs done prior to their first treatment cycle, about 2/3 through
           the first and third treatment cycles (around day 22), prior to their sixth treatment
           cycle, and every three treatment cycles thereafter.
