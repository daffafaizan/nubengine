      consequence of the increased abdominal weight. Atelectasis is the primary responsible for
      respiratory insufficiency and impossibility to wean obese patients from respiratory support.

      In a previous study we demonstrated the efficacy of the application of titrated PEEP levels
      following a recruitment maneuver in obese patients, i.e. improvement in respiratory mechanics
      and gas exchanges without negative hemodynamic effects.

      The application of lung and heat imaging will allow us to quantitatively describe:

        -  Increase in aerated lung tissue (reduction of atelectasis)

        -  Reduction of over-inflation of the ventilated regions

        -  Recoupling of ventilation and perfusion

        -  Improvement in right heart function by reduction of right heart afterload
