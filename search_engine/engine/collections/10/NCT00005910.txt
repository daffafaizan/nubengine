      secreting pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor require accurate localization of the tumor and
      definitive surgical resection. Non-invasive pre-operative imaging studies such as CT, MRI and
      ultrasound often fail to accurately localize the lesion prior to surgery. Invasive imaging
      such as arteriogram and selective arterial stimulation are a major improvement, but may not
      be needed in all patients. This trial will evaluate the ability of laparoscopic exploration
      with intraoperative ultrasound to localize the insulinoma and allow for its resection with a
      single procedure.
