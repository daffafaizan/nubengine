    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-988. TAK-988 is being tested to evaluate
      safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single and multiple oral doses in healthy non-Japanese
      and Japanese adult participants and HE participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 156 healthy participants. The study consists of 5 parts
      and up to 19 cohorts as mentioned below:

        -  TAK-988, Part A: Single-rising dose (SRD) design to assess the safety, tolerability, and
           PK of TAK-988 and effect of food on the PK of the TAK-988

        -  TAK-988, Part B: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-988

        -  TAK-988, Part C: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-988 and
           also central nervous system penetration relative to plasma concentrations of TAK-988

        -  TAK-988, Part D: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-988 for
           HE participants

        -  TAK-988, Part E: SRD and MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of
           TAK-988 for Japanese origin participants

      Participants in each cohort will be randomized to receive treatment with TAK-988 or matching
      placebo which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study
      (unless there is an urgent medical need).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the
      study is approximately 10.5 months. Participants will make a final visit 7 days after
      receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
