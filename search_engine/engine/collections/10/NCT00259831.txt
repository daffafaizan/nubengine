      placebo group with equal numbers in each group. The treatment will consist of taking two
      capsules of CVT-E002 (400mg)or placebo every morning, after breakfast, for a period of 12
      weeks. The subjects will be given an assessment form to log specific symptoms on a daily
      basis if they get a cold.

      Symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, hoarseness, cough, earaches, and
      fever. Subjects will be required to maintain the same dosing even during an upper respiratory
      infection and will be requested not to take any additional medication for their upper
      respiratory infection unless prescribed by their family physicians.
