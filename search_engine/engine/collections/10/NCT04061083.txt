      Group), intermittent with a manometer (Study Group 1) and continuously with a smart cuff
      manager (Study Group 2).

      To assess the effect of different ETT cuff pressure control on microaspiration of the stomach
      contents, the pepsin level will be measured during deep tracheal secretions. The samples will
      be examined in the first four hours after intubation, all secretions collected up to the 24th
      hour of intubation after first sample intake and all secretions collected between 24-48 hours
      after intubation. Pepsin level will be considered as positive for cut-off point. In addition,
      the effect of different ETT cuff pressures control on the incidence of VAP will be examined.
