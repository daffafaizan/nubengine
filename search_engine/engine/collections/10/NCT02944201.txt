      regulate prostate cancer development and dissemination. Studies in human prostate cancer
      specimens indicate that higher densities of autonomic nerve fibers are associated with poor
      clinical outcomes.

      In this clinical trial the beta-blocker carvedilol will be given to men diagnosed with
      prostate cancer. Men will begin carvedilol following their diagnostic prostate biopsy and
      will continue carvedilol until prostatectomy. The primary outcome measure is the change in
      Ki-67 and TUNEL assay biomarkers in prostate biopsy and prostatectomy tissues.
