      weeks for at least six consecutive injections. Prior to initiation of therapy and at each
      study visit, a full ophthalmic examination, best-corrected visual acuity, and a complete
      review of systems to monitor for any toxicity will be performed. In addition, the
      investigators will perform fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography at baseline and
      obtain color fundus photographs as well as spectral domain OCT images to properly document
      the extent and degree of activity of the vascular tumor at baseline and at all study visits.
