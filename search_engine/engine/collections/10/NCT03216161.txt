      approved study protocol.

      The study program included comprehensive surveys on diet and lifestyle (smoking, physical
      activity, and anthropometry). The aim was to achieve repeated measurements in a sub-cohort of
      about 600 people to validate (measurement error correction) and calibrate (adjustment of
      insufficient data collected to the actual data location) existing baseline data in the entire
      cohort (EPIC-Potsdam cohort).

      To this end, within age groups and by gender, active EPIC participants were then randomly
      selected in the years 2009 to 2012 from the cohort, contacted and invited to re-visit the
      respective study center. 816 subjects were acquired for re-examination, participation rate
      was 56.4%.

      Each participant gave informed consent. The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics
      Committee of the Medical Association of the State of Brandenburg, Cottbus, on 18/12/2009.
