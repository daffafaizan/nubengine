    
      Primarily: To study the correlations between the following parameters in adult Egyptian
      patients with chronic viral hepatitis B before treatment:

        -  ALT.

        -  HBeAg.

        -  HBV-DNA by quantitative PCR.

        -  Biopsy (if possible). Secondarily: After receiving lamivudine therapy we will identify
           the impact of these parameters on viral breakthrough at 1 year of therapy.
