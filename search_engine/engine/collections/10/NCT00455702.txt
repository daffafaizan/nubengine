    
      This is a ten-week, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial examining the cognitive effects
      at weeks 1, 2, 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 10 of once-weekly oral D-cycloserine 50 mg added to a
      stable dose of antipsychotic for 8 weeks in 60 adult outpatients with schizophrenia.

      Specific aims:

        1. Assess the effects of a single dose of D-cycloserine 50 mg on cognitive functioning
           compared to placebo.

        2. Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on cognitive functioning
           at week 8 compared to placebo.

        3. Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on memory functioning once
           a week 1 hour after medication administration compared to placebo.

        4. Assess the persistence of learned information in a no-treatment follow-up assessment at
           Week 10 in the D-cycloserine group compared to the placebo group.

        5. Assess effects of weekly D-cycloserine dosing on positive & negative symptoms at week 8
           compared to placebo.

        6. Assess tolerability and side effects of weekly D-cycloserine compared to placebo.

        7. Assess the effects of d-cycloserine dosed weekly for seven weeks on reward
           responsiveness as measured with the response bias task compared with placebo.

        8. Assess the effects of d-cycloserine dosed weekly for seven weeks on measures of
           functioning.
