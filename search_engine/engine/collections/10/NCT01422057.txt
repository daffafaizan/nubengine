      seriously affected.

      In the present study, markers of cardiac autonomic dysfunction, repolarization and
      respiration abnormalities will be assessed from Holter recordings and 30-minute recordings of
      high-resolution three dimensional ECG, non-invasive arterial blood pressure and respiratory
      activity.

      The correlation between markers of cardiac autonomic dysfunction and markers of severity of
      type-2 diabetes will be assessed. Autonomic dysfunction is assumed present when both heart
      rate turbulence and deceleration capacity are abnormal ("severe autonomic failure").
      Assessment of severity of diabetes includes levels of HbA1c and urine albumine, duration and
      treatment of diabetes, and diabetes related complications (nephropathy, neuropathy,
      retinopathy).
