      individuals with celiac disease proven by biopsy (or other medically documented confirmation
      of CD, e.g. TTG counts > 10 times the upper limit of normal on two occasions) at least 12
      months before study entry, and who are following a gluten-free diet but continue to have
      recurrent symptoms.

      AGY is designed to neutralize the hidden gliadin in food, thus preventing gliadin absorption
      and gliadin induced pathogenesis. The study will test whether AGY is safe and effective in
      the study population, versus placebo.

      Primary Objective: The primary objective will be to evaluate the effect of AGY on celiac
      symptoms using the daily Celiac Symptom Index (CSI).

      Secondary objectives: Secondary objectives will be to evaluate product safety and the effect
      of AGY on quality of life, autoantibodies, and gut permeability.
