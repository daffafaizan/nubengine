      diagnoses and more than 75% of the patients are diagnosed with an advanced stage. ASCO
      guidelines recommended that elderly patients with advanced NSCLC use single-agent
      chemotherapy. Nearly a decade of clinical trials showed that:the median survival time (MST)
      of Vinorelbine is 5-10months,1-year survival rate is 32%;the MST of Gemcitabine is
      6.8-9months,the MST of Taxol is 6.8-10.3months.Research had shown that TCM can prolong
      long-term survival and improve QOL, but high-level evidence is desperately needed to support
      this finding.

      The investigators perform a multi-center, randomized, double-blind controlled, prospective
      study in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients are randomized over observational
      group (TCM granules plus single-agent chemotherapy), and control group (TCM placebo plus
      single-agent chemotherapy). The investigators will observe 4 cycles and after that regular
      follow-up will be arranged. The primary end point is: PFS (progression-free survival); the
      secondary end points are: (1) OS(overall survival); (2) Objective response rate; (3)
      TTP(Time-to-Progression); (4) QOL (EORTC QLQ-L43, TCM syndrome score); (5) other end points
      are: Toxicity, side effects and security of the treatments will be assessed at the same time.
      The investigators expect that integrated TCM combined with chemotherapy has a better efficacy
      on prolonging PFS, OS, improving QOL, reducing the adverse reaction of patients than that of
      chemotherapy.Therefore our study can provide evidences for optimizing and promoting
      integrated TCM combined with Western Medicine treatment.
