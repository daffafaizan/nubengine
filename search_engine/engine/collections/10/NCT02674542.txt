      stillbirth or early neonatal death. This will be a qualitative study using 20 in-depth
      interviews and four focus group discussions of up to 10 women each. In-depth interviews will
      be conducted in Chichewa in a private room either within the participants' homes or in
      another private location determined by the participant.

      Each interview will take approximately 60-90 minutes to complete. The focus group discussions
      will be conducted in a private room in a health facility with 6-10 participants. These will
      take approximately 90-120 minutes to complete. Interviews and the focus group discussion will
      be audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated to English. If a participant is found to be
      eligible, she will be invited to participate in the study. After the investigators complete
      the in-depth interviews, the investigators will analyze the data and modify our focus group
      discussion guide as needed to integrate new themes that may have emerged during the
      individual interviews. The investigators will recruit 6-10 women per focus group (24 to 40
      total) from the same hospital that were used to recruit for the individual interviews.

      The investigators will search for recurrent patterns and themes in data and for ideas that
      help to explain the presence of these patterns. The data collection and analysis process is
      designed to be iterative, such that the investigators will be reviewing data as it is
      collected and adjusting the data collection instrument to reflect new themes that emerge
      during the data collection process. All interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed,
      translated, coded and computerized for analysis.
