    
      There are three total visits for this study. Details of each visit are listed below.

      Screening/Assessment Visit:

      This evaluation will include interviews, questionnaires, computerized testing, urine drug
      screen, breath sample for carbon monoxide level and alcohol and physical examination. If
      accepted into this study, you will then be scheduled for a biofeedback and an imaging
      session. Both smokers and nonsmoking controls will go through the screening process.

      Biofeedback Session:

      You will be asked to participate in a biofeedback session scheduled for 60 minutes. You will
      be comfortably seated and a sensor to measure your temperature will be placed on a finger of
      your non-dominant hand. You will be asked to make changes in your skin temperature based on
      feedback from the monitoring system. Your responses to the biofeedback session will be
      compared to your responses to feedback in the scanner. Both smokers and nonsmoking controls
      will go through the biofeedback session.

      Imaging Visit:

      The imaging visit should last approximately 2 hours. You will also be asked to refrain from
      using alcohol and any street drugs for 24 hours and from using any marijuana for 3 days prior
      to the visit. If you smoke, you will be asked not to smoke for 2 hours prior to the scanning
      session. Evaluation will include an interview, questionnaires, and a breath carbon monoxide
      level. If you are a woman, a urine pregnancy test will be completed prior to the exam. If you
      smoke, you will be asked to complete questionnaires that focus on your craving and withdrawal
      symptoms for cigarettes. These questionnaires will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.
