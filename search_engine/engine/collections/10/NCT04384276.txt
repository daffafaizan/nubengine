      Clinic. At this visit, families will complete the consent process. After consent is obtained,
      the study team will ensure that the family is signed up for the Patient Portal and will
      provide a demonstration of how to safely obtain a weight using the Weigh Easy scale and the
      infant's car seat. In addition to the luggage scale, a handout will also be sent home with
      the family, including instructions and safety tips for weighing their infant and instructions
      for submitting a weight via the Patient Portal.

      Families will be asked to submit a weight, obtained with the Weigh Easy scale, via the Weigh
      Easy eClipboard message on a weekly basis for 3 months.

      Three months after the family is enrolled onto the study, the family will be provided the
      Parental Satisfaction Survey to complete. This will occur at a clinic visit, in the event
      that a standard of care visit occurs within the window for the visit. If a clinic visit is
      unavailable, the surveys will be emailed to the family and three reminders will be sent if
      the survey is not completed in a timely manner.
