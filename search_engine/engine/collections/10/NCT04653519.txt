      monolithic zirconia FPD. Each patient case will receive two modes of preparation as in the
      previous in-vitro study: virtually guided tooth preparation using occlusal resin template to
      assist the intraoral preparation and the reference virtual tooth preparation. Each
      participant's preparation will be evaluated using diagnostic dental software and will be
      compared to a reference digital virtual preparation using 3-D mesh processing reverse
      engineering metrology software.
