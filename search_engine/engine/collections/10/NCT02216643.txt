      will be randomized up to 8 hours from symptoms onset in both arms (mechanical thrombectomy
      versus medical management alone). Subjects are either ineligible for IV alteplase or have
      received IV alteplase therapy without recanalization. They will be admitted at acute stroke
      units in Brazil (or ICU if needed) and treated following international guidelines.
      Concomitant medications and non-pharmacological therapies will be recorded. A maximum of six
      attempts to retrieve the thrombus in a single vessel can be made. No additional treatment
      will be allowed either with Intrarterial tPA, mechanical devices or angioplasty/stenting.

      The primary endpoint will be distribution of the modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days
      (shift analysis) as evaluated by two separate assessors who are blinded to treatment

      Interim Analysis The sample size for this Phase III Trial is projected to be 690 subjects.
      For interim analyses, the method of Lan and DeMets will be used to allocate alpha via the
      power family method with Ï† (phi) equal to 1 for the assessment of efficacy and futility,
      respectively after the first 174, 346 and 518 patients enrolled have completed the 90-day
      follow-up. The interval may be more frequent if requested by the Data and Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB). At interim analysis, in case the stopping boundaries are crossed the DSMB may
      recommend stopping the study either for better efficacy of the tested treatment either for
      futility. Other factors, such as safety, will be taken into consideration by the DSMB in the
      decision to stop the study. When considering stopping the trial for safety reasons, the DSMB
      will be instructed to consider both mortality (mRS=6) and severe dependency (mRS=5) at 3
      months as one single outcome.
