    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, multinational, Phase 2 basket study exploring the
      efficacy and safety of neratinib as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies in
      participants with HER (EGFR, HER2) mutation-positive solid tumors. The study has a basket
      design and includes several cohorts, either defined by an actionable somatic mutation or by
      actionable mutation and tumor histology, including HER2 mutant breast, HER2 mutant cervical,
      HER2 mutant salivary gland, and EGFR Exon 18 mutant Non-small cell lung cancers.

      The trial will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, and an end of treatment
      visit occurring when neratinib is discontinued for any reason, a safety follow-up visit
      occurring 28 days after the last dose of neratinib and a survival follow-up period.
