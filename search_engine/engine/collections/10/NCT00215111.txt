      restriction in calories by modifying intake of fat and simple sugars, along with an increase
      in energy expenditure through more physical activity. However, this approach is associated
      with only limited success. As a result, overweight children and adolescents are seeking
      alternative approaches to weight management, such as diets that modify the type and amount of
      carbohydrates. However, at this time there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of
      these diets, particularly with younger children. This study is a controlled clinical trial
      that compares the safety and efficacy of a low carbohydrate and reduced glycemic load diets
      to a more standard dietary intervention for the management of pediatric obesity (i.e.
      portion-controlled, moderate fat, high carbohydrate diet). This study will involve 150
      overweight children (ages 7 to 12) who will be randomly assigned to one of the three diet
      groups for 12 months. The effects of each diet will be determined by measuring changes in
      anthropometric measures (body weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference, body
      composition), other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, fasting lipid profile,
      fasting glucose and insulin, and inflammatory markers of cardiovascular disease), and
      measures of psychological well-being and mental status. The results of this study will
      provide needed information to the public in their quest for safe, effective, and
      health-promoting weight management strategies for obese children. Such information is vital
      if we are to address the obesity epidemic in the United States.
