      patient and visitor aggressive behavior towards nursing staff practicing on medical inpatient
      units. Staff on each unit will be informed about the AIMS study and all eligible nursing
      staff will be invited to participate in the study. After completing the informed consent
      nursing staff will be asked to complete the baseline demographic form and survey on
      professional quality of life. For the data collection phase of the study consented
      participants will be educated on use of the AIM log and provided with scenarios to practice
      AIM log use. Consented staff will carry event counters and use the AIM log for all shifts
      worked over the next 2 weeks.
