      To explore (i) the safety and tolerability, and (ii) the efficacy of probiotics on
      HIV-associated microbial translocation, systemic immune activation, disease progression and
      composition of gut microbiota in chronic HIV-1 infection.

      Methodology/Study design:

      Approximately 50 patients without current indication for antiretroviral treatment (ART) and
      50 patients receiving ART without normalised CD4 counts will be included. A controlled
      clinical trial will be carried out within each stratum randomised in a 2:1:1 fashion to
      double blinded intervention and placebo arms as well as an open, untreated control arm,
      respectively.
