      treatment is aimed at preventing extension and recurrence of the blood clot (DVT) through the
      use of anticoagulation medication. Compression stockings may be added for reduction of pain
      and swelling, but this therapy remains controversial amongst physicians. To date, there is
      limited manual therapies available for individuals affected with DVT. Regular medical
      treatment, anticoagulation medication, along with osteopathic treatment may offer these
      individuals improved control of the symptoms associated with DVT. In the long term
      osteopathic treatment may provide an increase in the quality of life (QOL) and improve the
      signs and symptoms associated with the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), which can be
      burdensome for both the individual and the health care system. Offering an effective add on
      treatment could provide individuals and the medical system with an additional means of
      treatment for the symptoms of DVT and also for the prevention of development of PTS.
