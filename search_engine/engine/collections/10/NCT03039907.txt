      allow patients that underwent total knee arthroplasty with the Journey II to return to
      recreational sports and/or work activities, and to achieve recommended physical activity
      levels (defined by the American Heart Association and the American College of Sports
      Medicine).

      The second purpose is to examine the factors that limit the ability of patients to resume
      sports, work, and physical fitness training, including comorbidities, general health,
      complications, and other factors.

      The third purpose is to use advanced sports medicine rehabilitation principles that involve
      staged progressive protocols to safely prepare patients for sports, work, and physical
      fitness training. Objective measurements of muscle strength, endurance, balance, and
      neuromuscular control will be used to determine when patients may be cleared to participate
      in these activities.
