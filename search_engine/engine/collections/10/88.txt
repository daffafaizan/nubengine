radiocardiography.. principles and methods .the aa show the importance of radiocardiography, as a method toevaluate the cardiac output, the ventricular volumes and the pulmonaryblood volume .in this first paper, they are particulary concerned with sometechnical aspects, which are very important to collect data .the position of the collimator on the precordium, the injection ofisotopes through a catheter, just behind the ventricle near thetricuspid valve, the selection of ratemeter constants the velocity ofpaper on the recorder and the way to read the area of the curve, werespecially discussed .finally, they present the formula used to calculate cardiac output,ventricular volumes and pulmonary blood volumes .
