      for about 30 days. This study is aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of D-PLEX in
      prevention of post abdominal surgery incisional infection.

      The study population includes male and female, 18 years old and above at screening,
      undergoing an elective colorectal surgery involving resection, with or without a stoma, that
      includes at least 1 incision that is > 10 cm (target incision). Eligible and willing subjects
      will be randomly allocated into 2 blinded study arms D-PLEX with SOC or SOC alone.

      D-PLEX will be applied during the surgery at the final stage of incision closure. All
      patients will be followed up for additional 5 visits over 2 months, for safety and incisional
      wound assessment. This will include blood tests for hematology and chemistry well as
      physicians assessment of the incisional wound.
