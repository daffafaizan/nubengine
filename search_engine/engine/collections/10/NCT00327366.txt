      women with abnormally long menstrual cycles or with winter depression, which suggests that
      bright light may influence sex hormones and ovulation. The study was designed to investigate
      this possibility. Twenty-two women with slightly lengthened menstrual cycles and without
      clinically evident endocrine abnormalities completed a study lasting for two menstrual cycles
      separated by an off-protocol episode of at least 1 menstrual cycle. Bright light therapy was
      administered for a week at home during one experimental cycle, and dim light during another
      cycle (placebo-controlled, crossover, counter-balanced order). Daytime blood sampling and
      ultrasound scan were performed before and after a week of light therapy, on the ~7th and 14th
      days after menstruation onset. Ultrasound examination was repeated further to document
      ovulation. Serum was assayed for thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone,
      follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol. The preliminary results were reported at the
      SLTBR meeting in June, 2005.
