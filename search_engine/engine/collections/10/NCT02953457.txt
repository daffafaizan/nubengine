      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of the combination of PARP inhibitor olaparib with
      anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and anti-CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab. (Phase I) II. To assess
      the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on progression
      free survival (PFS) rates. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on
      anti-tumor immune responses in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive or resistant or
      refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who carry a
      germline and/or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and/or a homologous recombination deficiency
      (HRD).

      II. To assess the impact of the combination of olaparib with durvalumab and tremelimumab on
      PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive or resistant or
      refractory epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who carry a
      germline and/or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and/or a HRD.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of olaparib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), and tremelimumab intravenously (IV)
      over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment with olaparib continues for up
      to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with
      tremelimumab repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses and treatment with durvalumab repeats
      every 4 weeks for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, and every 2
      months thereafter.
