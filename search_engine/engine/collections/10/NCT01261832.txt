      intervention (PCI), with significant reductions in the angiographic restenosis rate and need
      for repeated revascularization. However, several studies showed that DES is associated with a
      higher incidence of in-stent thrombosis compared with bare metal stents. Therefore, the
      latest guideline for antiplatelet therapy after PCI with DES suggests that the dual
      antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) be administered for at least 12 months.But is
      it enough for high-risk patients? Some studies showed that as many as 50% of the patients who
      received PCI did not react positively to aspirin or clopidogrel.Furthermore, there is
      increased platelet activity in acute coronary syndrome, especially in acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI). compared with aspirin or clopidogrel.A recent study suggested that
      cilostazol could ameliorate platelet responsiveness to clopidogrel in patients who underwent
      primary PCI. Furthermore, some other studies showed that the administration of cilostazol
      after PCI could significantly lower the incidence of in-stent restenosis. Therefore, the
      present study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of additional administration of
      cilostazol with aspirin and clopidogrel in a real-world cardiology practice among patients
      presenting with AMI who received primary PCI with DES.
