      out and the medical records will be consulted to collect the variables included in Annex 2.

      We will review a total of 215 patients according to the calculation of the sample size (see
      section) A prospective study will also be carried out in which the positive patients for C.
      difficile determined by the Microbiology Service of the General University Hospital Gregorio
      Marañón will be included. The medical records of the selected cases will be reviewed. All
      patients included in the prospective study (Objective 3) will receive the information sheet
      and consent sheet that they must sign for this study (Annex 1). These patients will be
      followed and the variables included in Annex 2 will be collected.
