      decreasing the side effects commonly seen with noninvasive ventilation. Studies have shown
      that even though noninvasive ventilation (NIV) with positive airway pressure (PAP) is
      successful at treating obstructive sleep apnea and hypoventilation, individuals have poor
      compliance with therapy. The reasons for poor compliance are numerous, but one significant
      and continually reported reason is poor mask fit. A poor mask fit is not only uncomfortable,
      but frequently causes side effects such as dry eyes, congestion, skin irritation and
      breakdown, and ineffective ventilation from inadequate pressures due to air leaking around
      the mask. Pediatric patients tend to be especially difficult to fit with conventional masks
      because of their smaller facial features and the lack of masks developed for pediatric use.

      In this study, patients will be fitted with a custom made NIV mask following facial imaging
      with a 3D camera (Artec 3D Scanner). The facial image will be used to construct an NIV mask
      model using computer design software that will then be created by using a 3D printer.
