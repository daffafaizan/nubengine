    
      Large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic stroke is a treatable disease at specialized centers.
      Clinical outcomes of patients with LVO is time-dependent. To maximize clinical benefit of
      thrombectomy, stroke systems of care need accurate methods to triage patients with LVO to
      comprehensive stroke centers or thrombectomy ready centers rather than closer primary stroke
      centers.

      EPISODE will evaluate whether measurements of the HeadPulse can predict the presence or
      absence of LVO based on recordings from a consecutive series of patients undergoing CTA for
      suspected stroke. Recordings from patients pre- and post-thrombectomy will also be compared
      to investigate whether a systematic change in cranial forces exists during LVO.
