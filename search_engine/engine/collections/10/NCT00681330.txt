      small cell lung cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray
      technique. In a prior study, it has been shown that URLC10, KOC1 and TTK are upregulated in
      human esophageal tumors. We identified that peptides derived from these proteins
      significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response in vitro and vivo. According
      to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety, immunological and clinical response
      of those peptides. Patients will be vaccinated twice a week for 8 weeks. On each vaccination
      day, the URLC10 peptide (1mg), KOC1 peptide (1mg), and TTK peptide (1mg) mixed with Montanide
      ISA 51 will be administered by subcutaneous injection. Repeated cycles of vaccine will be
      administered until patients develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever
      occurs first. In the phase I study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of these peptide
      vaccines. In the following phase II study, we evaluate the immunological and clinical
      response of this vaccine therapy.
