      and misoprostol when used alone in second trimester abortion, expecting that both drugs when
      used together will be more effective and associated with fewer side effects.

      In this study 60 women were enrolled, divided into two groups. The first group (group I), 30
      women received misoprostol and isosorbid mononitrate.

      The second group (group II), 30 women received misoprostol and placebo. The primary aim of
      the study was the occurrence of complete abortion in the first 24 hours.

      The study concluded that the combination of isosorbid mononitrate with misoprostol is more
      effective in second trimester abortion than misoprostol with placebo, but is associated with
      more side effects mainly headache.
