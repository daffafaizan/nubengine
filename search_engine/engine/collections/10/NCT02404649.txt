      Primary Outcome Measures:

      • The objective of this study is to allow a preliminary analysis of the resonance frequency
      values over the 12 month period, which will be the primary outcome

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      • To assess Crestal bone level maintenance

      Study Arms Bone Augmentation: Placement of two dental implants in Sinus augmented with Puros
      Cortico-Cancellous Particulate Allograft (70% Cortico and 30% Cancelleous) (Zimmer Dental-
      Carlsbad, CA, USA)- one implant will be TMDI (Zimmer Dental- Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the
      second will be Tapered Screw-Vent TSV-MTX (Zimmer Dental- Carlsbad, CA,USA). Implant
      stability will be determined by the initial insertion torque and RFV values at time of
      implant placement and after 1 month of healing on a monthly basis up until 12 months post
      implant placement.

      Sinus Elevation only: Placement of two dental implants as mentioned above in sinus augmented
      by sinus elevation procedure, blood clot and CopiOs Pericardium Membrane (Zimmer Dental-
      Carlsbad, CA, USA) only. One implant will be TMDI (Zimmer Dental- Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the
      second will be Tapered Screw-Vent TSV-MTX (Zimmer Dental- Carlsbad, CA,USA). Implant
      stability will be determined by the insertion torque and RFV values at time of implant
      placement and after 1 month of healing on a monthly basis up until 12 months post implant
      placement.
