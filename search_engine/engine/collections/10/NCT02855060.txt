      use of a commercial pelvic binder will improve morbidity and mortality in patients with
      pelvic fractures. We hypothesize that prehospital placement of pelvic binders will reduce
      hemorrhage and need for resuscitation and will improve overall mortality in patients with
      pelvic fractures. In addition, we hypothesize that pelvic splinting via external compression
      will improve patients' pain regardless of whether they have a pelvic, acetabular, or proximal
      femur fracture.
