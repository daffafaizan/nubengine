      2009, 26% of patients with diabetes were 75 older or over. Moreover, diabetes prevalence is
      particularly high among institutionalized subjects with more than half of them treated with
      insulin.

      Diabetes is source of activities limitations and participation restriction from the early
      stages of the disease and is responsible for 10% of direct health costs, with higher costs
      for older patients or insulin treated patients.

      Older patients with diabetes may be robust (fully independent), frail or disabled. Studies
      with patients of 75 years or older included mainly robust subjects. Nevertheless older
      patients with diabetes are more frequently frail and a large proportion have a different
      metabolic profile than younger ones: they are leaner and present more often with
      beta-cellular insufficiency. Frail or dependent patients may also have different nutritional
      status than robust ones. Thus, this is difficult to extrapolate what is known about glycaemic
      profile in robust and young older (65-74 years old) insulin-treated patients to frail and
      dependent older ones (>74 years).

      Continuous blood glucose monitoring systems give the opportunity to measure around the day
      the blood glucose variations in real-life and particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia for these
      patients treated with various types of basal insulins.
