      original study in 2003-2005. Surviving Existing Cohort participants without end-stage knee
      osteoarthritis will be asked to participate in the 144-, 152-, 160- and 168-month follow-up
      contacts. In addition, in 2016-2018 the cohort will be enriched by the recruitment of an
      additional 1,500 "New Cohort" participants with early or mild knee symptoms. The goal of the
      study is to find novel strategies to prevent disease at an early stage.
