      prostate cancer (mCRPC) within 3 months of initiating abiraterone or enzalutamide. The
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of a 12 week exercise intervention in
      mCRPC patients who have recently started on additional androgen suppression therapy. The
      investigators will also explore the effects of the exercise training on biomarkers of
      inflammation-hormonal status and their potential association with changes in lean mass and
      function.
