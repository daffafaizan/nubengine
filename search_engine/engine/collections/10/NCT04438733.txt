      breast cancer. A generic anastrozole tablet was developed to offer an alternative to the
      marketed tablet formulation.The aim of the current study was to evaluate the bioequivalence
      between the test and reference formulations of anastrozole in a single-dose, 2-period,
      2-sequence crossover study with a 21-day washout interval. A total of 26 healthy Chinese
      female volunteers were enrolled and completed the study, after oral administration of a
      single dose of 1.0-mg test and reference formulations of anastrozole. Blood samples (3 mL)
      for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected predose and 20min, 40min, 1, 1h20min, 1h40min, 2,
      2h20min, 2h40min, 3, 3.5, 4, 7, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours postdose and were determined by a
      fully validated high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The
      evaluated pharmacokinetic parameters, including Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-âˆž, were assessed for
      bioequivalence based on current guidelines.
