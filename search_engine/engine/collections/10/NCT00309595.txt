      with SFA occlusions. The disease will consist of symptomatic, de novo or restenotic
      occlusions (5 - 22 cm) on diagnostic imaging. The occlusions must not extend beyond the
      proximal popliteal artery. For the purpose of this protocol, no lesion within 3 cm of the
      upper part of the patella may be treated. At least one calf vessel must be patent. Reference
      vessel diameter must be >= 4.0 to <= 6.0 mm.

      Trial participants who meet all entry criteria, will be randomized to the SMART™ Nitinol
      Stent or balloon angioplasty.

      Patients will be followed for 12 months after the procedure. Study examinations will be done
      at screening, procedure time, discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months after the study procedure.

      This study will be conducted as an investigator initiated multicenter study with 6 study
      centers in Switzerland. Principal investigators will be Prof. Amann, PD Dr. med T. Pfammatter
      (University Hospital Zürich) and Prof. I. Baumgartner, Prof. J. Triller (University Hospital
      Bern).
