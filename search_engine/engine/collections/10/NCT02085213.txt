      evidence is based on anecdotal case-reports or clinical "trials" which are non-randomised, do
      not include a placebo arm and are underpowered. Further, in the context of constrained
      maternity resources in a publicly funded health system, it is important to quantify the costs
      associated with the use of GTN (including any subsequent monitoring costs and costs
      associated with complications) in relation to its effectiveness and any subsequent cost
      savings it may deliver over standard practice. There is therefore an urgent need for a
      pragmatic clinical trial of GTN for RP to determine whether GTN is efficacious, safe,
      acceptable and cost-effective as a treatment for RP before a treatment which may (or may not)
      work is embedded within routine clinical practice. Our proposed randomised placebo controlled
      double blind pragmatic UK wide GOT-IT trial RCT (with internal pilot study) will definitively
      determine whether sublingual GTN is (or is not) clinically and cost effective for management
      of RP.
