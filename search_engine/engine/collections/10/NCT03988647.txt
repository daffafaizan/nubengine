      combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. This combination therapy may have the potential to
      enhance the induction of systemic anti-Merkel cell carcinoma immune responses, which will
      inhibit growth and kill Merkel cell tumor cells in sites of established metastases outside of
      the local radiation therapy field.
