      US, and research indicates there is a complex relationship between these two risk factors.
      Smoking cessation is recommended as a standard treatment of diabetes by the American Diabetes
      Association; however, patients with T2DM and their providers are often inundated with other
      challenging lifestyle changes and disease management. Due to the complex relationship between
      diabetes and smoking and the large number of competing lifestyle changes recommended at
      diagnosis, smokers with T2DM may benefit from a contingency management (CM) program that
      incentivizes cessation. Providing patients tangible rewards to reinforce positive behaviors
      such as smoking abstinence has been proven effective in substance abuse programs, smoking
      cessation among pregnant women unwilling or unable to quit, and other population subgroups.
      In this CRUK2 study the investigators aim to test and further explore the potential
      effectiveness of financial incentives contingent upon proof of quitting smoking. The
      investigators will gather diabetes-related contextual factors associated with participation
      in the program and smoking cessation.
