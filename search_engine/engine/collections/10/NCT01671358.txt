      Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. MRSA can live on hospital
      surfaces for 9-14 days. Patients in rooms that were previously MRSA isolation rooms are at
      higher risk for developing a hospital-acquired infection.

      This study is to determine if medication cabinets located outside of MRSA isolation rooms and
      their contents, particularly medications and the pharmacy delivery folders are at a higher
      risk of having MRSA colonization on them. This study will use conventional methods to
      determine if MRSA colonization is present and compare results between non-isolation and
      isolation rooms. This will evaluate if alternate measures for the reduction of MRSA
      colonization are needed for the MRSA isolation rooms in regards to medication delivery and
      storage.
