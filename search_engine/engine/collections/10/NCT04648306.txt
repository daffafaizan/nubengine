           PCI in hemodynamically stable patients at high-risk for periprocedural complications
           during the procedure is associated with a significant improvement in the patient's LVEF
           and clinical status (heart failure symptoms and hospital readmissions) in the
           intermediate-term follow-up period post-ProPCI

        2. Objectives The primary objective of this study is to assess the patient's LVEF at 90
           days post-ProPCI (60 to 180 days window) as assessed in routine clinical practice and
           collected from EHR by clinical investigators.

           The secondary objective of the study is to assess the potential association between the
           completeness of revascularization and the clinical status at 90 days post-ProPCI (60-180
           days window). Clinical status includes NYHA heart failure functional class and hospital
           readmission.

        3. Sample Size: The study will enroll more than 1,000 patients at up to 30 investigational
           sites with experienced Impella operators (â‰¥ 25 cases).

        4. Primary Endpoint: Subject's LVEF at 90 days post-ProPCI (60 to 180 days window)
           collected from the subject's EHR.

        5. Secondary Endpoints:

             -  Completeness and extent of revascularization

             -  NYHA functional class at 90 days post-ProPCI (60 to 180 days window)

             -  Readmission at 90 days post-ProPCI (60 to 180 days window)
