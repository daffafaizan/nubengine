      electronic and one in print, using known dietary sources of calcium including frequency of
      consumption and portion size. For these questionnaires to be effective in clinical and
      research settings they must be a valid measurement of dietary calcium intake. To measure the
      validity of the dietary calcium questionnaires one hundred seventy three women will complete
      the two dietary calcium questionnaires and one 3-day food record. The dietary calcium
      questionnaires will be validated against this established method of dietary intake
      measurement. The objective of this study is to validate two dietary calcium questionnaires
      that can be used in clinical and research settings against an established method of dietary
      intake measurement.
