      ultrasound (CEUS) in diagnosing abdominal solid organ injuries in pediatric patients. 146
      subjects will be enrolled across approximately 8 sites in the US. All subjects will have had
      a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan as part of standard of care, confirming at least one
      solid organ abdominal injury. All subjects will have an abdominal ultrasound without
      contrast, followed by a contrast-enhanced ultrasound using the contrast agent Lumason.
      Ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound results will be compared to the CT scan results.
      The study procedures will take place within 48 hours of injury. At conclusion of enrollment
      of all subjects a centralized review of CT vs. CEUS will occur to compare to real time
      readings.
