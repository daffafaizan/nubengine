      report high rates of major depression. Depression frequently adds to the disabilities and
      suffering in these populations. Few definitive studies of depression treatments have been
      done in people with MS and none in SCI. There are several reasons to explore novel treatments
      for major depression in these groups. First, standard treatments, such as antidepressant
      medications, may not be as effective in people with neurological disabilities. Next, people
      with physical disabilities tend to be inactive. Lack of physical activity has been positively
      correlated with higher levels of depression. Longitudinal data and treatment trials suggest
      that increased physical activity is related to improved mood. Controlled trials show that
      increased exercise and physical activity can be effective treatments for major depression in
      nondisabled older adults. Previous research by the investigators' group suggests that people
      with MS are quite interested in exercise and that exercise is a safe and effective treatment
      for depression in younger, less disabled people with MS. Exercise may have widespread
      benefits for people with MS or SCI. Finally, exercise or increased physical activity
      represents a low cost, non-stigmatizing, highly accessible potential treatment for depression
      in people with physical disabilities. In this study the investigators will determine whether
      a relatively brief telephone-based intervention to promote physical activity is an effective
      treatment for major depression in people aging with MS or SCI. The investigators define
      "aging" as chronological age greater than 45 years old.
