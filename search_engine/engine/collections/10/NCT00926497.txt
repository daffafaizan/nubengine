    
      This single-centre, prospective randomized intervention study was conducted in a tertiary
      neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit in the Children's Hospital of Lucerne,
      Switzerland between June 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. All term and near term infants with
      suspected early-onset sepsis were randomly assigned either to standard treatment based on
      conventional laboratory parameters (standard group) or to Procalcitonin-guided treatment
      (Procalcitonin-group). Minimum duration of antibiotic therapy was (48)-72 hours in the
      standard group, whereas in the Procalcitonin group antibiotic therapy was discontinued when
      two consecutive Procalcitonin values were below predefined age-adjusted cut-off values.
