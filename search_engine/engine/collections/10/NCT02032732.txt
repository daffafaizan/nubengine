      for other reasons will have a leukocyte esterase test performed on fluid removed from the
      joint. A convenience sample of consecutive patients will be screened according to
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and enrolled in the study by informed consent. All patients who
      will be screened for the study will have already been identified as needing an
      intra-articular joint aspiration in accordance with standard of care. All patients who are
      enrolled in the study will have the leukocyte esterase test performed on the fluid that is
      aspirated. Results of the test strip will be recorded.
