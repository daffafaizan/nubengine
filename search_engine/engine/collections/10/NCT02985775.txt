      risk patients diagnosed with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and received
      haploidentical blood and marrow transplantation. When patients develop acute graft versus
      host disease (aGVHD), CMVpp65-specific T cells will be generated and transferred to the aGVHD
      controlled patients(patients who do not develop aGVHD are at low risk of refractory CMV
      infection, and are not include in treated group). Physical exams and blood tests will be
      performed -2w, -0d before and +1d, +2w, +4w, +8w, +12w, +24w after adoptive CMV-CTL
      transfusion. The end points were safety and clinical and immunologic response. Following time
      is 12 months.
