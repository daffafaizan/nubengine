      however, the clinical utility of doxorubicin is severely limited by its cardiotoxicity. With
      improved methods of detecting subtle changes in cardiac function, e.g. alterations in left
      ventricular wall stress (1), the incidence of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is now appreciated
      to be much higher than previously suspected, documented in 65% of long-term survivors of
      childhood cancer, even at doses as low as 228 mg/m2. This cardiotoxicity is dose-related, and
      higher doses are related to a higher incidence of clinical heart failure (2). Doxorubicin's
      cardiotoxicity is thought to be mediated through the generation of free radicals and through
      mitochondrial and membrane damage.

      We wish to determine whether beta-receptor genotype affects anthracycline-induced
      cardiomyopathy. We will correlate beta-receptor genotype with difference in wall stress
      post-anthracycline exposure, and with difference in shortening fraction. We plan to recruit
      300 patients over a two-year period. Inclusion criteria includes past exposure to
      anthracycline for cancer treatment and an echocardiogram 6 - 48 months after exposure to
      anthracyclines.

      The mean difference in 1.) wall stress and 2.) shortening fraction between each minor allele
      subgroup and wild type subgroup, for both beta-1 and beta-2 will be assessed using unpaired
      t-test analyses . We will assess through multivariate linear regression whether there are
      interactions between differences in wall stress or fractional shortening and other variables
      such as age, gender, dose of anthracycline, type of anthracycline given, and time between
      anthracycline exposure and echocardiogram. Those who receive other cardiotoxic drugs (such as
      trastuzumab for breast cancer) will be analyzed separately.
