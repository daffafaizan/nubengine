      HLA-matched sibling donor. There is a high likelihood of being unable to identify a perfect
      HLA matched unrelated donor, and the time to procure the marrow if such a donor is available
      is generally >3 months. An emerging body of literature suggests that related haploidentical
      HCT with innovative graft engineering may provide equal, or possibly superior, outcomes to
      conventional unrelated donors. This protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that HCT
      using an αβT cell / CD19+ B cell depleted graft from partially matched related donors will
      result in rapid, durable hematopoietic engraftment and rapid immune reconstitution with an
      acceptably low risk of severe acute and chronic GVHD.
