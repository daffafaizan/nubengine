    
      This is a "proof-of-principle" project for human subjects to examine the safety and
      feasibility of implementing a 1-week aerobic exercise program in the post-acute phase after
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This study will define the extent to which the exercise
      program improves recovery from mTBI in terms of relevant functional outcomes (cognition,
      mood, and physical status) and biomarkers (peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      [BDNF] concentration). This project will also lay the foundation for understanding the
      relationship between exercise and BDNF in the area of mTBI neurorecovery, thereby allowing
      future studies to develop best-practice methods for implementing exercise interventions as a
      treatment option for brain injuries.
