      To determine the objective response rates (ORR) to pemetrexed disodium (pemetrexed) in
      patients with MTAP-deficient metastatic bladder cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with MTAP-deficient
      metastatic bladder cancer treated with pemetrexed.

      II. To determine the overall survival (OS) for patients with MTAP-deficient metastatic
      bladder cancer treated with pemetrexed.

      III. Evaluate the toxicity of pemetrexed therapy for patients with MTAP-deficient metastatic
      bladder cancer.

      IV. Collect blood, urine, and tissue for future translational studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then every 3
      months for 5 years.
