      prostatectomy is salvage radiotherapy. Salvage radiotherapy delays the need for chronic,
      non-curative treatment, such as long-term androgen suppression, and is the only potentially
      curative treatment of some biochemical recurrences after prostatectomy.

      Patients are recommended to undergo salvage radiotherapy to eradicate biochemical disease
      delivered in approximately 40 treatments over the course of 8 weeks, representing a high
      burden of therapy, which may be related to lower utilization of salvage radiotherapy. Modern
      radiotherapy for prostate cancer has been afforded many advantages including advanced
      image-guided radiotherapy allowing for larger dose delivery in fewer treatments and smaller
      margins with hypofractionated (20 treatments) and ultra-hypofractionated (5 treatments)
      radiotherapy.

      In patients that need salvage radiotherapy, the potential advantages of hypofractionated and
      ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered over 20 or 5 treatments are: 1) increased
      convenience to patients because of fewer treatment days, 2) reduced costs to patients because
      of reduced travel expenses and copays, 3) improved resource utilization for physicians
      because of the fewer number of treatments per patient and consequently 4) reduced cost to
      society. In prostate cancer specifically, hypofractionated and ultra-hypofractionated
      radiotherapy has the added potential of not increasing toxicity with shorter treatment times.
