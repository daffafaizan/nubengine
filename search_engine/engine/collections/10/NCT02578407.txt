           1.1 To prove accommodative/vergence therapy (AT) can normalize the accommodative
           function of myopic children.ã€‚ 1.2 If the accommodation function of myopic children can
           be improved with AT therapy, the outcome will supply a basic for a randomized,
           multi-center clinic trail to determine the effectiveness of AT to slow the progression
           of myopia.

        2. Hypothesis:

      Accommodative/vergence therapy can normalize the accommodative functions of 8-12 years old
      Chinese myopic children.
