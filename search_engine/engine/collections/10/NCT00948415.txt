      community, state, or national level are needed. This project is an ongoing evaluation of
      Shape Up Rhode Island (SURI) program, a state-wide Internet based program involving
      team-based competition to increase physical activity and achieve weight loss.

      Aim: To enhance the effectiveness of SURI utilizing a minimal contact intervention delivered
      online.

      Design: SURI 2009 participants were invited to join a research study focusing on weight loss.
      Interested participants were randomized to two groups including a SURI Enhanced group
      (behavioral intervention presented in 12 weekly online presentations, daily self-monitoring,
      and weekly automated feedback) or a SURI Standard group (group given a list of previously
      existing online resources to aid with weight loss).
