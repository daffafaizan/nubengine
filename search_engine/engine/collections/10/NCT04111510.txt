    
      The primary aims of the study are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic Triple
           Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients by determining the objective response rate (ORR),
           using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as assessed by the
           Investigator.

        -  To characterize the safety profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as a single
           therapy in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients as measured by the
           incidence of Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

      The secondary aims of the study are:

      • To further evaluate the efficacy of autologous LN-145 as a single therapy in Metastatic
      Triple Negative Breast Cancer patients using complete response duration of response (DOR),
      disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS), using RECIST 1.1, as
      assessed by the Investigator, overall survival (OS) and (CR) rate.
