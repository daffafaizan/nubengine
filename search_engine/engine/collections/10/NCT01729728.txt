      protocol. The trial planned for the inclusion of participants in three age categories. Age 3
      to less than 6 years (young children), age 6 to less than 12 years (older children) and age
      12 to less than 18 years of age (adolescents). There was a request by the Paediatric
      Committee (PDCO) at the European Medicines Agency to include participants 2 years of age
      (very young children). The protocol amendment thus planned to combine the two youngest age
      groups into a single reporting group. The protocol amendment only planned that the very young
      children group would have separate analysis for the Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R) Scale
      and for the presentation of the serum concentrations, because the pharmacokinetic sampling
      scheme used in the 2 year old participants was different from the young children group (aged
      3 to less than 6 years).
