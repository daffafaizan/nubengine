      chronic low back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain and common musculoskeletal pain. Some studies
      with individuals with low back and neck pain show positive effects of Kinesio tape on pain
      reduction and recovery in disability. However, studies are reporting the opposite of these
      results. The number of studies in the literature is insufficient to create clinical evidence
      regarding the use of Kinesio tape in patients with neck pain. By considering this deficiency,
      the purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of Kinesio tape applied together with
      conventional physiotherapy methods in individuals with chronic neck pain.
