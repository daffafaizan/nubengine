      partial benefit from current psychotropic therapy. This clinical trial seeks to study the
      efficacy and safety of adjunctive treatment with risperidone in patients with MDD who failed
      to adequately respond to standard antidepressant treatment prior to this trial and who
      prospectively do not respond to adequate treatment with standard antidepressant therapy
      (SAD).

      Patients entering the open label phase of the study will have already taken a commercially
      available SAD for a minimum of 4 weeks, and provided the dose was optimal, will continue on
      this dose of SAD throughout the four-week open-label and six-week double-blind phases of the
      trial.

      If the dose in the four weeks prior to entering the study was not optimal (as per standard
      clinical practice), the dose will be increased to be within the optimal range and continued
      at that dose through the entire open-label SAD and double-blind phases.

      During the double-blind phase, subjects receive an adjunctive dose of risperidone or placebo,
      once daily, added to their stable dose of SAD. The starting dose of risperidone or placebo is
      0.25 mg for the first three days of the double-blind phase, and is increased to 0.5 mg for
      days 4 through 14. On the 15th day of this phase, the dose is increased to the target dose of
      1.0 mg/day. If response to this dose is not optimal by day 29, it is increased to 2.0 mg/day
      and is maintained for the duration of the 6-week double-blind phase. This dose may be reduced
      once to 1.0 mg/day, but then must be maintained at that dose for the remainder of the study.
