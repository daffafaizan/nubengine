    
      All participants will be identified via the geriatrician of the mobile geriatric team with
      the following inclusion criteria: age ≥ 75 years, ≥ 5 medications per day and being
      hospitalised either in emergency room, short-stay medicine unit or in a surgery department.
      For each patient, the pharmacist will detect potentially inappropriate prescribing (based on
      explicit criteria and an implicit approach) and liaise with the geriatrician for drug
      optimisations. The pharmaceutical advice will be added to the geriatrician's written report,
      and then addressed to the relevant physician. The implementation of the proposals will be
      evaluated immediately at the end of hospitalisation, and then reassessed three months later
      by calling the patient and/or his community pharmacist. A total of 250 patients will be
      enrolled over a 12 month-period. The evolution of potentially inappropriate prescribing will
      be assessed and their cost evaluated.
