      present intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy has become the mainstay of treatment. Nevertheless,
      intravitreal application is a hazardous procedure with a wide range of complications.
      Endophthalmitis, intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation, retinal detachment, vitreous
      hemorrhage, and cataract are among the major complications.

      The current study is focused on the cataractogenic potential of intravitreal ranibizumab.
      Cataract formation following intravitreal application is frequently associated with an
      inadvertent trauma at the procedure. However, occasionally the drug -itself- may precipitate
      cataract formation. Accelerated formation of cataract, has previously been shown as a
      possible cause of decreased visual acuity, in some cases who received intravitreal injections
      of triamcinolone. However, no prospective study has, as yet, assessed anti-VEGF agent related
      cataract progression in cases of AMD. Herein, the investigators have investigated the
      cataractogenic effect of intravitreal ranibizumab by using the Lens Opacity Classification
      System III (LOCS III).
