      labor there are several stages which are accompanied by many physiological changes and
      pharmacological interventions that may potentially influence the IOP. Among these are
      delivery position (lying versus sitting or kneeling), vascular changes and pharmacological
      effects (anesthetic agents, oxytocin and other drugs). The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of child delivery on the intraocular pressure (IOP) in healthy women.
      This will expend our understanding of the physiology of labor and its effect on the eye and
      it may serve as basis to determine the management of labor.
