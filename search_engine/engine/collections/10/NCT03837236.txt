    
      Behçet's Disease (BD) is a chronic, inflammatory, rheumatic disease that is characterized by
      mucocutaneous lesions and can be seen major organ involvement such as eyes, musculoskeletal
      system, gastrointestinal system and central nervous system. Gender and clinical findings
      effect the prognosis of the disease. Physical activity is all body movements requiring energy
      expenditure over basal metabolism and contraction of skeletal muscle. Promoting physical
      activity level is one of the major goals in the management of patients with rheumatic
      diseases because of negative impact of sedentary lifestyle which depends on rheumatic
      involvement.Impaired quality of life, aerobic capacity, respiratory function and life
      satisfaction, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety and fatigue are seen commonly in BD
      patients like the other rheumatic diseases. Because of these symptoms, it is possible and
      expected that BD patients have low physical activity level. Considering that regular physical
      activity effects survival for patients and healthy people, it is important to determine the
      factors affecting physical activity level and exercise barriers. The aim of this study is to
      investigate physical activity level and exercise barriers in patients with BD. Physical
      activity level, exercise barriers, disease activity, fatigue, depression, pain, sleep
      disorders, aerobic capacity and quality of life will be assessed using International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ),Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale, Behçet Disease
      Current Activity Form (BDCAF), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
      McGill Pain Questionnaire- Short Form (MPQ-SF), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 6 minute walk
      test and Behçet's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively.
