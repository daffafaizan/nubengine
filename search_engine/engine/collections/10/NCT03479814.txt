      high-risk rectal cancer. In neoadjuvant setting, patients are treated with standard
      chemotherapy plus experimental radiotherapy. The total dose to clinical target volume (CTV,
      rectum and locoregional lymph nodes) is 45 Gy, with a concomitant boost of 5 Gy to gross
      tumor volume (GTV), delivered with IMRT-SIB (intensity modulated radiotherapy-simultaneous
      integrated boost) technique in 25 fractions. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients are
      evaluated with 18 FDG-PET and sequential boost of 5 Gy (in 2 fractions) is planned.
