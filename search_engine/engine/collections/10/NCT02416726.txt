      tumor and the metastases in a same patient. One may cause by the heterogenicity of the tumor,
      another may cause by the sensitivity of the detection technique. So we determine to use NGS,
      which is a more sensitive technique, to detect the different gene mutations among the primary
      tumor, metastatic LN and peripheral blood in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.

      The study was designed as a prospective and single center study. Thirty five patients will be
      enrolled into the study and the clinical data of the patients, including his smoke history,
      cancer history, occupation exposure and so on, will be collected and recorded in a case
      report form. For the patients recruited in the study, the primary tumor and metastatic lymph
      nodes will be obtained by interventional pulmonology technology. And about 10ml peripheral
      blood will be collected at the same time. The tissue will be sent to Pathology Department of
      Shanghai Chest Hospital and will be processed with paraffin-embedded, and for those diagnosed
      with nonsquamous NSCLC, the rest tissue will be extracted with DNA and performed NGS for the
      qualified DNA sample using Illumina Nextseq500 sequencer.The matched peripheral blood will
      also be extract with DNA and performed NGS using Illumina Nextseq500 sequencer.
