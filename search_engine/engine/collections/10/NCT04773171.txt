      schizophrenia is about 1% worldwide. The related dysfunctions have great impact and burden to
      the concerned person and to the society. With increasing use of CR programmes in helping the
      patients to resume their capability in community living, the clinical outcome was not fully
      established especially on specific cognitive domains such as executive function (EF). The
      present study aims at evaluating the efficacy of CACR on developing EF and improving daily
      functioning. The result will provide information for therapists' future clinical decisions
      for patients' best reintegration into the societies. This also helps decrease the burden of
      family, society in the long run.
