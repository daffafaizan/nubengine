      weeks in a row (a total of 4 treatment days). Patients will then return at intervals up to 12
      weeks for blood samples and for evaluations to see if their disease responded and to monitor
      any adverse effects related to treatment. Some blood tests may then need to be repeated at
      least a few times and/or until any abnormal findings at earlier evaluations have resolved.
      Otherwise, patients will continue to be evaluated every 3 months for two years, then every 6
      months up to 5 years or until the disease worsens. Participation in the study will end when
      NHL disease worsens.
