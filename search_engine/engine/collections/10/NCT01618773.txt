      under daily clinical practice conditions. The study includes patients of all ages with
      moderate to severe inflammatory acne, taking Epiduo alone or in combination with other drugs.
      In addition, the effect of Epiduo alone or in combination with other drugs on quality of life
      and patient adherence will be assessed under marketed conditions.

      The observational study is designed as a multicentre study, covering all parts of Germany.
      Participating investigators are dermatologists with an adequate patient pool of acne
      patients. The observation time per patient will be 9 months. An interim and final examination
      with subsequent documentation are designated to be performed about 3 and 9 months after the
      start of treatment, respectively.
