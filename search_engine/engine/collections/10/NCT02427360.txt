      Study procedure

      Clinic and patient records and log books will be reviewed and the following clinical
      information will be extracted: vital signs especially the temperature, clinical signs and
      symptoms, blood slide and haematocrit result and findings of physical examination (anaemia,
      jaundice, liver, spleen etc). As a routine, these data were recorded on the clinic patient
      record and malaria smear microscopy logbook accordingly (which will be regarded as the source
      documents in this analysis). These source documents will be reviewed and stored specimen will
      be analysed after getting the permission from the Director of Shoklo Malaria Research Unit,
      the University of Oxford Tropical Research Ethical Committee (OxTREC)and the Faculty of
      Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee (FTMEC). These data will be extracted and transcribed into
      the case record forms and entered into Microsoft access. During the data extraction, the
      unique ID will be assigned to each patient whereas the patients' name will neither be entered
      into database nor disclosed in the analysis process (ie: the data will be anonymised).
