3123. effect of sodium selenate on acute poisoning with thalliumexperiments were performed on wistar rats weighing 150-200 g.  thallium was ad-ministered s.c. in doses of 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg.  sodium selenate wasgiven per os in doses of 10 mg/kg 2 hr after poisoning and 5 mg/kg dailyfor the next 2 days.  results indicate that sodium selenate protects theanimals from death.  it binds the thallium ions and increases their depositionin organs.  comparison of the level of thallium in organs of treated ratsshows that selenate increases in liver by 290.6%, in kidneys by 326.8% and inbones by 210.0%.  no influence of selenate on excretion of thallium in theurine was found, but fecal excretion of thallium increased by an average of45% of the treated animals.
