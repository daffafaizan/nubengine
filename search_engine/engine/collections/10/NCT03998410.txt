      in ambulatory settings. It can be caused by many different underlying conditions, some of
      which arise acutely and can be life-threatening, making rapid clinical evaluation and
      targeted diagnostic studies of central importance. A number of disorders cause dyspnea,
      including acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD), asthma, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, neuromuscular weakness,
      and others. The overlapping clinical presentations of these conditions and comorbid diseases
      can make the diagnostic evaluation of dyspnea a significant challenge.

      Acute heart failure (AHF) is a major cause of serious morbidity and death in the general
      population and one of the most common medical causes of hospitalization among people aged
      over 60. Patients presenting to the ED with ADHF must be evaluated and treated rapidly to
      ensure the best possible outcomes. The diagnosis should be made as soon as possible and
      therapy initiated. Delayed diagnosis at presentation may also result in patients being
      inappropriately transferred to non-specialist wards, resulting in longer stays, increased
      re-admission and poorer outcomes. The key to improving the time to diagnosis depends on the
      clinical evaluation alongside a readiness to initiate relevant additional tests.

      Previous studies showed that the TPD has the potential to differentiate between the cardiac
      cause of dyspnea and any other cause.
