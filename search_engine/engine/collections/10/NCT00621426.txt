      various times in the dialysis cycle. The hypothesis is that longer time intervals between
      hemodialysis results in sympathetic and electrolyte-induced alterations in ventricular
      repolarization that can be measured non-invasively using microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA).
      This increase in cardiac electrical instability may serve as a link between the clinically
      observed periods of increased risk and the occurrence of sudden cardiac death.
