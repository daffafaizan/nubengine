    
      Patients with aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral regurgitation, aortic
      regurgitation, artificial heart valve regurgitation or stenosis, and tricuspid valve
      regurgitation associated with pacemaker leads who are referred for clinically-indicated
      echocardiographic exams at Mayo Clinic, in Jacksonville, Florida will be screened for
      participation in the study. The plan is to have 292 people take part in this study. This
      minimal risk study will consist of the recording of patient data, activity and bleeding
      questionnaires, and collection and analysis of blood samples. Each blood sample will be
      analyzed for von Willebrand Factor antigen and activity, and von Willebrand Factor multimers,
      and BNP. Blood samples will be sent to the Mayo Special Coagulation Lab for analysis.

      Objective:

      This study seeks to assess the degree of association of the von Willebrand Factor activity
      indices and BNP to the severity of cardiac lesions, and to note a relationship between
      acquired bleeding the the hematologic abnormalities. Plasma will be stored in attempt to
      develop new in vitro tests of von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity.
