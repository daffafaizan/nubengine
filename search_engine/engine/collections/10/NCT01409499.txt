    
      This is a prospective non-randomized controlled study. Patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (BCLC C stage) who underwent palliative resection or TACE followed with Sorafenib
      or treated by sorafenib alone will be included. The patients will be divided to group A
      (palliative resection plus sorafenib), group B (palliative TACE plus sorafenib), and group C
      (sorafenib alone). The sample size will be about 200 cases altogether.
