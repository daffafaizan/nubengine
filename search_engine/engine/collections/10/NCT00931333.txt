      acrylic cement, is malleable and biocompatible, and has intrinsic radio opacity and good
      biomechanical properties (12 +/- 3 Mpa in 24 hours). After the filling of the bone cavity,
      the cement hardens in situ thanks to hydrolysis and apatite precipitation. Interestingly,
      this calcium phosphate cement has no exothermic hardening (on the contrary, the PMMA causes
      necrotic lesions in tissues around during this phase). During the dissolution, a
      macroporosity takes form between biphasic calcium phosphate granules. That permits
      vascularisation, cellular colonisation and bone healing. Thanks to its resorbability, the
      MCPC cement is replaced by a physiologic tissue. This last property is very important for
      young people needing a vertebroplasty after a traumatism.

      The issue is to validate this biomaterial with appropriate mechanical, biocompatibility
      properties and intrinsic radio opacity, and that can favour bone regeneration, with a lower
      frequency of leak and risk enhancement of other vertebra fracture. The MCPC will thus be
      tested on few patients to assess its efficacy and security for bone filling in vertebra site.

      Thus, it will be used in a low-invasive surgery, a non-percutaneous vertebroplasty,
      consisting in filling with the MCPC the body of the broken vertebra, after its stabilization
      thanks to 4 interpedicular screws. This protocol will be proposed to 21 patients 1 to 3 weeks
      after the trauma having caused the fracture. The follow up will last 12 months with 5 visits.
