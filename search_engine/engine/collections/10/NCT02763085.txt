      restorative material for Class I and Class II cavities that needs to be restored in permanent
      teeth.

      Basic filling material combines the handling properties of glass ionomer restorative
      materials with the mechanical properties of resin composite restorative materials.

      Extensive laboratory studies have been performed on the new material, but the clinical
      attributes have yet to be disclosed.

      The study will be carried out as a prospective study, with assessment of the restorations
      after three year.

      The project includes 80 patients. Most of the patients have been recruited from the Istanbul
      Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul.

      After giving their consent to take part in the study Class I & II restorations of both upper
      and lower molars and premolars are performed

      The treatment procedure is:

      The patients are offered local anesthetic before treatment start. The cavity is excavated and
      filled according to the guidelines for composite restorations.

      The control procedure is:

      The restoration is evaluated according to marginal adaptation, cavo surface marginal
      discoloration, approximal contact, fractures, caries associated with restorations and
      postoperative hypersensitivity. The controls will take place after two weeks, one year, two
      years and three years.
