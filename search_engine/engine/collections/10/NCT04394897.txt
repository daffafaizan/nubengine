    
      ASA I-II adult patients scheduled for elective thyroidectomy were randomly allocated into 3
      groups (n= 32 for each) to have TIVA either with remifentanil and propofol infusions
      separately (control group, Group I) or with MIXTIVA infusion that had remifentanil/propofol
      proportion 2/1000 or 3/1000 (remifentanil concentration 20 µg/ml or 30 µg/ml in propofol 1%,
      Group II or Group III respectively).

      This technique may be considered as a practical implementation for busy ambulatory surgery
      centers performing general anesthesia, but delayed recovery may be predicted with longer
      duration of surgery and anesthesia.
