      skin leaving it nicely moisturized allowing patients to move on with daily routines. In this
      trial, the MC2-01 cream will be compared to a marketed calcipotriene [CAL]/betamethasone
      dipropionate [BDP] ointment. The purpose of the trial, is to determine the pharmacokinetic
      parameters of MC2-01 cream and the comparator under maximum use conditions.
