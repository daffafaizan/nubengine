    
      This is a pediatric phase I study to determine a biologically active dose and to obtain
      information concerning the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF, (9 - [(R)-2[[bis [[isopropoxycarbonyl) oxy] methoxy] phosphinyl]
      -methoxy]propyl] adenine fumarate (1:1)), formerly known as PMPA prodrug, a potent nucleotide
      analogue HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, that demonstrates antiviral activity
      against most NRTI-resistant HIV-1. In addition to obtaining needed biological activity,
      pediatric safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data, the study will utilize tenofovir
      DF's potent antiretroviral activity and novel resistance mutation pattern, together with
      serial measurements of plasma HIV viral load, T-cell flow cytometry, and genotypic and
      phenotypic viral resistance analysis to conduct pilot studies in pediatric HIV pathogenesis,
      the response to antiretroviral therapy and to develop strategies to optimize the management
      of pediatric antiretroviral therapy. We will also use initial viral decay dynamics and other
      patient characteristics to model prediction for the long-term response to antiretroviral
      therapy. We will enroll children who have become refractory to or have experienced toxicity
      on prior antiretroviral therapy. Initial viral genotyping and phenotyping will be performed
      on the failing regimen, and this data will be used to create the most effective combination
      regimen with tenofovir DF. After an initial 6 days of tenofovir DF monotherapy, patients will
      receive tenofovir DF in combination with the optimal antiretroviral therapy as determined by
      their baseline viral resistance mutation pattern and history. The patients will be followed
      for at least 96 weeks to assess long-term tolerability and toxicity, and to assess the
      clinical, virological, and immunological response to tenofovir DF.
