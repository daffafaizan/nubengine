      clearly a great advantage in handling a critical (unstable, difficult) airway while inducing
      sedation in both adult and infants. The aim is to compare intubation conditions between
      dexmedetomidine and sevoflurane inhalation during fibreoptic intubation in pediatric patients
      with an anticipated difficult intubation
