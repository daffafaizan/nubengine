      or injury of the immature brain. It is a leading cause of childhood onset disability.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that umbilical cord blood is useful to repair
      neurological injury in brain.

      On the basis of many experimental studies, umbilical cord blood is suggested as a potential
      therapy for cerebral palsy.
