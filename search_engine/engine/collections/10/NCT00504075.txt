      subjects with chronic ITP to a threshold of 50 x 109/L, similar to that of published response
      >60%. The secondary objectives are: 1) to determine the safety of GAMMAPLEX at the dosage
      used in this study. 2) to determine if GAMMAPLEX maintains platelet counts of Â³ 50 x 109/L in
      subjects with chronic ITP for a period of time similar to that of a published data.
