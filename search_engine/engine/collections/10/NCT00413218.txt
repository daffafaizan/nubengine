      are the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections, with a mortality rate
      of 40%. Isavuconazole is not yet approved for the treatment of fungal infections. This study
      investigates the efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral isavuconazole. Patients are
      randomized to isavuconazole and the reference regimen. Patients with a positive blood- or
      deep tissue culture of candida fungi can be included.
