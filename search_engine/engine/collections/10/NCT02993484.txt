    
      20 diabetic and 20 non-diabetic patients undergoing elective CABG surgery or other heart
      surgery where extracorporal circulation is used will be included in the study. The patiens
      will not be given any treatment prior to the operation. During the cardiac surgery a small
      sample of the heart is routinely removed when the patient is connection to the heart-lung
      machine. From this tissue sample it is possible to isolate muscle trabeculae which will be
      used in an atrial strip model and randomized to one of four types of treatment.
      Simultaneously with the isolation of the trabeculae, a fifth trabecular will be used to
      assess mitochondrial respiration at baseline. Group 1 will serve as a sham control, group 2
      will serve as ischemic control and receive an extended period of hypoxia, Group 3 will be
      treated with ischemic preconditioning, where short periods of non lethal lack of oxygen will
      be given directly to the tissue (after removal from the patient) prior to the extended period
      of hypoxia, Group 4 will receive dimethyl malonate prior to the prolonged hypoxia.
