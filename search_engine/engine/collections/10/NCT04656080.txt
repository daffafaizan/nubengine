      i. Are dd-cfDNA levels in heart transplant recipients independent of recent cardiopulmonary
      exercise? More specifically, does the metabolic demand of maximal cardiopulmonary exercise in
      recent heart transplant recipients trigger a release of dd-cfDNA (if so, then what is the
      time course for resolution back to baseline?) ii. If dd-cfDNA does not release to any
      significant degree with cardiac allografts with short donor-ischemic time, does this test
      characteristic continue to hold for cardiac allografts transplanted after longer donor
      ischemic times? iii. In cardiac transplant recipients with medically stabilized, treated
      antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and persistent dd-cfDNA elevation, does a discrete episode
      of maximal cardiometabolic activity trigger any additional elevation of dd-cfDNA, and again,
      with what time course?
