    
      The study is a Double-masked randomised controlled trial with split-mouth design.

      Participants with periodontitis will be randomised to have one side of the mouth undergo root
      surface debridement using hand instruments and ultrasonic scaler alone, while the
      contralateral side will receive the same treatment, with the addition of the Er:YAG laser.
      Outcomes studies will be periodontal clinical parameters at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and
      12 months after treatment, radiographic parameters at 12 months, patient-reported parameters
      and laboratory analyses.
