      doses of intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous ketamine (0.1-0.5mg/kg) or placebo
      (saline, or 0.01mg/kg midazolam) weekly for up to 6 consecutive weeks. Prior to receiving
      ketamine/placebo, participants' mood and psychiatric symptoms will be assessed. Once they
      have received their treatment, mood, psychiatric side effects, ketamine blood levels, heart
      rate, blood pressure and biomarkers will be assessed. Mood and cognitive performance be
      assessed again after 4 hours. Finally, mood will also be assessed the next day.

      Some participants may be eligible to continue to Phase II. In this phase, participants will
      receive doses of ketamine approximately weekly for up to 6 months. During this phase,
      participants' mood, psychiatric, biomarkers and cognitive outcomes will be assessed.

      The purpose of the trial is to investigate the antidepressant and safety effects of using
      ketamine as a treatment in depression.
