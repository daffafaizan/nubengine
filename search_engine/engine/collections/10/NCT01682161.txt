    
      This is a prospective (patients are first identified and then followed forward as time
      passes), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication is
      assigned by chance), comparative and open-labeled (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) study.

      The study mainly consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (14 days before
      administration of study medication), treatment phase, and the follow-up phase (28 days after
      the last dose of the study medication). In the treatment phase, patients will be randomly
      assigned equally in 2 groups (Group 1 and Group 2), on the basis of known and unknown
      characteristics. Group 1 (immediate switch group): Patients will be administered with
      paliperidone palmitate immediately after randomization and will continue throughout the
      treatment phase. Group 2 (delayed switch group): Patients will remain on current oral
      antipsychotics until Week 8, and later on will be completely switched to paliperidone
      palmitate. However, during the first 8 weeks if the symptoms or satisfaction with MSQ further
      deteriorates for Group 2, they may be switched into paliperidone palmitate earlier.

      Safety evaluations will include evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination and these will be monitored
      throughout the study.

      The total duration of the study will be approximately 148 days.
