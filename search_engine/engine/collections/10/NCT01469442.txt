      (external biliary duct stent or not) by sealed envelopes. Systematic intraoperative test with
      methylene blue or air by the external biliary duct stent (EBDS) will necessary for all
      patients. Intra-abdominal drainage or not and type will be at the discretion of the surgeon.
      The EBDS will be left open for the first 7 postoperative days and then clamped. The EBDS will
      be removed during a consultation 5 weeks after surgery. Both groups of patients will be
      reviewed at 3 months after surgery, it will be noted at this point the possible complications
      related to the presence of EBDS (leakage from the drain, drop..). If patients are
      hospitalized more than five weeks, the study will stop at their consultation three months or
      the day of the consultation where the DTC is removed if it is still present at 3 months.
