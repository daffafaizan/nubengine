      standing stability of patients with stroke in clinical practice (Maeda et al., 2001).
      However, literature has also suggested that manipulation of ambulatory assistive devices in
      dynamic motor tasks, such as walking, inevitably requires additional attention, even in
      healthy adults (Wright & Kemp, 1992). Given that the majority of patients with stroke suffer
      from balance control difficulty, which subsequently increases their attentional demands
      associated with maintaining balance (Brown et al., 2002), it remains an important question as
      to whether the use of ambulatory assistive devices would take away some attentional resources
      that would otherwise be used for maintaining balance.
