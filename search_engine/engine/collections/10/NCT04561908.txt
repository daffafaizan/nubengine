      transseptal puncture still risks cardiac perforations and secondary pericardial
      effusion/tamponade, especially in patients with abnormal atrial septal morphology. To
      facilitate atrial septal crossing, different methods and devices have been developed,
      including radiofrequency energy, excimer laser, SafeSept wire and so on. However, these are
      still limited by availability and cost, and the advantages might be further offset by the
      potential risks. In addition, these methods are performed mainly with the linear insertion
      technique, which might result in less forward-force to penetrate atrial septum and
      displacement of needle-tip. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a safe, available and
      low-cost transseptal procedure for these patients.

      In this study, the hard-end of 0.014-inch microguidewire is used to drill through atrial
      septum through a 6F-guidecatheter. Over the fixed microguidewire, a 3.0 or 3.5-mm balloon is
      advanced to override atrial septum (proximal balloon within guidecatheter and distal balloon
      in left atrium). During balloon-dilation, the guidecatheter and balloon is advanced gently
      into left atrium as a unit over the fixed microguidewire.

      The study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and safety of transcatheter microguidewire
      drilling (TMD) for transseptal left atrial access.
