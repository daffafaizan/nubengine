      groups of patients will be between 30-60 years of age diagnosed with mixed dyslipidemia with
      failure to control medical nutrition therapy, which by simple random assignment with random
      numbers will be assigned to one of three groups:

        1. 20 patients will receive berberine, 1500 mg / day

        2. Patients receive 20 bezafibrate 400 mg / day

        3. 20 patients will receive combination of berberine (1500 mg / day) plus bezafibrate (400
           mg / day) They were determined before and after the intervention: lipid profile (total
           cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, VLDL), weight, BMI, waist circumference,
           glucose, blood pressure, tolerability.

      Statistical analysis was performed upon the sample of subjects. Before starting the
      statistical analysis of the groups will proceed to verify the behavior of the distribution of
      the variables included by Z Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit. The distribution of all the
      variables under this test is cataloged in normal or not normal, which define the type of
      statistical test would be performed (parametric or non-parametric). However, based on the
      sample size, non-parametric tests will be those considered most suitable for application. The
      data obtained will be expressed and presented using measures of central tendency and
      dispersion for quantitative (mean and standard deviation) variables and qualitative variables
      are expressed as frequencies and percentages.
