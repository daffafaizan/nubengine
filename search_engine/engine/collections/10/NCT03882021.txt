    
      This clinical investigation is intended to characterize the left atrial substrate using the
      Advisor™ HD Grid Mapping Catheter, Sensor Enabled™ in an HD Wave configuration and correlate
      different factors with 12-month success after a single ablation procedure using a pulmonary
      vein isolation (PVI) approach without further substrate modification.

      This is a post-market, single-arm, multi-center, prospective interventional study of the
      Advisor™ HD Grid Mapping Catheter, Sensor Enabled™. This study is aimed at determining
      correlations between pre-ablation mapping characteristics and outcomes after catheter
      ablation of atrial fibrillation.

      Approximately 300 subjects at up to 20 sites worldwide will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be followed until they complete their 12-month visit. Clinical Investigation
      visits will occur at Baseline (confirmation of eligibility), Index Procedure, 3 months, 6
      months, and 12 months. Endpoints will be analyzed when all subjects have completed their
      12-month follow up visits.
