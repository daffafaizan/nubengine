      of failure.

      This may result in a poor synchrony between the patient and the machine, leading to gross
      mismatching and potentially to an increased work of breathing.

      The investigators aim to investigate whether in these patients poorly responding to NIV the
      use of a sedation protocol using remifentanil will lead to an improve patient-ventilator
      interaction and better compliance to NIV.

      In this physiological study the investigators will study 15 patients at risk of failing NIV
      because of scarce tolerance and showing clinical signs of poor interaction with the
      ventilator.

      Once the patient will be enrolled the investigators will record using the balloon-catheter
      technique the online measurement of respiratory mechanics, to assess the inspiratory muscle
      effort and the matching between the patient breathing pattern and that of the ventilator The
      investigators will also record the clinical success of sedation (i.e. need or not for
      endotracheal intubation)
