      treatment the participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend
      treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if
      the drug has a real effect), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by
      chance), single-ascending dose study. The study consists of a screening phase, an in-clinic
      treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. The study duration for each subject will be
      approximately 5 weeks from screening (Day -28 to Day -3), in-clinic period (Day -2 to Day 4)
      to follow up visit (Day 8). Participants will receive a single oral dose of JNJ-42847922 or
      placebo in 3 cohorts. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
