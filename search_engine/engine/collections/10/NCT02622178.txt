      parameters to discriminate between healthy eyes and eyes with early to moderate glaucomatous
      visual field loss. We will evaluate measurements of the NOVA-DN VEP protocol, Corda software
      and Cirrus spectral domain (SD) OCT software in order to compare and correlate.

      Hypotheses is that NOVA-DN VEP protocol and Corda analysis results in a high sensitivity,
      specificity and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (ROC area) for
      glaucoma detection. Second hypothesis is NOVA-DN VEP protocol and Corda parameters can
      differentiate between normal and glaucoma suspects.
