      role in the reduction of ischemic recurrences in patients with atherosclerotic disease
      manifestations. In the COMPASS trial, patients with stable coronary or peripheral artery
      disease and no indication for oral anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) were
      randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid in combination with aspirin, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid
      monotherapy or aspirin monotherapy. The study showed a significant 24% relative reduction in
      ischemic outcomes with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid plus aspirin combination strategy compared with
      aspirin alone. These observations have raised practical considerations on how to implement
      the results of the COMPASS trial in clinical practice particularly for patients who are
      completing a minimum duration of DAPT and contemplating between continuing with a DAPT
      regimen versus switching to a dual pathway inhibition (DPI) regimen with aspirin plus
      rivaroxaban. Therefore, the objectives of this investigation are to assess the feasibility of
      switching from a DAPT to DPI regimen and to compare the pharmacodynamic profiles of these
      treatment regimens. This will be a prospective study conducted in cohorts of patients with
      CAD on treatment per standard of care with DAPT. Patients will be randomized to either
      maintain DAPT or to DPI. DPI consists in treatment with aspirin (81mg/qd) plus rivaroxaban
      (2.5mg/bid).
