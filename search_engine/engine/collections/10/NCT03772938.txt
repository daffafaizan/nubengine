      term that covers heterogenous group of diseases, f.e. retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt
      disease, Best's disease or age related macular degeneration. Undetermined etiology, wide
      range of factors that may trigger the onset of the disease and modulate it's course impede
      the implementation of an effective treatment. Currently, a stem cells therapy seems to be
      promising option in patients with degenerative diseases of the retina. The purpose of this
      prospective, nonrandomized, open label, pilot study is to conduct the investigation of the
      safety and efficacy of intravitreal injection of autologous bone marrow-isolated
      stem/progenitor cells with different selected phenotypes into the subjects with degenerative
      diseases of the retina. Especially, this clinical trial is designated to test the therapeutic
      (pro-regenerative and neuro-protective) functions of different stem/progenitor cell
      populations able to secrete bioactive neurotrophic factors. All patients enrolled will have a
      documented history of degenerative disease of the retina prior to study enrollment. Next,
      autologous bone marrow-isolated stem/progenitor cells intravitreous injection will be
      performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, including
      best corrected visual acuity, visual field and electroretinography parameters, to establish
      disease progression rate will be recorded throughout the duration of the post-treatment
      follow up period.
