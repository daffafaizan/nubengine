      morbimortality. The objective of foetal monitoring is to assess foetal growth, foetal
      well-being and to evaluate ability to adapt to chronic hypoxia.

      The primary objective in antenatal care is to ischemic cerebral lesions. However, there is
      currently no relevant prenatal exam predictive for the risk of such lesions.

      Foetal cerebral MRI could highlight changes in Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) in some
      frontal cerebral territories in foetuses with intra-uterine growth restriction and poor
      neonatal outcome.

      These changes could be associated with a transient cerebral ischemia. The study of ADC could
      be a useful tool in the prognostic evaluation of these foetuses.
