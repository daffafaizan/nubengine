    
      We have started a prospective study of evaluating efficacy and safety of imatinib 600mg/day
      depending on early molecular response in newly diagnosed patients with chronic myelogenous
      leukemia in chronic phase (IDEAL, NCT02204722), which will enroll 150 patients and follow up
      them for 1 years for the purpose of evaluating the primary endpoints - difference of major
      molecular response rate at 1 year. However, Chronic myelogenous is a disease which needs
      long-term for the outcome of treatment with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. After the end
      of follow-up period of IDEAL study, subjects who agree with this extension study (IDEAL-E)
      will be enrolled and be followed up for additional 4 years to evaluate the duration of
      treatment response, disease progression, and survival status. Subjects who will be enrolled
      in this prospective observational study will be treated with drugs - imatinib 300-600mg /
      nilotinib 600mg / dasatinib 100mg - which has been chosen by the each investigator according
      to the drug compliance and overall response. The drug choice will be at the discretion of
      each investigator, and the overall adverse event / molecular response will be monitored every
      6 months in this prospective observational study.
