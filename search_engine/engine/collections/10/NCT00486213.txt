      Primary

        -  Compare the incidence of capecitabine-induced palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia
           (hand-foot syndrome [HFS]) ≥ grade 2 in patients with cancer treated with pyridoxine
           hydrochloride vs placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the time to onset of HFS ≥ grade 2 in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life changes in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Identify factors predicting toxicity from capecitabine chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to gender and treatment setting (adjuvant/neoadjuvant vs palliative
      setting). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning concurrently with planned capecitabine treatment, patients receive oral
           pyridoxine hydrochloride once daily on days 1-21.

        -  Arm II: Beginning concurrently with planned capecitabine treatment, patients receive
           oral placebo once daily on days 1-21.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses (until discontinuation of
      capecitabine treatment).

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of courses 2, 4, 6, and 8, and at
      the end of the study.
