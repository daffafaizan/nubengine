      phone. If one is found eligible, she will be sent a consent and paper survey to fill out and
      send back to the research coordinator. Once that is completed, she will be given a phone
      interview in order answer additional questions of interest. Lastly, the study participant
      will be contacted once a year over the phone to obtain follow-up information.
