      delivery of the placenta, a ParaGardÂ® copper T380A IUD was inserted through the hysterotomy
      site. IUD placement was confirmed by visualization of the strings at the cervical os or via
      ultrasound at the 6 week postpartum visit. Subjects also received a phone call 6 months after
      IUD placement to ascertain physician follow-up and patient satisfaction. This telephone call
      was to ensure that each subject attended her postpartum visit, had an evaluation of IUD
      placement and then we performed a survey. This survey used a Likert Scale to measure each
      subject's satisfaction. The fields included very satisfied, satisfied, somewhat satisfied,
      neutral, somewhat unsatisfied, unsatisfied and very unsatisfied.
