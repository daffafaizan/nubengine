      theory, ASD is caused by both genes and environment interacting to produce a persistent cell
      danger response (CDR; Naviaux RK, 2014) that interferes with and alters normal child brain
      development. Gut microbiome and immune systems are also affected. In this theory, the
      pathological persistence of the cell danger response is traceable to mitochondria, and
      maintained by purinergic signaling mediated by the release of extracellular nucleotides like
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and
      uridine diphosphate (UDP). Suramin inhibits excess purinergic signaling by acting as a
      competitive inhibitor of nucleotide signaling at both ionotropic purinergic (P2X) receptors,
      and G-protein coupled, metabotropic purinergic (P2Y) receptors. Suramin has been found to
      correct the symptoms, metabolism, and brain synaptic abnormalities in two classical genetic
      and environmental mouse models of autism (Naviaux JC, et al. 2015; Naviaux JC, et al. 2014;
      Naviaux RK, et al. 2013). This study will test the safety and efficacy of a single dose of
      suramin in children with ASD. While it is not anticipated that a single dose will produce
      benefits for more than a few weeks, if successful, this study may lead to the development of
      newer and safer drugs for autism treatment.
