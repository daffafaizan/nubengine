    
      The Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable (LTS-D, (VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz, Germany), is a
      second generation single-use supraglottic airway devices (SADs) with gastric access, for
      airway management in spontaneously and mechanically ventilated patients undergoing general
      anesthesia.

      The AuraGain is a second generation laryngeal mask, satisfying airway management needs by
      integrating gastric access and ventilation capability in an anatomically curved single-use
      device that facilitates rapid establishment of a safe airway.

      The two devices have now pediatric sizes.

      To date, there is no published data comparing the LTS-D and the DLMA AG during mechanical
      ventilation in pediatric patients. The investigators hypothesized that the LTS-D and the DLMA
      AG perform similarly during mechanical ventilation despite differences in their structural
      design.

      The chief aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the LTS-D and the DLMA AG
      with respect to:

        1. time to achieve an effective airway,

        2. ease of insertion,

        3. need for interventions to achieve an effective airway,

        4. cuff seal (leak) pressure at an intracuff pressure of 60 cm H2O,

        5. ventilatory variables during mechanical ventilation,

        6. fiberoptic score,

        7. gastric tube insertion and

        8. adverse perioperative events.
