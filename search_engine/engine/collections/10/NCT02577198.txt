      effectiveness of patient-specific, point-of-care reminders on clinical practice and the
      quality of care. The investigators hypothesize that these reminders can increase clinician
      adherence to guidelines and, eventually, improve the quality of care offered to hospitalized
      patients. The results of the investigators study will contribute to the current understanding
      of the effectiveness of CDSSs in primary care and hospital settings.
