      adult patients (aged 18 years and over) of all ethnicities/races, who have been referred to
      the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University for esophageal cancer.

      The investigators will be using a standardized data collection form. This is an observational
      study in which standard of care will be practiced and the patients are not placed at
      additional risk from participating in this study. However, as the investigators are
      collecting data prospectively, all participants will sign consent. An attempt will be made to
      see if there is a correlation between the expression of SLC1A5 with esophageal cancer.
