        -  Determine the relationship between disease factors, patient factors, and understanding
           of the cancer clinical trial, and preferences for decision control in the decision to
           participate in a cancer clinical trial by patients with stage II-IV pancreatic cancer or
           stage III-IV colon or rectal cancer.

        -  Determine the relationship between disease factors, patient factors, understanding of
           the cancer clinical trial, and preferences for decision control with satisfaction with
           the decision to participate in a cancer clinical trial.

        -  Determine how quality of life, trust, and hope impact the decision to participate in a
           cancer clinical trial and the satisfaction with this decision.

      OUTLINE: This is a cross-sectional study.

      Patients complete 12 questionnaires to assess their symptom burden (e.g., nausea, pain,
      fatigue), sociodemographics, hope, quality of life, trust in the healthcare system, trust in
      health professionals, research decision control, perceived risks, adequacy of research
      information, clinical trial participation, and decision satisfaction.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
