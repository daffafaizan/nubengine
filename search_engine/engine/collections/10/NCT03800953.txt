      to the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and therefore inhibits binding to its receptor
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). In the case of avelumab, the formation of PD-1/PDL1 ligand
      pairs is blocked and CD8+ T cell immune response should be increased. This study comprises 2
      phases, the concurrent immune-chemoradiotherapy (Ave-PF-CRT) phase and the
      immune-chemotherapy (Ave-PF) phase. In the immune-chemoradiotherapy phase, patients are
      treated with PF-CRT and concomitant Avelumab. In the immune-chemotherapy phase, patients are
      treated with PF plus Avelumab. Overall radiological response, time to progression, overall
      survival and adverse events will be evaluated. Subjects' health-related quality of life will
      be assessed as well.
