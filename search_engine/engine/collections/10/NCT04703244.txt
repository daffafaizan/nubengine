      breast cancer remaining after chemotherapy or endocrine therapy is completed. We will use the
      blood and tissue for future studies. These studies will try to find ways to treat future
      breast cancer patients.

      Because there is cancer left in your body after breast cancer treatment is finished, we think
      the cancer may be different than other cancers. Tissue from surgery will be used to try to
      grow that kind of cancer in the lab so we can find out more about it and how to treat it.

      Blood samples will be used to look at measurements of biomarkers to see how this cancer is
      different and seek new ways to identify and treat it.
