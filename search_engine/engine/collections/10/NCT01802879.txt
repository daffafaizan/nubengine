      panobinostat to patients treated in a Novartis-sponsored study (parent study) which had met
      its endpoint and were benefiting from continuation of the treatment with single-agent
      panobinostat as judged by the investigator. Patients from multiple parent studies were
      transferred over to this protocol and continued to receive single agent panobinostat at the
      last assigned dose and regimen of the parent protocol. There was no screening period, and
      patients had to visit the study center at least on a quarterly basis. During these visits
      limited information on study treatment and occurrence of SAEs was collected for the clinical
      database. SAEs were only reported to the Novartis safety database. Other assessments and
      possibly more frequent visits occurred as per standard of care at the site. Patients
      continued treatment until they were no longer benefiting from panobinostat treatment,
      developed unacceptable toxicities, withdrew consent, were non-compliant with the protocol,
      the investigator believed it was no longer in the best interest to continue, the patient
      died, or for other administrative reasons. An end of treatment visit and a safety follow-up
      for 30 days after the last dose was performed. The study was expected to remain open for 5
      years or until such time that enrolled patients no longer needed treatment with panobinostat,
      whichever came earlier.
