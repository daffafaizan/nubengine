      during setting of a central venous catheter (CVC) in a ventilated patient. Several
      non-randomized studies have investigated the cross-sectional area (AST) ultrasound minor axis
      for different pressure levels by evaluating a single vessel every time or by not displaying
      the right or left side in the evaluation. Another study showed that there could be
      unpredictable size differences between the 2 subclavian veins.

      In ventilated patient, the PEEP, which is intrathoracic, will result in a decrease of venous
      return and thus possibly a superior vena cava dilation, located outside the pleura, depending
      on their capacitance. Different pressure levels showed an increase of AST with the increase
      of intra-thoracic pressure on certain veins, in a heterogeneous and not randomized manner.

      The primary purpose of the study is to measure the effect of PEEP (0, 5, 10 or 15 cm H2O) and
      the patient's position (supine or Trendelenburg strict -15-20 Â°) on the cross-sectional area
      of the jugular and subclavian veins.
