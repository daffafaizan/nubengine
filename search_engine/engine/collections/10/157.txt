comparison of central aortic and peripheral artery pressure curves .brachial artery and central aortic pressures were compared in 50consecutive patients subjected to retrograde left heart catheterizationin order to re-emphasize the fact that the two pressures are notnecessarily identical . in 43 cases the systemic systolic pressure peaksexceeded those in the central aorta while in seven these pressures wereequal . the average pressure difference was 22.6 mm. hg . the greatestdifferences occurred in cases of aortic regurgitation and could beextreme, the brachial artery systolic pressure exceeding that in theaorta by more than 100 mm. hg in some instances . the least differencesoccurred in cases of aortic stenosis but significant differencesoccasionally existed, leading to erroneous estimation of valve orificesize if the systemic rather than the aortic systolic pressure was used .
