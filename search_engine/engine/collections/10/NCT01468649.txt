      Israel Deaconess Medical Center (currently non-enrolling), who will be undergoing standard of
      care for breast cancer SLN mapping with Tc-99m will be enrolled in this study.

      Prior to surgery, patients will undergo lymphoscintigraphy as is standard of care. At the
      time of SLN mapping, the patient will be injected with indocyanine green dye (ICG).
      Concurrently, a custom-designed imaging platform that utilizes NIR fluorescence optics will
      be employed to identify the dye and its path through the lymphatic track, and its eventual
      highlighting of the SLN. Both color images and NIR images will be merged to give the
      operating surgeon a clear picture of the ICG track superimposed over anatomical landmarks.
      This technique will identify the SLN and provide an accurate video image of its location. The
      surgeon will resect all SLNs identified by Tc-99m or NIR fluorescence, and then confirm the
      radioactivity and NIR fluorescence signal in each after resection.
