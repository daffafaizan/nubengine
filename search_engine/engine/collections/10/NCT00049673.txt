        -  Compare overall survival of patients with multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide and
           prednisone as maintenance therapy vs observation alone after autologous stem cell
           transplantation.

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the objective venous thromboembolism rate in symptomatic patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, non-blinded, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to treatment center, age (under 60 vs 60 and over), and response to prior
      transplantation (complete vs incomplete). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral thalidomide daily and oral prednisone every other day for 4
           years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation.

      For both arms, patients are assessed (including for quality of life) regularly throughout the
      treatment/observation period: at baseline, every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for up
      to 4 years, and then annually thereafter.

      After the treatment/observation period, patients are followed annually..

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 324 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
