    
      Patients presenting for elective (day case) arthroscopic shoulder surgery for either
      Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression (ASD Group) or Rotator Cuff Repair (RCR Group) are
      recruited. Using a Cefar PainMatcher, a pain and sensory threshold assessment tool,
      consenting patients will have their preoperative pain thresholds recorded. The patients will
      then have a standard anaesthetic administered with TIVA (propofol/remifentanil) and either a
      subacromial injection (ASD Group) or interscalene block (RCR Group). Four days following
      surgery a telephone questionnaire will be completed by the patients recording their worst
      pain score since surgery.
