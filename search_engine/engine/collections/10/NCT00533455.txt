      Baseline measurements will be obtained with the tremor section of the UPDRS, the
      Simpson-Angus Scale, the ESRS, AIMS, and the Barnes Akathisia SScale. The Tremorometer, an
      instrument designed to quantatatively measure frequency, amplitude, and tremor power will be
      used for baseline and subsequent assessments. Demographic data will be collected. Diagnoses
      will be established with the SCID. Appropriate lab studies with an EKG will be done at
      baseline and at study end. Patients will be randomized to gabapentin or placebo and assessed
      on a blinded basis. Effectiveness of the blind will be assessed at study end. Gabapentin will
      be started at 300 mg/day and tapered up to a maximum of 1800 mg/day. The SF36 will be used to
      assess quality of life.
