      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, interventional radiology, etc.) during which close coaching is
      necessary. In spite of this adapted follow-up, the natural evolution of the disease and the
      management of treatment tolerance make these patients a frail population, sometimes isolated,
      for which admission to emergency services and admission to full hospitalization can be
      required.

      This trial will use a service package at home named IsereADOM, currently in the development
      phase in the management of 4 types of populations:

        -  Retired persons with no proven loss of autonomy;

        -  Users with loss of autonomy at risk of falling;

        -  Cardiac insufficiency;

        -  Patients with cancer.

      This service package is based on the identification of a person of proximity, called
      "sentinel referent". This person, in charge of monitoring the patient at his / her home, has
      access to various connected tools installed at the patient's home (scales, tensiometer ...)
      as well as computer solutions enabling the sharing of information with the different actors
      in the management of the patient.

      In addition, the patient benefits from motivational coaching based on investigator's
      recommendation and telephone and internet information platforms.
