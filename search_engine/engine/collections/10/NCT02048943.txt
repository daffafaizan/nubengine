    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of dovitinib
      (dovitinib lactate) when administered concurrently with gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride) and nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in
      patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      II. To characterize the safety profile of dovitinib, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel
      combination in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of dovitinib, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and
      their metabolites when administered concurrently in patients with advanced solid
      malignancies.

      II. To determine the preliminary efficacy of the study combination in patients with advanced
      solid tumors and pancreas adenocarcinoma.

      III. To explore serum and tumor biomarkers predictive of efficacy to the study combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dovitinib lactate.

      Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) once daily (QD) 5 days per week, paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
