    
      The study is a randomized (1:1), open-label, rater-blind, multi-center, prospective,
      parallel-arm, active comparator study which will consist of 15 months treatment period and a
      6 months observational safety extension period in 236 total patients with early relapsing
      multiple sclerosis (RMS) RMS patients are patients who are newly diagnosed or have never been
      on active treatment at the time of study entry with â‰¤ 3 years from first MS symptoms.

      There is a screening period and patients are randomized to either ofatumumab or first line
      DMT at baseline. Patients will be treated until the end of study (EOS) or for a maximum
      duration of 15 months. Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug or comparator will
      have their end of treatment (EOT) visit and assessments at the time of discontinuation. After
      ofatumumab or the standard of care comparator (DMT) discontinuation, patients may initiate
      alternative MS therapy according to local standard of care, if clinically indicated.

      Patients who for any reason withdraw from ofatumumab during treatment will be invited to
      participate in the observational extension safety period for 6 months or until patient
      re-starts MS treatment with a new DMT treatment. During this period, clinical efficacy after
      ofatumumab withdrawal will be assessed.
