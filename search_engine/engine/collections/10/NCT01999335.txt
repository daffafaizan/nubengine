      open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion component and part 2 was to have been a phase
      3, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized component. Part 2 was not conducted.

      The Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study followed a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation
      design. For each of the 2 schedules, groups of 3 to 6 patients were enrolled. The starting
      doses of oprozomib were 150 and 210 mg in the 5/14 and 2/7 schedules, respectively. The
      starting dose of pomalidomide was 4 mg in both schedules. As long as < 33% of patients
      experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in a given cohort, the dose of oprozomib was
      escalated in 30-mg increments for successive cohorts.

      Once the recommended dose and schedule for the expansion phase had been selected, additional
      participants were enrolled in the dose expansion portion of part 1 to continue the evaluation
      of the safety and efficacy of the regimen and determine the recommended phase 3 dose.
      Enrollment was halted during the dose expansion phase and part 2 was not conducted.
