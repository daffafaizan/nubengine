      noninvasive bioelectrical impedance device. When held, the BC3 sends an electrical impulse
      through the body to determine body fat, lean mass, and total body hydration. Bio-impedance
      devices measure the change in electrical resistance in body tissues by using a detectable
      electrical signal that passes through the body. The method is based on the principle that
      lean body mass contains virtually all the water and conducting electrolytes in the body and
      provides a good electrical pathway. In contrast, fat or fat-containing tissues produce a poor
      electrical pathway. By inducing a low-energy, high-frequency signal, a measurement of the
      baseline resistance to flow of electrical current can be assessed. The resistance measurement
      relates directly to the volume of the conductor. Through repeated measurements and
      identifying other parameters (i.e. gender, weight, age and height) proprietary equations were
      developed that determine total body water, lean mass, and % body fat.

      The purpose of this study is to validate the calculated hydration factor produced by the BC3
      bioelectrical impedance device. If this value is valid and comparable to the gold standard
      (D20) then this hydration factor will offer a very quick and inexpensive method to determine
      total body hydration status using a hand-held bioelectrical impedance device.
