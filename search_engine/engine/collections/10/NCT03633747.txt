      hemangioma patients with a diameter of 5-10 cm and no significant risk of rupture, or those
      with surgical indications but rejected of surgical, interventional/radiological
      interventions. After confirmation of no high risk for drugs, oral propranolol was given. The
      tumor size, objective remission rate, disease control rate, drugs related side effects and
      other endpoints events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the propranolol could or
      couldn't effectively control the progress of hepatic hemangioma.
