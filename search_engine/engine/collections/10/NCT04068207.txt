      treatment are widely applied for it. The worldwide prevalence of RP is estimated to be
      1/5000. RP is characterized by degeneration of peripheral rod photoreceptor(PR) and
      associated retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cells. Nyctalopia and visual field constriction
      are common symptoms. Cone degeneration and associated loss of central vision are typically
      followed later.

      Minocycline, a secord-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline antibiotic, is a highly
      lipophilic molecule and can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier. Several animal
      experiments and clinical trials have reported that minocycline exert anti-apoptotic,
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in treating neurodegenerative diseases.

      We propose to test the effect and safety of oral minocycline for retinitis pigmentosa.
