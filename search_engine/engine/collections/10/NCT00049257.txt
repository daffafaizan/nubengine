        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and time to PSA progression
           in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with paclitaxel
           and carboplatin.

        -  Determine the objective response rate, time to measurable or evaluable disease
           progression, and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks for 12 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
