      euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE).
      5-HT release mainly contributes to the subjective effects of MDMA whereas NE release is
      involved in the cardiovascular and psychostimulant effects of MDMA. DA is also likely to be
      involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. However, the functional
      role of DA in the subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear. To determine the
      role of the DA transporter (DAT) in the response to MDMA in humans the investigators test the
      effects of the DA and NE transporter blocker methylphenidate on the subjective effects of
      MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design
      with four experimental sessions. methylphenidate or placebo will be administered before MDMA
      or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be
      repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma samples are collected for
      pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is that methylphenidate will significantly reduce
      the subjective effects of MDMA.
