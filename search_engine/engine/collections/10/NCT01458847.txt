    
      This is a single dose, dose-escalating, Phase I study to evaluate safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of intravesical cis-urocanic acid (cis-UCA) in patients with primary or
      recurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      The primary objectives is to evaluate safety and tolerability of cis-UCA after a single
      intravesical instillation with escalating doses and to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of cis-UCA after a single intravesical instillation
      with escalating doses.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate pharmacokinetics of cis-UCA after a single
      intravesical instillation with escalating doses, to obtain preliminary information on
      possible anti-tumor effects of cis-UCA by cystoscopy and histological evaluation after a
      single intravesical instillation with escalating doses, and to evaluate the effects of
      cis-UCA on different surrogate biochemical markers on tumor growth and differentiation after
      a single intravesical instillation with escalating doses.

      The key eligibility criteria are the following: Patients with primary or recurrent non-muscle
      invasive bladder cancer; eligible for intravesical treatment; age 18-80 years; WHO
      performance status 0-2; acceptable liver, renal and hematological function within 30 days
      prior to inclusion.

      At minimum 3 patients and at maximum 24 patients is planned to be included in the study. The
      fixed dose-escalation levels will be used.

      Up to three dose cohorts are planned to be included:

        -  Cohort I: 2% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 3, max 12 patients

        -  Cohort II: 4% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 0, max 12 patients

        -  Cohort III: 6% cis-UCA solution (50 ml); min 0, max 12 patients
