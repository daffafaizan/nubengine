    
      There will be 8 cohorts of 7 subjects each. Cohorts 1-3 and 8 will be composed of healthy
      volunteers. Cohorts 4-7 will be composed of osteoarthritis patients. Cohort 4 will be a
      bridging cohort; osteoarthritis patients in Cohort 4 will receive the same dose as the
      healthy volunteers in Cohort 3, if deemed safe.

      Each subject will be assigned to receive a single dose of LEVI-04 or matching placebo. Each
      dose will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. Planned doses will
      start at 0.003 mg/kg in Cohort 1, and may be increased to 3.0 mg/kg in Cohort 8. The planned
      doses may be changed, depending on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic results after
      previous doses. The dose selected for each cohort will be determined by the Safety Review
      Team, following review of all available pharmacokinetic and safety data. For each escalating
      dose, there will be at least 2 weeks between the start of each cohort (at least 14 days
      between Day 0 for the last subject in the previous cohort and Day 0 for the first subject in
      the subsequent cohort), to allow for review of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data.
      In each cohort, 5 subjects will receive LEVI-04 and 2 subjects will receive matching placebo.
