      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP) as the first line anti-malaria treatment. Although the
      clinical response to this combination was relatively good in 2001, since then its efficacy
      has steadily declined: in 2002 the proportion of successful treatment (recorded at 28 days
      and PCR-unadjusted) was 83 % (Rwagacondo et al., 2003) and in 2003 it was 74% (Karema et al.,
      2006). Different artemisinin-based combination treatments (ACTs) such as
      amodiaquine+artesunate (AQ+AS), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAPPQ) and
      artemether-lumefantrine (ALN) have been tested in the past few years as possible alternatives
      to AQ+SP (Fanello et al., 2006; Karema et al., 2006).

      Chlorproguanil-dapsone (also known asLapDap) is an antifolate combination similar to
      sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) but for two important features: (1) it is rapidly eliminated
      and therefore exerts less selective pressure for resistance-conferring parasite mutations
      than does SP (Winstanley et al., 1997; Nzila et al., 2000b) and (2) it is active against the
      SP-resistant forms of the parasite that are found in Africa (Mutabingwa et al., 2001a,b;
      Kublin et al., 2002). Moreover, a pediatric course of treatment of LapDap is estimated to
      cost $0.15 (Mutabingwa et al., 2001b), making it orders of magnitude less expensive than any
      marketed antimalarial drug other than chloroquine and SP.

      In 2005-2006, a clinical trial was carried out to test safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      the combination chlorproguanil-dapsone+artesunate (CD+A): 800 children aged 12-59 months with
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria randomly allocated to AQ+SP or CD+A were followed up
      until day 28 after treatment. Adverse events, clinical and parasitological outcomes were
      recorded.

      Based on the results of all trials carried out by the NMCP, The Rwandan Ministry of Health
      has now changed the first line to artemether-lumefantrine (ALN), CoartemÂ®. The drug arrived
      in the country in October 2006.
