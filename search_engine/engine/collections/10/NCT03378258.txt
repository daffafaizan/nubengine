      department. A minority of children with a fever and a non-blanching rash with have a
      life-threatening infection. Currently it is very difficult to determine those children that
      require urgent treatment from those that have a simple viral illness.

      The aim of the PIC study is to research how to better diagnose those serious infections
      earlier.

      Data from the study will be used to test the effectiveness of current practice and to
      identify areas where current practice could be improved.
