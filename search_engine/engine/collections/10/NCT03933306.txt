      develop complications or even die after surgery. Perioperative organ injury is the leading
      cause of the unfavorable outcomes.

      Hypotension is not uncommon during major surgery and is highly responsible for the inadequate
      perfusion and organ injury. A recent study showed that individualized blood pressure
      management decreases the incidence of postoperative organ injury when compared with standard
      blood pressure management strategy.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha2 adrenergic agonist. Previous studies showed that
      dexmedetomidine provides organ protection in various conditions. In a recent meta-analysis,
      perioperative dexmedetomidine reduceds the occurrence of postoperative delirium. However,
      whether it can reduce postoperative complications remains inconclusive.

      This study aims to investigate the impact of intraoperative goal-directed blood pressure
      management and dexmedetomidine infusion on the incidence of postoperative organ injury in
      high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
