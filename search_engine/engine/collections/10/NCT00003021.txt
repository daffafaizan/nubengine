      cancer. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this therapy in these
      patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this therapy in these patients. IV.
      Determine the recommended dose of this drug for phase II trials. V. Determine the antitumor
      effects of this therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive bizelesin IV on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts
      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bizelesin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
