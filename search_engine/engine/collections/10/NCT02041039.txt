      qualities, and such cues can facilitate overeating. Alcohol consumption similarly "primes"
      appetite, and contributes to overeating while under alcohol's acute effects. Knowing the
      brain loci that respond to such naturalistic appetitive stimuli, and how they are modified by
      body fat and alcohol exposure, will provide critical insights about the neural systems that
      underlie loss of control of eating. Therefore, the main hypotheses of this study are that: A)
      Lean and obese subjects have different limbic responses to the olfactory cues that enhance
      motivation to eat, and B) Acute alcohol intoxication i) potentiates the brain's reward system
      response to food odors, and ii) affects brain systems involved in behavioral inhibition and
      eating restraint. To test these hypotheses, we have modified functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) paradigms successfully used to study alcoholic drink aromas in subjects at
      risk for alcoholism.
