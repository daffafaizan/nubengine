    
      We present a prospective study of a cohort of patients with age-related macular degeneration
      and myopic maculopathy treated with SML implantation. The study was approved by the ethics
      committee at the Consorci Sanitari de Terassa (Barcelona, Spain).

      Patients will be examined for best corrected visual acuity prior to the surgery at 6 meter
      and for reading at 40cm (with a +2.5D) and 15 cm (with +6D). Improvement of the reading
      ability at 15 cm compared to 40 cm will predict the potential for vision improvement with the
      add on lens.

      The preoperative and postoperative assessment will include a full ophthalmological exam,
      visual acuity for distance and near, optical coherence tomography of the anterior chamber and
      of the macula, axial length and keratometry examination using biometry and VFQ25
      questionnaire.

      Postoperative assessment will be performed at day 1, 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.
