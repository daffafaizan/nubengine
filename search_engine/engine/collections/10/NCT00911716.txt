      Primary

        -  Assess the feasibility of the combination of adjuvant bevacizumab, docetaxel, and
           cyclophosphamide in patients with early-stage HER2-negative high-risk breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen with regards to cardiac toxicity, hypertension, and
           bleeding complications in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen by measuring Topo II overexpression in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients will receive 4 cycles of Docetaxel 75mg/m2 + 4 cycles of Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2
      (each cycle lasts 21 days) (+/- 3 days if a due date could not be met because of public
      holidays, etc) and concomitant Avastin (Bevacizumab) 15mg/kg q 3weeks for treatment duration
      of one year.

      Bevacizumab at a dose of 15mg/kg will be administered as an intravenous infusion every 3
      weeks for a treatment period of one year, regardless of missed doses.

      Patients will be followed up through 5 years (i.e. from the time of registration through to
      end of Year 5/ 1 year treatment and 4 years follow up).
