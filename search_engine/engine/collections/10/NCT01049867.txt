    
      Refractory Coronary Artery Disease is a significant cause of mortality and decreased quality
      of life. Intracoronary infusion of CD133+ progenitor cells is a viable treatment option for
      patients with this condition. After clinical and laboratory evaluation, 50-100 ml of bone
      marrow will be obtained by bone marrow aspiration from the posterior iliac crest under local
      anesthesia. From this sample, CD133+ endothelial progenitor cells will be isolated, purified
      and packed within the next 12 hours of extraction, and resuspended in 30 ml saline solution.
      The patient will undergo coronary catheterization for selection of the target obstructed
      artery for cell infusion, which will be performed using a balloon catheter under hemodynamic
      monitoring. Once concluded, the patient will be transferred to intermediate care unit for
      post-interventional observation for approximately 24 hours before being released. Ambulatory
      follow-up will be performed at specific intervals to determine efficacy and safety of this
      intervention by clinical and laboratory examination, including imaging and cardiac function
      studies.
