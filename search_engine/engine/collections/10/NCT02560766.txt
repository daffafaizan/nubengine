    
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3 arm, parallel group study of
      HORIZANT in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe primary
      RLS. Eligible patients enter a 7-day screening period during which safety assessments are
      performed. Eligible patients are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to HORIZANT 300 mg or 600 mg, or
      matching placebo, followed by a 12-week treatment period. Patients take the study drug once
      daily at approximately 5 PM with food. Patients will visit the clinical site on 5 or 6
      different occasions.
