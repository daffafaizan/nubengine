      participating to the sleep observatory of the federation of pneumology (www.osfp.fr).

      All participating pneumologists would have to fill in the questionnaire (co-morbidities,
      concomitant treatments, biological analysis) directly online and also clinical signs and
      symptoms of acromegaly. A blood test for the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) dosage will
      be systematically prescribed to the patient. Pneumologists will have to include all
      consecutive patients presenting with sleep apnea syndrome suspicion.

      According to first IGF-1 results, patients may have to do a second blood test in a referenced
      laboratory to confirm the dosage.
