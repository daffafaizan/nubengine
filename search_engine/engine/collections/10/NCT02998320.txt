      post-exposure prophylaxis Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/FTC/Tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) for
      four Weeks.

      Elvitegravir is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Cobicistat is a
      selective, mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes of the CYP3A subfamily.
      Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and nucleoside analogue
      Ã f 2'-dexicytidine. Tenofovir alafenamide is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      (NtRTI) and phosphonoamidate prodrug of tenofovir (2'-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue).
