    
      Goal: To demonstrate differences in RV function by raising the systemic blood pressure with
      norepinephrine.

      Study design: randomized controlled trial Study population: 78 postoperative cardiac surgery
      patients admitted at the ICU.

      Intervention:

        -  Group 1: (N=22): RVEF<20% and MAP≤65mmHg. Intervention with norepinephrine to reach a
           MAP of 85mmHg for a maximum duration of two hours.

        -  Group 2: (N=22): RVEF <20% and MAP≤65mmHg. Control group: treatment according to current
           standards. Hypotensive patients are treated with fluids and/or vasopressors to gain a
           mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65mmHg.

        -  Group 3: (N=17): RVEF between ≥20 and <30% and MAP ≤65mmHg. Intervention with
           norepinephrine to reach a MAP of 85mmHg for a maximum duration of two hours.

        -  Group 4: (N=17): RVEF between ≥20 and <30% and MAP ≤65mmHg. Control group: treatment
           according to current standards. Hypotensive patients are treated with fluids and/or
           vasopressors to gain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65mmHg.

      Endpoints: Primary endpoint is the difference between the intervention and the control group
      in the change over time between baseline and the end of the study period (T4) in RVEF.
      Secondary endpoints are the echocardiographic parameters of RV and LV contractility, RV
      end-diastolic pressure, cardiac index, and fluid balance.
