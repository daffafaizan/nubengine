      epidural analgesia for labor. After written informed consent, 160 patients will have the use
      of the epidural depth equation with ultrasound (EQ-US) to estimate epidural depth (Est-D). US
      visualization of the epidural space will be completed by the principle investigator who has
      had extensive training in epidural US visualization. The EQ-US depth will be recorded. After
      US use, another provider who is listed as an investigator will place the epidural catheter
      without prior knowledge of the estimated epidural depth with the use of the equation and US.
      The actual needle depth to the epidural space (ND) will be recorded.

      Data collected from the patient's medical record will include demographic data (age, height,
      weight) gravidity, parity, and cervical dilation. Measured variables will include the
      estimated epidural depth (Est-D) as measured by the epidural depth equation with the use of
      ultrasound (EQ-US), and actual epidural needle depth (ND). The investigators believe that the
      use of ultrasound with the epidural depth equation (EQ-US) to estimate epidural depth (Est-D)
      in morbidly obese parturients will have a high correlation with actual epidural needle depth
      (ND).
