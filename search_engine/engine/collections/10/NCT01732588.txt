      is that this may be related to a 'common ion effect' leading to precipitation of the drug as
      a less soluble hydrochloride salt in the stomach, resulting in variable absorption of the
      drug. This study is designed to investigate the possibility of improving the PK profile by
      delivering the drug directly to the PSB, thereby bypassing the stomach. The study will
      compare a previously dosed PIB formulation with oral delivery of a nanoparticulate as a
      caplet formulation. The same caplet formulation containing nanoparticulate will be
      administered to the PSB via the Enterion capsule.
