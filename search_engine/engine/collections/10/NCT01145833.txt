      Children who are obese are at an increased risk for many negative health consequences in
      childhood and in adulthood. In addition, these children are at an increased risk for
      psychosocial consequences in childhood and adolescence, including poor self-esteem, teasing,
      verbal abuse and social isolation. Guided self-help offers an opportunity to provide
      empirically based programs to a larger amount of the target population. Once such treatment
      methods are available, it is possible that the guided self-help treatment for childhood
      obesity can be disseminated to primary care practitioners, psychologists, nurses, and health
      educators. Ultimately, the goal of this application is to develop a treatment protocol that
      can be used by clinics and lay health professionals to intervene with children who are
      overweight and their parents.
