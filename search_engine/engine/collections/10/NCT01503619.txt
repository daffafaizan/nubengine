      Primary

        -  To identify the major genetic alterations in human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) using
           next-generation sequencing and focusing on mutations in coding sequence.

      Secondary

        -  To follow up with in-depth assessment of candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes
           using gene expression analysis, cell culture systems, and murine models of SCLC.

      OUTLINE: DNA isolated from archived tumor tissue and blood samples are analyzed for genetic
      mutations and gene expression profiling using Illumina exome sequencing. Results are compared
      with transcriptome of tumors (or cell lines) with and without the specific mutation. Cell
      culture studies overexpressing or inhibiting the genes of interest are also performed in a
      mouse model to identified potential drivers of small cell lung cancer.
