      project. After appropriate consent patients are asked to complete a short 2 page survey about
      themselves and their eye drops. Then a video recording will be made of the patient instilling
      eye drops in their habitual manner. The eye drops used will be sterile saline placed in
      either Travatan-like or Systane bottles to simulate the corresponding prescribed medication.
      The videos will be graded for instillation technique and combined with scoring of survey
      answers.

      Patients will be asked to instill the drops to their left eye with their dominant hand as we
      expect this to be most difficult. Patients with severe (>20/200) vision loss will instill
      drops into their better seeing eye.
