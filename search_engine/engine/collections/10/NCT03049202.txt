    
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an umbrella diagnosis defined by obstructive
      lung function impairments, and is likely to be caused by a multitude of etiologies including
      environmental exposures, genetic predispositions and developmental factors. Due to the
      heterogeneity of the disease, molecular and mechanistic sub-phenotyping of COPD represents an
      essential step to facilitate the development of relevant diagnostic and treatment options for
      this constantly growing patient group. In the BRONCHO-SCAPIS study, molecular sub-phenotypes
      of smoking-induced COPD are investigated. A particular focus relates to recent
      epidemiological indications of an increasing proportion of never-smokers developing the
      disease. The study encompasses profiling of mRNA, miRNA, proteomes, metabolomes and lipid
      mediators of from multiple lung compartments (airway epithelium, alveolar macrophages,
      exosomes, and bronchoalveolar exudates) using a range of 'omics platforms, in combination
      with extensive clinical phenotyping of early stage COPD patients, never-smokers, and smokers
      with normal lung function from both genders. The primary objective of the study is to
      identify molecular sub-phenotypes of never-smokers with COPD, specifically by correlating
      clinical phenotypes multi-molecular 'omics profiling from multiple lung compartments of early
      stage COPD patients compared to healthy and at-risk control populations. Secondary goals
      involve identification of subsets of prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers for classification of
      the defined subgroups, as well as relevant pharmaceutical targets.
