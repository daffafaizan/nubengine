      has increased rapidly. Currently, over 30k hip scopes are performed annually in the United
      States (incidence 1.06 per 10K). Due to anatomical differences, hip arthroscopy procedures
      have the potential for significant fluid extravasation when compared to knee arthroscopy. A
      2011 study on hip arthroscopy showed on average 9.68 liters of fluid were used for a standard
      hip procedure; of that 1.13 liters absorbed into the surrounding soft tissues. A recent
      systematic review and meta-analysis showed warming of arthroscopic fluids significantly
      decreased the risk of hypothermia during hip arthroscopy. Additionally, active warming has
      been shown to decrease the rate of surgical site infection during numerous procedures. In
      total knee arthroplasty patients, a forced air warming gown significantly reduced narcotic
      pain consumption compared to standard care. However, the benefits of active warming for
      decreasing post-operative pain has not been studied in hip arthroscopy patients.
      Specifically, the investigators were interested in the roll the pre-warming arthroscopic
      fluid plays in post-operative pain after hip arthroscopy. The purpose of this study is to see
      if pre-warming of arthroscopic fluid reduces immediate post-surgical pain and narcotic
      consumption in hip arthroscopy patients.
