      I. To determine the metabolic adaptations that occur following exposure to standard
      chemotherapeutic agents using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples for analysis
      via cell isolation, glycolytic flux and oxygen consumption assays, viability assays, and
      western blot at baseline, 24, 48, and 72 hours after starting chemotherapy.
