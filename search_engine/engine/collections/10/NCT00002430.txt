      above 50,000 copies/ml) and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Group 1 receives IDV 3 times
      daily plus d4T/3TC twice daily. Group 2 receives IDV/NFV/d4T/3TC twice daily. Patients remain
      on study medications for 24 weeks and are seen at the clinic once every 4 weeks after
      entering the study. At each clinic visit, blood samples are taken to evaluate CD4 cell count
      and plasma HIV RNA levels.
