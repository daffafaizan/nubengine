      groups of subjects with 12 participants in each group. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      one of two vibrational units, which will differ in frequency and/or amplitude of vibration.
      The subjects will be asked to change their aligners every week instead of every 2 weeks,
      which is common with Invisalign.
