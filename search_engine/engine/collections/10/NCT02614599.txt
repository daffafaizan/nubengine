      parameters in ADD/ADHD children that not take stimulants or other drugs during study. They
      would only follow some nutritional recommendations based on increasing the amount of dietary
      protein and fast carbohydrates decrease. The duration of the study will be 6 months, 3 months
      for recruitment and 3 months for dietary treatment.
