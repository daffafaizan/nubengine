      time to progression in adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. II. Determine the effect of
      penicillamine on the reduction of serum copper in these patients. III. Determine whether
      penicillamine reduces the tumor volume, vascularity, invasion, and edema in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral penicillamine on the following schedule: Week 1: once daily
      Week 2: two times daily Week 3: three times daily Week 4: four times daily Week 5 to end of
      study: increased dose four times daily. Patients also receive oral pyridoxine daily and
      maintain a low copper diet (no greater than 0.5 mg/day). This regimen is continued for up to
      2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Radiotherapy is
      administered over 6 weeks, beginning on day 1 of penicillamine therapy. Patients are followed
      every month (with MRI every 2 months) until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
