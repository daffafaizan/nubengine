        -  Examine the feasibility and acceptability of polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel
           in pediatric patients experiencing oral pain from mucositis after cancer therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label, pilot, multicenter study.

      Beginning before hospital discharge or day 3 after chemotherapy, patients use oral
      polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel mouth rinse for at least 1 minute, 3 times per
      day or as needed. Treatment continues for 48 hours. Patients with persistent oral pain may
      continue treatment with polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel beyond 48 hours.

      Oral pain and acceptability (i.e., taste) of polyvinylpyrrolidone-sodium hyaluronate gel are
      assessed periodically using self-reported rating scales.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
