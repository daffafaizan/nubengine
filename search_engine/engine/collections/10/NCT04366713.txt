    
      This is an open-label, phase 2 study that will investigate colon pathology in patients with
      HER2-positive breast cancer treated with neratinib as monotherapy.

      All patients will receive neratinib for the first 28 days as a single daily dose of 240 mg.

      Colonoscopy will be performed after eligibility has been confirmed, but prior to
      administration of the first dose of neratinib and at Day 30 (Â± 3 days) the conclusion of
      Cycle 1 (28 days).

      Following the second study colonoscopy procedure:

        -  For patients being treated for stage 1 to 3c breast cancer in the extended adjuvant
           setting, neratinib will continue to be administered at a single daily dose of 240 mg
           until completion of one year of therapy from start of treatment, or until disease
           recurrence (as determined by the Investigator), death, unacceptable toxicity, or other
           specified withdrawal criterion.

        -  For patients being treated for metastatic breast cancer (mBC), capecitabine will be
           introduced after the second study colonoscopy procedure at a dose of 750mg/m2 twice
           daily for 14 days of each 21 day treatment cycle, with neratinib administered
           continuously throughout at 240 mg daily, until disease progression, death, unacceptable
           toxicity, or other specified withdrawal criterion.

      All patients will receive loperamide diarrhea prophylaxis daily for one 28-day cycle and then
      as needed.
