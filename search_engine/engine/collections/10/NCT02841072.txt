      200 mg mifepristone + 800 mcg buccal misoprostol to at least 20 women at 64-70 days of
      gestation. Designated staff at each site will review clinic records to identify and record
      data from every patient treated in that gestational week. Once data collection is completed,
      if the rate of success or serious complications at any clinic is substantially discordant
      from rates documented in the published literature, we may collect additional data on patients
      seeking medical abortion at 57-63 days, to aid in explaining results found in the 64-70 days
      group. In this situation, for each patient in the 64-70 days group, site staff will identify
      and record data from the next consecutive patient treated with this regimen at 57-63 days.
