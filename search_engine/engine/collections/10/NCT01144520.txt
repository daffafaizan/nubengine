      susceptibility to bacterial infection, leukotriene production, lysosomal enzyme release,
      proinflammatory cytokine expression and production of reactive oxygen species. Aberrant
      glucose concentration in diabetics affects functions of peripheral blood system as well as
      the immune system leading to impaired host defense. Impaired wound healing is a serious
      complication associated with diabetes. We hypothesized that impairment in leukocyte function
      results in dysfunctional inflammatory response in diabetic wounds. The proposed studies focus
      on characterizing mechanisms that will improve our understanding of the dysfunctional
      inflammatory response resulting in non-healing chronic wounds in diabetics.
