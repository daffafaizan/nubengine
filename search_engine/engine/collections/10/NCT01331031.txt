      between 10 and 20 years of age and enrolled in a municipal school system were analyzed. The
      participants were submitted to the self-explanatory questionnaire for screening recommended
      by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain for the determination of orofacial pain and TMD.
      This questionnaire is made up of ten guided questions with yes or no responses to the most
      frequent signs and symptoms of orofacial pain and TMD. According to the Academy, three or
      more affirmative responses are an indication of TMD. Patient history and a detailed clinical
      exam were performed for the assessment of the presence or absence of parafunctional habits.

      The frequency of signs and symptoms was analyzed and the data were described based on gender
      and age. The SPSS 12.0 program was used for the statistical analysis and the data were
      treated using the chi-square test.
