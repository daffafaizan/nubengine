      participants qualify, 10 inpatient study weeks.

      Subjects will be admitted to the Rockefeller University Hospital for the 10 week in-patient
      phase of the study. The first 2 weeks consist of a weight stabilization period, during which
      subjects will be required to eat an average American diet. This is followed by the 6 week
      weight loss period where subjects will be put on a low calorie high fat/protein diet. During
      the weight loss period, calories will be cut by 50% compared to the weight stabilization
      period. This will be followed by a 2 week weight maintenance period during which calories
      will be added to the diet to maintain the new weight. Appropriate adjustments will be made to
      keep the subject's weight stable.

      During the entire inpatient study, subjects will consume one multivitamin per day (Centrum,
      always complete, from A to Zinc) and one iron supplement per day. In addition, unlimited
      access to zero calorie liquids (water/diet soda) will be available and subjects will be
      encouraged to maintain their usual activity level.

      Females of reproductive age need to make sure that they do not become pregnant during the
      inpatient study. Urine will be tested for pregnancy once during each phase of the study.
