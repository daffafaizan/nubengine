      a minimally invasive procedure designed to replace the aortic valve inside the heart. This
      less invasive surgical approach called TAVR is offered to those patients who are high risk
      for undergoing open heart surgery to replace the aortic valve. In this study, TAVR will be
      performed using the JenaValve Pericardial TAVR System.
