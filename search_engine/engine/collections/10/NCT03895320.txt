      health promotion among youth and young adults in a participating Native American community.
      The goal of the intervention is to increase protective sexual health practices. The
      investigators will compare outcomes between two groups: the 1) experimental group and the 2)
      comparison group. Youth will be enrolled in the study and assessed at baseline, 3-months and
      6-months post-intervention. Participants ages 14-26 will be enrolled through a
      non-probability sampling frame at: a) the local Indian Health Service (IHS) facility,
      including the Emergency Department waiting room; b) local schools; c) during health fairs and
      other community-based events; and d) other community gathering spots. Eligible individuals
      will be of Native American ethnicity, 14-26 years of age, and have primary residence and/or
      employment within the participating tribe's reservation. Research staff will screen potential
      participants for inclusion/exclusion criteria, explain study goals and procedures, and
      administer informed consent. After obtaining participant consent, participants will complete
      a baseline assessment and then be randomized to receive the self-care intervention or a
      control program. Follow-up assessments will be administered at 3-months and 6-months
      post-intervention for all study participants. Each assessment is expected to take 20-30
      minutes to complete. The baseline assessment will take place at the location of recruitment
      and consent; follow-up assessments will take place at home or in a private location. All
      assessments will be self-administered on tablets using REDCap mobile technology.
