    
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study either by the
      attending physician in the Emergency Department at BC Children's hospital or by one of the
      study investigators. They will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: above
      elbow cast, long arm splint, or tape. After being treated, patients will be required to fill
      in a daily pain diary describing their level of pain and how much analgesia they are
      requiring. They will also be followed by regular phone calls to track any complications of
      treatment (e.g. loosening or shifting of cast/ splint/ tape, any skin breakdown, etc.).
      Patients will be seen for follow-up at three weeks post-injury in the Orthopedics Clinic at
      BCCH to have radiographs repeated, finish their treatment, and hand in their pain diaries.
