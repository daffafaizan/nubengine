      controls. For induction, a combination of 25 mg of meperidine and 2.5 mg of midazolam were
      injected in both groups. In the cocktail group, a bolus dose of propofol 1 mg/kg was
      administered and continuously infused. In the controls, 25 mg of meperidine or 2.5 mg/kg of
      midazolam were titrated to maintain the level of sedation.
