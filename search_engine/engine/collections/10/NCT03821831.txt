      medical/craniofacial appropriateness): CPAP, orthodontic intervention, or to remain untreated
      (control). It would be ideal if each patient was randomly assigned to one of three groups.
      However, in our study, random allocation is not an option as the established clinical
      pathways for treatment, financial resources, and physiological presentation of the patient
      determines the appropriate intervention. In each group, the effectiveness of the intervention
      will be analyzed through the evaluation of sleep parameters, medical history, questionnaire
      responses, craniofacial characteristics, diet, and metabolomic markers, each at baseline and
      at 12 months.
