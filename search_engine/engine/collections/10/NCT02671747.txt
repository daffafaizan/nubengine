      and bowel incontinence symptoms and care-seeking from workshop participants as well as
      information about workshop acceptability from workshop participants and community partners.
      The study is expected to last 6 months from initial IRB approval through data analysis and
      workshop revision. This research will provide preliminary data for a larger test of this
      workshop in four diverse Wisconsin Communities, followed by a randomized, controlled trial
      and subsequent dissemination research study.
