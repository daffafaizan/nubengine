      administration in spinal anaesthesia with levobupivacaine on postoperative pain and changes
      of consciousness, values of cortisol levels and quality of treatment for patients with
      femoral fractures compared to spinal anaesthesia with only local anaesthetic.

      The study was planned as a prospective, observational, randomised clinical trial. A total of
      60 patients ASA2 and ASA3 status, scheduled for surgical procedures were sorted into two
      groups and underwent surgery in spinal anesthesia with levobupivacaine with or without
      dexamethsone.
