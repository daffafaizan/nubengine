      medical therapy from the mid ninetieth century. Today, this therapy is a recognized modality
      in many European and Latin American nations for orthopedic problems, infections, ischemic
      diseases, and skin problems. However, despite of this wide use internationally, there is
      minimal mention of this treatment modality in the Anglo-American literature.

      The present is the first of a series of studies planned to scientifically test the
      effectiveness of ozone as a main-stream therapy, introducing it to the Anglo-American
      literature. In this first study we will check whether intraarticular injections of Ozone into
      the knee joint are effective as a therapy for pain control in patients with osteoarthritis of
      the knee.
