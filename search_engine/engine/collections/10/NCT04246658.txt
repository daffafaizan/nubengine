      enrolled in this study. They randomly assigned into two groups of equal number; control group
      (A), study group (B). Group (A) groups received the conventional physical therapy program
      based on neurodevelopmental approach for such cases. Whereas study group (B) received the
      same conventional physical therapy program given to group (A) in addition to gait training on
      platform swing walkway for 30 minute. All children were assessed before and after the
      treatment program by using 2D video based gait assessment system to measure the percentage of
      swing and stance phase, also GMFM was used to assess standing and walking, running, and
      jumping abilities, domains (D) and (E).
