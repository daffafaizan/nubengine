    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (phase 1) and overall response rate (ORR) (phase
      2) of venetoclax in combination with ASTX727 in patients with treatment-naive high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) with bone marrow
      excess blasts > 5%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rate of complete remission (CR). II. Rate of marrow/morphologic complete remission (mCR).
      III. Rate of hematologic improvement (HI; erythroid/platelet/neutrophil responses).

      IV. Rate of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence. V. Rate of platelet (PLT)
      transfusion independence. VI. Rate of cytogenetic response. VII. Rate of bone marrow blast
      response. VIII. Time to transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). IX. Duration of
      response (DOR). X. Overall survival (OS). XI. Progression-free survival (PFS). XII.
      Disease-free survival (DFS). XIII. Time to next MDS treatment (TTNT). XIV. Event-free
      survival (EFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the effects of therapy on MDS and to identify biological markers of
      response to venetoclax and/or its combination with ASTX727.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of venetoclax, followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Patients also receive
      ASTX727 PO QD on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.
