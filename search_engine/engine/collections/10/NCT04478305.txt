      and anxiety, and impaired sleep. Fluctuation in estrogen levels appears to play a role in
      this. The investigators suspect that the administration of estrogens without progesterone,
      such as conjugated estrogens/ bazedoxifene (CE/ BZA), may improve mood symptoms in this
      population. In 2017, CE/ BZA was approved for menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in Canada,
      but the effect on mood were not examined closely.

      The investigators propose a pilot study of 30 peri- and early postmenopausal women, currently
      seeking treatment for symptoms of depression or anxiety. The participants will go through a
      round of treatment with CE/BZA. The study will last 16 weeks. The study's objectives are to
      determine primarily if CE/BZA improves mood among peri- and early postmenopausal women, and
      secondarily if treatment with CE/BZA improves their sleep.
