      pain relief from a femoral nerve block. Complete recovery after leg surgery involves healing
      of tissues at the surgical site, recovery of muscle strength and range-of-motion. Some pain
      is normally experienced after leg surgery. At the hospital, pain is usually treated with pain
      medicines, and/or a nerve block procedure. A nerve block involves injecting a local
      anesthetic beside the nerves to numb the nerves that supply feeling to the knee joint and
      surrounding tissues. The choice as to whether a participant has a nerve block or not is made
      by the participant and their surgeon and is not determined by this research study. The study
      aim is to find out how long a nerve block can relieve postsurgical pain, and whether that
      duration is affected by the age of the participant.
