      hypoventilation requiring the initiation of CPAP/NIV. Most of these children have associated
      diseases (craniofacial malformations, trisomy 21, Prader Willi syndrome or neuromuscular
      diseases) which are accompanied by an abnormality of nocturnal breathing causing
      abnormalities in gas exchange and abnormalities of architecture and quality of sleep, with
      deleterious consequences on neurocognitive, cardiovascular and metabolic functions. In the
      absence of other treatments, the initiation of CPAP or NIV during sleep can correct the
      respiratory anomalies and the deleterious consequences. Optimal compliance with treatment is
      therefore essential for its efficacy and therapeutic education (TEP) plays a key role.

      The compliance of the child and his caregivers with CPAP / NIV therapy may be challenging.

      The use of an educational game (Yapouni) aims at improving communication around CPAP / NIV
      between the child and his caregivers, and may facilitate the compliance with CPAP / NIV at
      home, by increasing the motivation for using CPAP / NIV at home.

      The Yapouni educational game is based on a hot air balloon that will fly according to the
      number of hours the child has slept with his/her CPAP / NIV. Thus, the longer the child
      sleeps with his/her CPAP / NIV, the farther and higher his/her hot air balloon will fly in
      the sky. The game includes wild cards and rewards that are worked out with the child and
      his/her parents for an optimal individualized adaptation.

      The aim of the study is to assess the parents' feelings regarding the use of CPAP / NIV on D0
      and D30 later in a standard group: therapeutic education (TEP) versus a group: TEP + Yapouni.
