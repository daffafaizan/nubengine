      micronutrient supplementation in reducing morbidity and mortality in susceptible populations.
      For example, we recently completed a multiple micronutrient supplementation trial in
      HIV-positive Tanzanian women that showed a significant reduction in pre-term birth, fetal
      loss, and low birthweight. In children, we and others have also demonstrated the beneficial
      effects of vitamin A supplementation in reducing diarrheal disease and mortality. Our next
      priority is to evaluate the efficacy of multiple micronutrient supplementation in susceptible
      children. Children born to HIV-infected women are at risk of multiple micronutrient
      deficiencies due to poor dietary intake, malabsorption, and increased metabolic needs. In
      addition, these children, if HIV-infected themselves, are at significantly higher risk of
      death due to infectious illnesses compared to their non-infected peers. In this study, we
      propose to study the efficacy of micronutrient supplementation in reducing the risk of
      morbidity and mortality outcomes among children born to HIV positive mothers, compared to
      placebo supplementation.
