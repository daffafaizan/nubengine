      are roughly 3%. There are several device and procedure related characteristics which may
      increase the risk of stroke. We will examine if there is a signal in the UK registry. This
      will be important is TAVI is to be extended down to lower risk patient cohorts.

      Factors to be examined include (but not limited to):

      need for Pre-procedure Balloon aortic Valvuloplasty (BAV) Need for two valves need for
      post-dilatation need for rapid ventricular burst pacing
