    
      This is an observational prospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 recruited
      from communities surrounding New York City. 325 participants will be recruited from
      NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP)-Columbia hospital, the community using flyers and snowball
      sampling, and by contacting participants who are already participating in a Columbia
      University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) COVID-19 related study and have given consent to be
      contacted about participation in related research studies. Candidates will be eligible to
      participate if they have received a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 or were
      symptomatic and had a known contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, and are over the age
      of 7. Participants who were diagnosed empirically due to symptoms and exposure yet test
      negative by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology at baseline
      will not be considered infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may be excluded. Participants will be
      consented prior to participation in any study activities and will be prospectively followed
      for 96 weeks. At baseline, an enrollment survey will be administered that includes
      demographics, comorbidities, and characteristics of their COVID-19 illness (e.g., exposure,
      symptom onset, symptom duration, severity of symptoms) and will provide blood and host
      reservoir site samples. Participants will be followed for a 24 month period after symptom
      onset, with a maximum of 12 visits.
