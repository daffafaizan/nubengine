      increasing. In the UK 46,690 men were diagnosed in 2014 alone and it is estimated this figure
      will be closer to 70,000 by 2030. A significant proportion of these men will present with
      organ confined and low or intermediate risk disease. There is increasing recognition that
      many men with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer do not need immediate radical
      therapy.

      There is sufficient evidence that pharmacological intervention used as short-term therapy in
      men with low to intermediate-risk disease can inhibit the growth of prostate tumours and
      delay or remove the need for radical therapy in men managed by active surveillance. Given the
      irrefutable role of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer pathogenesis it is logical to
      target this pathway as a method of inhibiting or delaying disease progression.

      This window study will be built on the known anti-androgen effects of apalutamide and
      investigate the efficacy of using it as a short intervention strategy to cause a
      physiological change in the tumour by reducing its volume. Tumour volume can be measured
      using the well-established place of mpMRI defined tumour volumes as a surrogate of disease
      presence and change. The rationale for a short duration treatment is that it will not have
      the long term debilitating effects of androgen deprivation on general health and prevent the
      onset of androgen resistance.

      It is anticipated that if successful, this approach could be a new therapeutic strategy for
      these men who otherwise are living and waiting for their disease to progress or not.
