      will support the selection of the better NK cell product as measured by in vivo NK cell
      expansion. Successful in vivo NK cell expansion is defined as 40% donor DNA and 40% of
      lymphocytes are NK cells at day 7 post infusion OR 20% donor DNA and 20% of lymphocytes are
      NK cells at day 14 post infusion.

      Part 1: 1:1 randomization with 10 patients per cohort to either:

        1. CD3-/CD19- NK cell product or

        2. CD3-/CD56+ purified NK cell product The product with better NK cell expansion will be
           used for the rest of the trial. If the results and safety profile are equivalent, the
           CD56+ selection approach will be used. If neither approach results in successful NK cell
           expansion, the trial will be stopped and the platform redesigned.

      Part 2: complete the trial by enrolling an additional 26 patients using the product deemed
      successful during part 1 to estimate the primary endpoint (DFS at 12 months)
