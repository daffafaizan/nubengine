    
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, prospective study with two
      parallel treatment groups. Patients who present to the hematologist/oncologist and satisfy
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for participation in this 18-week
      study. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be randomized
      into the trial (Group A or B).
