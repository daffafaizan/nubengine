      ovum picked up. In this randomized controlled study, investigators try to observe the
      effectiveness of letrozole on decreasing the incidence of early ovarian hyperstimulation
      syndrome and vascular epithelium growth factor level of women with high ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome risks.
