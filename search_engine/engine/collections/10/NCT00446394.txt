      and health promotion program designed specifically for older adults with Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI). This study builds upon previous studies designed for cognitively intact
      older adults, with a supplemental study using a modified intervention for MCI participants,
      and for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

      Taken together, these prior investigations support the efficacy of behaviorally based
      exercise interventions in improving cognitive, physical, and affective status in cognitively
      intact and demented older adults. Results from a feasibility study suggest that these
      positive outcomes can also be obtained in older adults with MCI.

      The current study will investigate the efficacy of the modified exercise program called RALLI
      (Resources and Activities for Life Long Independence) to determine whether it is more
      effective than the control condition, a social walking program (SW), in delaying cognitive
      decline, improving self-rated health and health behaviors, improving affect and physical
      function, and enhancing quality of life. The long-term efficacy of RALLI to delay conversion
      of MCI to dementia, reduce physical disability, maintain independent living, and improve
      physiological health indicators will also be investigated.

      One hundred seventy participants over the age of 70 who meet American Academy of Neurology
      criteria for MCI will be recruited from independent living retirement residences.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two conditions (RALLI and SW) and
      assessed at baseline, post treatment (3 months), and follow up visits every 6 months for a
      total of 3 years (months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36). The hypothesis is that RALLI
      participants will experience better post-treatment outcomes than SW participants, and that
      gains will be maintained over 36 months.
