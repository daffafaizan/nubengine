      with localized hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who are newly treated and could accept
      radical treatment. Patients would be treated with toripalimab combined with docetaxel and
      cisplatin for two cycles. After the induction chemotherapy is completed, the investigator
      choose appropriate radical treatment (surgery or chemoradiotherapy) based on tumor
      evaluation. The primary endpoint is overall objective rate (ORR), the second endpoint include
      major pathologic response (MPR), 2-year DFS for surgery patients, 2-year PFS for radiotherapy
      patients, OS and QOL.
