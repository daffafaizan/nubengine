    
      Multicenter, open label, uncontrolled Phase I First In Man trial in advanced refractory
      multiple myeloma, to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of SST0001 given
      subcutaneously (sc) once daily for 5 or 10 days, in a cycle of 28 days. A starting dose of 25
      mg (flat dose) is given once daily for 5 days (from Day 1 to Day 5). In the subsequent cohort
      25 mg are administered once daily for 10 days (from Day 1 to 5 and from Day 8 to 12). Dose
      escalation with SST0001 administered for 10 days is performed in subsequent cohorts,
      depending on toxicities observed.

      Indirect pharmacokinetics based on Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) modifications
      in all patients (minimum of 3 patients in each cohort) during the first cycle of treatment
      and direct SST0001 concentrations measurements.

      Pharmacodynamics in all patients during the first cycle of treatment, based on modifications
      of coagulation parameters.

      During the study any hints of anti-tumor activity will also be evaluated based on use of
      surrogate parameters (monoclonal serum and urine protein modifications).
