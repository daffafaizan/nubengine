      has persisted for decades as the number one adolescent substance abuse problem in the U.S.
      Further, research has shown that the earlier the onset of alcohol use, the more likely is a
      person to develop alcohol dependence later, during adulthood. Consequently, the need is clear
      for interventions which will arrest this process at the earliest point possible. Hence,
      interventions that mobilize a youth's social systems to help that young person deal with the
      problem, i.e., the family and peer systems, would make sense from a number of standpoints.
      Two primary modalities developed to deal with such issues are those examined here: family
      therapy and group therapy.

      The participants were males and females, ages 13-17 at intake, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
      either alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. Following random assignment to condition, basic
      treatment in both conditions was based on a 12-session model and took approximately 3-4
      months, followed by 1-2 aftercare sessions over an additional 1-2 months. The treatment was
      provided by therapists who were already working within the community (as opposed, for
      instance, to graduate students). Follow-up assessments were obtained at 3 months
      post-treatment, 1 year post-treatment, and 2 years post-treatment, thus allowing
      determination of the extent to which treatment effects "held up" to a degree not attained by
      most of the previous outcome studies within this domain.

      Comparisons: AGT and TFT are being compared on the extent to which their participants used
      alcohol, as well as other substances, during the three post-treatment periods. Other
      comparisons include school performance (grade point average), family relations/functioning,
      and involvement with the legal system.
