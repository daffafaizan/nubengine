        -  Determine the efficacy of etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and
           doxorubicin (EPOCH) followed by lamivudine, zidovudine, and interferon alfa, in terms of
           response rate, in patients with HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on markers of virus replication and expression and
           immune function in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive EPOCH chemotherapy comprising etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin IV
      continuously on days 1-5, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 5, and oral prednisone
      on days 1-5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on
      day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for at
      least 2 courses beyond best response or for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity, disease progression, or stable disease.

      Beginning 1 month after completion of EPOCH, patients receive oral lamivudine and zidovudine
      twice daily and interferon alfa SC daily continuously for 1 year.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
