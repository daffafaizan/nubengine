    
      The study is a three period, randomized, open label study. Approximately 18 healthy subjects
      will receive GSK1349572 50mg q24h for 5 days (Treatment A) in Period 1. Subjects will then be
      administered GSK1349572 50mg q24h in combination with either LPV/RTV 400/100 mg q12h and
      etravirine 200mg q12h (Treatment B, n=9) or DRV/RTV 600/100 mg q12h and etravirine 200mg q12h
      (Treatment C, n=9) for 14 days in Period 2 followed by a washout period. GSK1349572 PK data
      will be obtained from Periods 1 and 2 and used to inform decision making on Period 3. If
      GSK1349572 CÏ„ is reduced by more than 50% in Period 2 compared to Period 1, subjects will
      return to the clinic and receive GSK1349572 50mg q12h in combination with ETV and either
      DRV/RTV or LPV/RTV in Period 3. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected
      during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of
      study drug. All doses of study drugs will be taken following a moderate fat meal.
