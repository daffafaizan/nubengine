    
      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, comparative parallel-group
      trial of subjects with chronic cough of unknown origin presenting to the Otolaryngology/ Head
      and Neck Surgery, Pulmonary Medicine, and Gastroenterology outpatient clinics at the
      University of North Carolina Hospital system.

      Potential subjects with chronic cough of unknown origin will be identified through the above
      outpatient clinics. Those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to join
      the study testing the efficacy of twice daily esomeprazole 40 mg taken for 3 months in the
      setting of chronic cough. Potential subjects will be consented for the study prior to leaving
      the enrolling clinic. A total of 40 subjects will be recruited into our study.
