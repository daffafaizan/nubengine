    
      The design of this phase I, open label, dose finding study was chosen in order to
      characterize the safety and tolerability of MIK665 and to determine the Maximal Tolerated
      Dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or Recommended Dose(s) for Expansion (RDE(s)).

      This study will utilize a Bayesian Hierarchical model to guide dose escalation and estimate
      the MTD(s) based on the dose-DLT relationship(s) for MIK665 in the indications.

      The expansion part of the study will employ an open-label multiple arm design. The purpose of
      the expansion part is to further assess safety, tolerability, PK, PD and the anti-tumor
      activity of MIK665 at the selected RDE/s for Multiple Myeloma (MM) and MYC positive Diffuse
      large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) identified in the dose-escalation part.
