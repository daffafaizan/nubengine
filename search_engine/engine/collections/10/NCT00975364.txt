    
      The main questions to be addressed in this pilot study are:

        1. what is the type of folate in red blood cells in individuals with different
           methylterahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotypes

        2. what is the relationship between other folate metabolism-related gene single nucleotide
           polymorphisms and type (species) of folate found in red blood cells

        3. what is the relationship between folate and other B vitamin status, genotype and folate
           species

        4. is there a relationship between serum ferritin status and folate metabolism

      Whole blood will be taken from apparently healthy male and female volunteers, aged 18-65,
      which will be used to determine genotype for various folate metabolism-related genes.
      Furthermore, the type of folate present on the red blood cells will be assessed, and folate,
      vitamin B12, riboflavin and serum ferritin status determined.
