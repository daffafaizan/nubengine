    
      -  Open-label SUBUTEX Sublingual Tablet Induction and Stabilisation Period After completing
           the screening period, subjects entered an open-label SUBUTEX SL tablet induction and
           stabilisation period to achieve stable daily doses of 8 mg, 12 mg, 14 mg, 24 mg or 8 -
           24 mg (variable) during a 13 day inpatient (Day -14 to Day -1) period.

        -  Open-label Treatment Phase On Day 1, eligible subjects discontinued use of SUBUTEX SL
           tablet and received a subcutaneous (SC) injection of RBP-6000. The dose of RBP-6000
           received and the cohort to which a subject was assigned depended upon the SUBUTEX SL
           tablet dose on Day -1.

             -  Injection 1 (Day 1): 3 days inpatient post-dose (Day 1 to Day 3) and outpatient
                visits (Day 4 to Day 28); serial pharmacokinetic (PK) samples

             -  Injection 2 (Day 29): 60-hour inpatient pre-dose and post-dose (Day 28 to Day 31)
                and outpatient visits (Day 32 to Day 56); sparse PK samples

             -  Injection 3 (Day 57): 60-hour inpatient pre-dose and post-dose (Day 56 to Day 59)
                and outpatient visits (Day 60 to Day 84); sparse PK samples

             -  Injection 4 (Day 85): 60-hour inpatient pre-dose and post-dose (Day 84 to Day 87)
                and outpatient visits (Day 88 to Day 113 [or Day 112 for Cohort 6]); serial PK
                samples

             -  Cohort 6 ONLY: Injection 5 (Day 113): 60-hour inpatient pre-dose and post-dose (Day
                112 to Day 115) and outpatient visits (Day 116 to Day 140); serial PK samples

             -  Cohort 6 ONLY: Injection 6 (Day 141): 60-hour inpatient pre- and post-dose (Day 140
                to Day 143) and outpatient visits (Day 144 to Day 169); serial PK samples

             -  Safety Follow-up: weekly visits up to 60 days post-Injection 4 (PK Day 114 to Day
                141) for subjects in Cohorts 1-5 who did not take part in the positron emission
                tomography (PET) imaging sub-study and up to 60 days post-Injection 6 (PK Day 169
                to Day 197) for subjects in Cohort 6

      The objective of the PET imaging sub-study was to evaluate the relationship between
      buprenorphine plasma levels and the ability of the 200 mg and 300 mg doses of RBP-6000 to
      reduce mu-opioid receptor availability measured with [11C]carfentanil and positron emission
      tomography (PET) scans. This objective was exploratory in nature and results are not reported
      as part of these summary results.
