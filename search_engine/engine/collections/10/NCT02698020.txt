      disease or demand for supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation. Control subjects receive
      current standard of care (anesthesia induction/pre-oxygenation with 80%, maintenance of
      anesthesia with 40%, and recovery with 80% inspired oxygen). Intervention subjects are
      maintained on room air throughout the procedure and supplemental oxygen added only if
      necessary according to the pre-specified oxygen saturation target. Subjects are monitored
      according to clinical protocols AND with cerebral oximetry (NIRS), transcutaneous measurement
      of partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), and blood-gas analyses. Blood and urine samples are
      collected for later analysis of markers for oxidative stress.
