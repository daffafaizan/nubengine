      residents in the United States and around the world. Pressure ulcers diminish quality of
      life, exact a devastating loss of function, increase the risk of death in geriatric
      populations and raise healthcare costs. Costs for the management of pressure ulcers in the US
      likely exceeds $6.4 billion annually, with a prevalence of approximately 12% in the high risk
      LTC population. A previous clinical trial at the University of Pittsburgh studied the effects
      of seat cushions on pressure ulcer incidence and found that when a skin protection seat
      cushion is used with a properly fitted wheelchair there is a significant reduction in
      incidence. The data led the investigators to question whether having a properly fitted
      wheelchair also has a significant effect on pressure ulcer incidence. This clinical trial
      investigate this question by randomizing subjects into a control group that receives a skin
      protection cushion and wheelchair training for use in their facility supplied wheelchair, or
      a treatment group that receives a skin protection cushion, wheelchair training and a new
      custom-fitted wheelchair. We expect that the treatment group will have a lower incidence of
      pressure ulcers.
