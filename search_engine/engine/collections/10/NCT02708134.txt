      year in the USA are treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and managed after their
      cardiac arrest. Neurological outcomes following these in-hospital CPR events are often
      abnormal. As children with neurological deficits following CPR are a major burden for
      families and society, improving neurological outcomes through superior chest compression
      delivery during CPR and optimal care and management after cardiac arrest is an important
      clinical goal.

      Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to obtain evidentiary support to associate
      the relationship of quantitative CPR quality data (depth, rate, chest compressions (CC)
      fraction, compression release) during CPR, post-cardiac arrest care (PCAC) and patient
      survival in those children who suffer an arrest within the study (RES-Q) Network.
