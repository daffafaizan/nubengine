      6000. This disorder is characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organ
      systems, including the brain. The primary neurological manifestations of TSC are epilepsy,
      mental retardation and autism. Epilepsy is most common, occurring in 80-90% of patients, and
      often the seizures are severe, unremitting, and uncontrolled by current anticonvulsant
      medications. It is generally accepted that the seizures arise from cortical and subcortical
      tubers and surrounding tissue in the brain. These tubers are caused by mutations in the tumor
      suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2. The protein products of these genes, hamartin and tuberin, act
      as negative regulators of the PI3K/PKB(Akt)/mTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth
      and proliferation Everolimus is an immunosuppressant drug that also inhibits mTOR signaling
      and is capable of reversing aberrant mTOR-dependent effects that occur when hamartin or
      tuberin are absent or defective. Thus, we hypothesize that drugs like everolimus may be
      therapeutically useful for the treatment of refractory epilepsy in patients with TSC.
