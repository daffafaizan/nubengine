    
      Two hundred (200) male and female subjects with papulopustular rosacea will be enrolled to
      get 176 completed subjects (forty-four (44) completers each in groups 1 to 4).

      After assessing eligibility during an up to 28 days screening period, 200 subjects will be
      enrolled in the study (fifty subjects each in groups 1 to 4). Subject visits are scheduled at
      Screening, Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16.

      Clinical assessments of efficacy will be conducted based on Investigator's Global Assessment
      (IGA, modified scale without erythema), Clinician's Erythema Assessment (CEA), and on
      inflammatory lesion counts at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 in comparison to Baseline. Additionally,
      high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the blood will be assessed at Baseline, and
      at Week 16 to explore any impact of the treatment on the inflammatory pathology.
