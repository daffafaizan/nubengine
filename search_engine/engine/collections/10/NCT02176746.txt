      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with colorectal
      cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the PBMCs of the
      colorectal cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate ALDHhigh and ALDHlow
      tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the colorectal cancer patient using a similar protocol
      as investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-colorectal cancer CSC immunity
      induced by colorectal cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of colorectal cancer CSCs by
      antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with colorectal cancer CSC-DC.
