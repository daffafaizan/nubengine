      I. To determine the rate of progression to multiple myeloma after 3 years of follow up.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe baseline patient characteristics and clinical variables. II. To identify
      molecular and genetic correlates that may predict for progression to multiple myeloma (MM).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples every 6 months for 3 years. Patients may also
      undergo a biopsy, x-rays, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans,
      and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to check the status of disease at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of 3 years on study, patients are followed up every 6-12 months thereafter.
