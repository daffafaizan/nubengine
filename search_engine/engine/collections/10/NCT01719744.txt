      working. These enzymes are needed for cells to divide including cancer cells. ENMD-2076 also
      works by stopping the growth of new blood vessels which would provide the tumor with
      nutrients for it to grow. It is believed that by blocking Aurora A enzymes from working and
      stopping new blood vessels from growing, the tumors may stop growing or shrink.
