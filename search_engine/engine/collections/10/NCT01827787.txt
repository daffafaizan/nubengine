      first-line or second-line chemotherapy treatment. This is a non-randomized, open label study
      with participants enrolled in one of two cohorts: Cohort 1. Hormone receptor
      (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (HR+/HER2-) or Cohort
      2: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) meaning HR-negative/HER2-negative (HR-/HER2-). HR-
      means progesterone receptor-negative (PR-) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-). Beyond
      efficacy as measured primarily by response to treatment, investigators will evaluate safety,
      tolerability and quality of life. In particular, it is hypothesized that eribulin may have
      lower rates of neuropathy, a common side effect of many of the major chemotherapeutics with
      activity in MBC. The investigators will study the effect eribulin has on the nerves through
      regular questionnaires that ask about any nerve-related symptoms. The investigators also plan
      to send blood samples to explore if gene markers may indicate increased sensitivity to the
      nerve effects of eribulin.
