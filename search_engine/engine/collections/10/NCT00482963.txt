      interactions between these agents and HIV medications. HIV-infected women taking efavirenz
      have an even greater need for effective birth control as this medication may cause severe
      brain damage to a developing fetus. The use of an emergency contraceptive agent in cases of
      unprotected sex or condom failure can prevent pregnancy. This study seeks to establish that
      Plan B can be used effectively and safely in women taking efavirenz.
