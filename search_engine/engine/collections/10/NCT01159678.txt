      themselves, their body, and their significant relationships at sexual and intimate levels1.
      Cancer and its treatments affect the physiological, psychological, and sociological realms of
      a survivor's life and his/her ability to experience sexual health. Sexual health is
      recognized as an integral aspect of quality of life (QOL) during cancer and is increasingly
      receiving research and clinical attention. Sexual changes following the treatment of
      gynaecologic (i.e.: ovarian, endometrial, cervical) and colorectal cancers are common though
      often not discussed. Moreover, cancer survivors express dissatisfaction that sexual concerns,
      and treatment of them, are not discussed in the context of their cancer care. Oncologists
      frequently are faced with patients inquiring about sexual changes with cancer treatment, but
      are usually not equipped with accurate and comprehensive data on the precise sexual symptoms
      to expect or where to refer patients with sexual concerns.

      The aims of the study are to assess the efficacy of a 12-module online psychoeducational
      intervention for sexual health (OPES) on (1) the primary endpoint of sexual distress in male
      and female cancer survivors with sexual problems; (2) the secondary sexuality-related
      endpoints of sexual desire, arousal (women) or erection (men), orgasm, and sexual pain; (3)
      on mood, relationship satisfaction, and quality of life; and (4) to assess gender differences
      in the proportion of survivors improved on sexual distress.
