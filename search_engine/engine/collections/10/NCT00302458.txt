    
      The main goal of this study is to assess whether the abuse liability potential of delayed,
      repeated administrations of different formulations of MPH is moderated by the oral delivery
      system in which a delivery system with slower onset may be safer than one with more rapid
      early release. To this end, the investigators will compare repeated administration of orally
      administered, therapeutic doses of a short (IR-MPH) and a long-acting formulation of MPH
      (OROS-MPH) in the following areas:

        1. pharmacokinetic profile of MPH assessing rate of onset of MPH action (indexed through
           change in plasma level) and

        2. abuse liability (indexed through detection and likeability).

      The investigators will test all combinations of initial administration and then delayed
      (repeated) administration of the two formulations: IR-MPH to IR-MPH; IR-MPH to OROS-MPH;
      OROS-MPH to IR-MPH; OROS-MPH to OROS-MPH, and placebo to placebo.
