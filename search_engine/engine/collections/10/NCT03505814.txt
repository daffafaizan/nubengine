      is still ongoing. Patients aged between 0-45 days needing mechanical ventilation (MV) with
      tracheal intubation were included regardless type of admission, severity of disease and
      randomly assigned in two groups for post-extubation management: Group Optiflow (GO) for
      patients receiving HNFC oxygen therapy and Control Group (CG) for conventional treatment.
      Before programmed extubation, newborns and young infants received 0.15 mg/kg of
      Dexamethasone. Patients were evaluated during the first 72h following extubation. Primary
      endpoint was the incidence of reintubation. Secondary endpoints were incidence of
      post-extubation respiratory failure, time to reintubate and weaning time from oxygen.
      Respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were assessed and compared between the two groups upon
      extubation, after 2 hours (H2), at H6, H12, H24, H36, H48 and H72. Length of stay (LOS) and
      mortality were also estimated.
