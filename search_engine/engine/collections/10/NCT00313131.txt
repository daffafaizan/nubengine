      therapy in the syndromic management of vaginal discharge.

      Methods: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial comparing single-dose tinidazole plus
      fluconazole (TF) to seven days of metronidazole plus three days of vaginal clotrimazole (MC)
      among 1570 women presenting with vaginal discharge in primary health care institutions of
      Ghana, Togo, Guinea and Mali. Participants were randomly allocated to one of the two
      treatments by research nurses or physicians using pre-coded envelopes. Effectiveness was
      assessed by symptomatic response on day 14.

      Findings: The two treatment regimens had similar effectiveness: complete resolution was seen
      in 66% (TF) and 64% (MC) and partial resolution in 33% (TF) and 34% (MC) of participants
      (p=0.26). Effectiveness was similar among subgroups with vulvovaginal candidiasis, T.
      vaginalis vaginitis or bacterial vaginosis. The two treatment regimens had a similar
      effectiveness among HIV-infected (TF: n=76, 71% complete resolution, 28% partial; MC: n=83,
      72% complete, 25% partial, p=0.76) and HIV-uninfected women (TF: n=517, 68% complete, 32%
      partial; MC: n=466, 65% complete, 33% partial, p=0.20). Cervical infections with N.
      gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis and M. genitalium were uncommon among women not involved in sex
      work, were associated with bacterial vaginosis or T. vaginalis vaginitis, and did not alter
      response to treatment with agents active against vaginal infections. Four fifths of women not
      relieved by single-dose TF had a favourable response when MC was administered as second-line
      treatment.

      Conclusion: Single-dose TF is as effective as multiple-dose MC in the syndromic management of
      vaginal discharge, even among the HIV-infected. Given its low price and easier compliance,
      tinidazole/fluconazole should be considered as a first-line treatment of the vaginal
      discharge syndrome.
