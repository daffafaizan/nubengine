      such as bacteria) that live on the human body called the microbiome. Recent studies have
      shown that premature babies are more likely to have changes in their gut microbiome that are
      associated with health issues. However, the specific microbiome features that are involved in
      the development of premature babies is still unknown. Therefore, this study examines the
      impact of very premature birth on the baby's microbiome, and how microbiome alterations are
      involved in health issues such as immune dysregulation, allergies and asthma.

      The large communities of microbes in the gut play a major role on the microbiome that will
      form during infancy and childhood. Factors such as diet, exposure to antibiotics, surgical
      procedures, and mode of delivery, can strongly affect the dynamics microbiome development. It
      is well known that microbiome alterations are associated with disorders such as asthma.
      However, the features involved in disease development and progression are highly
      understudied. Through this clinical study, we will evaluate associations between the early
      patterns of microbial colonization in premature infants and their risk to develop asthma
      later in childhood.

      The hypothesis of the study is that microbial alterations resulting from preterm birth
      causally contribute to the allergy and asthma risk in infants (defined by atopic-wheeze)
      through immune mechanisms.
