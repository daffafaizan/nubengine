      signal displayed on a monitor and front in the patients: in the biofeedback group, patients
      will be instructed to control muscle activity, whereas in the placebo group patients will
      receive a pill of placebo. In each patient 3 sessions will be performed over a 10-day period.
      Physiological (muscular activity by EMG) and clinical outcomes (number of rumination events
      by questionnaires administered daily for 10 days) will be measured before and after
      treatment.
