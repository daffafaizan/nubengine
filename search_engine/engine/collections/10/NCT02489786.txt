      tachyarrhythmias. It exerts a positive inotropic, neurohormonal, and electro physiologic
      actions on the heart . For heart failure patients, the targeted steady state serum digoxin
      level is between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/ml . Ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation patients
      will usually require higher digoxin steady state serum concentrations . However, serum
      digoxin level higher than 2 ng/ml is associated with increased incidence of adverse drug
      reactions and should be avoided . Because of inter and intra-patient variability, narrow
      therapeutic index, and risk of toxicity, digoxin doses are calculated based on the patient
      weight, renal status, indications and drug interactions. Due to substantial overlap between
      therapeutic and toxic levels of digoxin, therapeutic drug monitoring is a must especially in
      patients with deteriorating renal function and electrolyte disturbance. In Egypt, most
      cardiologists give a digoxin holiday for patients with atrial fibrillation and /or heart
      failure where patients skip the drug doses on Thursday and Friday or Friday only every week
      to avoid possible drug accumulation and toxicity. It is not clear if these interrupted
      digoxin regimens really offer safer alternative over the continuous dosing regimens without
      compromising the effectiveness. It is anticipated that plasma digoxin levels may fall below
      the therapeutic range during the holiday which may affect patient clinical status and quality
      of life.
