    
      This is an observational, non-interventional, single-country, multicenter, retrospective
      cohort study, based on real world data collection, of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who had been treated with Afatinib s at any line.

      The study is carried out by hospital-based oncologists/pneumonologists specializing in lung
      cancer under real-world conditions of daily clinical practice. Investigators were selected
      through a documented and structured feasibility process which accounted for physicians'
      qualifications, previous participation and experience in similar clinical studies,
      recruitment potential, and retention capability. In addition, in order to represent
      variations in current real-world patterns of care, research sites were recruited from various
      geographic regions in Greece, also taking into consideration the regional setting and type of
      healthcare site/institution (publicly/privately owned, specialized oncology/pulmonology
      clinic, university clinic).
