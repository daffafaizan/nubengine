      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but the prognosis varies. Nevertheless, the feasibility of
      distinguishing these two conditions is limited by the fact that overlapping LVH and diverse
      forms of HCM can often lead to diagnostic ambiguity when diagnosis is based on a single
      morphological index. Diagnosis is more difficult in a patient with a history of hypertension
      and with left ventricular wall thickness between 11 and 15 mm. It also puzzles the situation
      when hypertrophy without outflow-track obstruction was found in hypertensive subjects which
      might not be explained solely by the history of hypertension.

      The investigators have deduced an integrated formula based on cardiac magnetic resonance
      (CMR) imaging and established a differentiating flow-chart between HCM and HHD. In this
      study, the investigators aim to explore the applicability of the quantifying scheme for
      distinguishing HCM from HHD in the multi-center trial.
