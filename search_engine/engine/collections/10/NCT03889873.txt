      HD. We will recruit 328 student hazardous drinkers and use an expressive writing task to
      manipulate their DI, the salience of their social network, and their writing perspective. The
      last factor is included because writing in a self-distanced (3rd person) vs. self-immersed
      (1st person) perspective has been linked to greater cognitive control. We will evaluate the
      manipulation's immediate effects on DI, self-efficacy, and craving. Participants will also
      complete two weekly follow-up "booster" sessions. Longer-term effects on DI, self-efficacy,
      craving and HD will be evaluated at additional 2-week, 1-month, and 3-month follow-ups.

      With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, new subject enrollment was paused between March
      and September 2020. In light of the continued COVID-19 pandemic, the study team made the
      decision to move the in-person, lab-based session (where participants completed the writing
      task) to online sessions as of October 2020. With the move to online sessions, we have
      discontinued the cue reactivity task and the accompanying craving assessment. Inclusion
      criteria have shifted slightly -- we now explicitly require participants to be currently
      living in Washington State (this criterion was implicit in our previous criteria and
      procedures) . The structure of the study otherwise remains the same.
