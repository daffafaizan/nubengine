      predictive of disability, nursing home admission, increased healthcare costs, and mortality
      in older adults. Structured physical activity has been shown to prevent mobility disability
      among those with physical function limitations, though community-based programs are needed,
      particularly in underserved communities. The purpose of this study is to pilot test a
      tailored physical activity intervention in churches in Chicago's West Side through an
      existing community-based participatory research partnership. The investigators previously
      found high rates of physical function limitations in these communities, and through
      qualitative research have identified intervention components that may aid in promoting
      physical activity among community members with physical function limitations. The primary aim
      is test the intervention in a 16 week, proof-of-concept study in 20 participants who are
      ambulatory but have PF limitations. The group-based physical activity intervention will take
      place in a large common area of a church. For feasibility the investigators will be testing
      the intervention in one church. The intervention will be delivered over 16 weeks, with
      assessments at baseline and 16 weeks.
