      it is important to determine the concentrations of metformin that are achievable in tissue.
      Clinical effects of metformin develop gradually over several days of treatment. Steady-state
      plasma metformin concentrations are correlated with anti-hyperglycemic response. Thus,
      achieving steady-state concentrations in this study will allow accurate determination of the
      most representative concentrations of metformin in normal and cancerous tissues, as well as
      determine AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling differences in these tissues. As tha
      Primary Objective is to determine the concentration of metformin in tumors, patients will be
      treated with metformin extended release (ER) (GlucophageÂ® XR), starting at 750 milligrams
      (mg) oral (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 days, then escalating to 750 mg PO twice daily (BID) for
      3-6 days prior to surgery. FDA prescribing information indicates that metformin reaches
      steady-state plasma concentrations within 24-48 hours after the start of dosing in humans;
      thus, the 7-to-10-day time frame of this study will allow sufficient time for metformin to
      reach steady-state plasma concentrations, in addition to time allotted for potential
      accumulation in tissues. Metformin concentrations will be measured using a validated liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay.
