      the implication of oxidative stress in the etiology of this pathological condition. The
      present study was designed to find out DNA fragmentation in ejaculated spermatozoa can be
      reduced by oral treatment with Ginger extract. 71 men with unexplained or Idiopathic
      infertility were randomized between a Ginger treatment (500 milligram daily for 3months)
      group and a placebo group.

      Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by Terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated
      dUTP nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL) before and after treatment. No differences in basic
      sperm parameters were found between the Ginger treatment and the placebo group before or
      after treatment. However, the percentage of DNA-fragmented spermatozoa was markedly reduced
      (P< .005) in the Ginger treatment group after the treatment as compared with the pretreatment
      values). No difference in the pretreatment and post treatment incidence of sperm DNA
      fragmentation was observed in the placebo group. These data show that sperm DNA damage can be
      efficiently treated with oral Ginger extract administered during a relatively short time
      period.
