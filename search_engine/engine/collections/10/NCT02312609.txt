      Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral dose of minocycline hydrochloride
      extended release tablet 135 mg of either test or reference investigational product was
      administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient
      temperature under low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel.

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.
