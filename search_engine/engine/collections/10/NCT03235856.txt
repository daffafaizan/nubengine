      of the thinnest corneal point; Pachymetry progression (radial change of pachymetry); IS value
      (i.e., ratio of average curvature in superior and inferior sections)

      Description:

      The primary endpoint is to obtain a database, containing at least two valid corneal biometry
      measurements (Scheimpflug) recorded at least 5 months apart, for a predetermined number of
      suitable keratoconus patients.

      These data will be used to create a personalized three-dimensional model of the cornea at
      each time point, which permits classifying corneas according to shape and stage, as well as
      assessing the influence of patient age, gender, family history and ophthalmic habits (e.g.
      eye rubbing) on keratoconus progression. Based on corneal changes over time, an estimate of
      the underlying biomechanical changes will be made. All these data will then be combined to
      develop software for automated keratoconus detection and progression risk assessment to help
      ophthalmologists decide when to perform crosslinking on their patients.

      The primary variables are the elevation parameters derived directly from the Scheimpflug
      measuring device export files, along with the demographic and medical information (if
      available).

      Time frame: 5 months

      Once a predictive model for keratoconus progression speed based on multiple measurements,
      this can be improved to make predictions based on a single measurement. Furthermore, the
      database obtained in this work will also be a valuable resource to analyse the variation in
      keratoconus shape, which may lead to an improved classification of keratoconus types
