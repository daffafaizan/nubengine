      chronic liver disease associated with high short term mortality. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)
      is commonly seen in patients with ACLF and its treatment mainly involves non-absorbable
      disaccharides (lactulose/lactitol).Treatment of HE in ACLF is based on extrapolation of data
      available from cirrhotic patients. No studies have compared different treatment options for
      HE in patients with ACLF.
