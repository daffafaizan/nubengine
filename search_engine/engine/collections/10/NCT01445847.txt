      laryngospasm. The etiology of laryngospasm is unknown but may be due to insufficient depth of
      anesthesia during tracheal intubation, light plane of anesthesia during tracheal extubation,
      pain, or presence of airway irritant like laryngoscope blade, irritated volatile agent,
      suction catheter, surgical debris, mucus, blood, or other foreign body. Laryngospasm occurs
      in both genders and all ages. Incidence of laryngospasm was reported to the Australian
      incident monitoring study (AIMS) was 5% with of 22% of them without an attributable cause.

      Currently, there is no proven prophylaxis for laryngospasm and the known treatments of
      laryngospasm are used post-occurrence. However, elimination of factors that lead to
      laryngospasm is the most indispensable item for reduction of its incidence.

      Intravenous (IV) lidocaine interrupts nerve conduction by blocking sodium channels. Recent
      meta-analysis study showed that IV lidocaine was able to prevent laryngospasm in children.
      However, in the literature, we found no randomized clinical trials addressing the using of IV
      lidocaine as prophylaxis for postoperative laryngospasm among adults.

      The aim of this study was to assess the effects of IV lidocaine on the incidence of
      postoperative laryngospasm of adults patients.
