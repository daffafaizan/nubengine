hypophysectomy and the lipolytic action of epinephrine in vitrothe response of normal adiposetissue to epinephrine (0.05 ug/ml incubationmedium) is completely abolished by hypo-physectomy of the donor rats.  treatment ofhypophysectomized rats with crude, wholerat pituitary extract restored the lipolytic ac-tion of epinephrine to normal.  posterior pi-tuitary extract and corticotropin replacementwas without effect.  thyrotropin injectionsproduced a partial, and growth hormonetreatment a full restoration of the lipolyticaction of epinephrine.  treatment of hypo-physectomized rats with cortisol or cortico-sterone reestablished the sensitivity of theiradipose tissue to epinephrine, but only whenrelatively large doses of these hormones weregiven.  physiological doses of triiodothyronine(1 ug/rat/day), however, restored the nor-mal response to epinephrine.  it is concludedthat several endocrine factors can influencethe lipolytic action of epinephrine but thattheir physiological importance cannot yet bequantitated.
