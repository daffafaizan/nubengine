      to implement and evaluate a short-term family counselling intervention at the Cancer Center
      of the University Hospital Basel. The study will be divided into two stages: Stage 1 serves
      as the preparatory work phase, where the intervention manual will be developed as well as the
      implementation strategy into the hospital. In stage 2 the intervention will be evaluated,
      with an interim analysis to test for feasibility. The primary objective of the study is the
      enhancement of adjustment (family, parents and children) to the parental cancer diagnosis.
      The study seeks secondary to determine the feasibility of the short-term counselling
      intervention in the Swiss medical setting and to identify predictors for families with
      continuing psychosocial adjustment problems.
