    
      Phase I's specific aim is to estimate the incidence of symptomatic concussion in the
      pediatric orthopedic surgical population.

      The first phase of this study requires a member of the research team to administer a paper
      questionnaire to all eligible, consented orthopedic surgery patients in either the
      Pre-operative Clinic or in the Day Surgery Unit over a period of four months. The research
      member will only approach adolescents that are scheduled for repair of orthopedic traumatic
      injury as defined in the inclusion criteria. The questionnaire is specifically designed to
      elicit occurrence and symptoms of a concussion. If the patient answers yes to question 2a,
      which asks "At the time of the injury do you recall a blow to the head, neck, face or body
      that resulted in sustained symptoms of concussion (e.g., headache, dizziness, confusion,
      nausea, vomiting, etc.)?", the research team will administer the 22 item self-reporting
      symptom scale in the above mentioned SCAT3. The responses obtained from the questionnaire
      will be used to determine the incidence of symptomatic concussions, either known or
      unrecognized, in pediatric patients sustaining an orthopedic injury requiring surgical
      repair. If the participant scores higher than a 0 on the SCAT3 the results will be conveyed
      to the surgeon prior to the start of the scheduled surgical procedure. A copy of the
      completed SCAT3 will also be placed in the medical record. The decision to continue with
      surgery and need to possibly refer the patient to the Boston Children's Hospital Sports
      Concussion Clinic after the SCAT3 will remain at the surgeon's discretion.

      Information will be gathered from the questionnaire and the SCAT3, then entered into the
      REDcap database under a de-identified subject number.
