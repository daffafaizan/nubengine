      functional vision in people who have become blind from retinal degenerative eye disease. This
      study follows on from an initial proof of concept study (n=3) between 2012 and 2014, and will
      test a second-generation retinal prosthesis device, which has the ability to be used outside
      of the laboratory environment (i.e. is fully implantable).
