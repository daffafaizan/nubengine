      Federation estimates that 285 million people worldwide have diabetes mellitus and
      approximately 7% of these individuals are affected by diabetic macular edema.

      EYLEAÂ® (aflibercept) injection, an anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) agent, has
      been approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema (DME).

      Mylan Inc. and Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are developing MYL-1701P, a proposed biosimilar
      to Eylea.

      MYL-1701P-3001 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and
      immunogenicity of MYL-1701P in the treatment of subjects with Diabetic Macular Edema (DME).
      Eligible subjects from MYL-1701P-3001 study will be enrolled in the AFIL-IJZ-3002 study. All
      enrolled subjects will receive three doses of MYL-1701P every eight weeks. Subjects will
      attend the clinic visits for safety and efficacy assessments including BCVA, SD-OCT, complete
