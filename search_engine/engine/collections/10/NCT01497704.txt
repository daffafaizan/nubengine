    
      Part 1 will include a sequential evaluation of 3 subjects per cohort; cohort 1 at a dose of
      100 mg YN968D1, followed by a cohorts 2, 3 and 4 at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg
      respectively. Initially, each subject will receive one dose of YN968D1 followed by a 7-Day
      observation period, during which single dose PK assessments and safety monitoring will be
      performed. If the initial dose is well tolerated, the subject will return on Day 8 and
      receive 28-Days of continuous YN968D1 oral administration daily. Each subject will
      subsequently be assessed for safety and disease progression on Day 35±2 and steady state
      pharmacokinetic sampling will be obtained. Patients may continue on therapy for an additional
      28-Day cycles without dose interruption if the therapy is well tolerated. Efficacy
      assessments (biomarkers) and disease progression (RECIST imaging) will be assessed every two
      28-Day cycles. The subjects will be assessed for safety for at least 28-Days after the last
      dose of YN968D1.

      For Part 1 of this study, a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) event is defined as any of the
      following events that are assessed by the Investigator as probably or possibly related to
      YN968D1 and occur during or after the initial dose on Day 1 through Day 35 of the first cycle
      of therapy.

        -  CTCAE Grade 4 event

        -  Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (<1,000 neutrophils/mL)

        -  Grade 3 hematologic toxicity with duration > 7 days

        -  Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea that continues
           despite optimal medical management)

      If a DLT is experienced in any cohort, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If two (2)
      DLTs are experienced in any cohort, the study will be paused until the safety events are
      evaluated and discussed with the FDA to determine if the trial may continue.

      Part 2 of this study will include up to 30 subjects. Each subject will receive a 750 mg dose
      or the maximum tolerated dose of YN968D1 from part 1 of the study for continuous 28-Day
      cycles of therapy. If a subject experiences an intolerable side effect a dose reduction or a
      dose interruption for up to 7-Days is allowed at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects
      will be evaluated for RECIST (version 1.1) response at the end of the second cycle of therapy
      on Day 56±3 of the Part 2 study. Safety reporting will be continued for 28-Days from the last
      dose of study medication.

      All subjects in Part 1 and 2 of this trial will be eligible to continue therapy provided they
      have a least stable disease or better and are, in the opinion of the investigator, adequately
      tolerating treatment with YN968D1.
