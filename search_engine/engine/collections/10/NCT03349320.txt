      submitted to the MMSE test, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer'sDisease
      battery (CERAD), and the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire. CERAD memory evaluation
      was further divided into five components: incidental recall (CERAD151 INC), immediate recall
      1 and 2 (CERAD-RM1, CERAD-RM2, respectively) and delayed recall after five minutes (CERAD-R).
      Each aspect was analyzed individually and compared between groups at baseline and after 12
      months of treatment with donepezil. All patients had blood samples (10mL) collected to obtain
      donepezil plasmatic concentration (DPC) measurements and for APOE and CYP2D6 genotyping.
