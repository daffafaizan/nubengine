      conventional opioid analgesia regimen group.

      Intravenous 1Î¼g/kg fentanyl is administered as a test in patients with spontaneous breath
      after sevoflurane induction. A positive result is defined as a decrease of more than 50% in
      spontaneous respiratory rate (rate after fentanyl test versus rate before fentanyl test).
      Otherwise it is defined as a negative result.

      All the patients are given regular paracetamol and ibuprofen after surgery. The addition of
      rescue oral morphine is given as needed. The dose of oral morphine is determined according to
      the results of fentanyl test in the individualized group, while the patients in the
      conventional group are given the routine dose. The Faces Scale is used to assess analgesic
      effectiveness by parents from postoperative day 1 to day 10. If the Faces Scale score > 6,
      the child receive rescue oral morphine analgesia.

      At the preoperative appointment, parents are provided with a pulse oximeter including oxygen
      saturation sensors to take home. The oxygen saturation per night during sleep will be
      monitored using the pulse oximeter by parents from postoperative Day 1 to Day 10. The
      research team will instruct parents on how to properly apply the oximeter to the child and
      repeat these measurements. The primary outcome measure is desaturation events during sleep
      per night.
