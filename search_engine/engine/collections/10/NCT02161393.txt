      highlighted that there are not enough programmes available; currently in the UK less than
      1.5% of patients with COPD receive pulmonary rehabilitation per year. Only a proportion of
      patients are targeted i.e. those with moderate to severe disease. The majority of programmes
      are outpatient-based and are supervised by clinicians. This structured and supervised format
      of pulmonary rehabilitation does not meet the needs of all patients with high numbers of
      dropouts and non-adherence; yet alternative options for increasing physical activity for
      patients with COPD currently do not seem to be offered.

      A home-based pedometer-driven walking intervention offers an alternative method of delivering
      physical activity training that could be provided to larger numbers of patients, at a lower
      cost and with flexibility around life commitments. It would also provide patients with more
      choice when deciding whether to participate in exercise or physical activity.

      To date no study has compared a home-based walking intervention to structured, supervised
      pulmonary rehabilitation or the patient preferences or cost of the two programmes. For this
      reason, there is a need to compare a home-based-walking intervention to the standard method
      of providing patients with physical activity training, i.e. pulmonary rehabilitation.
      Therefore this study is essential as it will assess the feasibility of conducting a trial to
      investigate the efficacy of a physical activity intervention (physical activity consultation
      and a pedometer-based walking programme) versus pulmonary rehabilitation in improving
      physical activity in COPD.
