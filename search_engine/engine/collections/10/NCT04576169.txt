      wrist pain. TFCC lesions can be traumatic or degenerative according to classification
      suggested by Palmer and Atzei. Primary treatment is conservative, but if symptoms persist,
      operative treatment is an option. Depending on the morphology of the tear, the treatment can
      be either debridement or repair. Trialists have observed improvement of symptoms after TFCC
      repair but all these trials are observational cohorts without proper controls. Efficacy of
      surgery has not been studied in randomized controlled trial (RCT) setting.

      The investigators planned a prospective, randomized, controlled, outcome assessor and
      participant (in other randomization cohort of the trial) blinded, two randomization cohorts,
      which each has two parallel 1:1 arms, a multinational and -centre trial comparing the
      efficacy of 1) debridement with placebo surgery and 2) repair with physiotherapy.

      Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Tampere university hospital has approved the study
      protocol. All participants will give written informed consent. The results of the trial will
      be disseminated as published articles in peer-reviewed journals.

      Outcome measures for different studies are often derived from what clinicians, rather than
      patients, thinks to be important. The investigators chose to base the efficacy assessment on
      the measure of patient's subjective disability and pain.

      There is no clear evidence of the efficacy of the treatments (debridement and repair). It is
      justified and ethically correct to compare these treatments to placebo surgery and
      physiotherapy. Placebo surgery and physiotherapy are less invasive than debridement and
      repair and because of this are even safer to patients than comparable treatments.
