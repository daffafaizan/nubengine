2774. pitfalls in the clinical and histologic diagnosis of broncho-genic carcinomaa necropsy study of 380 cases of extrathoraciccarcinoma revealed that pulmonarymetastases occurred in almost 50% of thecases and bronchial metastases in over25%.  there were 39 cases (10.3%) in theseries with clinical features simulatingbronchogenic carcinoma and in 24 (62%)of these cases there was cytologic and/orhistologic confirmation.  carcinomas ofthe pancreas presented the greatest sourceof diagnostic error accounting for morethan one-third of the 39 cases; the primarysite second in frequency was carcinomaof the kidney.  bronchial metastases werechiefly responsible for the clinical,cytologic, and histologic findings compatiblewith the diagnosis of bronchogeniccarcinoma.  secondary growths in the lungs maypresent roentgenologically as solitarytumors indistinguishable from primary lungcancer.  metastatic lesions in lymphnodes, bronchi, and lung may exhibit pleomor-phic features simulating squamouscell carcinoma.  the diagnosis of bronchioloalveo-lar carcinoma in resected lung tissueis a presumptive conclusion inasmuch as theidentical morphological features maybe reproduced by metastases from duct orglandular carcinomas.  the simulationof bronchogenic carcinoma by metastatic tum-ors occurs with sufficient frequency tochallenge the diagnostic accuracy of deathscertified as bronchogenic carcinomawith necropsy exclusion of other primary sites.
