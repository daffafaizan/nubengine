    
      Pediatric patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I will be treated with genetically
      modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells collected from mobilized peripheral blood (or
      bone marrow if mobilization is not feasible) and transduced with IDUA lentiviral vector
      encoding for the human Î±-L-iduronidase gene.

      Patients will be followed for 3 year after gene therapy. After completing participation in
      this study, subjects will be offered enrolment into an approved long term follow-up (LTFU)
      study which will enable continued follow up for up to 15 years post-treatment (per regulatory
      guidelines for follow up of patients treated with ATIMPs).
