      I. To establish an association between bladder cancer disease stage and the level of
      invasiveness as measured by a novel ultrasound assay.

      II. To establish an association between bladder cancer disease stage and expression of novel
      invasiveness biomarkers related to the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) gene.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tumor tissue samples, bladder washings, and urine cells are stained with
      calcium dye, washed and immersed in external buffer solution, and then transferred to the
      ultrasound imaging system. Tissue, bladder wash cells and urine cells samples are also
      analyzed for biomarkers of invasiveness derived from or related to REST gene via quantitative
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH).
