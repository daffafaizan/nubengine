      A significant factor determining long-term survivability of breast cancer is whether or not
      lymph nodes, glands which cleanse and filter the body's fluids, are involved. Despite
      treatment with approved multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy ("dose-dense chemotherapy"), women
      with breast cancer involving more than 4 axillary lymph nodes still have a high risk for
      recurrence.

      Several dose-dense chemotherapy regimens are currently being compared in other studies,
      however, at this time there is no proof that one regimen is superior to another. Therefore,
      in an attempt to decrease metastases, prolong time to recurrence and improve overall
      survival, it is essential to develop novel therapeutic strategies. The use of inhibitors of
      angiogenesis represents a promising option.

      Bevacizumab is the first angiogenesis inhibiting drug to be FDA approved, for the treatment
      of colon cancer. It is has also been studied alone in progressed lymph-node positive breast
      cancer and has shown moderate efficacy.

      This study will observe the efficacy and tolerability of using bevacizumab in combination
      with an approved dose-dense chemotherapy regimen for 8 cycles, followed by 12 of bevacizumab
      alone. Patients may be on the study for up to 52 weeks if their disease has not progressed
      and the regimen is tolerated.
