    
      Older (>60 yrs) men and women (50% African American, 50% white) who are obese (BMI >30 kg/m2)
      and have pre-diabetes will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio; couples randomized together) to
      one to two treatment groups: 1) Weight loss intervention (WL-Control; n = 20): subjects
      follow a calorie-reduction diet for a weight loss of ≥10%, protein~0.8g/g/d; and 2) High
      protein weight loss intervention (WL-Protein; n = 20): subjects follow a calorie-reduction
      diet for a weight loss of ≥10%, with a high proportion of high quality protein (> 30g
      protein, 3/day, 60-70% egg protein). Primary (insulin resistance/sensitivity, weight loss)
      and secondary outcomes (physical function, body composition, diet adherence, cognitive
      function, readiness to change) will be measured at 0 and 4 months.
