    
      The specific aim of this study is to compare, by means of a randomized clinical trial, the
      efficacy of three surgical treatment combinations: adenoidectomy with myringotomy (A-M),
      adenoidectomy with myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertion (A-M&T), and M&T alone, in
      reducing subsequent middle ear disease in children aged 24-47 months with otitis media with
      effusion (OME) of at least 3 months' duration unresponsive to standardized, recent
      antimicrobial treatment. The children are randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms:
      1. M&T; 2. A-M; and 3. A-M&T. Subjects are be stratified according to: 1. age; 2. nasal
      obstruction; and 3. previous tubes. All subjects are scheduled for surgery according to
      assignment within 4 weeks after entry. The first post-operative visit takes place 2 weeks
      after surgery, and a complete examination of the ears, nose, and throat (ENT exam) including
      pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry is performed. Subjects are followed with
      monthly evaluations (ENT-exam, pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry) for three years. Audiometry
      is performed every 6 months. All subjects are evaluated at any time while still enrolled in
      the study if signs and symptoms of URI, acute otitis media (AOM, including otorrhea), or OME
      occur and are treated appropriately. Subjects who develop OME for 4 months bilaterally or 6
      months unilaterally have M&T and continue to be followed in the study. The primary outcome
      measure will be percentage of time with middle ear effusion (MEE). Episodes of AOM, otorrhea,
      and OME, time to first recurrence, and number of surgical procedures will be compared between
      the three treatment groups. Treatment failures, complications and sequelae of treatments will
      also be recorded and compared among the three treatment groups.
