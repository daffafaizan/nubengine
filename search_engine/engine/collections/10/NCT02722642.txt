    
      Bronchiectasis is a term for irreversible lung damage resulting from recurrent episodes of
      infection and inflammation. Bronchial basal cells (BCCs) have been proven with stem cell
      activity to regenerate bronchi and repair lung damage. In this single-center, non-randomized,
      self control phase I/II clinical trial, patients' own BCCs will be grown in laboratory before
      injected to the damaged part of lung tissue. Transplanted BCCs have the potential to
      replenish the bronchial epithelium and reconstruct respiratory architecture.
