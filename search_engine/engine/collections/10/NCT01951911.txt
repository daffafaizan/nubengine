    
      Patients with cancer pain judged to have a neuropathic component and receiving pain treatment
      with a subcutaneous infusion of morphine will be included in a randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover study. All patients will be recruited from hospital wards
      (Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen). In the case of patient withdrawal or dropout, new
      patients will be recruited so that the total number of patients completing the study will be
      20. Data from patients not completing the study will solely be used to provide information
      about adverse effects.

      The basic treatment with subcutaneous morphine infusion will be supplemented with a separate
      subcutaneous infusion of ketamine 1 mg/kg/ 24 hours or NaCl 9 mg/ml (placebo).

      After 48 hours (phase 1) there will be a "wash-out" period of minimum 10 hours to minimize
      carryover effects before the treatment is replaced by the alternative treatment for a further
      48 hours (phase 2) in a standard crossover design. The treatment duration is based on
      ketamine's short plasma half-life which is less than 2 hours after initial equilibration.

      Pain intensity (using NRS) will be recorded at rest and on movement x 4 daily. Rescue
      medication in the form of morphine subcutaneous bolus may be given to the patient as
      required. There will be a" lockout" time of 1 hour which means that the rescue dose of
      morphine can be repeated every 60 minutes if necessary, providing the patient is awake and
      has a respiratory rate of 8 or more per minute.Randomization will be performed by Haukeland
      University Hospital Pharmacy. The study drug/ placebo will also be prepared by the hospital
      pharmacy according to a standard instruction.
