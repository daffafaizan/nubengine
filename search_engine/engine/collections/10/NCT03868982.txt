    
      Background： Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) should ventilated with a tidal volume
      of 4-6 ml/kg according to the ARDSnet recommendations. Due to the lack of clinical evidence
      of the potential role of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) in ARDS, investigators
      would like to conduct a study comparing the two modes from a lung protective point of view.
      Investigators believe it may have a great value in defining guidelines for improved lung
      protection.

      Study Design： This is a prospective, pilot-randomized controlled trial n a single intensive
      care unit from one hospital. The study is expected to close the case a year
      (2018.08.01-2019.07.31).

      Methods： Fifty patients with ARDS according to the Berlin Definition will enroll to this
      study. Patients are randomized after fulfilling inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria
      (25 participants will divide into study group and the other 25 participants will be control
      group). Patients are studied twice daily with collection of data and blood tests. All data
      are collected and analysis.

      Effect： Tidal volumes in ARDS patients ventilated with NAVA will show tidal volumes clearly
      within the safe range. ARDS patients on NAVA mode will show improvements in oxygenation, gas
      distribution and inflammatory markers while requiring less sedatives and hemodynamic support.

      Key words： Acute respiratory distress syndrome; neurally adjusted ventilatory assist; lung
      protective strategy.
