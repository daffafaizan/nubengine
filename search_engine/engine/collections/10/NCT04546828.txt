    
      This is a multi-institution, open label phase II study designed to investigate the
      feasibility of gemcitabine/cisplatin/nab-paclitaxel as a neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy
      for patients with reseactable oncologically high-risk IHCCA. This study will enroll up to 34
      patients from all participating institutions with an accrual rate of 2 patients per month.

      This will be an open-label, single arm study with each cycle equal to 21 days. All three
      drugs will be administered intravenously on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle. Dosing will be
      calculated using body surface area (BSA) based on the actual weight of the patient at each
      visit. Nab-Paclitaxel will be given at 100 mg/m2, followed by cisplatin at 25 mg/m2 and then
      gemcitabine at 800 mg/m2 for 2 weeks in a row followed by a week of rest. Patients will
      receive 4 cycles of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Restaging will be done after every 2
      cycles (+/- 1 week) by radiological imaging. If radiological scans demonstrate stable disease
      or partial or complete tumor response and the tumor remains resectable, surgery will be
      performed. For patients with radiological scans that document disease progression during the
      study, treatment will be discontinued off the protocol and will not be evaluable for other
      secondary endpoints. Resection will be performed per standard of care and will include a
      portal lymphadenectomy for all cases. Objective evidence of recurrent disease after resection
      will be recorded at the time of recurrence. Patients will be followed for overall survival
      endpoint as well.
