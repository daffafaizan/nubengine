      In vitro studies have shown that R-methadone has less inhibitory effect than S-methadone on
      the voltage-gated potassium channel current, and is thus thought to have less effect on the
      QTc interval.

      The investigators hypothesized that switching from racemic to R-methadone would reduce the
      methadone serum concentration and also its effect on the QTc interval.
