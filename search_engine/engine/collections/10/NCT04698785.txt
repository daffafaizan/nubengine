    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, prospective, comparative,
      multicentre phase II study.

      Patients with measurable unresectable residual disease will be accrued after they completed
      standard of care, consisting of:

        -  At diagnosis: multimodal treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and adjuvant
           chemotherapy

        -  At first relapse: chemotherapy

      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned (1:1) into one of the
      following treatment groups:

        -  Experimental arm: regorafenib + best supportive care (BSC) maintenance (12 months
           maximum)

        -  Standard arm: placebo + BSC (12 months maximum)

      A randomization procedure (centralized implementation of concealed random permuted blocks)
      will be used to obtain a balanced distribution of the setting of the disease (stratification
      factor): residual disease at diagnosis or at relapse after standard multimodal treatment.

      After their eligibility has been confirmed, patients will receive regorafenib or its matching
      placebo until disease progression, or for a maximum of 12 months, or unacceptable toxicity or
      willingness to stop, whichever occurs first.

      In case of radiological disease progression during treatment period, patients from the
      standard arm (placebo) who have unresectable disease will be allow to switch to experimental
      arm (regorafenib). After the switch, patients will be treated with regorafenib until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity or willingness to stop which occurs first.

      After the completion of the maintenance therapy (12 months) patients will be followed-up
      until the first radiological disease progression, unless a premature disease progression
      occurred. All patients will be followed-up until the data cut-off (12 months after the last
      randomization).

      The vital status will be updated once for all patients at the end of the study, based on
      patient's medical file.

      The end of the study will be 24 months after the last randomisation or at the end of
      treatment of the last patient under treatment (either blinded or open label) whichever occurs
      last.
