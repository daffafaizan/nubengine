      interaction studies of other PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra, Levitra and cialis) have already
      accomplished and the results have provided useful information to the patients. The objective
      of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of SK3530 and its metabolite (SK3541)
      under the fasted and fed (low-fat meal and high-fat meal) conditions.
