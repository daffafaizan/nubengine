      I. To determine the proportion of patients progression-free at 12 weeks (progression free
      survival [PFS], defined as Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 complete
      response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) with (A) Insulin-like growth
      factor (IGF)-1receptor (R)+ soft tissue sarcomas; (B) IGF-1R+ bone tumors; or (C) IGF-1R(-)
      sarcomas, who are treated weekly with intravenous A12 (cixutumumab) and temsirolimus.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (defined as CR + PR). II. To determine the overall
      survival. III. To determine the correlation of clinical outcome with pre- and post-treatment
      IGF-1R pathway related markers in plasma (pre and post therapy), archived tissue, and pre-
      and post-treatment tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cixutumumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and temsirolimus IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.
