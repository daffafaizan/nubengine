      training that focused on object location associations. Across these training sessions, each
      group received 9 training trials for each of the 45 trained stimuli. Task-fMRI was acquired
      before and after training. Memory was again evaluated 1 month after the last training
      session. The primary outcome measure was memory for the "trained" stimuli while secondary
      outcome was accuracy for novel stimuli acquired outside of the MRI environment.
