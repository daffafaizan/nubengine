      assigned to a modified negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressing or standard moist
      dressing. The investigators will measure the percentage of re-epithelization at set
      postoperative time intervals using digital photography, pain using the visual analog scale
      (VAS), and healing quality using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). The investigators
      hypothesize that the NPWT will lead to less pain and increased re-epithelization in a shorter
      postoperative time course. This specific aim seeks to prove/disprove that patients who
      receive a modified NPWT dressing perceive the advantage with improved healing, pain, shorter
      length of stay, and other wound symptoms related to delayed donor site wound healing.

      The donor site for STSGs provides a consistent model of superficial wounds that offers the
      opportunity to study both mechanisms of wound healing and potential mechanisms of action of
      NPWT. In patients undergoing both standard dressings and NPWT, the investigators will sample
      the wound exudate and perform microbiopsies of the healing wound at fixed intervals and
      perform histologic and molecular analysis in order to quantify the degree of
      re-epithelization and the trophic and inflammatory profile of the healing wound.
