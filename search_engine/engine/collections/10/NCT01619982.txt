      surgical site infections (SSIs) has decreased considerably, but is still greater than the
      baseline rate at the best comparison hospital (2.5%). Recent analysis of SSI's in
      cardiovascular surgery patients identified more than half being caused by cefazolin resistant
      gram positive bacteria (methicillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococci- MRSE
      (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, or methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus- MRSA). Cefazolin is routinely given pre-operatively as surgical prophylaxis in
      patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. Vancomycin is not routinely recommended for
      prophylaxis due to concerns of developing vancomycin resistance, however patients with MRSE
      and MRSA SSIs end up needing additional surgery to remove or replace infected hardware or
      grafts and/or additional weeks to months of intravenous vancomycin therapy. This results in
      significant morbidity to the children and cost to the institution. Several published
      guidelines suggest the use of pre-operative prophylaxis with vancomycin (alone or in
      conjunction with cefazolin) in instances where patients may be at higher risk for infection
      with MRSE or MRSA. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of
      vancomycin to standard pre-operative prophylaxis with cefazolin in selected high risk
      subjects along with the full SIP bundle will decrease the incidence of cefazolin-resistant
      SSI's.
