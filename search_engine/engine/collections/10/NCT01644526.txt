      AV graft is placed. A saline pump delivers fluid to the arterial balloon valve and closes
      that end of the graft off to blood flow. Using the dialysis blood lines, saline flushes
      residual blood from the graft back into the body. Then the venous balloon valve closes and
      heparinized saline resides in the graft between dialysis sessions.

      When the patient returns for dialysis, the dialysis technician deflates the valves and allows
      blood to flow to the graft for dialysis. (The saline inside the graft simply enters the blood
      stream.)

      By only having saline inside the AV graft between dialysis sessions, there is no
      post-dialysis bleeding where the dialysis needles were cannulated, and because blood flow is
      restored to its normal course in the vein and artery, the traditional turbulent blood flow
      through the graft is eliminated, reducing the traditional complications caused when arterial
      blood is diverted through the graft then into the vein.
