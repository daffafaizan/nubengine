      undergoing bariatric surgery will be enrolled in this study and have several parameters
      checked as explained below. Patients selected and consented for elective bariatric surgery
      will be recruited in the Bariatric and Metabolic Institute to participate in this study and
      will undergo standard of care. The investigators will enroll approximately 120 candidates
      during a 6 months (~5 a week) period. Patients will be randomized to the A. control group: 3
      traditional shakes or B. intervention group: 2 traditional shakes and 1 daily administration
      of substituting iso-protein green Wolffia Globosa (Mankai) Shake (4 frozen cubes of Wolffia
      Globosa (Mankai) equal to 20 grams of dry Wolffia Globosa (Mankai). Each shake will provide
      equivalent carbohydrate, calories and protein levels from the respective source. As part of
      our routine pre and postoperative screening and follow up protocol, the investigators will
      collect anthropometric and clinical data on all patients, including standard of care blood
      samples collected at 2 weeks pre operatively, surgery day and at 2 months postoperatively
