      effects of nicotine. One study showed that nicotine eliminates some of the beneficial effects
      of the nicotine patch in reducing withdrawal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to
      replicate and extend these findings and examine the effects of various doses of cotinine base
      compared placebo on withdrawal symptom as well as drug preference among abstinent smokers
      while using the nicotine patch. We hypothesized that cotinine will reduce the beneficial
      effects of the nicotine patch in reducing withdrawal symptoms and that placebo will be
      preferred over cotinine during the forced drug choice period.
