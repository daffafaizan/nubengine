      development of the illness is a very complex interaction between genetic and surrounding
      factors. Also the response on therapy and the development and seriousness of side effects is
      stipulated by this complicated collaboration of genetic and surrounding factors. Moreover it
      is not only the DNA that plays an important role but also the systems of control at protein
      level. At this moment a lot of questions remain to be answered because up till now the
      studies were of rather restricted statistic strength with frequently inconsistent dates and
      moreover retrospective. Major retrospective studies are necessary to distinguish the
      relationship between DNA/protein patterns and clinical relevant endpoints like prognosis and
      toxicity in which an as broad as possible patient group is being monitored. For this reason
      we want to take blood samples in MAASTRO clinic of all patients with lung cancer and to store
      it encrypted so that we can perform DNA and protein analyses in future and to correlate the
      results with survival and toxicity of the treatment.
