      HDIL-2 is similar to a hormone naturally found in the body that boosts the immune system by
      helping "natural killer" (NK) cells live longer and work better. NK cells are a type of white
      blood cell that kill other cells, and they may kill cancer cells.

      ASCI is a immunotherapy designed to teach your immune system to fight cancer in the same way
      that you are given vaccines to prevent disease by teaching your immune system to fight an
      infection caused by germs. Because the cancer is made by your own body, the immune system
      does not recognize the cancer cells as being harmful. Your immune system needs to be
      "trained" to recognize the cancer cells. This is done by injecting a protein (the MAGE-A3
      protein) that is found in the tumor and training your body to recognize it and to destroy the
      cells that have this protein. This may increase the effectiveness of IL-2 by slowing the
      growth of the cancer cells, which may cause them to die.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin the study drugs
      within 14 days of signing the second consent form. To receive the study drugs, you will be
      admitted to the hospital, either in the intensive care unit (ICU) or a specifically
      designated nursing unit where study drugs can be administered, on Day 2 of each cycle and may
      remain in the hospital for up to 7 days each cycle.

      You may receive a total of 24 ASCI doses either in combination with HDIL-2 or alone. You may
      receive the study drugs in combination for up to 30 weeks. After that, you may receive the
      ASCI study medication alone for up to 157 more weeks.

      Cycle 1 is 14 days (Weeks 1 and 2):

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection. Each

           minutes. HDIL-2 treatment will be delayed in cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 until all

      Additional Blood Draws:

      Additional blood (about 4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for laboratory tests to look
      at how the study drug combination may affect the immune system. These blood draws will be
      collected on Day 1 of cycle 1 and again during cycle 1 48 hours after the last dose of IL-2.
      Additional blood draws (about 4 tablespoons each time) will also Part of the blood drawn for
      these tests will be sent to GSK Biologicals (or a contracted laboratory) for testing.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue to receive the study drug combination for up to 8 cycles (33 weeks) and ASCI
      alone for up to 76 more weeks (+/- 2 business days). If you continue beyond completing 8
      cycles of HDIL-2, you will receive the ASCI on Day 1 (+/- 2 business days) every 6 weeks for

      either a phone call or clinic visit until the side effect is tolerable.

      End-of-Dosing Visit:

      After receiving the last dose of study drug combination, you will have an end-of-dosing
      visit:

           may be having and drugs you are taking.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

      get any worse. Starting after the last dose of study drug, you will have 1 visit every 3
      months for the 1st year, every 4 months for the 2nd year, every 6 months for the 3rd and 4th
      year, then once a year for up to 10 years (+/- 2 business days). At these visits, the
      following will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for

           chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and/or MRI scan or CT scan of the brain to check the status
           of the disease.

      If the disease begins to get worse, information about the status of your health will be
      collected every 2 months. If you are not able to come into the clinic to complete this visit,
      you will be asked for this information over the phone. The phone call should last about 10-15

      This is an investigational study. IL-2 is commercially available and FDA approved for the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma. HDIL-2 is a higher dose than the standard approved dose of
      IL-2. The ASCI study medication is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
