      shoulder tip pain between two low pressure level (8 and 10 mmHg) during laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. After the enrolled participant signed the inform consent, the participant
      was randomly assigned to 8 or 10 mmHg group. The standard procedure of the laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy was performed by experience surgeons. During the operation, the pressure
      limit can be adjusted to facilitate the procedure according to the surgeons. Following the
      operation, the investigator will ask about the shoulder tip pain from the participant during
      48 hours. The standard of care including pain medication during postoperative period was
      performed.
