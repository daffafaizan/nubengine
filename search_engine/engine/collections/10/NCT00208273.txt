      A ratio of 1 to 1 will be used for the randomization process between the two arms:

        -  Arm A : Letrozole 2.5 mg daily for 5 years started three weeks before the first day of
           adjuvant radiotherapy.

        -  Arm B : Letrozole 2.5 mg daily for 5 years started three weeks after the last day of
           adjuvant radiotherapy.

      All patients will be followed every 3 months for toxicities, disease status and for survival
      until death.
