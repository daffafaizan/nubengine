    
      Tapentadol (CG5503) is a centrally active pain-relieving drug being investigated for the
      treatment of acute and chronic pain. This study is a randomized (patients are assigned
      different treatments based on chance in a ratio of 4 patients on tapentadol (CG5503) PR to
      every 1 patient on oxycodone CR), open-label (both the Investigator and the patient know what
      medication is allocated), active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study. It is
      designed to investigate the long-term safety (side effects during up to one year of
      administration) and effectiveness (level of pain control) of tapentadol (CG5503) PR compared
      to oxycodone CR (an opioid commonly used for relief of moderate to severe pain) taken orally.
      The study consisted of a screening period (up to 14 days), a washout period (3 to 7 days),
      and an active treatment phase with titration and maintenance (total duration of 52 weeks).
      The doses of both of these medications will be adjusted to give the best therapeutic benefit
      for the patient. A total of 1123 patients will be screened. Safety evaluations include
      monitoring of adverse events, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.
      Assessments of pain relief include the pain intensity numerical rating scale, and patient
      global impression of change scale (PGIC). Venous blood samples will be collected for the
      determination of serum concentrations of tapentadol (CG5503) and oxycodone. Tapentadol
      (CG5503) PR is also referred to as Tapentadol (CG5503) Extended Release (ER). Starting oral
      dose is randomly assigned to tapentadol (CG5503) PR 50 mg or oxycodone CR 10 mg twice daily
      (BID) x 3 days; then increase to tapentadol (CG5503)100 mg BID, oxycodone CR 20 mg BID x 4
      days; during the maintenance phase upward titration may occur at a minimum of 3 day intervals
      in increments of tapentadol (CG5503) PR 50 mg BID or oxycodone CR 10 mg BID. The maximum
      doses are tapentadol (CG5503) PR 250 mg BID or oxycodone CR 50 mg BID.
