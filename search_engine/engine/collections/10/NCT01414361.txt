      from intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in assessing intermediate coronary stenotic lesions are
      useful. Functional significance of a coronary stenosis is determined by both the severity of
      a stenosis and the amount of myocardium supplied. Therefore, when the functional significance
      of a lesion is assessed by lumen area measured by IVUS, different criteria should be applied
      according to lesion location and anatomical variations of the coronary artery. However,
      previous studies included only patients with proximal lesions or small vessel disease, and
      the sample sizes were too small to assess these differences. In a recent study, the
      investigators have shown that optimal IVUS criteria defining the functional significance (FFR
      < 0.8) of intermediate coronary stenoses is different according to their locations of the
      coronary tree. Herein, the investigators performed this study to validate the our results and
      to generalize the IVUS criteria defining functional significance of intermediate coronary
      stenosis in a different location of coronary tree in a larger sample size.
