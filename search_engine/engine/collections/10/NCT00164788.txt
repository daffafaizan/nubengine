      become the mainstay of controlling bleeding. Recurrent bleeding after endoscopic control
      occurs in about 20% of patients with a high associated mortality. We previously demonstrated
      that the adjunct use of high dose proton pump inhibitor reduces risk of recurrent bleeding
      and thereby improves patients' outcome [Lau JY N Engl J Med 2000]. The newer PPI,
      esomeprazole, is an S-isomer of omeprazole. Esomeprazole is more effective in gastric acid
      control as measured by both basal and pentagastrin acid output when compared to omeprazole.
      Esomeprazole when given orally at a lower dose achieves a similar gastric control than
      intravenous esomeprazole. The gastric pH with a high dose esomeprazole when given either
      orally or intravenously has not been measured among Hong Kong Chinese. If a high dose oral
      esomeprazole achieves a similar pH control near gastric neutrality, the oral regime can be
      used in place of the intravenous formulation. This represents significant convenience in
      dosing and cost savings.
