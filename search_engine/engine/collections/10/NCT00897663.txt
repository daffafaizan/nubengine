      Primary

        -  Identify molecular characteristics that predict for overall survival and
           progression-free survival of patients treated with erlotinib hydrochloride,
           temozolomide, and radiotherapy on clinical trial NCCTG-N0177.

      Secondary

        -  Identify molecular characteristics that predict for overall survival and
           progression-free survival of patients treated with gefitinib after radiotherapy on
           clinical trial NCCTG-N0074.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue samples from patients enrolled on clinical trials NCCTG-N0177 or NCCTG-N0074 are
      analyzed by microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry for biological markers predicting
      progression-free survival and overall survival. Biological markers include epidermal growth
      factor expression, vIII mutant p53 gene, P-AKT, p7056k, S6, 4EBP1, STAT-3, PLC-g, Erk, ErbB2,
      ErbB3, ErbB4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, IGF1R, interleukin-6, FADD, and MGMT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
