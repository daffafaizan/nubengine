      neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of multiple
      NTFs to the immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve
      their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms. NTF-secreting
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-NTF cells) are a novel cell-therapeutic approach aimed at
      effectively delivering NTFs directly to the site of damage in ALS patients.

      Participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized and will undergo
      bone-marrow aspiration. MSC of the participants randomized to the treatment group will be
      induced into MSC-NTF cells. Participants will undergo a total of three intrathecal (IT)
      transplantations with NurOwnÂ® (MSC-NTF cells) or matching placebo at three bi-monthly
      intervals
