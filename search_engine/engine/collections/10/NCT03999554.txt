    
      This is a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 250 healthy adults,
      18-49 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This
      dose escalation clinical study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability/reactogenicity,
      and immunogenicity of H3N2 M2SR investigational vaccines for prevention of influenza, when
      delivered at increasing dosages or in two doses. Subjects will be enrolled in five groups in
      a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Arm 1 will receive a low dose of Sing2016 M2SR intranasally on days 1 and
      29. Arm 2 will receive a medium dose of Sing2016 M2SR intranasally on days 1 and 29. Arm 3
      will receive a high dose of Sing2016 M2SR intranasally on days 1 and 29. Arm 4 will receive a
      low dose of Bris16 M2SR intranasally on days 1 and 29. Arm 5 will receive a placebo
      intranasally on days 1 and 29. Study duration will be approximately 8 months with subject
      participation duration approximately 7 months. The primary study objective is to assess the
      safety and reactogenicity of a monovalent live single replication influenza H3N2 M2SR
      vaccine. The secondary study objectives are to evaluate systemic and mucosal immune responses
      induced by H3N2 M2SR vaccination.
