      chart review will be performed among pediatric patients undergoing burn care or knee
      arthroscopy at our institution to determine a whether there was a reduction in prescribed
      opioid medications following the 2017 Ohio opioid prescription law. A 24-month pre-law period
      (August 1st, 2015, to August 31st, 2017) and 24-month post-law period (September 1st, 2017,
      to August 31st 2019) will be compared. This phase will include 300 patients (n=150 burn,
      n=150 knee arthroscopy) evenly divided between the pre-law and post-law periods.

      Phase 2 involves a prospective patient telephone survey 90 days after burn care or knee
      arthroscopy procedure to assess the association of opioid prescribing, consumption and amount
      of left-over medications, and pain control status after 90 days. This phase will include 100
      patients (n=50 burn, n=50 knee arthroscopy) recruited via convenience sampling.
