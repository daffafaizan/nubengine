    
      This study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of NV1205 in pediatric
      patients diagnosed with childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD).

      The study consists of:

        -  Screening period: within 30 days of first dose

        -  Main treatment period of 12 weeks (Part 1- from Screening to Week 12)

        -  Long Term Treatment (LTT) period (Part 2- Week 13 through Week 96)

      In Part 1, subjects will have an initial 4-week treatment period at the assigned dose and, if
      no safety concerns are noted, subjects continue for another 8 weeks of extended safety
      assessment.

      There will be several cohorts of subjects enrolled. After each Cohort has completed the
      4-week initial safety assessment, the safety data will be reviewed by an independent Data
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and, subject to DSMB recommendation, Cohort 2 will be enrolled
      and receive the next dose level. After Cohort 2 has completed 4 weeks of treatment, the DSMB
      will review all available safety data (Cohorts 1 and 2) and, subject to DSMB recommendation,
      Cohort 3 will be enrolled and receive the next dose level. Additional Cohorts may be enrolled
      at the recommendation of the DSMB with an incremental dose increase.

      In Part 2, subjects will continue to receive treatment in the LTT period of the study.
