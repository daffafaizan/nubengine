    
      A 3-month prospective, controlled study with a quasi-experimental design (i.e., a
      nonrandomized controlled sample with geographic stratification [30 areas]). Control and
      intervention areas ARE selected for their similarities in rural-to-urban distribution of the
      population and patients' access to GPs and to minimize risk of overlap between areas.
