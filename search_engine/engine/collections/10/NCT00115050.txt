    
      This is an open-label non-randomized safety study to provide early access to TMC114 for HIV-1
      infected patients who have failed and exhausted regimens based on commercially available
      antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and who are ineligible for participation in any other
      Tibotec-sponsored trial. The safety and tolerability of TMC114 in combination with low dose
      ritonavir (RTV) and other ARVs in highly ARV-experienced HIV-1 infected patients with limited
      or no treatment options will be assessed. Treatment will be continued until
      treatment-limiting toxicity, lost to follow-up, withdrawal, pregnancy, discontinuation of
      TMC114 development or when TMC114 is commercially available to the patient. Total daily dose
      is 600 mg TMC114 twice daily, each intake in combination with one capsule of 100 mg
      Ritonavir. Since TMC114 is formulated as 300mg tablets (F014) this means 2X2 tablets per day,
      taken orally. Treatment will be continued until treatment-limiting toxicity, lost to
      follow-up, withdrawal, pregnancy, discontinuation of TMC114 development or when TMC114 is
      commercially available to the patient.
