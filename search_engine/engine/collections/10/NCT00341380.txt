      of recurrence after resection of early stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Until
      recently, the only clearly identified prognostic factor was the stage of the disease. Recent
      development of sensitive molecular assays has provided a way to study the effect of
      circulating tumor cells on clinical outcome. Preliminary studies have shown that tumor cells
      detected by such means in lymph nodes or in bone marrow are associated with an increased risk
      of recurrence. Preliminary studies have also indicated that the level of circulating tumor
      cells in the blood stream is effected by intraoperative factors, i.e. the sequence of vessel
      ligation.

      The main objective for this study is to investigate the influence of intraoperative sequence
      of vessel ligation and how this affects tumor recurrence and survival. In addition, we will
      also investigate the use of molecular assays to detect circulating tumor cells as a surrogate
      endpoint for the occurrence of distant metastases and/or death after surgery for NSCL.
      Several of these molecular markers have proven their value in case series but have not been
      rigorously tested for association with the clinical endpoints of interest, tumor recurrence
      and survival. We believe that this study may lead to important answers about how the spread
      of tumor cells occurs and if novel detection methods can be used to predict patient outcome.
