    
      Primary Objective:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ex vivo expanded non-HLA matched donor NK cells in
      combination with ALT-803

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Describe safety profile / toxicity of combining ALT-803 with NK cell adoptive therapy.

        -  Determine antitumor activity of allogeneic NK cells with ALT-803 support.

        -  Determine if a lymphocyte depleting regimen is adequate for preventing early elimination
           of HLA-mismatched donor NK cells by host T-cells.

      Study Design:

      This is a phase I study with "3+3" design with three planned dose levels of NK cells and a
      fixed dose of ALT-803. Three patients will be enrolled sequentially to each dose level,
      starting with dose level 1. Patients will be segregated to either receive ALT803 as cytokine
      support after NK cell infusion (starting with same dose level as Level 1) or no cytokine
      administration. Patients in the arm receiving ALT803 will be either hematologic malignancy
      patients (Cohort A) or Colon/Soft tissue sarcoma patients (Cohort B). Absence of dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) in the DLT assessment period of 28 days must be documented for all
      patients enrolled a cell dose without ALT803 before the next cohort of patients to receive
      cytokines at that dose level can be enrolled. Patients can also be enrolled in parallel to
      the next cell dose level without cytokines.
