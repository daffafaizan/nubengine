        -  To determine if there are any alterations in serotonin levels in patients undergoing
           chemotherapy for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and if this is
           associated with increased constipation.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to beginning of planned postoperative
      chemotherapy, after 3 and 6 courses of chemotherapy, and at the 3-month surveillance visit.
      Patients also complete a bowel function questionnaire at these time points.
