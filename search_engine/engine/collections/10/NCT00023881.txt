        -  Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate, duration of response,
           and survival of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous
           leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib intravenous (IV) over 3-5 seconds twice weekly on weeks
      1-2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 15-30
      months.
