      known , with consequences clearly established on the morbidity, mortality and quality of
      life. Undernutrition is an independent risk factor for mortality (5). In terms of morbidity,
      the most frequently reported consequences are infections, postoperative complications
      (delayed healing, in particular nosocomial infections, risk of pressure ulcers) and
      pejorative impact on the prognosis of chronic diseases such as respiratory failure , heart
      and kidney.

      Malnutrition therefore affects the length of hospital stays and the burden of care.

      Many studies have shown the positive impact of the medical care of malnutrition on morbidity
      and mortality, whether intervention studies in general hospital population or in specific
      pathologies.

      But there is no systematic screening strategy undernutrition implementation in hospitals.

      The investigators assume that the organization of screening for eating disorders based on a
      caregiver specifically dedicated to this activity, improves the indicator IPAQSS Screening
      indicator of nutritional disorders level 3 compared with a "classic" organization shared
      between different actors of care. This indicator reflects the care system performance This
      organization must advance quickly and significantly the number of patients evaluated
      nutritionally and help reach a level of completeness close to 100%.
