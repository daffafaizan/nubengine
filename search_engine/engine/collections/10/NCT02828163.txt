      score of the patients will be assessed using the pemphigus disease area index (PDAI). Three
      milliliters of blood will be withdrawn from each patient. The blood will be centrifuged and
      the platelet rich plasma (PRP) will be extracted. Patients will receive autologous PRP
      injections for one side of buccal mucosa and triamcinolone acetonide 10mg/ml at the other
      buccal mucosa at biweekly intervals for 3 months. The degree of pain and clinical improvement
      of each buccal mucosa will be assessed by an investigator who does not know the nature of
      injection in each buccal mucosa. Therefore the investigation doing the injection will not be
      blind but the other investigator assessing the results will be blind also the patients will
      be blind.
