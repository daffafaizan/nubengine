      age. Specifically, we will test whether adipose tissue loses some of its ability to expand in
      response to overfeeding in older compared to younger men. To test this possibility the
      Investigators will recruit overweight and mildly obese older (age 55-75y) and younger (age
      25-40y) men and collect adipose tissue biopsies before and after 7 days of overfeeding. The
      investigators will test how well the cells in adipose tissue expand in response to
      overfeeding and whether this differs between younger and older men.
