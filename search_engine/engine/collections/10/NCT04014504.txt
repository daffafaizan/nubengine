      beginning of the active phase of labor and the control group consisted of patients not
      receiving pethidine. Newborns were evaluated by otoacoustic emission (OAE) test. The OAE test
      was performed before the patients were discharged. Perinatal and neonatal variables and test
      results were recorded and the relationship between false positivity and pethidine use was
      evaluated.
