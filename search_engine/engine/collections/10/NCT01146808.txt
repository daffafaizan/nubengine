      who received HBcAb + livers and adefovir prophylaxis post-transplant. At one year to 18
      months following transplantation, all study patients will then be vaccinated with standard
      Hepatitis B vaccine at double dose on a monthly basis for three months, at which point they
      will be tested for Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb). Any study patients that have
      developed a sufficient antibody response (HBsAb >500 IU) will be given the option to
      discontinue anti-viral treatment in a monitored setting.
