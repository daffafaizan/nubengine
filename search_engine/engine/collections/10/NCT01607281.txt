      landmark technique. The anatomy of right IJV and left IJV may differ each other. The
      hypothesis is that the anatomical difference between right and left IJV may give rise to
      false puncture of especially left IJV by using anatomical landmark technique.Although USG is
      available, most of the experienced anesthesiologist does not prefer to use USG for IJV
      canulation due to different reasons.In addition to this anesthesiologists are generally
      preferring right IJV canulation, thus they are inexperienced in left IJV canulation. So
      especially during left IJV canulation,not by anatomical landmark technique but by USG will be
      recommended for anesthesiologists.
