      technique. Self-introduction was given to the subjects. Rapport was developed with subjects.
      Nature and purpose of the study was explained to the subjects. Subjects were assured about
      the confidentiality of their responses and informed written consent was taken prior to the
      data collection. Subjects in the experimental and comparison group were administered low
      molecular weight heparin injection subcutaneously by the researcher itself. After
      administration of subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight heparin, dry cold
      application using ice bag (Crushed ice was filled in ice bag with Â½ table spoon of salt and
      then covered by clean linen to prevent moisture) was placed over the injection site for about
      20 minutes in experimental group and no intervention was given in comparison group. Pain was
      assessed using numerical pain rating scale after 20 minutes of subcutaneous injection in both
      the groups (experimental and comparison). At 12 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr after the subcutaneous
      injection, bruise was assessed in both the groups using bruise assessment scale.
