      exercise (MCE) approach and a designed patient education (PE) program based on the
      psychosocial approach will be feasible and acceptable in reducing pain intensity and
      functional disability among rural dwellers with CLBP in Nigeria.

      Participants will be recruited and assigned to one of three intervention groups that include
      MCE group, PE group, or MCE plus PE gr using a simple random technique based on an electronic
      randomization table generated by a computer software program. Blinded assessment of all
      clinical outcomes will be performed at baseline and 6 weeks after randomization.

      Primary outcomes include pain intensity and functional disability while secondary outcomes
      include overall treatment satisfaction.

      Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and ANOVA. All statistical
      analyses will be performed on SPSS (version 24.00) at an alpha level of 0.05.
