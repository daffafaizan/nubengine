      to at-risk families. HFAK is based on the Healthy Families America initiative promoted by
      Prevent Child Abuse America. The State Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS)
      administers the HFAK program.

      In 1998, the Alaska State Legislature requested a controlled study of HFAK to determine its
      effectiveness in preventing child maltreatment, promoting healthy family functioning, and
      promoting child health and development. DHSS awarded the Johns Hopkins University School of
      Medicine a contract to conduct the study from July 1999 through June 2004.

      The study is a randomized trial of six HFAK sites throughout Alaska. It aims to compare
      services actually provided to HFAK standards, assess program success in achieving intended
      outcomes, and relate program impact to service delivery.

      Families are enrolled over 21 months beginning in January 2000. Families are randomized to
      either the HFAk group or the control group. Baseline data on family attributes are collected
      from HFAK files and maternal interviews. HFAK service data are collected from the program's
      management information system, record reviews, surveys of staff, and staff focus groups.
      Outcome data are collected when the children were two years old through maternal interview,
      home-based observations, child developmental testing, review of medical records, and review
      of OCS child welfare records.
