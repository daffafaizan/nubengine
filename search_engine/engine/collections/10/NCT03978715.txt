      diabetic foot infections, ulcers, and bone injuries from 2005 (5 years prior to the start of
      the diabetic limb preservation team) to present day. The investigators will collect
      information from medical records on demographics, medical/surgical history, social history,
      medications, laboratory results, peripheral arterial disease, wound severity, and treatment
      factors such as type of antibiotics, off-loading, debridement, wound healing, surgery
      interventions, complications, recurrence, and history and physical characteristics and exam
      from inpatient and outpatient encounters. This will be identified by current procedural
      terminology (CPT) codes for foot and leg amputations, and lower extremity revascularization
      procedures. Clinic visits will be identified to podiatry/foot wound, vascular surgery,
      invasive cardiology, general surgery, and physical therapy wound care in addition to
      inpatient encounters of these patients to determine the full scope of care received and to
      compare resources utilization before and after implementation of the diabetic limb
      preservation team. Study records will by a study identification number that will be assigned
      to the subject as soon as data collection is completed on each individual chart.

      Non-parametric statistical analyses comparing individuals within each group and also
      differences between the groups will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 (IBM
      Corporation, Armonk, New York).
