      to known genetic markers or due to family history of T1D, are followed from birth and
      monitored for development of T1D-related autoimmunity, on an annual basis. At annual clinic
      visits, participants are tested for development of these autoantibodies and data is collected
      related to environmental exposures. In addition to blood collection for determination of
      autoantibodies, serum and plasma are frozen, and stored for future analyses. Other biological
      samples collected for further future analysis include: throat swabs, rectal swabs, saliva,
      and urine. If T1D-related autoantibodies are detected, the participant is asked to increase
      the frequency of clinic visits to 2-4 visits per year in order to more closely monitor for
      onset of disease. The endpoint of the study is diagnosis of T1D per the American Diabetes
      Association (ADA) criteria.
