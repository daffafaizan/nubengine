      perspective describing recent pharmacological and non-pharmacological management and clinical
      event rates associated with AF complicating ACS in the era of novel treatment strategies (in
      both AF and ACS) and high coronary reperfusion rates.

      This registry will assess the current in-hospital management and clinical events at 6 months
      of consecutive patients admitted in Italian cardiology intensive care units (CCUs) for an ACS
      treated invasively with PCI and stent implantation who present AF at admission or during
      hospital stay, before or after stent implantation .
