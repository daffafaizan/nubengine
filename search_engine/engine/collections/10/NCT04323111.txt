      . The etiology of a deviated septum is generally congenital, but may also be as a result of
      trauma or iatrogenic causes. Most important is the Caudal septal deviation which narrows the
      airway and impairs major mechanisms supporting the tip, leading to tip-ptosis and airway
      collapse. .The correction of caudal septal deviations can be a challenging problem so many
      techniques have been described and tested to correct caudal septal deflections . Attempts to
      correct nasal septal deformities were described in the medical literature as early as the
      late 19th century , and till now there is not one specific technique that is agreed upon by
      surgeons worldwide.
