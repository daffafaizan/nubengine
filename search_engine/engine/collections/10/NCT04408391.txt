      the mechanisms leading to the onset of these symptoms and will provide a pathophysiological
      basis for the therapeutic interventions to improve the clinical prognosis of affected
      patients.

      The study investigators hypothesize that in COVID-19 patients witch anosmia the brain mapping
      objectified by an MRI examination is modified and that there are functional abnormalities in
      the brain in these patients.
