      complex and patients being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Drugs that increase
      the effectiveness of AZT against HIV may also decrease the need for high doses of AZT. This
      might reduce some of the negative effects of AZT while not reducing the positive effects.

      AMENDED: Patients are randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. They receive AZT
      (or other antiretroviral agent) with or without ACV. Treatment Plan 1: AZT along with placebo
      at the same time. Treatment Plan 2: AZT and ACV. Therapy is for 104 weeks with an optional
      extension of 24 weeks or until the end of the study whichever comes first. The maximum
      duration of therapy for any patient will be 128 weeks. Medication is dispensed on a biweekly
      basis for the first 4 weeks, then every other month for the remainder of the study. Original
      design: Patients are randomly assigned to one of four treatment plans to receive AZT alone or
      AZT and ACV. Medications are given every 4 hours (q4h) orally (PO) while awake (WA). A total
      of 5 doses/day are given. The per dose schedule for the four plans are: Treatment plan 1: AZT
      plus placebo (an inactive medication) substituting for ACV. Treatment plan 2: AZT and AZT
      placebo along with an ACV placebo. Treatment plan 3: AZT and ACV. Treatment plan 4: AZT and
      AZT placebo and ACV.
