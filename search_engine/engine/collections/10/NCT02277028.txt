      research. The purpose of these techniques is to prime the cortex prior to training. The
      priming techniques previously described in the literature include medication (i.e.
      amphetamines), transcranial electric or magnetic stimulation, and manipulation of
      somatosensory input. Here, the investigators examine a priming technique which is
      non-invasive and free of side effects. The technique described in this study uses bilateral,
      symmetrical, rhythmic movement "bilateral priming" and its purpose is to ready the motor
      cortex for functional limb training. A "rocker" is used so that the less affected limb can
      drive the affected one in symmetrical wrist flexion and extension. In this project, the
      investigators intend to compare bilateral upper limb priming with task specfiic training to a
      health care education website program followed by the same task specific training as the
      experimental group.This active comparator (health care education) will receive stroke related
      health education via a website from the American Heart Association. Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation willl include measurement of transcallosal inhibition persistence from the
      affected hemisphere to the less affected hemisphere and vice versa ( less affected to
      affected). The investigators expect the bilateral priming group to have greater changes in
      transcranial magnetic stimulation measures and greater improvements in behavioral measures at
      all time points.
