      Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand in 2005. At presentation, patients received immediate ACP
      with a 30-gauge needle. The IOP, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal edema grading,
      pupil size and symptoms were recorded at immediately, 15 and 30 minutes, and then 1, 24 and
      48 hours after paracentesis. All affected eyes received antiglaucomatous medications 60
      minutes after ACP and underwent peripheral iridotomy within 24 hours.
