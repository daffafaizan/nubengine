    
      The written consent of the subjects will be obtained after full information of the aims,
      nature and possible risks of the study.

      Before inclusion, subjects will undergo a medical check-up including an interview on personal
      and family history and drug treatments taken as well as a standard medical examination
      including weight, height and blood pressure measurement. . Their compliance with the
      inclusion / exclusion criteria will be verified during this review. An interview with
      personnel involved in the research (a dietician / study Research clinic assistant, etc.) will
      also be carried out as well as a biological selection assessment.

      As part of this study, the subjects will come a total of 7 times to the Emile ROUX hospital
      in Le Puy en Velay.

      The probiotic treatment will begin between 1 and 3 weeks after the inclusion visit. The
      volunteers / patients recruited will have a volume of blood sampled and a stool collected
      before the start of the probiotic treatment (T = 0) and at the end of the treatment (T = 4
      weeks). The study consists of three periods of probiotic treatment of 4 weeks each
      interspersed with a wash-out period of 3 weeks in accordance with the recovery period
      necessary between two blood samples.

      The sera thus obtained will then be analyzed to determine their biological activity with
      regard to the induction of changes in the behavior of bone cell models: osteoformin cells
      (osteoblasts) and osteo-resorbent cells (osteoclasts).
