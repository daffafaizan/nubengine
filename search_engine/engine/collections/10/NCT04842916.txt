      the world and the third leading cause of cancer death in both sexes. Chemotherapy (CT)
      combined with surgery represents the standard of care for stages II-III GC, but the efficacy
      of such treatments is still limited for many patients. It is mandatory to develop novel
      strategies aimed at identifying predictive markers, as well as deciphering the impact of the
      psychological-social and cultural environment of each patient on the outcome. GRAMMY study
      proposes a novel interdisciplinary approach integrating high impact basic, translational and
      psychological/sociological research towards developing an optimized patient stratification
      tool for the early prediction of therapy-resistant GC patient groups.
