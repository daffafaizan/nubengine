      BCR-ABL gene rearrangement. This genetic abnormality occurs in up to 30% of adult acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and its presence is known to be the most adverse prognostic
      factor for ALL. Because long-term survival cannot be achieved by conventional chemotherapy
      alone, there is a clear medical need for alternative treatment approaches. Imatinib is a
      potent selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL protein kinase, and it has been reported that
      single-agent imatinib induced response in a substantial proportion of Ph-positive ALL
      (Ph+ALL) patients, but that the response was not durable. The Japan Adult Leukemia Study
      Group (JALSG) has therefore started a phase 2 study designed to evaluate the clinical effect
      of imatinib-combined chemotherapy on newly diagnosed BCR-ABL-positive ALL.
