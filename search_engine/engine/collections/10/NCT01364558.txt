      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States and is currently sold as
      Valium® tablets, Diazepam Injection and Diastat® rectal gel.

      This study will evaluate two intranasal (nasal spray) formulations of diazepam which will be
      supplied by Neurelis, Inc. The purpose of this clinical research study is to assess the
      bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of two formulations of diazepam after intranasal (nasal
      spray) and injectable diazepam after intravenous (I.V.) administration. "Bioavailability" is
      a measure of how much drug is absorbed and present in the blood. "Pharmacokinetics" means to
      study the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time
