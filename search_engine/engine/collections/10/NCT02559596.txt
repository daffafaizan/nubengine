    
      This study will use a case control design to investigate whether adult participants in the
      Health Survey for England between 2009 and 2013 who were admitted to hospital with either a
      stroke or heart attack had higher preceding levels of varicella zoster virus antibodies
      measured in stored serum samples compared to matched controls with no history of heart attack
      or stroke, controlling for a range of potential demographic, lifestyle and clinical
      confounders.

      This study is funded by the University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre
      Fast Track grant scheme and has received ethics approval (ref 15/NW/0456).
