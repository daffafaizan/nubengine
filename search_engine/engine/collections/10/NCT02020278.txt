      • For all participants: To evaluate the post-treatment safety follow-up of children and
      adolescent participants with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia who have
      previously participated in a tolvaptan hyponatremia trial.

      Optional Tolvaptan Treatment Component

      • For participants who receive optional tolvaptan treatment: To demonstrate that tolvaptan
      safely and effectively achieves and maintains increased serum sodium concentrations in
      children and adolescent participants with dilutional (euvolemic or hypervolemic) hyponatremia
      when used for both multiple short-term treatments, and/or longer chronic treatments.
