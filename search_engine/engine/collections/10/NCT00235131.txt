    
      This is a German multi-center prospective, randomized, two-arm study evaluating performance
      of the Cordis S.M.A.R.T.™ CONTROL ™ Nitinol Stent System as compared to the C.R. Bard®
      Luminexx™ 6F Vascular Stent. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. It is anticipated
      that a total of 200 patients will be entered into the study.

      The study population will consist of approximately 200 symptomatic peripheral vascular
      disease patients with TASC C & D SFA lesions. The disease will consist of symptomatic, long
      de novo or restenotic lesions (> 70% stenosis) and occlusions (5 - 22 cm) on diagnostic
      imaging. The lesion must not extend into the distal SFA and the popliteal artery. At least
      one distal popliteal artery must be patent as well as one calf vessel. Reference vessel
      diameter must be >= 4.0 to <= 6.0 mm.

      Trial participants will be randomized to the Cordis S.M.A.R.T.™ CONTROL™ Nitinol Stent System
      or to the Bard® Luminexx™ 6F Vascular Stent.

      Patients will be followed for twelve months post-procedure. Study examinations will be done
      at screening, procedure time, discharge, six, and twelve months post procedure.

      This study will be conducted over up to 15 investigational sites in Germany.
