excretion patterns of urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c14 inpostmenopausal women with benign and malignant disease of the breast .a study of the excretion patterns of the urinary metabolites ofestradiol-4-c1j administered to a group of 43 postmenopausal women, 38with advanced mammary carcinoma prior to endocrine therapy and 5 withbenign mammary dysplasia, is reported . a chromatographic method wasemployed for the determination of estradiol, estrone, and estriol andother estrogen metabolites . the urinary excretion pattern is defined by(a) the extent of excretion of isotope in each of 3 successive 24-hr.collection periods, (b) the percentage of the urinary radiometabolitesenzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the severalmetabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subjectvariations were found . the metabolites other than estradiol, estrone,and estriol comprised a large portion of the total estrogens excreted .a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group ofwomen with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in thegroup of women with benign mammary dysplasia, suggesting that the formergroup metabolizes more rapidly the administered estradiol . although theexcretion patterns of patients who failed to respond to estrogentreatment (nonresponders) differed the greatest from the patternsassociated with benign disease, distinctive patterns of the urinaryexcretion of isotopic estrogens which allowed a statisticallysignificant or clinically useful separation between responders andnonresponders to subsequent estrogen therapy were not discovered .
