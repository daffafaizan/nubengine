    
      Approximately 800 patients will receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus
      Interferon gamma-1b. Chemotherapy will be paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over 3 hours) followed by
      carboplatin (AUC 6) every 3 weeks. Only those patients in the treatment arm will receive
      interferon doses. Interferon gamma-1b 100 mg will be administered subcutaneously 3 times per
      week (every other day; no more than 3 doses in a 7-day period) continuously while patients
      are treated with carboplatin / paclitaxel (including for the 3 weeks following the last dose
      of chemotherapy). A total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy will be given unless disease
      progression or liming toxicity occurs or patients refuse further treatment. Each patient will
      receive a total of 54 doses over a period of 18 weeks. Each patient's participation will be
      from 3-8 years in duration.
