    
      Multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, multidose study of MDX-1203, a fully human
      monoclonal antibody drug conjugate targeting the CD70 transmembrane cell-surface protein
      which is highly expressed in ccRCC and B-NHL. MDX-1203 is composed of a human anti-CD70
      monoclonal antibody covalently linked to a prodrug form of a cytotoxic deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) minor-groove binding agent (MGBA).

      The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (up to 17 cycles or
      2 years), and Follow-up (up to 6 months).
