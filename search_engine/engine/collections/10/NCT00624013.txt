      clinical trials to be an effective and well tolerated prescription medication that improves
      the quality and enjoyment of life for adults suffering from depression . Sertraline is an
      antidepressant and a member of the family of medications known as selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has excellent tolerability and minimal drug-drug
      intereactions.

      The hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims:

        1. To determine if treating mild to moderate depression with sertraline (Zoloft) in
           patients with diabetes improves HbA1c.

        2. To determine if treating mild to moderate depression with sertraline (Zoloft) in
           patients with diabetes improves quality of life.

      If our hypothesis proves correct and this treatment of depression is efficient and easy in a
      county hospital population of African Americans and Hispanics, researchers can move forward
      in finding fast and efficient means of diagnosing depression in vulnerable populations,
      including low-literate patients. This study is critical in that it stands to improve the
      HBA1c (and other metabolic parameters) and quality of life of our underserved minority
      community, which sadly suffers from a higher rate of almost every disease, including
      diabetes. Treating mild to moderate depression in a county hospital population of African
      Americans and Hispanics may improve quality of life and reduce/prevent complications and
      early death. Secondary outcomes include reduced hospitalizations, fewer missed appointments,
      and improved adherence to medication.
