      compared to placebo can achieve a 3 point or greater reduction in itch severity as measured
      by numeric rating scale (NRS) score following two months of treatment.

      Secondary objectives include;

        1. comparative weekly change in daily worst-itch NRS,

        2. comparative weekly change in average daily NRS itch severity,

        3. the proportion of patients who achieve at a least 30% or 50% reduction in NRS severity
           from baseline at the end of two months of treatment,

        4. proportion of patients achieving 2 point and 4 point reductions in average daily itch
           severity following two months of treatment,

        5. change in participant-reported outcomes of global assessment of change in itch and
           overall improvement as measured by static participant assessment of itch, participant
           global assessment of change in itch severity, and caregiver global assessment of change
           in itch severity, and

        6. assessment on the safety of Serlopitant in adolescents (â‰¥13 y.o.) and adults with
           pruritus associated with epidermolysis bullosa (EB).
