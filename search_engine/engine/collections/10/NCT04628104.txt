      000 patients worldwide as of April 28, 2020. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2,. Among patients with COVID-19, there is a high prevalence of
      cardiovascular disease, and >7% of patients experience myocardial injury from the infection
      (22% of critically ill patients). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 serves as the
      portal for infection, the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin
      receptor blockers requires further investigation.

      However, much like any other respiratory tract infection, pre-existing cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) and CV risk factors enhance vulnerability to COVID-19. Further, COVID-19 can worsen
      underly- ing CVD and even precipitate de novo cardiac complications.

      Preliminary reports suggest that haemostatic abnormalities, including disseminated
      intravascular coagulation (DIC), occur in patients affected by COVID-19. Additionally, the
      severe inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying traditional risk factors may
      all predispose to thrombotic events, similar to prior virulent zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks
      CMR is the reference non-invasive standard for cardiac function and tissue characterization
      and may offer an effective and efficient diagnostic imaging choice to obtain critical
      information for clinical decision-making.
