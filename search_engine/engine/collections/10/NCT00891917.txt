      crossover design. Patients will be screened, enrolled, and studied in the outpatient clinic
      of the Thomas Center for Down Syndrome at CCHMC. All patients will be randomly assigned to
      either a liquid product (LiQ-NOLÂ®) and an identical placebo liquid. Study drug and placebo
      will be administered twice a day (morning and evening).
