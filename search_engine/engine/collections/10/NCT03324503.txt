      that efficiently reflect changes in disease activity over short treatment durations. Such
      endpoints enable preliminary assessment of candidate drug efficacy in small studies - prior
      to exposing large cohorts to experimental compounds in pursuit of registrational data.

      This study will accordingly investigate the ways that certain HRCT-based functional
      respiratory imaging (FRI) measures can serve as more quantitative and sensitive endpoints
      compared to pulmonary function tests to measure drug effect in a short duration small sample
      size study in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The study is designed to minimize impact
      on sarcoid care that the patient would have otherwise received. Glucocorticoid (â‰¥ 30 mg/day
      prednisone or prednisolone) as per local clinical practice of sarcoidosis initial induction
      therapy will be taken orally in this study. The glucocorticoid dose may be modified depending
      on ongoing assessment as a part of standard local clinical practice.
