      device or a sham procedure. Patients will be evaluated for the study and randomized to a
      treatment group if they qualify for the study. Throughout the study their weights will be
      obtained and various laboratory tests collected. A comparison of weight loss between the two
      groups will be assessed as the primary outcome measure.
