      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit: Promega®, USA)
      and kept frozen at seventy degrees Celsius negative (-70ºC) until analysis. For APOE
      genotyping (alleles Ɛ2, Ɛ3 and Ɛ4), DNA samples were amplified by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR), followed by digestion with Haemophilus haemolyticus restriction endonuclease I (HhaI)
      and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, as previously described by
      Hixson and Vernier.

      The CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*6 alleles were investigated by tetra-primer PCR and the
      CYP2D6*5 allele, which presents the entire CYP2D6 gene deletion, was identified by long PCR
      reaction, according to the method described by Hersberger et al. The CYP2D6*10 allele was
      amplified by PCR following Baclig et al. and the RFLP analysis was performed with Type II
      restriction enzyme (HphI). For all analysis a positive and negative controls were included.

      Subjects carrying Epsilon 3, Epsilon 3 (Ɛ3Ɛ3), CYP2D6*3/4/5/6/10-nor specific mutations are
      classified as wild-type and functional allele carriers. The subjects carrying two defective
      alleles were classified as poor metabolizers (PM) and those heterozygous were classified as
      extensive metabolizers (EM).
