      patients infected by HIV with failure in renal function at year 5. The main criterion will be
      a degradation of the glomerular filtration throughput measured. It will be compared to
      clinical scores of degradation risks of renal function for patients infected with HIV.

      From 2011 to 2013, researchers realized a study called HIVOL, on the diagnostic performance
      of GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) estimators in patients infected with HIV. It lead to a
      publication in AIDS, retaken in the rational of recommendations of Infectious Diseases
      Society of America for the Chronic Renal Diseases support for patients infected with HIV.

      235 patients were involved, for everyone researchers have a GFR measure (by Iohexol plasmatic
      clearance) and urinary and plasma samples.
