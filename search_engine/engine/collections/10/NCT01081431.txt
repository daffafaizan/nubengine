      proportion of patients with MDS and del(5q) developed leukemia while treated with
      Lenalidomide. Up to now it is unknown what patients are at risk to progress while being
      treated with Lenalidomid. Therefore it is planned to examine not only the traditional
      clinical parameters like disease status and proportion of blasts, but also cytogenetic
      findings, gene expression, antiangiogenic effect, marrow fibrosis, mesenchymal stem cell as
      well as mitochondrial DNA mutation at baseline and in the course of the study performed by
      central laboratories. Moreover, long-term data are required, e.g., with regard to the
      development of AML. Therefore, it is planned to collect data from all patients with MDS and
      del 5q (isolated, blast count <5%) in whom treatment with lenalidomide is the best
      therapeutic option according to the investigator's assessment in a structured fashion.
