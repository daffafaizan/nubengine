      safety and effectiveness of the Superion™ ISS compared to the X-STOP® IPD® device in healthy
      adults suffering from at least 6 months of moderate spinal stenosis symptoms who have been
      unresponsive to conservative care. The study endpoint is the rate of overall subject success
      at 24 months.
