      1. To determine the feasibility, adherence, and satisfaction with physical activity (PA) plus
      dexamethasone (PA+ DEX).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the preliminary efficacy of PA+ Hi Dex group (PA for 4 weeks plus high dose
      dexamethasone for 1 week) and PA + Lo Dex groups (PA for 4 weeks plus low dose dexamethasone
      for 1 week) on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) as measured by Functional Assessment of Chronic
      Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) at the end of one week.

      II. To explore the effects of PA+ Hi Dex on the various dimensions of CRF (Patient-Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System-Fatigue [PROMIS-F]), i.e., affective/emotional
      (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS]); physical/behavioral (the Multidimensional Fatigue
      Symptom Inventory-Short Form [MFSI-SF], Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), physical activity and
      function (30 second sit-to stand test, six minute walk test) before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive high-dose dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 7 days.
      Patients also follow a graded resistance exercise program 3 days a week and a walking regimen
      at least 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercises
      will be evaluated and adjusted as necessary.

      ARM II: Patients receive low-dose dexamethasone PO BID for 7 days. Patients also follow a
      graded resistance exercise program 3 days a week and a walking regimen at least 5 days a week
      for 4 weeks. The frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercises will be evaluated and
      adjusted as necessary.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at day 29 and again after 1 month.
