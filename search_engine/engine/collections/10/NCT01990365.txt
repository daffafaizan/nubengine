      without low back pain even if acute OVFs occurred. The mechanism of low back pain after acute
      OVFs is well unknown. We set up a hypothesis that low back pain results from vertebral body
      mobility, which refers to a change of vertebral height or configuration with changes in body
      positioning. The main objective of this study is to reveal the relationship between vertebral
      body mobility and low back pain.
