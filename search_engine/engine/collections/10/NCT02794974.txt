      vessel wall (IX,X) and of the neck muscles (VII,XI)), as well as the cervical plexus and
      brachial plexus. This is a major cause of insufficient anesthesia quality during carotid
      endarterectomies.

      The investigators test with the present prospective study design, whether an
      ultrasound-guided blockade of the cervical plexus in combination with an additional
      application of local anesthetic to the superficial cervical ansa (facial nerve: cervical
      branch) leads to an improved quality of anesthesia.
