      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and optimum schedule of tributyrin in patients with
      prostate cancer or other solid tumors.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of tributyrin in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacodynamics of tributyrin, including modulation of tumor markers, evaluation of clinical
      remission (when possible), assessment of F-reticulocytes and/or F cells, and evaluation of
      hemoglobin F before and after treatment, in these patients.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of tributyrin, including maximum plasma concentration,
      terminal half-life, area under the concentration time curve, volume of distribution, and
      clearance of butyrate, in these patients.

      V. Determine the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and toxic or therapeutic
      pharmacodynamic effects of butyrate in these patients.

      VI. Calculate a tributyrin dose, using results from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      studies, that achieves sustained butyrate concentrations capable of increasing therapeutic
      effects with reduced toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive oral tributyrin every 8 hours for 3 weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks
      for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve stable disease may receive additional courses at the discretion of the protocol
      chairperson. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tributyrin until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
