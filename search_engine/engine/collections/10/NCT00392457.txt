      identified in approximately 50% of cases. To date, however, most infertility research has
      focused on the female partner and in the majority of instances the etiology of male
      infertility remains poorly understood with inconsistent elevation in FSH levels. Given that
      spermatogenesis is highly dependent on FSH secretion, this project will focus on delineating
      the feedback control of FSH in the human male. Such studies, although difficult to perform in
      the human, are critical to understanding not only the pathophysiology of male infertility,
      but also to determining the feasibility of hormonal approaches to male contraception. In this
      protocol, studies of normal, GnRH-deficient and agonadal men employing reversible sex steroid
      ablation, physiologic sex steroid replacement and manipulation of the GnRH input to the
      pituitary will permit the non-steroidal, sex steroid, and GnRH-dependent components of FSH
      regulation to be selectively elucidated.
