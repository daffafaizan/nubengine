        1. What is the estimated effect size of a behavioral MA intervention on MA rates in older
           adults who are poorly adherent to statin medications?

           The study will also explore the following secondary research questions:

        2. What is the estimated effect size of a behavioral MA intervention on low-density
           lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in older adults?

        3. What is the estimated effect size of a behavioral MA intervention on high-density
           lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in older adults?

        4. What is the feasibility of successfully testing this intervention protocol in a
           population of older adults with low adherence to statin medications?
