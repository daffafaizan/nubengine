    
      This is a phase 3, two-arm, randomized, active-controlled, multi-center, 52-week, parallel
      design trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety in women with Female Pattern Hair Loss
      (FPHL), comparing the new 5% minoxidil topical foam (MTF) formulation versus the 2% minoxidil
      topical solution (MTS) formulation.

      This clinical trial is designed to compare the risk/benefit profile of the 5% MTF formulation
      applied once a day versus the 2% MTS applied twice a day (BID), using objective efficacy
      measures and safety assessments.

      Study centers will screen a sufficient number of participants so that a minimum of 300 female
      participants with FPHL will be enrolled, to ensure 270 to complete. There will be at least 16
      participants enrolled per center at multiple centers located across the US and globally.
      Approximately 300 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use either 5% MTF
      or 2% MTS, for 52 weeks for efficacy and safety evaluations.

      Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in the order of their
      enrollment at each site. The signing of the informed consent and assignment of a participant
      number to a subject shall constitute enrollment.

      During the trial following enrollment at Baseline, participants will return to the study site
      at regular intervals for safety assessments, adverse events monitoring, and compliance
      assessments. At the Week 12, 24, and Week 52 visits TAHC will be evaluated for efficacy
      analysis.
