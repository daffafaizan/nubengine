      with 2 MICE sessions per week on cardiovascular fitness and mobility compared to MICE
      training 5 days/week. Participants post-stroke will be randomly assigned to either MICE (5
      days per week (d∙wk-1)) or combined HIIT (3 d∙wk-1) with MICE (2 d∙wk-1). Both groups will be
      exercising 5 times per week (walking on a treadmill with harness for fall protection); 3
      times at the centre and 2 times at home. Outcome measures will be conducted before and after
      24 weeks of training.
