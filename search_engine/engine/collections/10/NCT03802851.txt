      enucleation (HoLEP) in men with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and prostate
      cancer who have elected for radiation therapy as the primary treatment modality for their
      prostate cancer. The investigators hypothesize that pre-radiation HoLEP may decrease their
      overall LUTS and may decrease their need for subsequent radiation therapy. The goal with this
      study is to better understand the overlap between prostate cancer and LUTS, as well as
      determine if primary surgical treatment for the LUTS with HoLEP can also serve as a possible
      treatment modality for concurrent prostate cancer. This information may provide further
      information to inform future standard of care practices for patients with prostate cancer.
