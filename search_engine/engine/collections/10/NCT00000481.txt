      The Request for Proposal for the Women's Health Trial: Feasibility Study in Minority
      Populations was developed and released by the National Cancer Institute with assistance from
      the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized. Recruitment began in August 1992 and ended in February 1994. Forty percent of the
      subjects were randomized to a control group and 60 percent to the dietary intervention group.
      Dietary counseling aimed to reduce total fat to 20 percent of calories, reduce saturated fat
      and dietary cholesterol intakes, and to increase the intake of fruits, vegetables, and grain
      products. Recruitment and randomization were conducted over an 18-month period at three
      clinical centers. Other objectives of the trial included: development and evaluation of
      strategies for recruiting and retaining women of different racial and SES groups into a
      dietary intervention study; identification of factors affecting compliance; assessment of the
      effects of a modified fat eating pattern on cardiovascular disease risk factors, including
      fasting blood lipids and lipoproteins, glucose and insulin, body weight and blood pressure;
      identification and assessment of potential biochemical and/or biological markers for dietary
      adherence.

      Close-out visits began in May 1994 and ended in September 1994. These visits included six,
      twelve, and eighteen-month follow-up. NCI extended the coordinating center contract through
      January 1996 to support data analysis and publication of research results.
