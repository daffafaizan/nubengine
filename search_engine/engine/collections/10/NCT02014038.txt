      at least one ultramarathon (50K distance or greater) prior to enrollment.Longitudinal data
      will be collected through periodic (every 1-2 years) survey completion by enrolled subjects
      over the course of up to 20 years. All surveys will be collected through a secure web-based
      system used by Stanford University Qualtrics). Minor formatting adjustments will be required
      when placing into the on-line questionnaire format.

      We anticipate that the follow-up surveys will be adjusted prior to use, so they will be
      submitted to the Institutional Review board as addendum or in continuing review. As indicated
      elsewhere, subjects will be recruited through an email exchange (referred to as the
      "Ultralist"), various ultramarathon-related web sites and blogs, and ultramarathon-related
      magazines. Initial recruitment will continue for up to 12 months or until we have reached our
      desired sample size. Recruitment material (attached) will include a link to the initial
      survey. For follow-up surveys, subjects will initially be sent an email (using the address
      they have provided with the initial survey) that contains a link to the survey and request
      that they complete the survey. Attempt to contact non-responders will be, in this order,
      through a second email, phone call, letter to their home, email to identified surrogate,
      phone call to identified surrogate, and letter to identified surrogate. Publicly available
      death records will be examined for cases where follow-up cannot be achieved.
