      functional level and the clinical level. The investigators will measure the effect of rTMS
      directly on brain activity through EEG recording. The investigators investigate its effects
      on cognitive performance through the use of neuropsychological computer tasks. The
      investigators will address clinical behavior (craving and alcohol use) with questionnaires.
