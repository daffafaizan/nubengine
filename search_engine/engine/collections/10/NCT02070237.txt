    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled study to compare the proportion of
      patients that achieve the desired effect of LMWH (enoxaparin) thromboprophylaxis as measured
      by peak anti Xa level with weight based twice daily dosing versus standard fixed daily
      dosing. The investigators hypothesize that when enoxaparin is dosed by maternal weight and
      administered twice daily, the anti-factor Xa level would more frequently achieve prophylactic
      levels when compared to taking a fixed 40 mg of the drug daily.

      Subjects will be women with a BMI > 35 who have undergone a cesarean delivery and who will
      receive thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin (Lovenox) at the judgment of their physician.

      Women who are eligible and consent to participate in the study will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to one of the following groups:

      Group 1 will receive the weight based dosing (0.5mg/kg BID) enoxaparin (Lovenox®; Aventis
      Pharmaceuticals) regimen Group 2 will received the fixed dose (40mg daily) enoxaparin
      (Lovenox®; Aventis Pharmaceuticals) regimen.

      Treatment will begin between 8 and 12 hours post operatively and this regimen will continue
      until discharge from the hospital, usually on the third or fourth day after surgery. A single
      peak anti Xa level will be drawn 3.5-4 hours after the third dose of medication. The results
      of the anti Xa level will only be for research purposes and will not guide clinical
      management.

      The primary outcome for this study is to assess the peak anti-factor Xa level in the blood,
      and whether or not the subject achieved the desired prophylactic level when receiving fixed
      dose of enoxaparin compared with weight based dosing.
