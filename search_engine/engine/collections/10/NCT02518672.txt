      To investigate the efficacity of oral administration of MAG-DHA to increase DHA
      bioavailability and reduce lung inflammation of patients with cystic fibrosis

      The specific objectives of the project are :

        -  Determine the effect of MAG-DHA on lipid membranes of the blood mononuclear cells.

        -  Evaluate the effect of MAG-DHA on lung inflammation (determination of Human leukocyte
           elastase and alpha1 antitrypsin complexes : pHLE).

      For this study, 20 cystic fibrosis patients are recruited. Patients are divided into 2 groups
      of 10 and received a daily dose equivalent to 3 g of placebo (sunflower oil) or MAG-DHA.

      The project takes place over a period of 3 months and patients must travel to the research
      center for a total of five visits including recruitment.

      For the 2 groups, DHA ratio / AA is measured in membranes of mononuclear cells. Forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is determined and pHLE complexes are detected in plasma
      as a marker of inflammation.
