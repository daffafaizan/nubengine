    
      SpA patients who had foot pain at least for 4 weeks and those having bilateral
      anteroposterior and lateral feet x-rays will be included into the study. Foot x-rays will be
      evaluated by a radiologist by using the spondyloarthropathy tarsal radiographic index
      (SpA-TRI). The foot related functional status of the patients will be determined by the
      Turkish version of the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS).
