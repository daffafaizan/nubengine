      VTS-270 in patients with neurologic manifestations of Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease has
      the potential to slow the rate of progression of their neurologic disease.

      Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare, neurodegenerative, inherited, autosomal
      recessive lysosomal lipid storage disorder primarily in children and teenagers. The disease
      is characterized by the inability to properly metabolize cholesterol and other lipids within
      the cell due to mutations in the NPC1 gene, causing unesterified cholesterol to accumulate in
      the brain, liver and spleen.

      This study plans to enroll about 51 participants with NPC1 disease. It will be conducted in
      three parts: Parts A, B, and C.

        -  Part A will evaluate 3 different dose levels of VTS-270 in 12 participants to determine
           the dose level for Parts B and C.

        -  In Part B, 39 more participants will join the original 12 to evaluate the safety and
           effectiveness of the dose selected from Part A compared to sham control.

        -  Part C will be an open-label extension phase of the study for Part B participants who
           either complete Part B or have met rescue therapy criteria.

      Participants in Part C will receive treatment with VTS-270 until the product is licensed or
      the program is terminated (anticipated within 5 years).
