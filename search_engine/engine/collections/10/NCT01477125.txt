      improves working memory capacity. Secondary aims are to explore whether improvements in
      working memory capacity will be transferred to improvements in learning abilities and fluid
      intelligence. Also, far transfer effects on executive functioning, ADHD symptoms,
      psychosocial functioning and quality of life will be explored. Finally, it will also be
      assessed to what extent improvements gained from 5 weeks of working memory training will be
      maintained 3 and 6 months post-study, respectively.
