      be obtained from patients requiring intubation for general anesthesia, after obtaining
      written informed consent. The images of the larynx will be captured first with the Macintosh
      blade and thereafter with the D blade. An expert panel will score these images with the
      Cormack Lehane and POGO scores. The set of images will be prepared from patients with both
      difficult and normal airway anatomy. Some images in the series will be repeated to assess
      intra rater variability. The anesthesiologist will be asked to rate 20 images both with the
      CL and POGO scores. The experience of the raters in airway management, their experience with
      videolaryngoscopy and scoring systems used currently when documenting videolaryngoscopy and
      demographic data will be also obtained. The POGO scores of the participants and investigators
      will be compared. The primary outcome measure was the reviewer's agreement with the correct
      POGO scores (accuracy).
