      considered chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). This is a problem in kids and adolescents that
      can impact many areas of the patient's life and their family. Many patients who undergo
      surgery for their scoliosis develop CPSP. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      effect of a common pain medication (gabapentin) on chronic postsurgical pain in pediatric
      patients who require surgery for idiopathic scoliosis.
