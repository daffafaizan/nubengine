      an omega-3 fatty acid based IFE in infants with surgical gastrointestinal disease will
      improve clinical outcomes compared to infants treated with standard IFE up to 6 months post
      randomization. Neonates and infants < 3 months old (postnatally) with surgical
      gastrointestinal disease (defined as congenital or acquired gastrointestinal disease
      requiring PN for more than 21 days) will be eligible for enrollment. Patients who meet all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive PN with either Intralipid® or
      Omegaven®. The appearance of both IFEs is indistinguishable, so patients, families and the
      medical care team will be blinded to treatment group allocation. Aside from the IFE type, the
      clinical care of both groups of infants will remain unchanged, including standard use of
      feeding advancement protocols, and treatment of underlying gastrointestinal and other
      diseases.
