      patients requiring corneal incisions. The cutting action of the VisuMax laser keratome is
      achieved through precise individual micro-photodisruptions of tissue, created by tightly
      focused, ultra-short pulses, delivered through a disposable applanation lens while fixating
      the eye under a low vacuum. ReLEx SMILE combines state-of-the-art femtosecond laser
      technology of the VisuMax with high-precision lenticule extraction to provide minimally
      invasive refractive correction. It is distinguished by its flapless, minimally invasive laser
      correction. A refractive lenticule is created in the intact cornea, but removed via a small
      incision. The changed form of the cornea corrects the refraction error. ReLEx SMILE for
      myopia is a well-established treatment with extensive supporting published evidence for
      efficacy and safety. It is CE marked and available since 2011; more than 1 Million procedures
      have been performed worldwide. The correction of farsightedness using ReLEx SMILE for
      hyperopia is focus of this investigation and is therefore not yet CE marked.
