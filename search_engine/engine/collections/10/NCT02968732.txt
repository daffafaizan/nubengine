      slides to under-go next generation sequencing and be compared to final cystectomy specimen to
      investigate potential pre-treatment signatures predictive of response to chemotherapy and to
      understand genomic evolution of primary tumors after chemotherapy. All patients will also
      have urine, PBMC, and serum/plasma collected at baseline, day of procedure, 4-6 weeks
      post-procedure, and 6 months post-procedure. The baseline samples will be collected prior to
      any chemotherapy administration and prior to the procedure.

      On the day of the patient's radical cystectomy, standard rigid cystourethroscopy will be
      performed. A urine sample will be collected from the bladder. A plasma sample will be
      collected while the patient is under anesthesia or in pre-op holding area. Visible tumor and
      prior tumor sites will be targeted for tissue sampling (no more than two sites will be
      targeted). A standardized tumor quantification system will be employed to document location
      and presence of tumor and previous biopsy sites. To this end, the investigators have
      developed a novel scoring system that allows for objective quantification of endoscopic
      findings at the time of cystoscopy and indexes presence and location of papillary tumor,
      erythema, and scar. Two additional random biopsies will be obtained, one from the posterior
      wall and one from the lateral wall for assessment of genomic signatures within
      normal-appearing mucosa.

      Tumor location and its relationship to the ureteral orifices will be noted in order to assist
      the surgeon in performance of radical cystectomy. The patient will then undergo radical
      cystectomy as per standard of care.
