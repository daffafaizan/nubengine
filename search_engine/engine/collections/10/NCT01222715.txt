      l. To determine the feasibility of administering bevacizumab in combination with intravenous
      vinorelbine (vinorelbine tartrate) and cyclophosphamide (VC) in patients with recurrent
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS).

      II. To determine the feasibility of administering temsirolimus in combination with VC in
      patients with recurrent RMS.

      III. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) of patients with recurrent/refractory RMS
      treated with bevacizumab and VC and compare with the EFS of those treated with temsirolimus
      and VC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the initial (2 cycle) response rate of patients with recurrent/refractory RMS
      treated with bevacizumab and VC and compare with the response rate of those treated with
      temsirolimus and VC, and to also compare the best response rate on each regimen of protocol
      therapy.

      II. To evaluate surrogate biological markers in patients with recurrent RMS and to estimate
      differences in these markers following treatment with bevacizumab and temsirolimus.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate intravenously (IV) over 6-10 minutes on days 1
      and 8 and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate and cyclophosphamide as in arm I. Patients also
      receive temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years.
