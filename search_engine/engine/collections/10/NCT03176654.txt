    
      A high-velocity low-amplitude thrust (HVLAT) manipulation or commonly known as a spinal
      manipulation, is an intervention frequently used by physical therapists and other healthcare
      practitioners as an alternative treatment to help relieve spinal pain The mechanism by which
      HVLAT manipulation modulates pain remains undefined, although this does not contradict the
      clinical effects from HVLAT manipulation. Furthermore, there is evidence that suggests
      analgesia after HVLAT manipulation. There is a variety of observed and proposed phenomena
      that can explain the mechanisms for the psychological, mechanical, or neurophysiological
      responses from a HVLAT manipulation associated with alterations in pain processing or
      sympathetic and motor systems' excitation.
