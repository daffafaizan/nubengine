      the upper chamber of the heart (atrial tachyarrhythmias) in pacemaker patients that have not
      been previously diagnosed with this condition. The study will also look at how the diagnostic
      feature in the pacemaker that detects atrial tachyarrhythmias helps physicians with the
      medical management of patients' heart rhythm.
