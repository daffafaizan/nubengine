      disability includes facial disfigurement and impairment in soft tissue movements,
      particularly in facial expressive behaviors. These negative physical sequelae not only impact
      facial esthetics and function, but also patients' social and emotional quality of life.
      Treatments range from non-surgical interventions and facial reanimation surgery to new
      implantable facial pacing devices that would potentially initiate artificial movement on the
      paralyzed side of the face. Traditionally, surgeons' plan treatment based on isolated
      measurements made from 2D photographs and subjective grading of the patient's face, both of
      which are limited in scope and dimension. Our research group has demonstrated the utility of
      a novel 3D dynamic and static quantitative (objective) measures for the evaluation of facial
      soft tissue function. The measures are objective and quantitative, and they provide a more
      precise diagnosis of facial soft tissue disability and evaluation of surgical outcomes. The
      main goal of this prospective, observational study is to determine the applicability of these
      novel 3D dynamic and static measures for quantification and measurement of impairment and
      disfigurement, as well as change over time, in patients with facial paralysis. The global
      hypothesis is that the use of the measures will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the
      severity of facial paralysis and the changes over time (recovery) when compared with current
      assessment methods.
