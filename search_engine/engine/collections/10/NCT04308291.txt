    
      Local, post-market, non-interventional, prospective, single-arm, multi-center study of
      patients pediatric and adult.

      The study is conducted according to the same schedule as the routine follow-up of patients:

        1. RUN-IN PHASE: Subject will start a run-in phase in an out of hospital setting, as per
           standard practice of the site. The objective of the run-in phase is to train the
           subjects on the MiniMed™ 780G insulin pump, assess subjects' compliance and ability to
           comprehend the study procedures and tolerance of wearing the sensor and transmitter
           continuously. It is expected that during the run-in phase the MiniMed™ 780G insulin pump
           will be set in Manual mode and all the algorithms are switched off, and baseline
           Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data will be collected. The expected duration of the
           run-in phase is approximately 2 weeks. At the end of the run-in phase the MiniMed™ 780G
           insulin pump will be set in Auto Mode and the date of activation will be collected and
           identified as a start of the study phase. Data from the MiniMed™ 780G insulin pump will
           be uploaded in the CareLink™ as per standard practice, before Auto Mode activation.

        2. 6 AND 12 MONTHS FOLLOW UP: Follow-up visits will be performed according to the therapy
           management standard of care at 6 and 12 months after Auto Mode activation in the study.

      Approximately 300 patients (children and adults) will be enrollment in the study in
      approximately 32 sites in France.
