    
      Develop a registry (list of patients) of patients seen the clinics with motility disorders.
      Motility diagnosis based on billing diagnostic codes are not accurate. Motility diagnosis
      will be made by physicians with specialized in GI Motility, based on clinical consensus of
      diagnostic criteria. The information gathered from the database will be used to help promote
      future clinical research in the GI motility and Neurogastroenterology Unit at Indiana
      University School of Medicine.

      Gastrointestinal motility symptoms are very common. It encompasses a wide range of problems,
      such as dysphagia, heartburn, nausea, emesis, food regurgitation, abdominal distension,
      weight loss, postprandial bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. An accurate diagnosis is
      essential in order to promote cost-effective treatment and future research to benefit
      patients with GI motility disorders

      Specific Aims

        1. Primary Aim: Identification of patients by accurate motility diagnosis

        2. Secondary Aims:

             1. To develop Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measurements in patients with small
                intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)

             2. To develop Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measurements in patients with
                gastroparesis
