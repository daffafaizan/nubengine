      peanut allergy by lowering the risk of anaphylactic reactions (desensitization), and changing
      the peanut-specific immune response in subjects who have peanut allergy (tolerance). This is
      a research study to test stimulation of the immune system to improve peanut allergy. The
      approach the investigators will use for peanut allergy is called desensitization. A person
      becomes desensitized to a food by taking small, increasing amounts of the food to help the
      body become used to the food so that it no longer causes a severe allergic reaction.

      The study also looks at the safety and immune system effects of the investigational study
      product, peanut protein. The word "investigational" means the study product is still being
      tested in research studies and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA).

      This project is designed to study if peanut oral immunotherapy (POIT) will desensitize
      subjects with peanut hypersensitivity by regulating their oral and systemic immune reactivity
      and cause long-term tolerance.
