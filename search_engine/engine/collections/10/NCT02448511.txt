      way of being a powerful oxidant that stimulates the antioxidant system, immunomodulation,
      microbicidal and perhaps other unknown mechanisms. It has largely been regarded as a
      complementary therapy form but with elucidation of it's biological actions and availability
      of reliable ozone generators it may form a novel treatment option for a range of medical
      conditions with ample literature available on wound healing. In this study it was used as an
      adjunct to conventional treatment i.e surgical procedures, antibiotics and wound care. It was
      locally applied as a gas though there are various other routes of administration such as
      major and minor autohematotherapy, intramuscular and intraarticular injections, rectal and
      vaginal insufflation.
