      nausea, vomiting and delayed feeding was proven. However, this study aims to evaluate the
      effect of postoperative systemic rapid onset and short acting dexamethasone followed by a
      tapering dose of oral prednisolone on the aforementioned morbidities and on decreasing the
      duration and costs of hospital stays. patients who were in the waiting list for tonsillectomy
      procedure were screened for medical history and those who comply with the inclusion criteria
      were randomly assigned into two equal groups of 50 patients each. One group was selected to
      receive a single postoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone followed by oral steroids;
      the second group received placebo. Questionnaires investigating postoperative pain, nausea,
      vomiting, and oral intake were answered by patients, parents or guardians where applicable.
