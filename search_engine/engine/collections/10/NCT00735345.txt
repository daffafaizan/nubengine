      low survival prognosis following surgical resection. In studies published to date no positive
      effect upon overall survival could be demonstrated for preoperative chemotherapy or
      chemoradiotherapy. However, patients with a complete remission following preoperative therapy
      show prolonged survival.

      This study design is based upon decreasing primary tumour and preventing oder delaying
      micrometastases by means of a chemo induction therapy, increasing R0 resection rates and
      preventing local recurrence by means of preoperative chemoradiotherapy, increasing the
      radiosensitivity of tumour cells through treatment combination with cetuximab, surgical
      resection of the locoregional primary tumour or definitive radiochemotherapy in case the
      primary tumour is inoperable.

      The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a 3-staged
      therapy approach including an EGFR antibody in the treatment of patients with potentially
      resectable esophageal cancer, as well as the evaluation of objective response rates to this
      preoperative therapy.
