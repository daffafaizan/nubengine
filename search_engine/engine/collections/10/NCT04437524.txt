      on the symptoms of the disease and the superiority of the two exercise models in patients
      with fibromyalgia syndrom (FMS), 62 women who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly
      divided into two groups. Aerobic exercise group (n = 26) and balance-proprioception exercise
      group (n = 26) will be applied for 3 weeks a week, 6 days a week under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist in the exercise laboratory of the Istanbul Medical Faculty Sports Medicine
      Department. Pain (VAS), functional status (FÄ°Q) and knee extension muscle strength (Cybex
      isokinetic dynamometer) will be evaluated before and after the program. Cognitive status will
      be evaluated with standardized Mini Mental Test only before the program.
