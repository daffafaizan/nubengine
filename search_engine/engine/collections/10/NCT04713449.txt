      cancer-free will be recruited via the New Jersey State Cancer Registry or the Cancer Registry
      of Greater California and randomly assigned to ES or Springboard Beyond Cancer. Participants
      will complete measures at baseline, 2, and 6-months post-baseline. The investigators will
      also complete a process evaluation of Empowered Survivor.
