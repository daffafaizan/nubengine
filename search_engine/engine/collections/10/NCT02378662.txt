    
      This is a Phase II, open-label study. Each patient will receive targeted dose of
      Erythropoietin (EPO) delivered via TARGTEPO.

      The targeted doses will be determined according to 2 cohorts as follows: Group A (18-25
      IU/Kg/day), Group B (35-45 IU/Kg/day). The objective is to evaluate safety and biologic
      activity of TARGTEPO treatment when maintaining Hb levels within the target range of 9-12
      g/dl. Biological activity assessments will include duration of TARGTEPO secretion as measured
      by serum EPO levels above baseline.
