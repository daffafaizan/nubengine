      Primary

        -  Determine whether treatment with radiotherapy involving a high biological dose with
           limited treatment volume (using stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] techniques)
           achieves acceptable primary tumor control (i.e., ≥ 90% at 2 years) in patients with
           resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether treatment with radiotherapy involving a high biological dose with
           limited treatment volume (using SBRT techniques) achieves acceptable treatment-related
           toxicity.

        -  Estimate the disease-free survival and the overall survival rate at 2 years.

        -  Observe patterns of failure in the first 2 years.

        -  Assess the level of comorbidity burden on morbidity and efficacy.

        -  Determine if blood markers prior to, during the course of treatment (between the second
           and the last dose of SBRT), and at the first follow-up after SBRT predict 2-year primary
           tumor control and predict for grade ≥ 2 treatment-related toxicities

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy over 14 days. Patients with
      disease progression undergo surgical resection as salvage local therapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years and then annually thereafter.
