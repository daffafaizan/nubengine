    
      This is a multi-centre randomised trial of prophylactic ciprofloxacin (10mg/kg BD,
      enteral/IV) versus standard of care during the neutropenic period of induction (with an
      internal pilot study) in patients aged 1-17 years with de-novo ALL treated on ALLTogether-1.
      Exclusion criteria include: patients with Down syndrome (who already receive ciprofloxacin
      prophylaxis), contraindication to fluoroquinolones, non-consent to ALLTogether-1 or CiproPAL.
      AMR of colonising organisms will be assessed with stool or peri-rectal swab cultures
      performed at five timepoints within the first year. Longer term invasive infection AMR
      monitoring will include sensitivity testing of all organisms isolated in confirmed infection
      for the duration of ALLTogether-1.

      The primary outcome is the rate of sterile site bacterial infections during induction,
      evaluated by intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes include rates of febrile
      episodes, febrile neutropenia, severe infection and infection-related death; rates of AMR;
      antibiotic exposure; secondary infections; and quinolone side effects. A model-based health
      economic analysis will be undertaken. Using a conservative effect estimate of 40% reduction
      in bacteraemia (i.e. a reduction from 15% to 9%) 1052 patients randomised 1:1 gives 85% power
      with a 5% 2-sided alpha.
