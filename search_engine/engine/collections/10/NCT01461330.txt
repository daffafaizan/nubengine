      patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Secondary objectives are: Assess whether the
      prescription of a DASH-type diet and encouragement for physical activity through use of
      pedometers, can improve blood pressure control in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      hypertension resistant to treatment.

      Forty type 2 diabetic with resistant hypertension outpatients were included in a randomized
      clinical trial: treatment 1- DASH diet + encouragement for physical activity through use of
      pedometer; treatment 2- ADA diet + usual exercises. The duration of each treatment are four
      weeks. The patients included should have performed Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring
      (ABPM) to exclude white-coat effect, ie when there are abnormal in the measurement of office
      blood pressure (equal to or above 140/90 mm Hg) and normal blood pressure by ABPM during the
      awake period (equal to or below 135/85 mm Hg). Twenty-four hour records with concurrent 24h
      urinary collections (protein intake estimative), clinical and laboratory evaluation were
      performed at baseline and after 4 weeks. Serum fatty acids were measured in total lipids by
      gas chromatography.
