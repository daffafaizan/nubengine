      I. Determine if micro-ultrasound (US) can be used to identify prostate cancer foci with
      equivalent (non-inferior) performance relative to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging
      (mpMRI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine if micro-US can be used to contour prostate cancer foci with equivalent
      (non-inferior) accuracy to mpMRI.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine if ex vivo micro-US images have quality comparable to in vivo micro-US images.

      QUATERNARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine if micro-US can be used to evaluate suspicion of extracapsular extension (ECE)
      with equivalent (non-inferior) accuracy to mpMRI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients may undergo transrectal micro-ultrasound scan (TRUS) prior to standard-of-care
      radical prostatectomy. Following radical prostatectomy, removed glands are scanned and
      micro-US, standard of care mpMRI, and whole mount images are analyzed and compared.
