    
      Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ocular AAV-RS1 vector
      (AAV8-scRS/IRBPhRS) gene transfer to the retina of participants affected with X-linked
      juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS).

      Study Population: Male participants affected with XLRS will receive ocular gene transfer. A
      maximum of up to 24 participants may be enrolled.

      Design: This is a Phase I/IIa, prospective, dose escalation, single-center study. One eye of
      each participant will receive the AAV-RS1 gene vector application by intravitreal injection.
      Participants will be closely monitored in conjunction with DSMC oversight. Participants will
      be followed for 18 months after which they will continue to be followed for up to 15 years
      after enrollment, or per FDA requirements, for further safety analysis.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the safety of ocular AAV-RS1 vector as determined
      from assessment of retinal function, ocular structure and occurrence of adverse events and
      laboratory tests. Secondary outcomes include changes in visual function, electroretinogram
      (ERG) responses, visual field measurements, retinal imaging with optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), and the formation of anti-AAV and anti-RS1 antibodies.

      Statistics: No formal sample size calculations are used in this Phase I/IIa dose-escalation
      study.
