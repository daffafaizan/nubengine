      A treatment diary will increase the patient's awareness of which spasticity symptoms are
      significant and can enable the patients to evaluate the treatment more easily.

      This will result in more relevant treatment goals. At the same time the treatment can be
      better addressed to the individual patient at routine controls. In addition, the treatment
      diary will result in closer cooperation between the physiotherapists and occupational
      therapists and the physician who administers the botulinum toxin. This collaboration is
      expected to lead to better common goals and optimization of treatment.

      Finally, it is expected that the above will help to increase the patient's quality of life.
