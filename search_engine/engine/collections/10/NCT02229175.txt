        -  Group 1: Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) will be administered at the first 3 monthly
           visits and subvisible laser treatment will be administered at the first visit. The the
           patient will undergo monthly visits, as he/she would with standard of care treatment,
           allowing for retreatment with monthly IVB and laser treatment every 3 months if defined
           retreatment criteria are met, as determined by a physician.

        -  Group 2: Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) will be administered at the first 3 monthly
           visits. The patient will then undergo monthly exams, as he or she would with standard of
           care treatment, allowing for retreatment with monthly IVB if defined retreatment
           criteria are met, as determined by a physician. The patient may also undergo sham laser
           treatment (he/she will be placed in front of laser but no laser will be activated) so
           that the patient isn't made aware of which treatment group he/she is a part of.

      Other data that will be collected throughout the study at monthly examinations:

        -  Monthly Snellen Visual acuity test

        -  Monthly spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging using standard
           clinic protocol monthly

        -  Standard clinic diabetic montage Fundus photos at months 0,6,12

        -  Fluorescein angiography at months 0, 6, 12

      The subjects' visit schedules will be the same as for routine standard of care for the IVB
      injection procedure. There are no additional appointments for this study.

      All study procedures will be done at San Francisco General Hospital
