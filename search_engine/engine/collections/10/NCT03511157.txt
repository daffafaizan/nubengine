      distance in patients with intermittent claudication. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a
      circulatory condition in which large supply blood vessels narrow, reducing oxygen and
      nutrient distribution to peripheral tissues. IPC protects against tissue damage caused by
      ischemia and can improve functional capacity in patients recovering from stroke; however, the
      benefit of ischemic preconditioning in patients with peripheral arterial disease remains
      unclear.

      The investigators predict that ischemic preconditioning (IPC) will delay claudication onset
      time (COT), increase peak walking time (PWT) and improve muscle strength in patients with
      intermittent claudication.

      The investigators will determine whether IPC improves claudication onset time (COT) and peak
      walking time (PWT) in patients with intermittent claudication. A motorized treadmill will be
      employed to assess COT and PWT.

      The investigators will determine whether IPC can improve muscle strength and time to pain
      onset in the affected leg of patients with intermittent claudication. These metrics will be
      assessed quantitatively using a Biodexâ„¢ dynamometer.
