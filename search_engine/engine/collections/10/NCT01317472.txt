      pharyngeal probe results, after LPR patients are treated for two months with once-daily (QAM)
      Kapidex versus placebo.Forty patients with pharyngeal pH probe-documented LPR and an elevated
      reflux symptom index (RSI) (â‰¥14) will be enrolled into a double-blinded placebo controlled
      study. Twenty patients will receive Kapidex once daily, while twenty receive placebo.
      Patients will return at two months for evaluation with repeat RSI documentation and repeat
      pharyngeal pH probe testing. Student t-test will be used to determine if the change in RSI
      and pH-probe results differs between the study and placebo group.
