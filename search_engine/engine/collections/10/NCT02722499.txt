      greater risk for complications and death compared to White Americans. HbA1c is the primary
      marker for glycemic control and is a strong independent predictor of development of
      complications and increased mortality in T2DM. Key self-care behaviors that influence
      glycemic control (and HbA1c) include diet, physical activity, self-monitoring of blood
      glucose and medication adherence. Systematic review of multiple RCTs show that self-care
      interventions that include diabetes education and skills training are effective in improving
      metabolic control in diabetes. Recent findings indicate that patients with diabetes,
      especially ethnic minority patients, prefer telephone-delivered diabetes education to group
      visits or internet-based education. Multiple RCTs have documented the effectiveness of
      telephone-delivered self-care interventions in T2DM.

      The overarching aim of this proposal is test the efficacy of three financial incentive
      structures in combination with technology intensified diabetes education and skills training
      intervention on blood pressure and quality of life in AAs with T2DM. 60 AAs with T2DM will be
      randomized to three groups with varying frequency of financial incentives: 1) High Frequency:
      financial incentives for weekly uploads plus average glucose, incentives for weekly
      attendance to educational sessions, and incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c
      goals 2) Moderate Frequency: financial incentives for weekly uploads plus average glucose,
      and incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c goals, and 3) Low Frequency:
      financial incentives at the end of the study for meeting HbA1c goals.
