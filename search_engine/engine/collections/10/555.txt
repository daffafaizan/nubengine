study of phosphate excretion by the stop-flowtechniquem. de myttenaerethe stop-flow technique has been applied to the dog in an attempt torule out tubular secretion of phosphate and to locate the site of action ofparathyroid hormone (p.t.h.) on the renal tubule.  under the experimentalconditions used, no significant inward transtubular movement of p32 could bedemonstrated, ruling out tubular secretion of phosphate.  stop-flowexperiments performed in parathyroidectomized dogs before and after p.t.h.administration demonstrated inhibition of phosphorus reabsorption by thehormone.  in addition, the stop-flow pattern indicated that thisphenomenon took place mainly in the distal part of the proximal tubules.
