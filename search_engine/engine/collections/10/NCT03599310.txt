    
      Advance care planning (ACP) is defined as a communication process among patients, their
      family members and healthcare providers about end-of-life care, before the patients lose
      their capacity to decide for themselves. The main purpose of this study is to embed ACP into
      the usual care process in acute hospital setting through building staff capacity to conduct
      ACP. This will be a 24-month stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial, with
      randomization built into the phasing of intervention implementation. This crossover design
      enables all study venues sequentially switched from control to experimental. This study will
      be conducted in all eight wards of the medical department of an 800-bed acute hospital. The
      ACP in this study is a facilitator-based intervention with a structured communication guide
      as a tool to aid the interventionists in broaching end-of-life care issues and eliciting
      patients' values and preferences in a consistent manner. The primary study outcome is the
      documentation of ACP discussion in medical records. Secondary outcomes are communicating
      end-of-life care preferences with family carers, quality of life and concordance of care
      preferences and treatment provided. Data collection will be conducted at baseline, one week,
      three months and six months after intervention.
