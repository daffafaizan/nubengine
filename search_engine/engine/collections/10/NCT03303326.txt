      sexuality as well as unwanted sexual experiences can impact physical and psychological
      health; yet no studies have examined sexual health among Arab American women in the U.S.
      These women face the task of negotiating their heritage culture and the American culture in
      which they reside. This may result in bicultural identity conflict for some women as they try
      to negotiate these two identities, which may have implications for sexuality and sexual
      health due to the two cultures' disparate views on sexuality. Confidential discussion of
      these sensitive topics with a knowledgeable interviewer may yield beneficial effects.

      The overall goal of the current study is to fill the gap in the literature on Arab American
      sexual health by examining how sexual health is related to physical and psychological health.
      This will be accomplished using both: a) correlational findings about sexual, physical, and
      psychological health from information gathered through self-report questionnaires and a
      60-minute women's health interview; and b) an experimental test of the effects of the women's
      health interview on physical and psychological health. A sample of young adult Arab American
      women will be assessed at baseline via questionnaires for various constructs (sexual
      attitudes, cultural and religious identity, and physical and mental health), and then
      randomized to either an immediate or delayed health interview, with a 5-week follow-up
      reassessment.

      It is hypothesized that lower sexual well-being, negative sexual self-schemas, and unwanted
      sexual experiences will correlate with more somatic and psychological health symptoms and
      lower satisfaction with life. It is also hypothesized that participants who have the
      immediate interview will report greater reduction in somatic and psychological symptoms and a
      greater willingness to discuss sexual health with medical providers compared to participants
      who are not interviewed (i.e., have a delayed interview after follow-up assessment).
