      malignancies, it is generally limited for treating tumors larger than 2 cm in diameter with a
      sufficient tumor-free margin. Thus, various strategies are employed to create a sufficient
      ablation zone such as internally cooled-electrodes, expandable electrodes and adaptation of
      switching mono/bipolar controllers. Despite that these attempts have created larger ablative
      zones in clinical and preclinical studies, the efficacy should be validated in terms of
      clinical outcome.

      In this study, investigators evaluated the therapeutic outcomes and safety of RFA using
      separable clustered electrodes for treatment-naive hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in
      comparison with RFA using multiple internally-cooled electrodes. The study group is a
      subgroup of our prospective study cohort (NCT02683538) and a control group is a matched
      historical group received RFA in our institution using multiple internally-cooled electrodes.
