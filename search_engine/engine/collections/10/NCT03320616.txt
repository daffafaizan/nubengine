    
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 4-way crossover study.

      A total of 14 chronic HBV subjects will participate. Subjects will receive 4 single dose
      administrations of EYP001a during the study. There will be 2 separate dosing periods: 1
      period with 2 single administrations of EYP001a in the morning, once under fasted conditions
      and once under fed condition (separated by 48.5 hours), and 1 period with 2 single
      administrations of EYP001a in the evening, once under fasted conditions and once under fed
      condition (separated by 48.5 hours).

      The subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences:

        -  Sequence 1: Period 1 first dose morning fasted, second dose morning fed; Period 2 first
           dose evening fasted, second dose evening fed.

        -  Sequence 2: Period 1 first dose evening fasted, second dose evening fed; Period 2 first
           dose morning fasted, second dose morning fed.

        -  Sequence 3: Period 1 first dose morning fed, second dose morning fasted; Period 2 first
           dose evening fed, second dose evening fasted.

        -  Sequence 4: Period 1 first dose evening fed, second dose evening fasted; Period 2 first
           dose morning fed, second dose morning fasted.

      Participation will include an eligibility screening period of maximally 40 days, clinic stay
      during the treatment periods, and a followup visit 4 to 6 days after the last study drug
      administration.

      The safety and tolerability of EYP001a will be assessed by evaluating vital signs, ECGs,
      liver ultrasound, clinical laboratory and adverse events.
