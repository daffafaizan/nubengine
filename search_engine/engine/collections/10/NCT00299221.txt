    
      This was a prospective, randomized, controlled (open-label) trial of 2 different strategies
      of immunosuppression in de novo post-heart transplant patients. The hypothesis was that
      immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, coupled with rapid steroid
      weaning would provide similar anti-rejection efficacy as tacrolimus with only a 2 week course
      of mycophenolate mofetil but including the same rapid steroid wean.

      The primary endpoint was the mean International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation
      (ISHLT) biopsy score over the first 6 months post-transplant. Secondary endpoints included
      the incidence of adverse events over the first year post-transplant, as well as all-cause
      mortality, 12 month ISHLT biopsy score (mean), along with the incidence of proven
      cytomegalovirus disease. In addition, the incidence of allograft vasculopathy as assessed by
      angiography or intravascular ultrasound was compared between groups.
