      therapies will be quantified using PSMA-based PET imaging using a novel agent,18F-DCFPyL, as
      a non-invasive imaging biomarker of tumor neovasculature to functionally monitor renal cell
      cancer neovasculature in patients undergoing systemic anti-angiogenesis therapy. PSMA PET
      will be compared with response to anti-angiogenesis therapy using conventional imaging
      computed tomography(CT)-based RECIST1.1 criteria as well as histopathological endpoints
      (tumor vascular density, immunohistochemical staining for PSMA and neovascularization
      (cluster of differentiation(CD)105, CD31). Whole body PSMA PET/CT scans will be obtained at
      baseline, following adjuvant anti- angiogenic therapy and when the patient becomes refractory
      to treatment.

      The rationale and time points for obtaining PET scans is planned with respect to the typical
      natural history of metastatic RCC. This project will obtain information from tumors that are
      responding to anti-angiogenesis therapy and those resistant to treatment.
