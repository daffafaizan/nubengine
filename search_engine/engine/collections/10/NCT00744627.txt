      to treat anxiety in adults who have general anxiety disorder (GAD). This study looked at GAD
      relief in people who took vortioxetine.

      The study enrolled 301 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient
      and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 5 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a capsule that looked like the study drug but
           had no active ingredient.

      All participants were asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Europe. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 13 weeks. Participants made 7 visits to the clinic, and were contacted by
      telephone 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
