      and chemotherapy treatments. For patients with tumors with low oxygen levels, it is not well
      known if higher radiation doses can overcome treatment resistance to radiation. Currently,
      there are limited ways of measuring tumor oxygen levels. The investigators believe that
      measuring tumor oxygen levels during the brachytherapy procedure will allow the investigators
      to develop better and improved oxygen measurement techniques, and ultimately improve clinical
      outcomes for patients, such as better local tumor control.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, meaning that this is the first time investigators are
      examining the oxygen sensor being used. This study is designed to test the oxygen sensor's
      ability to measure the oxygen levels within the participant's cervical tumor with the aid of
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. MRI scans use magnets to make detailed images of the
      participant's tumor and the surrounding normal tissues during the brachytherapy procedure.
