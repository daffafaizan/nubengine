      the feasibility phase, the first cohort (cohort 1A) will receive only 1 course of the
      immunotherapy doublet followed by a single dose of Durvalumab (Figure 1). The 2nd cohort
      (Figure 1, cohort 2A) will open for inclusion if 5 to 6 out of 6 patients complete CIT-CRT
      according to the safety rules (paragraph 6.1.3). In next cohort two courses of Tremelimumab
      and Durvalumab will be administered. The expansion cohort will be opened (Figure 1, cohort
      2B) if this is well tolerated. Patients will be enrolled for cohort 1B in case < 5 out of 6
      patients complete CIT-CRT in cohort 2A.
