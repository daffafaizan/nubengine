    
      2A Pharma's AAVLP-HPV vaccine candidate is based on AAVLPs with insertion of sequences of the
      L2 minor HPV capsid protein. The vaccine's intended clinical use is as a vaccine for
      prophylaxis against HPV infection in adolescents and adults.

      This is a 12 month single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated
      dose, safety, tolerability, and immunological effect study. Twenty (20) healthy, adult male
      and female subjects will be enrolled with a minimum of 40% of each gender. Sixteen (16)
      subjects will be randomized to receive the active drug and 4 subjects to receive the placebo.
      At least 1 subject of each gender will be randomized to receive the placebo.

      Subjects will receive a total of 3 doses of AAVLP-HPV or placebo: a prime on Day 1, and two
      boosts, one on Day 57 (±2 days) and one on Day 180 (±1 week). The volunteers will be followed
      until day 365 (±1 week) when they return for the final safety and serum-based immunogenicity
      and neutralising antibodies assessment.
