      cephalo-medullary nail is the cut-out of the cephalic screw from femoral head resulting in a
      protrusion of this screw in the coxo-femoral joint, mostly during the first 6 months after
      the operation. In most cases, the surgeon has to remove the primary implant and perform a
      total hip arthroplasty to his patient, therefore rising the morbidity and social costs linked
      to the treatment of the initial fracture.

      Baumgartner showed the importance of the position of the cephalic screw for predicting
      failure of the implant and proposed a new measurement to evaluate this position, the tip-apex
      distance which is the sum of the distance from the tip of the cephalic screw to the apex of
      the femoral head on an anteroposterior radiograph and this distance on a lateral radiograph,
      after controlling for magnification. He showed a lower TAD was associated with a lower risk
      of cut-out.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the help of a 3D reconstruction software linked to the
      standard fluoroscopy in achieving the lowest TAD and therefore minimizing the cut-out rate.
