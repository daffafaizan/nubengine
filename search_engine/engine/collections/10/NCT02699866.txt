      study. The total study duration for each patient should be 12 ± 1 months.

      Straumann BLT implants Ø 2.9 mm will be placed in central and lateral incisors in the
      mandible and lateral incisors in the maxilla for single tooth replacement, followed by
      provisional prosthetic loading after 6 ± 2 weeks and by final prosthetic loading 4 ± 1 months
      after implant placements.

      In total 7 visits per patient are scheduled in this study. Implant survival, PES, implant
      success, bone level changes and adverse events (AEs) will be assessed.

      The investigational device is a CE-(Conformité Européenne, meaning European Conformity)
      marked product. Straumann BLT implants Ø 2.9 mm Roxolid SLActive (sand blasted, large grit,
      acid etched surface) are available in lengths of 10, 12 and 14 mm.

      Four centers in Germany will participate. The study and any amendments will be performed as
      far as possible according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14155 and
      conform to the Declaration of Helsinki (last revision Fortaleza 2013) and local legal and
      regulatory requirements.
