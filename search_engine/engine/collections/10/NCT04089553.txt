    
      This is an open-label Phase II modular study in patients with prostate cancer which will
      assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AZD4635 in combination with other therapeutic
      agents in different treatment arm (referred to as modules).

      Combinations to be studied include: 1) Module 1: AZD4635 plus durvalumab; 2) Module 2:
      AZD4635 plus oleclumab; 3) Module 3 (if conducted): AZD4635 plus durvalumab plus oleclumab.
      The protocol may be amended to include other combinations.

      All patients will be allocated into a module using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).
      Randomization will occur when patients meet eligibility criteria for two or more modules that
      are currently recruiting. If patients only meet the criteria for one currently recruiting
      module, they will be allocated to that module without randomization taking place.

      The primary objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of each combination
      therapy by: 1) assessing the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with measurable
      disease [response will be determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST
      1.1)]; 2) assessing the PSA confirmed response rate of each combination therapy (PSA
      confirmed response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with a reduction in the
      PSA level of â‰¥50% measured from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result measured
      twice, at least 3 weeks apart by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria PCWG3).

      The safety endpoints include assessment of adverse events and serious adverse events,
      physical examinations, vital signs, and collection of clinical chemistry/hematology
      parameters

      There will be approximately 30 PSA evaluable patients in each module, and at least 20
      patients will have RECIST measurable disease at baseline in each module. If any of the
      required patients for PSA and/or ORR are not evaluable for PSA response or tumor response,
      respectively, they may be replaced at the sponsor's discretion.
