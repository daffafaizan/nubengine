      cumulative incidences of failures in participants who undergo a second aqueous shunt (SAS) to
      those cumulative incidences of failures in participants who undergo transscleral diode laser
      cyclophotocoagulation (TLC) for eyes with uncontrolled glaucoma with a single existing
      aqueous tube shunt procedure.
