      perform work, care for him/herself and ultimately leads to physical disability. There is a
      high caregiver burden associated with dementia and many individuals require care in a
      long-term care facility. There is some emerging evidence that music based interventions may
      have a protective effect on the brain in those with dementia. There is also evidence that
      doing activities that engage the brain through music are beneficial. This study seeks to
      investigate the potential benefits of a music based intervention for individuals with
      dementia. The study aims to recruit individuals with a diagnosis of dementia. Once enrolled
      participants will undergo assessment of walking, balance and cognition and then be asked to
      participate either in a dance class or to listen to live music. After 6 weeks and again at
      the end of the study (after 12 weeks) participants will undergo assessments of walking,
      balance and cognition.
