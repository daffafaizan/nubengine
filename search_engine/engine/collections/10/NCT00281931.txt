        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients with B-cell
           prolymphocytic leukemia treated with immunochemotherapy comprising fludarabine,
           cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive fludarabine IV and cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-3. Patients also receive
      rituximab IV on day 0 in course 1 and on day 1 in courses 2-6. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 6 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study.
