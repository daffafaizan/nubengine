      mellitus (DM). Both OSA and DM are highly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. There is growing evidence that OSA may trigger or worsen pre-existing adverse
      metabolic profile indicative of cardiovascular risk. Treatment of OSA with nasal Continuous
      Positive Airway Pressure (nCPAP) has been shown to reduce blood pressure and hence to reduce
      the risk of atherogenesis. In patients with DM, the therapeutic effect of nCPAP is still not
      known, it would be important to delineate any independent effect of OSA on DM and the
      therapeutic effect of nCPAP on glycemic control to reduce the long term risk of macrovascular
      and microvascular complications.
