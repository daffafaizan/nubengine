      available will be screened for the eligibility. Patients will be screened within 28 days
      prior to the first dose of CAL056 mesylate. Eligible patients will receive CAL056 mesylate
      daily with the assigned dose level for 28 days (Day 1 to Day 28) for each treatment cycle.
      Patients will be administered with CAL056 mesylate at clinical site at scheduled visits (i.e.
      Day 1/Visit 1, Day 8/Visit 2, Day 15/ Visit 3, Day 22/Visit 4, Day 28/Visit 5). Remaining
      doses of CAL056 mesylate on all other days will be self-administered by patients at home.
      After the administration of CAL056 mesylate on Day 1 and Day 28, patients can stay at the
      clinical site for 24 hours to have safety monitoring and blood samples collected for PK
      analysis.

      Only patients completing Cycle 1 without a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or disease
      progression will be allowed to continue the subsequent cycles at the same dose level. The
      maximum number of dosing cycle is 6 cycles in each patient in this study. Continuation of
      using CAL056 mesylate may be permitted after the evaluation of the risk/benefit in individual
      patient by the Investigators and with the approval of Calgent.

      During the Cycle 1 of study period, a total of 5 visits are scheduled to evaluate the safety,
      PK, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of CAL056 mesylate. Each visit is planned on
      Day 1 of each subsequent cycle if patients continue the treatment of CAL056 mesylate. After
      the end treatment of CAL056 mesylate, an end of treatment (EOT) visit and a safety follow-up
      visit will be scheduled.
