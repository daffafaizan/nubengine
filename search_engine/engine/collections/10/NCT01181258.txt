    
      This is a single center phase II trial designated to expand donor NK cells and induce
      remissions in patients with refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) using chemotherapy followed by haploidentical NK cells and IL2.

      Primary Objective is to evaluate the objective response rate (PR+CR) at 2 months post
      haploidentical NK cell infusion in patients with refractory Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      Secondary Objective is to 1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy, rituximab, and methylprednisone as determined by incidence of serious adverse
      events; 2) evaluate in vivo expansion of allogeneic donor NK cells at day 14; 3) determine
      time to progression

      Exploratory Objective is to 1) correlate clinical response with frequencies of peripheral
      blood T reg cells after chemotherapy; 2) correlate clinical response with donor KIR-B-content
      score determined by genotype; 3) monitor phenotypic and functional characteristics of natural
      killer cells and regulatory T cells in vivo; 4) correlate clinical response with donor FcR
      polymorphism.

        -  Pre-NK cell infusion chemotherapeutic regimen consist of 1) Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV weekly
           x 4, start day -7; 2) Fludarabine 25 mg/m2 IV day -6 through day -2; 3) Cyclophosphamide
           60mg/kg IV day -5; 4) Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg day -2 through day +9.

        -  NK cell infusion using IL2 activated donor NK cells 1.5 to 8 x 107 cells/kg IV day 0

        -  IL2 SC 9 million IU every other day x 6 doses over 2 weeks begin 1 to 24 hours after NK
           cell infusion. If weight < 45 kilograms, give IL-2 at 5 million units/m2 on same
           schedule

      Accrual Goal: Up to 17 patients will be enrolled
