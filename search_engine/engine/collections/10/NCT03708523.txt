      gland, which usually causing further hypopituitarism and hormone recovery. In order to
      prevent the potential applications of adrenal cortical malfunction after the surgery, many
      medical centers will use glucocorticoid supplements during the perioperative period care.
      However, this treatment might expose the normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
      function patients into potential threats after the treatment of glucocorticoid supplements,
      such as bone loss, hypertension, emotional distress, and weight gain. To avoid unnecessary
      supply of glucocorticoids, the key question is to monitor the pituitary function. Thus, in
      this study we try to predict the morning postoperative cortisol levels, for further
      prediction of the postoperative pituitary function. To do so, we will review the
      retrospective charts of transsphenoidal adenomectomied patients from January, 2013 to April,
      2018 in the NTUH Taipei. Use statistical methods analyzing all sorts of medical reports,
      including perioperative hormone thresholds.This study tried to highlight the predictive value
      of the morning postoperative cortisol levels, which can act as the prognosis value of the
      postoperative pituitary function, providing future medication advices for improving patients'
      safety of drugs.
