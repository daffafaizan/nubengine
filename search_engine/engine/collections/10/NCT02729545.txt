      with polycystic ovarian syndrome, but until now there is no definite evidence to indicate
      acupuncture could play the same role in improving ovarian function. So we design this study
      to observe the change of follicular development, ovary size and sex hormone( testosterone,
      follitropin, luteinizing hormone) before and after the treatment, and evaluate the efficacy
      and safty of acupuncture.
