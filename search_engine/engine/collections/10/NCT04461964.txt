      Image Guided Surgery (MvIGS) spine navigation system for treatment of spinal stenosis,
      scoliosis, and spondylolisthesis that requires fusion. This is a single-arm, open-label
      study. All participants will undergo their single and multi-level posterior spine fusion
      surgery using bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation under MvIGS intraoperative navigation
      guidance.
