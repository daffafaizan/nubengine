    
      Patients aged 18-65 years undergoing bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Patients were randomly
      divided into two groups with closed envelope to perform tumescent anesthesia and erector
      spinae block.

      All patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/ kg preoperatively. All patients
      received standard general anesthesia protocol as induction with 2-3 mg/kg iv propofol and
      1-1.5 mcg/kg fentanyl and 0.6 mg/kg iv rocuronium. Endotracheal intubations were performed
      7.0 or 7.5 endotracheal tubes with the patient in a supine position. Anesthesia maintenance
      was with sevoflurane 0.5/kg/mg remifentanil infusion and in a 50% O2 -50% air mixture.
      Standard monitoring of the patients included of heart rate, invasive systolic, diastolic and
      mean blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation and the operating times were recorded.

      At approximately 30 minutes before the end of surgery, 8mg dexketoprofen IV was administered
      to all patients. At the end of the operation, all the patients were performed with iv
      PCA(Patient Controlled Analgesia).

      Demographic data such as age, weight, and height of the patients were recorded. After
      patients informed about pain score NRS (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) and patient satisfaction
      score ( one to ten) recorded by the nurse of PACU and ward.
