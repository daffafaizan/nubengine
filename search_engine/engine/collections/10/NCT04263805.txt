      However, several environmental factors might influence their research practice. In this
      study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of research climate on PhD students'
      research practice (exposure to an environment where their peers commit a detrimental
      practice).

      Objective: To evaluate the impact of research climate on PhD students' research practice

      Design: A randomized controlled trial

        1. Intervention: Participants will be shown two case vignettes describing dilemma
           situations in research reported with and without research climate factor.

        2. Participants: The participants will be PhD students in all biomedical disciplines.

        3. Sample size will be 300 participants

        4. Primary outcome: In each vignette, participants will have to indicate which solution
           they prefer on a semantic differential scale, rated from - 5 to -1 (preference for
           solution A) and from 1 to 5 (preference for solution B). Participants will be forced to
           make a choice between the 2 solutions. The primary outcome will be the mean preference
           score.
