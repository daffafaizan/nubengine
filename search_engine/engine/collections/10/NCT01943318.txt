      baseline clinical laboratory data. Biological tests, endoscopy,liver ultrasonography
      (including ARFI) and hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements will be performed if not
      done within 90 days prior to inclusion. During this visit, 20 ml of blood will be collected
      for freezing and storage of serum and plasma, and constitution of a DNA library.

      Monitoring: Patients will have regular surveillance with blood test, liver ultrasonography
      and medical consultation at least every 6 months, periodic assessment of esophageal, gastric
      varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy (every 1 year) and prevention of their rupture if
      any. An additional blood sampling of 20 ml will be taken at baseline and every year in order
      to perform whole blood, serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and DNA libraries;
      Data will be standardized and centralized in a single database.

      And alcoholic liver cirrhosis patients will undergo liver biopsy for polymerase chain
      reaction, western blot, immunohistochemistry and RNA analysis.

      After measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient and liver stiffness at baseline a
      non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB,carvedilol) was initiated and increased stepwise (weekly)
      until the systolic blood pressure remained at>100 mmHg and the heart rate was not <60. The
      maximum target dose for carvedilol 25 mg/day. The hepatic venous pressure gradient response
      to NSBB was again assessed 6 weeks after the intake of carvedilol. A hemodynamic response to
      NSBB treatment was defined as a reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient >=20% compared
      to baseline or to an absolute value <=12 mmHg. Compliance with therapy was monitored by
      monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure during clinical visits.
