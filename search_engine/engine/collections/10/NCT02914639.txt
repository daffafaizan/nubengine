    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, multicenter, Phase I/II clinical study in
      which up to 40 eligible subjects with Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)will
      be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio as follows: SF0166 low dose twice daily
      (BID) or SF0166 high dose BID.

      The study population includes male and female subjects, aged 50 or older, with active
      subfoveal choroidal neovascularization due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) that
      meet the following criteria: â‰¤12 Macular Photocoagulation Study [MPS] disc areas, with
      choroidal neovascularization [CNV] >50% of the total lesion area), retinal or subretinal
      fluid visible on optical coherence tomography (OCT), and no treatment with anti-vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in the study eye within up to 60 days of study
      entry.

      If a subject qualifies in both eyes, SF0166 may be administered to both eyes (study eye and
      non-study eye) at the discretion of the Investigator.

      Study subjects will administer the randomly assigned treatment for 28 days. There is an
      additional 28-day post-treatment follow-up period. All study subjects will return for
      examination every 2 weeks for 8 weeks (2 months).

      All outcomes and assessments will be summarized descriptively for Days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56.
      No formal hypotheses will be tested.
