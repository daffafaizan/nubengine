      is caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene which encodes for 7-dehydrocholesterol-
      Î”7-reductase, an enzyme necessary for the production of cholesterol in the body. Affected
      individuals exhibit multiple malformations and mental retardation. The features of SLOS are
      thought to be primarily related to cholesterol deficiency and accumulation of cholesterol
      precursors. However, the clinical phenotype is not well characterized, the biochemical
      pathogenesis is incompletely understood, and there is no proven therapy for this devastating
      condition. Thus our primary objective is to better define the clinical and biochemical
      phenotypes of the disease using a natural history study design. The study will contribute to
      creating a comprehensive SLOS patient registry, identify biomarkers that can be used for
      diagnostic testing, screening and outcome measures in future therapeutic trials. All patients
      with SLOS receive dietary cholesterol supplementation with the hope that cholesterol
      supplementation will improve the clinical manifestation of the disease. However, there is no
      evidence supporting a clinical benefit of cholesterol supplementation. Thus a secondary
      objective of the study is to determine if cholesterol intake correlates with changes in whole
      body cholesterol homeostasis and clinical end-points.
