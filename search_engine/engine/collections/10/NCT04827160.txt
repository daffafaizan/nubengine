    
      Primary outcome : Characterize different D-dimer trends in COVID-19 patients.

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  Identify the predictive value of different D-dimers trends for thrombosis / all-cause
           mortality / orotracheal intubation during hospitalization

        -  Identify the predictive value of D-dimers at admission for thrombosis / all-cause
           mortality / orotracheal intubation during hospitalization

        -  Identify the predictive value of 1st D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio for thrombosis / all-cause
           mortality / orotracheal intubation during hospitalization
