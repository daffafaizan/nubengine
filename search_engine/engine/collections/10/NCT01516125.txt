      genes that control how fats are processed in the body. Persons with the needed genotypes will
      be added to a database of healthy persons who may be asked to join a larger study comparing
      differences in diet on lipid metabolism and inflammatory biomarkers as well as future
      studies. A key hypothesis for the larger study is that variations in genes involved in lipid
      metabolism play a role in determining levels of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (LC-PUFAs).
