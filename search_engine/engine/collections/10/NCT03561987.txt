      such as Diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, liver disease, arterial hypertension, obstructive
      apnea and cardiovascular risk. However this does not happen in all obese patients, even when
      there is a weight reduction.

      It is known that the adipose tissue is actively involved in synthesis of cytokines and its
      role in metabolic phenotypes has been suggested. It is possible that the intrinsic mechanisms
      of adipose tissue participate in several benefits observed in morbidly obese patients who
      undergo to an anti-obesity surgery.

      So this study explores the involvement of adipose tissue as an active component, which can
      define metabolic phenotypes linked to cardiovascular risk modification post bariatric
      surgery.
