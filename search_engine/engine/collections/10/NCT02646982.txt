      placebo in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who also have positive
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) biomarkers. The investigators will assess if blocking the effect of
      Ang II, a crucial mediator of neuro-vascular injury, using angiotensin receptor blockers
      (ARBs) will address shortcomings of current treatment regimens. This study will also assess
      the safety and dose-response of target engagement for treatment with escalating doses of
      candesartan.
