      investigators measured the physiological responses of bodies after acute and chronic exposure
      to playing AVG. The investigators established a significant difference in skin conductance
      before beginning the intervention between the virtual and actual game. After the
      intervention, the experimental group had a significantly higher average value of heart rate
      frequency and breathing frequency while playing AVG in comparison to the control group.

      In the second sub-research the investigators measured progress in tennis technique (TRSC
      test), development of gross motor skills and change in reaction time on the same group of
      children. In the TRSC test, the control group improved in all sub-groups with both strokes.
      The experimental group made no improvements in sub-group 3d with the ''forehand'', 1d and 3d
      with the ''backhand''. In the gross motor skill development test the investigators have not
      established a significant interaction effect. In the analogue reaction time measurement test,
      the investigators recorded a significant interaction between time x group. The same goes for
      Simon's test with incongruent stimuli, with congruent the interaction was of no relevance.

      The investigators established that the use of AVG can represent a new strategy for combining
      movement/sports activities and cognitively directed tasks aiming at effective assessment of
      tennis skills.
