      accompanied by psychological and behavioral changes and can result in preoperative anxiety.
      Sometimes, preoperative anxiety can be serious. Furthermore, in the absence of premedication
      for oocyte retrieval, severe degrees of anxiety may occur. Anxiety effects the total
      consumption of analgesic and anesthetic drugs intraoperatively and has a negative impact on
      recovery from anesthesia. In addition, the negative effect of anesthetic agents used on
      fertilization and embryo quality during in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been discussed.
      However, the impact of any of them on fertilization and embryo quality has not been clearly
      determined to date. Studies have reported different results regarding the negative effects of
      anesthetic agents on embryo development and fertilization.
