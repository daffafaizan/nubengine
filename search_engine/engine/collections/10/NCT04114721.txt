      cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR). ETI during CPR has higher risks of failure or delayed
      success with frequent attempts, misplacement of the tube, and prolonged interruptions of
      chest compressions. The main problems associated with ETI relate to the inherently technical
      difficulty in using DL. VL have various advantages of fast learning curve and overall success
      comparing with the DL in non-arrest patients, but there was no known data of learnig curve of
      successful ETI during CPR.

      This study tried to estimate the the appropriate numbers of VL usage for successful ETI at
      first attempt during CPR. So the investigators analyze the success rate, speed, trial number,
      incidence of complications, and hands-off time of ETI using VL which in real clinical
      setting. In addition, this study analyze the residency training term, total number of of VL
      usage using VL at that time.
