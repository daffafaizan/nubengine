    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an evidence-based antidepressant,
      sertraline, in youth (N=120) with generalized, separation and/or social anxiety disorders,
      seeks to evaluate the predictive value of plasma EV signatures. Patients will be randomized
      to sertraline (25-200 mg/day) or placebo (3:1) and total plasma EVs will be collected at
      baseline and serially during the course of the 12-week treatment period.
