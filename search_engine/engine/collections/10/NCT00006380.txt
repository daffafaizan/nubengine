      monoclonal antibody muJ591 in patients with progressive androgen independent prostate cancer.
      II. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics
      of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the human antimouse antibody response in these
      patients to this drug. V. Determine the antitumor effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody muJ591
      (131I-J591). Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody muJ591 IV over 1 hour followed by
      131I-J591 IV over 1 hour. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 131I-J591
      (radioactivity is escalated, monoclonal antibody dose is fixed) until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at weeks 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12, and
      then every 6 months until month 21.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months.
