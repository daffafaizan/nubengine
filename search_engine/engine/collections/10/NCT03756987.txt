      become increasingly popular and gradually becoming the standard of care for lung surgery.
      Although acute pain after VATS is less than the traditional thoracotomy, patients still
      experience moderate amount of pain within the first 24 hours. However, the optimal regional
      analgesic technique for VATS procedures has not been established.

      Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and paravertebral block (PVB) have been tried to improve
      postoperative analgesia after VATS. Although TEA and PVB provides superior analgesia, these
      technologies accompanied by the rare but serious complications involving epidural hematoma,
      pneumothorax and total spinal anesthesia.

      Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a novel and simple ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic
      technique, providing analgesia for the ipsilateral hemithorax. Ultrasound guidance is
      believed to improve peripheral and regional nerve block success rates and safety. ESPB is a
      technically easy to perform. ESPB has only been reported in case series but so far, no
      adverse events such as hypotension, hematoma or infection has been reported.

      Given its safety, ease of performance and efficacy, the study aims to verify the hypothesis
      that combines ESPB with general anesthesia would accelerate functional recovery after breast
      cancer surgery. Our secondary aims were to examine ESPB's effect on analgesic outcomes (e.g.,
      postoperative pain intensity, cumulative opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and
      vomiting, dizziness, the postanesthesia care unit discharge time and patients' satisfaction)
      in patients undergoing VATS.
