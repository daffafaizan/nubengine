      proprietary blend of minerals and nutritional supplements which is patented as "Liquidized
      Infrared Negative Ion Activation Energy". Active ingredients include sodium bicarbonate,
      potassium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, strontium carbonate, gold nanoparticles, calcium,
      germanium, selenium , zinc, sugar and water. When applied to the skin , it has been shown to
      reduce the appearance of wrinkles by stimulation of skin fibroblasts to produce new collagen
      while removing aging dermis cells, facilitate the production of fibrillin proteins and
      protect the skin from ultraviolet rays.
