      placebo. After enrolment, eligible patients will enter a 5-week screening/run in period.
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomised 1:1 at Week 0 (Day 0) to receive
      either placebo or benralizumab 30 mg SC every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses (Weeks 0, 4 and
      8) and every 8 weeks thereafter (Weeks 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48). An end of treatment visit will
      be conducted at Week 56.The first up to 74 patients that complete the 56-week treatment will
      have a 24-week follow-up (FU) period without dosing to assess durability of benefit. These
      patients will have the FU for the final safety assessment at week 80. The remaining patients
      will have a last FU visit 12 weeks after last dose for final safety assessments at week 60.
