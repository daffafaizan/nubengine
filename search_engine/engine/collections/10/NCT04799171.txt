      exercise response variation of the muscle mitochondria in vivo to elucidate the underlying
      mechanisms for the health benefits of exercise training in young, middle aged and older
      adults. This knowledge will improve investigators understanding of biological basis for
      targeted "precision medicine" exercise and non-exercise interventions to improve age related
      conditions. The mitochondrial capacity measurement via non-invasive 31P magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (31-MRS) will provide a tangible link between the two primary foci of the parent
      MoTrPAC study: molecular drivers of exercise response and key phenotypic health outcomes.
