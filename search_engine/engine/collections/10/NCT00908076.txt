      common neurological condition that is clinically defined by rigidity (muscle stiffness),
      bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and tremor. Parkinson's Disease , however, reveals
      numerous non-motor symptoms that have been underemphasized. Problematic symptoms include
      varying degrees of dementia, psychosis, diminished assertiveness and confidence, general
      fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, problems with blood pressure, sweating, and bladder,
      and a common yet difficult to define sense of "not feeling well".

      A commonly missed symptom in Parkinson's patients is constipation. Constipation can be
      difficult to treat with current medications available and many are ineffective. Levodopa and
      dopamine agonists drugs are useful for motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease but have no
      effect on constipation. Laxatives and enemas provide limited relief with bothersome side
      effects. Even fewer drugs have been studied targeting the constipation problem specifically
      in the Parkinson's Disease population. Lubiprostone (AMITIZA) is a new medication that has
      been studied in the general population for the treatment of chronic constipation. It has been
      shown to be a safe and effective medication with few side effects. Lubiprostone has not yet
      been studied in the Parkinson's Disease population. We hope to show that this medication can
      be safe and effective for constipation in PD patients as well.
