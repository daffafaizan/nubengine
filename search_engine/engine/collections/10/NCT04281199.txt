      I. To test whether the investigators can achieve a mean lung dose of < 8 Gy and still treat
      the total body at a minimum of 85% prescribed dose in patients undergoing allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who are eligible for standard total body irradiation
      (TBI)-based myeloablative regimens.

      II. To evaluate TBI coverage from tomotherapy and VMAT with new lung sparing guidelines.

      III. To assess the rate of adverse events with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
      TBI: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration, and complications (acute
      graft versus host disease [GvHD], infections, and delayed neutrophil/platelet engraftment)
      measured by Bearman and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version
      (v)5.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate dose homogeneity for all target and non-target structures using dose volume
      histograms.

      II. To evaluate non-relapse mortality at 100 days, and 1 year post IMRT TBI. III. To evaluate
      relapse-free survival (RFS) at 100 days, and 1 year post IMRT TBI.

      IV. To evaluate extramedullary recurrence rate at 1 year post IMRT TBI.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo TBI using IMRT with VMAT or tomotherapy twice daily (BID) on days -7 to -4
      then undergo stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100 days and 1 year post
      transplant.
