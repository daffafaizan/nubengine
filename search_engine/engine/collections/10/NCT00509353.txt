      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
           when given in combination with fixed-dose irinotecan hydrochloride and vincristine in
           young patients with refractory or relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma.

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicities of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine when
           combined with fixed-dose irinotecan hydrochloride and vincristine.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if there is a therapeutic response to this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine
      (^131I-MIBG).

      Patients receive ^131I-MIBG IV over 1Â½-2 hours on day 1, vincristine IV on days 0 and 7, and
      irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 0-4 and 7-11. Treatment repeats every 56 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.
