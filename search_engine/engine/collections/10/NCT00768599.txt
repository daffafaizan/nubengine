      uncomfortable to the user and messy on clothing and foot wear. A foam formulation that
      spreads easily and rubs-in easily that is as effective as the (reference) cream formulation
      in treating athlete's foot would be a benefit to the user. This study is designed to
      substantiate a clinical bridge between econazole nitrate foam 1% and econazole nitrate cream
      1% based on clinical outcome, safety, and pharmacokinetic data. The study is (foam)
      vehicle-controlled and is randomized 1 to 1 to 1 (foam:cream:vehicle).
