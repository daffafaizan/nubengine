      will include medical history, vital signs, ECG, physical examination and safety blood and
      urine lab tests.

      On the first treatment visit, eligible subjects will undergo pre-dose physical examination
      and vital signs, and a blood sample will be drawn for baseline cellular immunogenicity and
      circulating Interferon gamma (IFN-g). They will then receive an IM injection of either
