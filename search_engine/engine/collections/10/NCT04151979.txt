      invasion. In recent years, the incidence of PAS has increased significantly, and the main
      risk is high hysterectomy rate,massive postpartum hemorrhage, and even maternal mortality in
      women at childbearing age. The research team of Peking university third hospital developed
      the ultrasound rating scale in china at first to conduct preliminary assessment of the PAS
      risk which can identify the severity of cases and guide the junior hospitals to transfer.
      Peking University third hospital is in the leading position in the preoperative diagnosis of
      PAS currently.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a common method for preoperative evaluation for
      sever cases. MRI can provide a map of the placenta and PAS features, like the uterus enlarged
      significantly, the uneven signal intensity , the myometrial discontinuity, and black band on
      T2 image. It has a high diagnostic value. At present, only Lim and Ueno reported MRI scoring
      system for PAS. Due to the small sample size and the limitation of the research methods, a
      widely applicable rating scale has not been established. MRI score system of PAS can reduce
      the subjective difference of the clinician's visual reading, and assist the clinician to
      assess the risk of sever PAS further, and conduct perioperative preparation to reduce the
      risk of maternal morbidity and mortality and achieve a better clinical outcome.
