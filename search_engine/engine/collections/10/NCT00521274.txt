      Trovax is vaccine that targets 5T4 receptors on tumor cells. 5T4 has been detected in the
      majority of primary prostate cancers. Based on pre-clinical and clinical data, it may be
      advantageous to administer a cancer vaccine before chemotherapy to enhance immune responses,
      thus leading to a more therapeutic approach for patients with metastatic androgen independent
      prostate cancer (AIPC).
