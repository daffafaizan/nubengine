      recovery through moderating the metabolic responses to surgery, improving well-being,
      decreasing post-operative insulin resistance and attenuation loss of lean body mass. On other
      hand there are fasting guidelines in place to prevent from pulmonary aspiration. The current
      fasting guidelines of 2hrs for clear fluids come from some small studies performed in healthy
      non-pregnant adults and consensus agreement.

      The aim of the study is to use sequential ultrasound evaluation of the gastric volume to
      determine how long it takes for the stomach of a fasting pregnant woman at term, admitted for
      elective cesarean section, to empty after ingesting a 400ml carbohydrate drink (Nutricia
      preOp - a clear, non-carbonated, lemon flavoured, carbohydrate drink that provides
      0.5kcal/ml).

      Patients who are fasting according to the current guidelines and agree to partake in the
      study will, on the day of their elective LSCS, be given a 400ml carbohydrate drink at least
      2hours before their scheduled theatre time. Patients will then have their gastric volume
      assessed at 15minutes intervals for 2 hours to determine how long it takes for the ingested
      fluid to leave the stomach. The results of the study will give us more information regarding
      gastric emptying in the investigator's patient population and may lead to reduced fasting
      times, increasing patient comfort and improving the patient experience.
