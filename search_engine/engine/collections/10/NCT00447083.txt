      occurs primarily in women, especially women of childbearing age. The effectiveness of
      treatment for this disorder is limited, and alternative medical treatments are commonly used.

      Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure gives a sense of relaxation. It is unknown whether UV
      exposure has any effect on pain, particularly in patients with fibromyalgia. Through studies
      performed with RO3 funding from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), we demonstrated
      that in frequent tanners, appearance is less important than UV-induced relaxation in
      motivating tanning behavior. Moreover, we determined that UV light has reinforcing properties
      apart from any psychosocial benefits of having a tan. One subject in our study reported low
      back pain relief from the UV exposure condition.

      This is a two-year proposal that is the beginning of a long-term plan to assess whether
      indoor tanning ultraviolet light exposure has a therapeutic effect for patients with chronic
      pain. To this end, we will determine the effect of UV light on fibromyalgia pain in a
      controlled, double blind clinical trial of UV exposure. This approach is carefully designed
      to separate the effects of UV exposure on pain from potential confounds associated with the
      tanning procedure, including any perceived benefits of having a tan. The results of this
      study will increase our understanding of the specific influence of UV light on persistence in
      tanning behavior.
