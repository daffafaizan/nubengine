    
      This study is a phase 4, single center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial
      evaluating the safety, tolerability and mechanistic effects of spironolactone, an aldosterone
      antagonist, on neurohormonal activity and remodeling in patients with chronic right heart
      failure (RHF).

      RHF is one of the most important predictors of prognosis in many cardiac disease states
      including pulmonary hypertension (PH), and left heart failure. Sympathetic nervous system
      activation plays an important role in the development and progression of heart failure. It
      remains to be determined whether there is a role for neurohormonal therapy in chronic right
      HF, but evidence points to the role of sympathetic nervous system stimulation and activation
      of the renin-angiotensin and aldosterone system as a contributor to progressive right heart
      failure.

      The study will determine if treatment with spironolactone is associated with reduction in
      right ventricular wall stress. In addition, the study aims to evaluate the effects of
      spironolactone on cardiac sympathetic activity assessed by HED(11 C-hydroxy-ephedrine)
      retention on PET(positron emission tomography) imaging, and global autonomic function
      assessed by heart rate variability.

      Approximately 30 patients with RHF will be randomized to receive either spironolactone daily
      or placebo.
