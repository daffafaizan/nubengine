      controlled trial of the program compared to Usual Care in patients diagnosed with OSA and
      prescribed CPAP therapy. Participants randomized to the SASMP group attended 4 weekly
      educational sessions of approximately two hours each. A trained leader facilitated the
      program from a scripted manual. Key topics covered in this program included: (1) management
      of OSA symptoms, CPAP side effects, and weight loss; (2) maintaining social contacts and
      family relationships; and (3) dealing with symptoms of depression and worries about the
      future.

      The primary aim of this study was to examine the effect of the SASMP, compared to Usual Care,
      on CPAP adherence. It is hypothesized that SASMP participants will have higher levels of CPAP
      adherence compared to those in the Usual Care group.

      A second aim of the study was to examine the effect of the SASMP, compared to Usual Care, on
      proposed mediating variables derived from social cognitive theory (perceived self-efficacy,
      outcome expectations). It is hypothesized that SASMP participants would have higher levels of
      self-efficacy and outcome expectations compared to the Usual Care group.

      And the third aim of the study was to measure the short- and long-term effects of the SASMP,
      compared to Usual Care, on health outcomes (e.g., OSA symptoms and OSA-specific HRQOL). It is
      hypothesized that improvements in OSA symptoms and OSA-specific HRQOL will be seen both
      initially and as maintained 6 months and 1 year after the start of the SASMP.
