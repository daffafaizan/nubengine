      environmental strategies to reduce overall sitting time and increase the number of times
      participants stand up in a day.

      Secondary aim: To assess whether existing and new measurement approaches can detect specific
      changes in sedentary behavior.

      Exploratory aim: To establish whether specified intervention strategies were efficacious in
      reducing sedentary behavior and whether intervention effects were specific to the targeted
      sedentary behavior construct (e.g. decreased overall sitting time or increased number of
      breaks in sitting).
