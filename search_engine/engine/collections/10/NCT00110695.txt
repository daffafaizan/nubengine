      bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) every week for 12 weeks followed by 5-FU, epirubicin, and
      cyclophosphamide (FEC) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in women with locally advanced breast
      cancer. Patients with HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer may receive trastuzumab concurrently
      with the chemotherapy at the discretion of the investigator. The primary aim of this study is
      to determine the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) of this sequential regimen.

      Patients who achieve clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), or
      have resectable stable disease (SD) will undergo surgery. Surgery will consist of modified
      radical mastectomy or excision of the primary tumor site with clear surgical margins
      accompanied by axillary staging. Tumor samples taken prior to initiation of treatment will be
      analyzed for molecular and genetic changes which will be correlated with tumor response.

      Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer without documented
      evidence of distant metastatic disease. Patients with clinical Stage IIB (T3N0 only), IIIA,
      or IIIB breast cancer will be potential candidates for this trial.
