      potential biomarker for the course, severity and outcome of patients with acute pancreatitis.
      From each patient one buccal and rectal swab is collected within 72 h after hospital
      admission. Microbial composition will be determined by 16S and metagenomics Oxford Nanopore
      Sequencing (ONT) and correlated with the revised Atlanta classification as the primary
      endpoint. Secondary endpoints are the correlation of microbiome signatures with the length of
      hospital stay, numbers of interventions and mortality. To this end, alpha and beta diversity
      of microbiota are determined and compared between mild, moderately severe and severe acute
      pancreatitis.
