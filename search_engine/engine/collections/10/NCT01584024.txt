    
      A 3-year prospective, randomized control clinical trial (RCT) is designed incorporating a
      split mouth intra-oral design. Young volunteers (18-24 years old) with at least two early
      lesions in posterior teeth will be enrolled into this clinical trial to evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness of arresting lesion progression by resin infiltration therapy as adjunct to
      standard-of-care preventative measures. Lesion status (non-cavitated) is clinically confirmed
      prior to implementing the assigned therapy.
