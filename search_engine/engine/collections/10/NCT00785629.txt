      maintaining a serum P less than or equal to 3.5 mg/dL (1.13 mmol/L) in patients with eGFR >20
      and <45 mL/min with any of the 3 commercially available P lowering agents (calcium acetate,
      sevelamer carbonate, or lanthanum carbonate). Results of this study will clarify the degree
      of separation in serum P that can be achieved with the use of P lowering agents and the
      current standard of care (P binder initiation when P > 5.5 mg/dL or 1.78 mmol/L).
      Furthermore, this knowledge, combined with analyses of the secondary aims and outcomes of
      interest, will serve to facilitate the design of a properly powered, randomized, placebo
      controlled clinical outcomes trial that will firmly establish the necessity of achieving a
      specific target P in patients with CKD. The secondary aims of this pilot study are to provide
      insight into the optimal detection of progression of abnormalities in mineral metabolism and
      their relationship to vascular disease in CKD. The tertiary aim is to evaluate long term
      outcomes related to phosphorus normalization with respect to renal replacement therapy or
      death.
