      controlled trial, with a sample size of 60 subjects. GDC is the type of treatment one would
      likely receive in a community drug abuse treatment program, in that it focuses primarily in
      substance use, unlike IGT, which focuses equally on SUD and BD issues. Patients are followed
      for a year after the end of the group therapy, to examine the long-term effects of the
      treatment, and also to examine the longer-term relationship of substance use and mood.
      Patients in the trial must be taking a mood stabilizer to enter the study. Any drug of abuse
      is accepted, and all subtypes of BD are accepted.
