      infarction can be made by an ECG (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI). However, some
      myocardial infarctions can also occur without ST-elevations on the ECG (non-ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction, non-STEMI). In the latter case, a quick acquisition of blood troponin
      levels is necessary to coin the diagnosis and initiate treatment. Therefore, the
      investigators prospectively want to compare 3 clinical tests for measuring blood troponin
      levels in patients presenting to the emergency room with thoracic pain probably related to a
      non-STEMI with regard to the time necessary to obtain the test results.

      The 3 tests are:

        1. A laboratory based test: Roche Cobas E 602

        2. A point of care test: Radiometer AQT 90 Flex

        3. A point of care test: Philips Minicare I-20

      The measured timeframe is the time between venipuncture to the point the test results are
      known.
