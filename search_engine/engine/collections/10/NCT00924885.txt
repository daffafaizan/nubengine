      retrieval with ultrasound guidance can still cause a lot of pain, both during and after the
      procedure. To reduce the pain, some clinics prefer to use needles as thin as 0.8 mm (outer
      diameter, OD). A disadvantage with these needles is the increased aspiration time. Therefore
      a new needle has been developed that has the possibility to reduce pain without a large
      increase in aspiration time. The needle has a 50 mm long tip with an outer diameter of 0.9
      mm. The remaining part of the needle is 300 mm long with an outer diameter of 1.4 mm.
