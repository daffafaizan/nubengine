      myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients; the earlier reperfusion therapy is delivered, the
      greater the mortality reduction. Most STEMI patient in Ontario still do not receive
      reperfusion therapy within established target times of <30 minutes for fibrinolysis or <90
      minutes for PCI. 12 lead PHECG with advance ED notification may have a time to treatment
      impact in STEMI patients. However studies, investigating this intervention were all small,
      largely urban trials, and were carried out with advanced care paramedics. In Ontario, many
      emergency medical services (EMS) systems cover large rural regions, and are frequently
      staffed by primary care paramedics with only basic life support training. Thus, the benefit
      of 12 lead PHECG in these settings is unclear. In addition, no study has assessed the
      cost-effectiveness of 12 lead PHECG compared to 3 lead PHECG.
