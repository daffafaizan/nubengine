      community/home-based care, and little is known about the long-term sustainability of the
      nutritional and health benefits of treatment after rehabilitation. The two treatments will be
      compared in terms of costs of treatment and convened health benefits (child nutritional
      status and development, cured rate and relapse, maternal mental health, and family care
      practices) at both short and long-term periods after admission. The proposed complementary
      psychosocial intervention focuses directly on the key underlying determinants of acute
      malnutrition within children's early years, such as child care practices and stimulation,
      parent-child relationships and maternal mental health. It includes the mother/caregiver as
      patient of psychosocial support, but also empowers her as the key ally in the treatment of
      the undernourished child. Adding a brief psychosocial component to the standard
      medico-nutritional treatment is expected to pay off in terms of sustainable recovery, health,
      and development outcomes of children.
