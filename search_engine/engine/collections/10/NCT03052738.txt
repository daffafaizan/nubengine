      national leader in pediatric cancer therapy. The CHCO Neuro-Oncology program treats more that
      90% of Coloradan children with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors and a large percentage of
      children with CNS tumors from the surrounding five states. Due to advances in therapy,
      approximately two-thirds of children with CNS tumors treated at CHCO will be cured. Although
      medical marijuana has been legal for more than a decade in Colorado, the publicity around the
      more recent legalization for general adult use, increasing literature, and anecdotal reports
      of patients with terminal CNS tumors cured with medical marijuana, have prompted a recent
      increase in interest of current CHCO patients and their families. There has been an influx of
      pediatric cancer patients and their families moving to Colorado to obtain these
      marijuana-based products to self-medicate.

      The Investigators will administer PedsQLTM questionnaires and diaries to gather data
      regarding use practices, method of delivery, strain used, dosing and frequency, and family
      financial impact on all enrolled patients. The Investigators will also collect peripheral
      blood samples to evaluate for evidence of immuno-modulation by cannabinoids in patients who
      may already be immunocompromised and to assess blood cannabinoid levels.

      This study will provide novel exploratory data regarding use patterns, impact on families and
      resources, and potential clinical benefits and harms associated with the growing marijuana
      use in the pediatric neuro-oncology population. Such information may guide future children
      afflicted with CNS tumors and their families to make decisions about whether to pursue
      cannabinoid treatment.
