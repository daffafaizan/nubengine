      with abdominal obesity are at markedly increased risk for diabetes and heart disease. Recent
      studies have shown that decreased sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance), a hallmark of
      the metabolic syndrome, is related to increased storage of fat in muscle cells (muscle fat).
      Several recent studies indicate that blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may improve
      insulin sensitivity and prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. Other data suggests that
      this effect may be due to the effect of RAS blockade on the recruitment and growth of adipose
      tissue. The primary aim of this study is therefore to explore the role of angiotensin II in
      the development of insulin resistance. Specifically, we will examine the mechanisms
      underlying the putative anti-diabetic effect of RAS blockade by examining the effect of
      angiotensin receptor blockade on muscle fat content in individuals with the abdominal
      obesity. This study will therefore test the hypothesis that treatment with the angiotensin
      receptor blocker telmisartan (MicardisÂ®) will reduce muscle fat, thereby improving insulin
      sensitivity in people with abdominal obesity, with or without additional features of the
      metabolic syndrome. A number of dietary factors can also affect insulin sensitivity and may
      influence muscle fat. Recent studies suggest that increasing the content of low-glycemic
      foods (carbohydrates which are less easily digested), can improve insulin sensitivity and
      lipid profile in patients with insulin resistance. A second aim of this study is therefore to
      test the hypothesis that a low-glycemic diet will reduce muscle fat, thereby improving
      insulin sensitivity in this population.
