      shown the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) during the luteal phase of the
      menstrual cycle to be effective in improving symptoms in women with premenstrual dysphoric
      disorder (PMDD). Unfortunately, SRI treatment has only been evaluated in controlled clinical
      trials, and evidence suggests that patients in these clinical trials are not representative
      of women commonly seen in clinical practice. Thus, the real-world feasibility of intermittent
      dosing is questionable.

      Patients in this study receive sertraline (Zoloft) during the luteal phase of their menstrual
      cycle every month for 6 months. The dose may be modified based on structured interviews with
      the patients. Assessments include questionnaires and interviews which take place at study
      start, at midpoint, and at the end of the study.
