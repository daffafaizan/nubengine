      exploratory efforts will be to increase the currently very limited information available in
      the topics of interest stated above, and the findings, even if only from limited group of
      respondents, will help us guide our research development, prepare for design of clinical
      trials, guide special interest groups, and serve as role data for appropriate scientific
      publications.
