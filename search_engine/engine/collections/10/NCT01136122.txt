      resistance and heart disease. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body produces
      insulin but does not use it properly. Insulin helps the body use glucose for energy. Insulin
      resistance increases the chance of developing type II diabetes and heart disease.

      One method of treatment for OSA is with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This
      treatment is given by a device named CPAP. There are many different types of CPAPs available
      on the market that are FDA approved.

      The purpose of this study is to see if treatment of OSA with the CPAP device makes a
      difference to insulin resistance and heart disease. This study will measure insulin
      resistance by testing the glucose level in the blood, and testing the levels of special
      protein found in blood, that are known to increase the sensitivity to insulin and decrease
      progression of heart disease. The heart disease will be measured by cardiac MRI. Glucose
      testing and cardiac MRI's are normal testing procedures for people who have OSA and heart
      disease, however will be conducted more frequently than normal and therefore are for research
      purposes. The specialized blood testing is for research purposes only.
