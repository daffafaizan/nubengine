      also allows the realization of endoscopic therapeutics techniques; thus, endoscopic mucosal
      resection (EMR) is an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of premalignant and early
      malignant colorectal lesions of the colon and its use is universal.

      Usually, colon lesions larger than 10 mm (or pedunculated of any size) require for resection
      the use of electrocoagulation current (or hot snare polypectomy) and thus is reflected in the
      most recent clinical practice guidelines (ESGE guidelines, for example). However, the risk of
      side adverse effects from the use of electrocoagulation is not insignificant and includes
      post-polypectomy bleeding, post-polypectomy syndrome, post-polypectomy fever and/or immediate
      or delayed perforation. This risk of complications is higher depending on the characteristics
      and size of colorectal lesions resected.

      On the other hand, currently in small lesions not pedunculated (< 10 mm), it is recommended
      to use cold snare polypectomy according to ESGE clinical guidelines, as it has been seen in
      previous studies that this reduces complication rates without varying the effectiveness in
      resection.

      However, in lesions > 10 mm the previous experience with cold snare resection is less,
      probably motivated by the possible drawbacks in terms of the possible difficulty of resection
      of thick tissue with cold snare and a possible increased intra-procedure hemorrhagic risk
      that can make it difficult to see the scar, with the possibility of leaving residual tissue.

      However, in recent years the accumulated evidence gathered in various studies and grouped in
      a recent systematic review suggests that endoscopic mucosal resection with cold snare
      (Cold-EMR) may be safer than electrocoagulation resection for both 10-19mm lesions and for
      lesions >20 mm, associated with a lower rate of adverse effects with similar efficacy rates
      in terms of complete resection and adenomatous recurrence rate. Still, evidence for the
      treatment of nonpedunculated lesions >20 mm is relatively limited and is not based on
      randomized comparative studies with the standard EMR technique.
