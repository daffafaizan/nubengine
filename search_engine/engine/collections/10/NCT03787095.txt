    
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunotherapeutic activity of an anti-PD-1 antibody
      (cemiplimab) in participants with HIV-1 on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) who have
      plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL and CD4+ T cell counts â‰¥350/mm^3.

      Participants will be enrolled into three sequential dose-rising cohorts. Participants in each
      cohort will receive infusions of either cemiplimab or placebo at study entry (Day 0) and Week
      6, for a total of two infusions. All participants will also continue their non-study provided
      ART regimen. Enrollment in the cohorts will be sequential, with the second and third cohorts
      only opening after all participants in the previous cohort have reached week 12 and an
      evaluation of safety outcomes has established that it is safe to dose escalate.

      Participants will attend study visits on Day 0 and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20,
      24, 28, 36, and 48. These visits may include a medical history, physical examination, urine
      and blood collection, and adherence assessments. Participants will be followed for 48 weeks.
