      the form of observational survey to develop and validate food-based recommendations (FBRs).
      The second phase was an intervention study to assess the effectiveness of the FBRs in
      improving dietary practice, the intake of problem nutrient, nutritional status and lipid
      profile of the subject.

      Sample size for intervention per group (n=60/group; 2 groups) was expected to detect
      mean(±SD) differences in LDL-cholesterol concentration (as an secondary outcome) of 14±20
      mg/dL as observed in a previous study in other area, with assumption of 80% power and 25%
      loss of follow up. Potential subjects were identified prior to dyslipidemia screening before
      intervention. Field nutritionist and volunteer cadres were requested to identify and list
      women of reproductive age fulfilling the inclusion criteria living in selected sites. An
      invitation letter was sent to all identified eligible subjects to visit appointed field
      laboratory to perform blood measurement. Inform consent was signed by all potential
      participants before blood measurement.

      This study did not compare an intervention group (FBR group) with a true control group, but
      with a comparison group that received once nutrition counselling from usual nutrition health
      program (non-FBR group). Drawing on concepts of Plan Behavior Theory, persuasive FBR
      promotion was designed to influence subjects' attitude, subjective norms, perceive behavior
      control related to dyslipidemia and dietary management, and intention to change. Participants
      were prompted to set goals for themselves to improve their dietary practices in order to
      fulfill their nutrient requirements, improve nutritional status and lipid profile.
