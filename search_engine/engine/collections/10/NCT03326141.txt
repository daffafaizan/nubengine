      delineated Primary, Secondary and Exploratory Aims:

      Primary Aim: Determine which experimental intervention component(s) increase PA among
      community-dwelling older adults post-intervention: immediately, 6 months, and 12 months.
      Hypothesis: Participants receiving the interpersonal set of behavior change strategies
      (conditions 2 and 4) will have clinically meaningful increases in PA post- intervention (at
      all 3 time-points), compared to participants not receiving these strategies (conditions 1 and
      3).

      Secondary Aim: Determine which experimental intervention component(s)decrease fall occurrence
      and increase quality of life (QOL) among community-dwelling older adults 12 months
      post-intervention. Hypotheses: Participants receiving the set of interpersonal behavior
      change strategies will have clinically meaningful reductions in falls and increases in QOL,
      12 months post-intervention, compared to participants not receiving these strategies.

      Exploratory Aim: Evaluate experimental intervention component effects on targeted
      psychosocial constructs (social support; readiness; self-regulation) and physical constructs
      (functional leg strength and balance), which are theorized as mechanisms of change--and
      whether these mechanisms mediate the effects of experimental intervention components on PA
      and falls. Hypotheses: Receiving the interpersonal behavioral change strategies, relative to
      not receiving these strategies, will elicit increases in targeted psychosocial constructs and
      increases in physical constructs, which in turn will mediate the intervention's effects on PA
      behavior and falls.
