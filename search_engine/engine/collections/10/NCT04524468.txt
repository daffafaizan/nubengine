      Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is one of the major predictors of mortality and heart
      failure in this patient group. It has been shown that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD)
      which is usually carried out via a surgically created arteriovenous fistula (AVF) have an
      increased risk for pulmonary hypertension and poorer right ventricular function compared with
      healthy controls . However, there are few data comparing the patients undergoing HD and
      peritoneal dialysis (PD), in terms of echocardiographic right ventricular function.

      The aim of the present study was to elucidate the impact of both long term PD and HD therapy
      via brachial AVF on RV function in patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) function.

      Patients undergoing dialysis were grouped as follows: 46 patients on PD and 37 patients on HD
      with brachial AVF. All of the study patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography. Left
      and right ventricular parameters were compared between two groups.
