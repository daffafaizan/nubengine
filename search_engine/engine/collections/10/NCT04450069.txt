    
      CLBR001 + SWI019 is a two-component therapy comprising an autologous chimeric antigen
      receptor T (CAR-T) cell product (CLBR001, the switchable CAR-T cell (sCAR-T)) and an
      anti-CD19 (cluster of differentiation antigen 19) antibody (SWI019, the switch, a biologic).
      In combination, SWI019 acts as an adapter molecule that controls the activity of the CLBR001
      CAR-T cell product.
