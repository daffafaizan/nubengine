    
      This is a randomized, open-label (identity of assigned treatment will be known to
      participants and study staff), 2-arm (2 treatment groups), multicenter study of daratumumab
      in participants diagnosed with previously untreated Multiple Myeloma who are eligible for
      high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (transplantation of own bone
      marrow). Participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to one of 2 treatment groups to
      either receive daratumumab plus bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone or bortezomib,
      thalidomide and dexamethasone for induction (before transplantation) and consolidation (after
      transplantation) treatment. All responders will then be re-randomized (assigned by chance) to
      one of 2 treatment groups to receive maintenance treatment with daratumumab only or
      observation (no treatment). The study will include a 28-Day Screening Phase, a Treatment
      Phase of 6 treatment cycles (each cycle is 4 weeks in duration for total period of 30 weeks),
      and a Follow up Phase of 2 years. The total duration for each participant in the study will
      be approximately 138 weeks. The end of the study will occur approximately 5 years after the
      last participant is randomized in the second phase of the study. Disease assessments will be
      performed every 4 weeks in the first phase of the study and then every 8 weeks in the second
      phase of the study. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
