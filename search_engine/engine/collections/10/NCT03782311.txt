    
      All study patients (n=210) between the ages of 35 to 60 with inflammatory periodontal
      diseases filled out questionnaires regarding GSE and OHSE. Subgroups including OHSE-low
      (n=26) and OHSE-high (n=26) groups were selected after performing "cut off" on OHSE scores of
      all study patients. In both subgroups, plaque index (PI) values were determined, and
      motivation and oral hygiene instructions were performed at baseline. PI measurements and OHSE
      questionnaire were repeated at 1 and 3 months.
