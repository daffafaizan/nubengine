      Endeavor Resolute stent is commercially available. There are two study cohorts:

        1. 38 mm cohort: a minimum of 46 patients and maximum of 111 patients with at least one
           lesion amenable to treatment with a 38 mm length Endeavor Resolute stent. Patients may
           have one or two lesions, if the two lesions are located in separate target vessels.

        2. Dual vessel cohort: a minimum of 203 patients and maximum of 300 patients with dual
           vessel treatment where each vessel has a lesion with length â‰¤ 27 mm and reference vessel
           diameters between 2.25 mm and 4.0 mm.
