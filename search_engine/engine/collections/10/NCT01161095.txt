      Interval time period. The study arm will consist of women randomized to receiving Immediate
      placement.

      The investigators hypothesize that Immediate placement of IUD in the postpartum period will
      result in a 20% decrease in continuation rates at six months compared to Interval placement.

      Secondary outcome measures that we will obtain include:

        -  Pain at the time of placement

        -  Postpartum Depression

        -  Breastfeeding status

        -  Postpartum weight retention

        -  Expulsion Rates

        -  Bleeding Profile

        -  Uterine Infection(Endometritis)
