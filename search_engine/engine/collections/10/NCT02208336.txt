      I. Retrospectively measure the frequency of nonadherence with established monitoring
      guidelines in the target patient population.

      II. Retrospectively assess the impact of nonadherence events on myelosuppression severity and
      patient morbidity.

      III. Prospectively measure the effect of an automated notification program on adherence
      rates.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantify any time savings realized by patient care staff through the use of such a
      program.

      II. Quantify the number of patient care interventions that directly result from this
      automated monitoring and notification program.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients' electronic medical records are reviewed for adherence, severe myelosuppression, and
      patient morbidity retrospectively and prospectively.
