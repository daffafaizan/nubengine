      critical limb ischaemia. The poorest prognosis considering preservation of the limb is shown
      by the patients who exhibit symptoms of ischaemia due to affected popliteal artery and
      arteries of the shank in the the popliteal artery aneurysm. On the other hand, diagnosis of
      this condition is prompt and easy (general ultrasound scan below the knee). Patients with the
      popliteal artery aneurysm, confirmed by ultrasound investigation, and concurrent signs and
      symptoms of acute critical ischaemia will be indicated for catheterization intervention at
      our unit, which will confirm morphological compatibility with endovascular occlusion of the
      aneurysm sac through implantation of a peripheral stent graft, supported by implantation of a
      peripheral flexible stent, and at the same time insertion of a thrombolytic catheter into the
      implanted stent graft for local thrombolysis of tibial arteries if required by the current
      situation. The patient will be hospitalized at the angiology intensive care unit of the 2nd
      Medical Department, where local intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy will be performed
      according to the standard protocol. After completion of the proper endovascular treatment,
      the patients will be transferred to combined peroral anticoagulation and antiaggregation
      treatment, and all of them will have an ultrasound scan below the knee, with the readings
      archived for the purpose of further comparison and monitoring. Subsequently, the patients
      will be monitored in the outpatient regime after 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months. At each visit,
      clinical examination will be done including establishment of ABI/TBI values and ultrasound
      investigation of the region below the knee.
