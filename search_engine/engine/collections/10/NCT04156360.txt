      prospectively. CTCs and CAMLs both are cancer specific biomarkers found in the peripheral
      blood of patients with solid tumors including lung cancer. Through detecting CTCs and CAMLs
      in healthy volunteers and patients with pulmonary nodules who undergo biopsy, determine the
      cut-off value of the test. Further analysis of the test specificity and sensitivity, and on
      this basis construct an early diagnostic model for lung cancer.
