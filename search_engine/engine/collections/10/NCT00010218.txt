        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with relapsed or
           refractory non-small cell lung cancer treated with karenitecin as salvage chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the effect of prior response to chemotherapy on response to this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Determine survival and failure-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to response to prior chemotherapy (relapsed vs
      refractory).

      Patients receive karenitecin IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with responding disease after 6 courses may receive 2 additional courses beyond best
      response.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 45 patients (25 for stratum I and 20 for stratum II) will be
      accrued for this study within 12 months.
