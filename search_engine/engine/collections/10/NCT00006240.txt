        -  Determine the objective response (complete hematologic remission induction) of
           phenylbutyrate, dexamethasone, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with refractory or
           relapsed t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the correlation between histone acetylation, differentiation, and apoptosis in
           bone marrow mononuclear cells with response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients on this regimen.

        -  Determine the correlation between histone acetylation, differentiation, and apoptosis in
           bone marrow mononuclear cells with pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive phenylbutyrate IV continuously and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on
      days 1-7 and 15-21. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4 and 15-18. Treatment
      continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity until
      complete hematologic remission is induced. Patients with stable disease at the end of 1
      course receive at least 2 additional courses.

      Patients are followed twice a week for 3 months, monthly for 1 year, every three months for
      the next 4 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study in at least 2
      years.
