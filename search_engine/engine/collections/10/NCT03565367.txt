    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of intravenous (IV) injection of hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate
      (hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      II. To assess the frequency and sensitivity with which lactate and bicarbonate signals can be
      detected in malignant brain tumors after IV injection of hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo MRI over 45 minutes at baseline. Participants then receive
      hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate IV over 30-40 seconds. Within 1 minute, participants
      undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) over 3 minutes and MRI over 10
      minutes (participants may receive gadolinium at the discretion of the protocol director).

      After completion of study, participants are followed up periodically.
