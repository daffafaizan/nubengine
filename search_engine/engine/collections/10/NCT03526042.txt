      the second loop of the AT1 receptor. These antibodies have been studied in human diseases
      such as preeclampsia, transplantation and scleroderma. A previous study from the
      investigators' group found an elevated prevalence of AT1R-Ab in patients with lupus
      nephritis. As these antibodies have been linked to atherosclerosis development this open
      randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effect of AT1R-Ab blockade with
      losartan compared to the use of enalapril in the progression of carotid intima-media
      thickness (CIMT) in patients with active lupus nephritis.

      Biopsy-proven lupus nephritis patients who tested positive for AT1R-Ab will be performed a
      CIMT measurement by Doppler ultrasound at the time of the biopsy and then at 12-months follow
      up.

      The primary outcome will be the change in the CIMT in the course of 12 months in both groups.
