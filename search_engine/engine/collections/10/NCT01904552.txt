      16 teeth with normal periapex (NP), were selected. Access cavity was prepared and coronal
      portion of the canal was flared. Electronic working length (EWL) was determined by each
      ERCLMD according to each manufacturer's instructions. Each tooth was extracted and actual
      working length (AWL) was determined by inserting a size 15 K-file until the tip could be seen
      at a position tangential to the major foramen and then 0.5 mm was subtracted from the
      measurement. The distance from the AWL to the file tip was calculated and compared between
      the two groups by t-test. The accuracy of each ERCLMD within Â±0.5 mm was compared between the
      groups by Fisher's test. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.
