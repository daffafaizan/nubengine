      quick and efficient emergency stabilization and bleeding control is inevitable. The pelvic
      C-clamp and the pelvic binder are efficient tools for temporary bleeding control, especially
      for the posterior pelvic ring. However, whether these disadvantages make up for a more
      efficient bleeding control, still needs to be discussed in the guidelines of the emergency
      management of pelvic ring fractures.

      Patients with a type-C pelvic ring fracture were identified from the German Pelvic Registry
      (GPR). The patients were divided into three groups of 40 patients: 1. group without emergency
      stabilization, 2. group treated with pelvic binder and 3. group treated with pelvic C-clamp.
      The patients were matched according to the following parameters: age, gender, initial RR and
      HB level. The complication rates and mortality rates were compared between the groups,
      especially regarding bleeding control, as measured by the amount of transfused blood
      products. Furthermore, the subjective efficacy of the treatment was assessed. Finally, the
      time until established bleeding control was compared.
