      treatment for kidney or bladder cancer may be possible. This research study will collect a
      bone marrow sample as well as a blood sample.

      Participation in the research study will last approximately 60 days which includes time to
      determine if the patient is eligible to participate in the study, perform the research
      procedures and follow-up with the patient following the research procedures to determine if
      they are experiencing any side effects. Participation will end approximately 30 days
      following the bone marrow collection.

      The bone marrow and blood samples will be collected from all patients in both cohorts only at
      a single time point, after they have been enrolled on the study.
