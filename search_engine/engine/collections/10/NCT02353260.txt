      treatment of cancer.Many studies have shown that Therapeutic Ultrasound is safe and
      effective. Eligible patients were randomly assigned by using permutated blocks designed for
      each site to receive either Ultrasound Hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy (Arm A) or
      chemotherapy alone(Arm B).Chemotherapy will be conducted as follows. For Squamous cell
      carcinoma of head and neck,it will be administrated with Docetaxel(at a dose of 75 mg per
      square meter of body-surface area and intravenous infused in 1 hr at day 1rt), Cisplatin(at a
      dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area and intravenous infused in 1 hr at day
      1rt) and Fluorouracil(at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area and
      intravenous infused last 5 days) . For other types of cancer,the treatments will be
      administrated in accord with the guideline.In addition,Ultrasound Hyperthermia will be
      conducted 5 times(day 1rt,3rd,5th,7th,9th) in Arm A. Patients in arm B will receive
      chemotherapy only. One cycle comprises a period of 3 weeks (21 days).All patients will
      receive 2 cycles in both arms. All the patients eligible for the operation will take surgery.
      After treatmentï¼Œsome patients with advanced unresectable cancer may be down-staged from stage
      IV, and will regain the opportunity of operation.
