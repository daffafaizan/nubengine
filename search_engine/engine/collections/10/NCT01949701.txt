    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and
      clinical efficacies of HLA-A*0201 restricted epitope peptides URLC10 emulsified with
      Montanide ISA 51 for disease controlled advanced non-small cell lung cancers.

      The investigators previously identified a novel HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope peptide, which
      was derived from a cancer-testis antigen, URLC10 as a target for cancer vaccination against
      lung cancer. In this phase I/II trial, the investigators examine using the peptides the
      safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A*0201-positive
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients whose disease are controlled after any standard
      therapies, but who do not have any options for additional standard ones to prevent .future
      relapse of the disease.
