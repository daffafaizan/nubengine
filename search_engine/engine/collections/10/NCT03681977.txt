    
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized control study comparing the TKA Zimmer
      Medial Pivot Persona design to the traditional Zimmer Persona Knee-PS. Eighty patients
      requiring a TKA will be recruited and randomized to one of the two treatment arms following
      confirmation of eligibility criteria. Forty age and sex matched healthy participants with no
      knee OA will also be recruited to provide a comparator measure of "normal" joint motion.

      Clinical follow-up visits and radiographic assessments will be performed pre- and
      post-operative at 6-weeks, 1-year, 2-years. Knee kinematics and self-assessment will be
      completed at the following intervals: pre-operative as baseline assessments for knee motion,
      1-year, 2-years. Measures will include joint mechanics and neuromuscular activation during
      walking and stair stepping measured with motion capture and electromyography, and
      clinical/self assessment including pain in response to physical activity. Any other adverse
      events and complications (i.e, implant failure, re-operation, infection) will be record
      throughout the study.

      Healthy participants will only be assessed once to provide normative data.
