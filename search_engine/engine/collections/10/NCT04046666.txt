    
      The Lung and Heart meridians are chosen as two specific studied meridians. Participants of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and healthy volunteers will be enrolled.

      120 participants will be included and divided into the healthy control group, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) group and healthy intervention group. Functional near
      infrared spectroscopy will be used to assess the metabolic characteristics of the Heart and
      Lung meridians. The specificity for the meridian-visceral association will be investigated by
      comparing the metabolic difference between the Heart and Lung meridians in the healthy
      control group and COPD group. Besides, participants in the healthy intervention group will
      receive two sessions of moxibustion in the Heart meridian and Lung meridian respectively to
      explore the specificity for the site-to-site association.
