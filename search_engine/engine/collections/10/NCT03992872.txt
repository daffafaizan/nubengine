      interfere with immune responses to chikungunya virus (CHIKV) exposure or vaccination. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the chikungunya
      vaccine candidate PXVX0317 when administered to prior recipients of experimental alphavirus
      vaccines versus alphavirus na√Øve gender and age-matched controls.
