      twenty-eight voluntary patients with COPD, aged between 35-80 years will be divided into two
      groups: Group-1 have at least one fall (fallers) and Group-2 have no history of falls
      (non-fallers). Fall frequency will be investigated by asking patients to report any fall
      event in the last one month and the last 12-months. Assessments will be performed at
      baseline. Fear of falling will be assessed with Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC)
      scale. Balance will be evaluated by Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The level of dyspnea during
      daily activities will be assessed with London Chest Activity of Daily Living (LCADL) scale.
      The global impacts of COPD symptoms on overall health status will be evaluated by The COPD
      Assessment Test (CAT). The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea (MMRC) scale and
      Six-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) will be used for evaluating the how dyspnea limits the
      patients' daily activities and functional capacity, respectively. Isometric muscle strength
      will be measured with a handheld dynamometer of quadriceps femoris. Pulmonary function data
      will be retrieved from the last 1-month clinical records of the COPD patients. Statistical
      analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version
      21.0. Among the groups, demographic and clinical variables will be compared with independent
      sample t-test for continuous variables and a chi-square test for categorical variables. The
      significance level will be set as p<0.05.
