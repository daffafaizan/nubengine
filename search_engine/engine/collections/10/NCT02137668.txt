      (microbiome: the collection or collectivity of microorganisms) using molecular methods,
      examine the mechanisms of interaction between host and microbiome using genomic approaches,
      and determine how the microbiome both preserves local health and promotes pathology.
      Investigation will focus on primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary atresia, as well as
      states of health. The composition of the associated microbiome will be assessed based on
      ribosomal DNA and RNA sequences, and attention will be given to richness (diversity),
      evenness (relative abundance), and variation with respect to time, person, and anatomic
      niche. Host response at the adjacent mucosal surface will be assessed based on genome-wide
      gene expression patterns. In addition, changes in the metabolites of the blood will be
      analyzed.

      To see if the antibiotic vancomycin, when used for the early treatment of Biliary Atresia
      (BA) and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is effective treatment for these diseases.
      Investigators hope to learn what effect Vancomycin has on the bacteria that are present in
      stool, body fluid or intestinal tissue on someone who has BA and PSC and if so by what
      mechanism.
