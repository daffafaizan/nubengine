      be examined. Women with impalpable bony landmarks will be offered recruitment to the study.
      Women will be randomly assigned to the standard of care group - palpation attempts only,
      versus an ultrasound group, where the insertion point will be identified by the handheld
      ultrasound device

      Inclusion criteria:

      advancement of the needle and/or introducer, as well as any new intervertebral space
      attempted.

      Secondary outcomes include:

      The insertion site identification time, patient verbal numerical pain score (0-10) after skin
