      need of care is common in the end stage of the disease. Nurse-led clinics for other groups of
      patients, e.g. coronary heart disease, have shown high quality which has resulted in an
      established part of the follow-up.

      This study is a randomized controlled study at five Swedish hospitals to study the effect of
      a changed follow-up process for liver cirrhotic patients by adding a nurse-led clinic to
      follow up by physician. The intervention implies a larger extend of nursing interventions at
      the outpatient clinic to increase the patient's quality of life, quality of care and reduce
      the need of inpatient care.

      A few hospitals in Sweden offers a nurse-led clinic for liver cirrhotic patients, the
      interest in other hospitals are raising. Though there is a lack of evidence in nursing
      intervention within this population and it is still unknown what the effects are for the
      individual or on the health economy.
