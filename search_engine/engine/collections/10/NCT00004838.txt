    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is randomized study. Patients are randomized to receive succimer in
      addition to standard treatment (arm I) or standard treatment only (arm II).

      Succimer is administered orally 3 times a day for 7 days, then twice daily for 19 days.
      Patients may receive up to 3 courses.

      Standard treatment consists of a medical history and physical examination, environmental
      assessment with modification to reduce lead exposure, dietary modifications to decrease lead
      absorption, the use of a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement with iron, developmental
      screening and intervention, and frequent follow up of lead levels.

      If blood lead level rises above 45 mcg/dL, patient receives succimer regardless of treatment
      arm originally assigned.

      Patients are followed every 3-4 weeks for 2 months, then every 3 months for 6 months, and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
