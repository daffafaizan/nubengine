        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine and sargramostim
           (GM-CSF) in patients with stage II, III, or IV soft tissue sarcoma expressing NY-ESO-1
           or LAGE antigen.

        -  Determine the immunologic profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type
           hypersensitivity) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine tumor responses in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine intradermally once every 2 weeks for a
      total of 6 vaccinations. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once
      daily beginning 2 days before every vaccination and continuing for 5 days. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
