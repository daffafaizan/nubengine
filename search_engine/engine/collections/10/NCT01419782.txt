      Vibration will be applied the right lower extremity by whole-body vibration (PowerPlate Pro).
      Cases will stand on vibration plate. WBV will be applied at a frequency of 40 Hz and
      amplitude of 2 mm for 60 seconds. WBV will be applied one session only.

      The rest muscle electrical activity of ipsilateral and contralateral hip adductor muscles at
      rest will be measured by PowerLab (data acquisition system, ADInstruments, Australia)
      device.The rest-EMGrms will be measured at before and during vibration. We also evaluate a
      change in contralateral soleus H reflex during vibration.

      Effects of bone on the rest muscle electrical activity will be assessed by hip bone mineral
      density, bone mineral content and serum sclerostin level. The right hip bone mineral density
      (BMD) and BMC will be evaluated by bone densitometer (Norland). Plasma sclerostin level will
      be measured by using Human Sclerostin ELISA kÄ±t before and after vibration.
