      Lung transplant patients will undergo CT Scans before scheduled bronchoscopies which are
      routinely performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post transplant. Imaging will be done with
      the newest generation scanner, with intent to analyze all pertinent areas of the lung for
      pathology, but especially the bronchial anastomoses, the lung parenchyma with focus on gas
      exchanging lobules of the lung, and any suspected abnormalities from physical exam,
      laboratory tests, or prior chest xray.

      CT imaging will precede bronchoscopy and biopsy so that CT interpretation will be
      unencumbered by changes due to the bronchoscopic procedure.
