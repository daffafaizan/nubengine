      hypertension (PPHTN). In the World Health Organization (WHO) classification PPHTN is
      categorized as a WHO group 1 condition. This categorization is appropriate as PPHTN shares
      similar pathological features and clinical presentation and as idiopathic (primary) pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH). Advances in oral therapies in PAH (idiopathic, connective tissue
      disease, congenital heart disease) has deferred the need for parenteral therapies, lung
      transplantation and led to improvements in functional capacity, quality of life and survival.
      However unlike other forms of PAH, treatment options have not been formally evaluated for
      PPHTN and there are no approved medical therapies. Patients are unable to pay for
      medications. Consequently patients continue to endure the natural progression of PAH - a
      state characterized by progressive right heart failure, disability and death. Furthermore the
      unacceptable mortality associated with liver transplantation in the presence of
      hemodynamically significant PAH, leaves them with no therapeutic options. Therefore, new
      treatment options need to be systematically evaluated.
