           intracerebral hemorrhage.

        -  Some observations suggest that previous use of antiplatelet agents associates with rapid
           hematoma enlargement and poor outcome after cerebral hemorrhage.

        -  Immediate platelet transfusion for such patients may prevent hematoma growth but also
           cause thromboembolic complications.
