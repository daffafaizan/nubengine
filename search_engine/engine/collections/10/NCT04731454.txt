      either a healthy Nordic diet or a control diet for 8 days. All meals were provided and
      minimal food preparation was required. Participants picked up their food outside the study
      kitchen every 3 days. Before and after the intervention, health-related self-rated
      questionnaires were completed. For every meal during the intervention, participants completed
      a questionnaire on their perceptions of the meal. Every evening a questionnaire was completed
      to assess dietary adherence. At the end of the study, a final evaluation questionnaire was
      completed to assess participants' perceptions of the diet and study as a whole.
