      method that has been used for decades, there is not enough evidence on its efficacy, so it's
      considered ineffective in the Spanish and British guidelines of clinical practice. The
      present study seeks to verify the analgesic efficacy of TENS by applying the electrodes in
      the spinal nerve roots associated with labor pain and using conventional TENS with parameters
      that, according to the evidence, may be effective for this application.
