      pregnancy, and it causes variable degree of left ventricular outflow obstruction and
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy requires specific management as digoxin and inotropic agents
      usually used in heart failure are contraindicated.

      So high index of suspicion is required in fetus of diabetic mother having thick Inter
      ventricular septum.
