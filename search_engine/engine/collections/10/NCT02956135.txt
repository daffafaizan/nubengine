      standing or walking. The large number of repetitions of high intensity activities such as
      sprinting or jumping, associated with physical contact with opposing players, make this sport
      in a physically demanding activity. Furthermore, overuse injuries have been widely described
      but poorly quantified. In addition, is necessary to know the influence of static
      lumbar-pelvic position in low back pain and its correlation with stability. Not only strength
      is important for a good quality of movement, there should also be a specific muscle
      activation in order for a correct motor pattern. This coordinated action must be I just by
      the action of muscles agonists, antagonists and synergists.The aim of this study is to assess
      the relationship between the presence of overuse injuries and failure to control of movement
      in those areas. For this, participants will perform some tests related to movement
      dysfunction lumbar-pelvic area to check for faults in one or more movement planes.
