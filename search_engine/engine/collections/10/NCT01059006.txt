      ability to focus in order to obtain clear vision for near distance. At approximately age 40
      the range of accommodation begins to decrease and there is a diminishing capacity of the eye
      to focus on the nearest point it can focus on. This makes the need for corrective lenses a
      necessity in order to read at near as well as focus at an intermediate distance.

      Presbyopia correction is one of the most frequently discussed topics in refractive surgery
      today. The idea of a creating a multifocal cornea using refractive surgery has sparked
      tremendous interest in finding a solution for this growing population throughout the world,
      especially amongst surgeons and the ophthalmic industry

      PresbyLASIK essentially involves the creation of a multifocal surface able to correct any
      visual defect for distance while simultaneously allowing freedom from near spectacle
      dependency in presbyopic patients. PresbyLASIK is currently being offered routinely to
      patients in the San Diego area, across the country as well as in numerous centers around the
      world.

      Conclusions from this study would serve as a guide for keratorefractive surgeons, who are
      pursuing peripheral PresbyLASIK, in determining the preoperative patient features in order to
      achieve the best outcome using the Wavelight-Allegretto System.
