      assessing myocardial sympathetic denervation in Parkinson's disease (PD) Patients. Compared
      to the routinely used I123 MIBG scan, [18F]FDOPA seems to have an advantage for the following
      reasons:

        1. meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a false analog of norepinephrine while [18F]FDOPA is
           the radiolabelled form of DOPA, a direct precursor of dopamine which is subsequently
           converted to norepinephrine

        2. 123I MIBG, un-like norepinephrine, dose not undergo intracellular metabolism (19) while
           [18F]FDOPA undergo complex intracellular metabolism (17)

        3. Studies have shown that I123 MIBG reuptake is almost exclusive by uptake mechanism 1.
           Uptake-2 mechanism of 123I-MIBG by the myocardium is not significant. Reuptake of
           norepinephrine (NE) in the synaptic cleft and is mainly by uptake 1 system but also in
           small amount by uptake 2 systems. The investigators assumption is that this double
           mechanism of reuptake will increase the concentration of [18F]FDOPA for better imaging
