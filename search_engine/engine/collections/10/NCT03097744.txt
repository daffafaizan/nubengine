    
      The study is a retrospective, non-randomized, single-group assignment, open-label study of
      repairs of meniscal tears status post repair. The following clinical efficacy endpoints will
      be evaluated at greater than 12 months:

        -  Reoperation rate

        -  Validated patient-reported outcomes measures

        -  Contribution of the following retrospective covariates on failure and outcomes when
           available: Type of tear, Location of tear (lateral versus medial), Chronicity of
           symptoms, Nature of tear (degenerative versus traumatic), Length of tear, Patient age,
           Patient gender, Length of rehabilitation protocol, Performance of trephination,
           Inclusion of biologic enhancement, Meniscal repair alone versus meniscal repair combined
           with ACL reconstruction.
