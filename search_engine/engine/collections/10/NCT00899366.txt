        -  Identify the transcriptional signatures associated with the presence of NOTCH1 mutations
           in primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells using oligonucleotide
           microarrays.

        -  Characterize the global changes on gene expression resulting from the inactivation of
           NOTCH signaling in human T-ALL lymphoblasts.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Frozen lymphoblast samples from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (NOTCH1-mutated and wild type) are assessed for genetic expression profiles and mutations by
      microarray analysis and activated NOTCH1 protein by western blot analysis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 samples from patients will be accrued for this study.
