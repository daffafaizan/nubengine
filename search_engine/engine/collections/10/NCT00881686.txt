      years. New progresses in myocardial protection in the settings of acute myocardial infarction
      treatment put forward the its clinical use to a broader field. But the safety and
      effectiveness of its use in myocardial protection in the setting of open heart surgery has
      not been investigated intensively. Our primary results suggested that adenosine
      preconditioning could decrease the release of myocardial serum markers, such as cTnI. This
      study will focus on the safety and effectiveness of adenosine in the field of pediatric
      myocardial protection during surgery repair of congenital heart defects with CPB and
      cardioplegia.
