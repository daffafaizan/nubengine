      (stroke-associated pneumonia, SAP). Early diagnose and treatment of SAP is paramount in the
      treatment of stroke patients. While dysphagia strongly contributes to its pathogenesis,
      recent years have also shown a strong risk-modulation by CNS injury induced
      immunosuppression, making stroke patients more susceptible to SAP. Additionally, murine
      models of stroke showed changes in mucociliary clearance as possible contributors to SAP. It
      remains unclear, whether structural integrity and mucociliary clearance of the respiratory
      epithel change in stroke patients, and whether these changes might contribute to the
      occurence of SAP.

      Therefore, the investigators designed this exploratory observational pilot-study to examine
      the structural and functional integrity of respiratory epithel in severely affected stroke
      patients and correlate these findings to immune phenotyping and occurence of SAP. The
      investigators will conduct bronchoscopy in severely affected stroke patients to collect
      histological samples in order to evaluate multiple tissue predictors, as well as perform
      optical coherence tomography to examine ciliary kinetics in-vivo. The investigators will
      furthermore perform serum and plasma immune phenotyping, record occuring pneumonias and
      correlate these data in order to identify possible predictors of pneumonia.
