    
      The purpose of this study is to calibrate the performance of RBA-2 using people by comparing
      the results against a standard diagnostics test. The objective of this study is to collect
      non-invasive in vivo saliva from confirmed cases of both infected and non-infected COVID-19
      patients or site staff at the testing site and compare the test results using the RBA-2
      against the standard test results used for diagnosis.

      The comparison of the results obtained from the current testing methods will be used to
      calibrate machine learning algorithms of the RBA-2.
