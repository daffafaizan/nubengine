      in adolescents 12-17 years old. The main goal of this pilot study is to estimate variance in
      the outcome measures to help with planning the future fully powered study. Participants will
      have an in person enrollment visit, followed by phone follow up visits and headache diary
      data collection via smart phone or internet.
