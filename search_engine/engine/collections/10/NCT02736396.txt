      diagnose dementia, however diagnosis still remains challenging. There is currently a focus on
      the usefulness of resting state functionalMRI (RS fMRI) as a way of establishing differences
      in functional connectivity between healthy subjects and those with various neurodegenerative
      disorders. Although the potential for RS fMRI to be used as a biomarker for neurological
      diseases looks promising, further research is needed, especially regarding validation of
      normal values and seed-based functional connectivity. Further research into this area will
      help to improve the ability to appropriately classify new subjects and ultimately allow use
      of RS functional connectivity as a biomarker. This is a nontreatment, prospective, natural
      history data collection that aims to analyse functional connectivity in a cohort of patients
      with suspected cognitive impairment. Correlation of global cognition and episodic memory
      performance to resting state fMRI functional connectivity will be evaluated. Patient
      population will include patients over the age of 18 with cognitive impairment and age and
      gender matched controls. Eligible patients will have to complete neuropsychological and
      clinical assessments and complete an fMRI scan prior to enrolment.Study duration is estimated
      at 4 years.
