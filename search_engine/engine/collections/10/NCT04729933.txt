      catheterization which allows for the transfer of blood from the left atrium (LA) to right
      atrium (RA). The intended effect is to reduce excessive left-sided cardiac filling pressures
      in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) and thus improve symptoms related to pulmonary
      congestion. All patients in the study must meet all anatomic and clinical eligibility in the
      FDA approved indications for use of the MitraClip in functional mitral regurgitation (MR).
      All patients must have persistence of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or
      ambulatory class IV HF symptoms despite maximally tolerated guideline directed medical
      therapy (GDMT) as assessed by a Cardiologist specialist in advanced heart failure (HF). All
      patients will have reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 20% and ≤ 50% and
      at least moderate to severe 3-4+ MR with a functional or combined functional and degenerative
      mechanism. Despite MitraClip treatment and maximum GDMT, these patients are at high risk for
      recurrent HF events and readmission, and thus there is an unmet need for further therapies to
      improve outcomes in this patient population.

      The existing transseptal puncture used for MitraClip placement will be used to place the
      V-Wave Shunt device after MitraClip placement.
