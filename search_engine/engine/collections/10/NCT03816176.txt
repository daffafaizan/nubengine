      dose for safety. Treatment will be administered until the participant has a successful
      outcome or for a maximum duration of 84 days (IA) or 180 days (IM), whichever occurs first.

      Participants will receive a loading regimen of isavuconazonium sulfate (via intravenous or
      oral administration at the investigator's discretion), which consists of a dose every 8 hours
      (± 2 hours) on Days 1 and 2 (for a total of 6 doses), followed by once daily maintenance
      dosing for up to 84 days (IA) or 180 days (IM) of dosing. The first maintenance dose should
      start 12 to 24 hours after the administration of the last loading dose. Subsequent
      maintenance doses will be administered once daily (24 hours ± 2 hours from the previous
      maintenance dose). The oral formulation can only be given to subjects 6 years to < 18 years
      of age and with a body weight of at least 12 kg. Subjects who are discharged from the
      hospital with oral capsules for at-home administration must return weekly for study drug
      accountability and to receive new oral dosing supplies. Subjects who begin oral
      administration are to complete the oral dosing acceptability assessment after ingesting their
      first oral dose.
