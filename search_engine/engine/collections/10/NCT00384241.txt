      obesity, diet, genetics, or stress. Maintaining a healthy balance of sodium in the body is
      important for adequate blood pressure control. Some individuals experience sustained high
      blood pressure during periods of extended stress, combined with the inability to excrete
      enough sodium through urine to re-establish normal blood pressure levels. This type of
      stress-induced high blood pressure is related to interleukin-6 (IL-6), a protein that
      stimulates inflammation and immune responses. To determine the interaction between stress,
      inflammation, and genetics, this study will examine the role of IL-6 in regulating sodium
      levels and blood pressure in individuals undergoing stress. This information will be useful
      in determining new ways to evaluate risk factors for high blood pressure.

      This study will examine previously collected DNA samples from young adults who participated
      in prior genetic studies. There will be no study visits for participants. IL-6, IL-6R,
      glycoprotein 130 (gp130), and C-reactive protein (CRP) genes will be analyzed in all samples;
      changes in plasma levels of IL-6 and CRP in response to stress will be examined in selected
      samples. The parents of participants will be asked to provide cheek swabs for additional DNA
      analysis.
