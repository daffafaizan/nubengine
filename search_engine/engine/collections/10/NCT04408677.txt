      Objectives

      Primary:

      1. To measure the oxygen saturation at different locations on the retina (macula, optic nerve
      head, nasal retina) in order to provide the range of these values in normal eyes.

      Secondary:

        1. To assess the repeatability of the device's measurements (on a subset of patients).

        2. To assess the variability of measurements between the two eyes (on a subset of
           patients).

      Outcomes

      Primary Outcome:

      1. Normative values of the retinal oxygen saturation at different locations on the retina.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        1. Intraclass correlation coefficient of the measurements on the same patient at the same
           visit.

        2. Percent difference between the measurements of the two eyes.

      STUDY HYPOTHESES

      Primary:

      1. Oxygen saturation should have a consistent range among healthy subjects.

      Secondary:

        1. Intraclass classification (ICC) between two measurements on the same eye of the same
           participant should be at least 90%.

        2. Measurements between the two eyes should have a percent difference less than 5%.

      STUDY DESIGN Type of study: observational, single-center.

      Expected number of subjects:

      For primary objective: N=120 subjects For secondary objective #1: n= 62 For secondary
      objective #2: n= 12
