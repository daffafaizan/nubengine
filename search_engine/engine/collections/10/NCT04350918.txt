      mechanical neck pain from the Outpatient Physiotherapy Department of the Obafemi Awolowo
      University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife. Subjects were randomly allocated into the MET
      and SS groups. Subjects in MET group received 6 treatment sessions of Muscle Energy Technique
      in addition to conventional physiotherapy treatments. Patients in SS group received 6
      treatment sessions of Static Stretching in addition to conventional physiotherapy treatments.
      All subjects were treated twice a week for six weeks. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Neck
      Disability Index (NDI) were used to assess the pain intensity and functional disability at
      baseline, 3rd week and 6th week of treatment sessions respectively. Descriptive and
      Inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Alpha level was set at < 0.05.
