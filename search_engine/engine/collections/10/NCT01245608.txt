    
      2400 subjects will be randomly selected from participants of the Golestan Cohort Study (GCS)
      who are living in Gonbad and are over 50 years old. These subjects will be randomized to
      either receive PolyPill or no treatment.

      Those agreeing to the study will undergo additional measurements (in addition to the baseline
      measurements performed in the GCS) including liver-related tests such as liver enzyme levels,
      abdominal ultrasonography and liver stiffness measurement. Some additional tests such as
      color doppler ultrasonography of carotid vessels will also be performed.

      Subjects in the PolyPill arm who have no contraindication for the components of the pill will
      receive a single daily dose of PolyPill for 5 years.
