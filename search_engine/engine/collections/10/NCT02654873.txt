      with benign conditions. Routinely cholecystectomy specimens sent for histopathologic
      examination. The histopathologic examination of the cholecystectomy specimens are benign in
      most of the cases and the incidental malignancy of the gallbladder is 2-2.9% in the
      literature. The histopathologic evaluations of the gallbladder come with additional workload
      for pathology and surgery departments. Also there is additional cost for the patients.
      Because of that the idea of selective histopathologic examination has been raised.
