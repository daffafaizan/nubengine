      the symptoms associated with gingival inflammatory conditions or gums trauma in infant,
      recently, products containing Hyaluronic Acid (HA) have been marketed in Europe. In
      particular, Bioplax Limited is developing several high molecular weight HA medical devices
      characterized by the absence of preservatives, alcohol and dyes; therefore, the
      administration of these products in infants is safe and can help creating a natural
      protective layer on the gingival tissue. In previous clinical trials with these high
      molecular weight HA medical devices it was noted a periodontal tissue/fluid balance with
      accelerated healing and repair properties that could be of interest either for accelerating
      the wound healing process or for treating the complex physical symptoms (i.e. soreness and
      swelling of gums, crying, sleeplessness) related to the teething in infants. These data were
      confirmed by a recent pilot study on 18 infants suffering by teething where the two
      formulation of the tested high molecular weight HA medical device evidenced, at the end of
      treatment period, a statistically significant reduction of pain, swelling, gingival rush,
      hyper-salivation and redness, from baseline.
