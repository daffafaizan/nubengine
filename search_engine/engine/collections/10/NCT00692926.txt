      cells can be safely supplemented with transfusion of a portion of these cells that have been
      grown in a special system (designed to increase the number of cells transplanted) in the
      laboratory prior to the transplant. This system is currently in the early phases of testing
      in a FDA-IND-sponsored clinical trial. If the patient consents to participate in this study,
      approximately 1/5th (20%) of the cord blood unit selected for the transplant will be treated
      per protocol. The first 3 patients will receive ALDHbr sorted cells but not primed in
      culture. This is to test the safety of the ALDHbr cells. The treated cells will be given to
      the patient on the day of transplant approximately 4 hours after the standard or conventional
      transplant which will be given from the 80% fraction of the cord blood unit. A total of 26
      evaluable patients are to be enrolled as outlined below (protocol has been amended to allow
      this enrollment):

        -  10 evaluable patients who received ALDHbr freshly sorted cells (20% portion)

        -  10 evaluable patients who received ALDHbr sorted and cytokine primed cells (20% portion)

        -  3 evaluable patients who received a conventional cord blood unit and a cord blood unit
           that has been ALDHbr sorted (sort of the UCB unit will be done on Day -1 due to the time
           it takes to actually perform the sort)

        -  3 evaluable patients who received a conventional cord blood unit and a cord blood unit
           that has been ALDHbr sorted and cytokine primed (sort and priming will be done on day -5
           as described later in the protocol)
