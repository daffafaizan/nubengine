    
      Indolent lymphoma is a slow growing but incurable lymphoma which includes follicular lymphoma
      and marginal zone lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma are cancers of the
      B lymphocyte, a type of white blood cell. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug (a drug
      that affects the immune system) which alters the body's immune system and it may also
      interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels involved in tumor growth. Therefore,
      lenalidomide may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide has also been
      shown to restore the immune cells' ability to attack and kill tumor cells, an ability that
      may be inhibited by follicular lymphoma and other lymphomas. The combination of rituximab and
      lenalidomide may eliminate the cancer while restoring the immune system's ability to attack
      tumor cells.
