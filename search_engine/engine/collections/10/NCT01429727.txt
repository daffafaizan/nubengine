    
      Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is a relatively rare and poorly understood
      condition that has been reported to affect more women than men. The coronary arteries consist
      of three layers, and dissection occurs when two of these layers separate, enabling blood to
      flow into the space between the layers. As the blood accumulates, this can cause obstruction
      to normal blood flow within the heart, leading to chest pain, heart attack and even sudden
      death.

      The medical community has much to learn about treatment and prevention of this potentially
      fatal cardiovascular event. Mayo Clinic is conducting two new studies of SCAD. This study
      consists of building a database/registry of patients with SCAD (whether they have been
      patients at Mayo Clinic or not) to identify patterns of SCAD incidence, causes and
      associations that could guide future research. With participant consent, Mayo Clinic staff
      will request a copy of the original coronary angiogram when SCAD was diagnosed to confirm the
      diagnosis and determine eligibility. If eligible, study coordinators will contact the
      participant to provide more information about the studies and request a signed informed
      consent document.
