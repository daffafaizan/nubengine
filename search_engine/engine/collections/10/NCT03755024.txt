      estimated fetal weight and common ultrasound biometric measurements intended for worldwide
      use. WHO study was conducted in 10 countries including Egypt (Assiut).The study showed that
      fetal growth differs significantly between countries. Growth was to a small extent influenced
      by maternal age, height, weight, and parity, and by fetal sex. The study suggested that these
      WHO charts for growth are more suitable for international use than those commonly applied
      today. However, the differences between countries, with maternal factors, and with fetal sex
      mean that these growth charts may need to be adjusted for local clinical use to increase
      their diagnostic and predictive performance. In our setting, we are using the charts built in
      the ultrasound machines based on studies done in western countries. So, it is prudent now to
      implement the WHO fetal growth charts in our setting
