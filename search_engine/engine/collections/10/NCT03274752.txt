      functional changes of the myocardium, and is an important determinant of heart failure and
      cardiovascular outcome in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. Progression of heart
      failure secondary to the remodeling process results from dysregulation of the G
      protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Excessive adrenergic drive in patients with heart failure
      results in an enhanced activation of GPCR kinases (GRKs) that is considered to have a central
      role in adverse cardiac remodeling after ischemic injury. The selective Serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor paroxetine specifically binds to the catalytic domain of GRK2 as an off-target
      effect, and has been shown to reverse cardiac remodeling and increase left ventricular
      ejection fraction in a mouse model. The effect was observed at serum levels achieved with
      standard dosages of paroxetine, and was robust in mice with and without concomitant heart
      failure treatment, respectively.
