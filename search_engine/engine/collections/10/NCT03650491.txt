    
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of FOR46
      in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This study will be conducted in two
      parts:

      Dose escalation:

      This part will evaluate increasing doses of FOR46 to identify the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). The first patient enrolled on the study will receive the lowest dose of FOR46. Once
      this dose is shown to be safe, a second patient will be enrolled at the next higher dose.
      Patients will continue to be enrolled into either single or multiple patient groups receiving
      increasing doses until the MTD is reached.

      Dose expansion:

      This part of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity
      of FOR46 at a dose shown to be safe in the dose escalation part of the study.
