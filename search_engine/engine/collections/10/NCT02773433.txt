      and daily spontaneous trial combination, in patients requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation with low ventilator support (PaO2/Fio2 ratio > 200, FiO2 < 0.5 & PEEP <8) for a
      period not greater than 48 hrs.

      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that 50 % of patients approached will agree to
      enrollment in this clinical trial over a period of 4 months. The investigators hypothesize
      80% of the patients meeting inclusion criteria will be approached in a timely manner. The
      investigators also propose that PAV mode ventilation will be superior to ACV based on
      clinical outcome measurements.

      Study Subjects Consecutive adult patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation on low
      ventilator support (as mentioned above) for a period not greater than 48 hrs will be enrolled
      if they or their proxy consent for the study. The study will be performed in the intensive
      care units of University of Louisville and Jewish Hospital in Louisville, KY.
