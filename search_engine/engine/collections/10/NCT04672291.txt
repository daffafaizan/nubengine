      below under carefully monitored conditions, including examinations to rule out evidence of
      chronic mucosal inflammation due to the drug. 10 patients will receive drug and 3 will
      receive placebo. The safety stopping rule is to stop the trial early if 2 out of the first
      six, or 3 out of the first 10, or 4 out of the 13 patients receiving drug experience a dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT, see section 5.1 ) in either cycle 1 or cycle 2.

      If at most 3 patients out of the 10 receiving drug experience a DLT, then a Phase Ib
      expansion cohort will open. The expansion cohort will receive 3 cycles of therapy. A total of
      30 patients will be accrued and randomized 4:1 to receive drug (N=24) or placebo (N=6). There
      will be extensive assessment of toxicity and an early stopping rule will be employed as
      above. Safety and tolerability will be the primary endpoint but secondary endpoints include
      changes in immunological parameters.
