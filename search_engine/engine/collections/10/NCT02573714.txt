    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, drug trial using sub-dissociative intranasal
      ketamine as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy for the management of pediatric sickle
      cell disease vasoocclusive pain crises in resource-poor settings. Pediatric patients will be
      enrolled at a teaching and referral hospital in West Africa. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to the treatment arm - standard therapy plus sub-dissociative intranasal ketamine (1
      mg/kg) given at time zero) or the control arm - standard therapy plus intranasal normal
      saline (volume-matched to treatment arm), and patients will evaluated at standard intervals
      to assess for pain scores and vital signs (0 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 120
      minutes). Pain will be assessed using the Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R). Patients will
      also be observed for any potential side effects or adverse events. All patients will be
      contacted 2-3 weeks post intranasal medication administration for over-the-phone follow-up
      using a portion of the PedsQL-SCD questionnaire, to assess for basic quality of life related
      to pain management and treatment.
