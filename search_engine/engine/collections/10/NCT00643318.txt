    
      The objectives of this clinical evaluation are to assess the outcomes of patients who undergo
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to treat primary early stage non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) in patients (comprising of two cohorts, peripheral and central) who are not
      candidates for surgical resection because of high operative risks. In particular, the effect
      of CyberKnife SRS on clinical response rate, local control, progression-free survival,
      overall survival, dyspnea and QOL (for U.S. sites), and radiological findings over two years
      after treatment will be evaluated.
