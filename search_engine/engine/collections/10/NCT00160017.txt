      the prevention of severe complications provide evidence for the necessity of tight control.
      Different interventions and models to achieve strict control and reduce diabetes related
      risks of complications are available. These are, however, not implemented in daily practice.
      Our study focuses on this implementation problem: it tests whether implementing professional
      evidence-based guidelines and best practices -through participation of multidisciplinary
      teams in the Breakthrough collaborative- results in an improvement of diabetes care, its
      health outcomes and economic costs.

      Data on diabetes will also be used to explore and better understand the Breakthrough model as
      an implementation method. Only uncontrolled observational studies have, so far, described the
      outcomes of Breakthrough collaboratives. They also describe significant differences between
      teams in specific improvements made in patient care and organisational performance, resulting
      in different implementation and medical costs. There is hardly any information regarding
      these costs and the cost-effectiveness of collaboratives, and little knowledge about how they
      could be made more effective. Insight is also needed into the factors that influence the
      success of individual teams. There are no data regarding the sustainability of improvements.
