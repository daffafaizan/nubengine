    
      CODE is a multicenter prospective observational study to describe and quantify the outcomes
      of patients starting DTG-based regimens. The investigators will follow ART-na√Øve patients
      starting DTG-based regimens (Group 1), patients on stable ART regimens switching to DTG (any
      reason) (Group 2), and ART-experienced patients switching to DTG-containing regimens due to
      virological failure (Group 3). In addition, for comparison purposes, the investigators will
      collect data on patients who started a non-DTG containing regimen (Group 4) in the period for
      2014-2016 and did not switch to DTG-based regimens (Figure 1). Enrolled patients will be
      followed for 36 months.
