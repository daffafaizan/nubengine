    
      SPECIFIC AIMS AND HYPOTHESES

      Our overall objective in this study is to determine whether ADHD medication use is associated
      SNS activation, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness in children and adolescents.

      Our hypothesis is:

      Children and adolescents taking ADHD medications will have higher SNS activation, lower
      digital reactive hyperemia, and higher pulse wave velocity and aortic augmentation index
      compared to sibling controls without ADHD.

      Study Design We will obtain non-invasive measures of SNS activation (heart rate variability),
      endothelial function (digital reactive hyperemia and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation),
      and arterial stiffness (carotid-radial pulse wave velocity; aortic augmentation index) in
      youth taking ADHD stimulant medication and in their healthy siblings without ADHD.

      Study visits will be conducted at the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) at
      the University of Minnesota. All vascular testing will occur in the Vascular Biology
      Laboratory within the CTSI.
