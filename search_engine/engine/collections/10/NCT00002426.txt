    
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms in a 2:1 ratio. Approximately 260 patients receive ADV
      and approximately 130 patients receive placebo. Patients receive ADV or placebo in addition
      to L-carnitine and their current stable HAART regimen. Each patient receives blinded study
      medication for 48 weeks and is evaluated at Weeks 16, 24, and 48. Patients who reach the
      primary endpoint of virologic failure prior to Week 48 may continue blinded study medication
      or receive open-label ADV at the investigator's discretion. In both cases, patients continue
      their study visits as per the original visit schedule. Virologic failure is defined as 2
      consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements, after baseline, above 400 copies/ml (measured by the
      Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor UltraSensitive assay) drawn at least 14 days apart. All patients
      who complete study visits without treatment-limiting ADV toxicity may continue open-label ADV
      in the Maintenance Phase at the discretion of the principal investigator.
