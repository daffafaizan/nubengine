    
      Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition caused by diabetes in which new blood vessels grow
      on the retina (the back, inside part of the eye) and the iris. These vessels are not normal
      and may leak or break, causing bleeding in the eye. This process can lead to vision loss or
      blindness, glaucoma (disease of the eye where eye pressures are usually too high resulting in
      damage to the optic nerve), or other eye problems. This study is to determine if a drug
      called Macugen may help to stop the growth of these abnormal blood vessels on the iris.
