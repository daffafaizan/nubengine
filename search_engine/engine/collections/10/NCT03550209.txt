      that affect their quality of life and severely disrupt family well-being. Fatty acid
      supplements are natural products with anti-inflammatory properties often used for treatment
      of ASD symptoms, but their efficacy remains unproven. The objective of the proposed protocol
      is to quantify the impact of Omega 3-6 on pre-specified biological signatures. The hypotheses
      were formulated based on data from the investigators previous studies and other published
      data which suggest that the inflammatory markers, IL-1β, IL-2, and IFNγ are consistently
      elevated in children with ASD and decreases in these markers correlate with ASD symptom
      improvement. The investigators long-term goal is to identify effective treatments for ASD.
