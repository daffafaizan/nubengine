      respiratory infections, as well as have effects on multiple cytokines involved in
      immunomodulation and the bradykinin/renin-angiotensin system. Recently, data was released
      showing a correlation between baseline vitamin D deficiency status and increased risk of
      contracting COVID-19. Separate analysis shows that many of the deleterious effects of
      COVID-19 may be due to the bradykinin/RAS system, and that vitamin D is one plausible
      treatment option to modulate these effects. Studies are currently ongoing to determine if
      vitamin D supplementation of those hospitalized with COVID-19 has a beneficial effect on
      patient outcomes.

      Objective: To determine if those hospitalized with COVID-19 with baseline vitamin D
      deficiency, have worse outcomes during their stay than those who are not vitamin D deficient
      at baseline.

      Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a retrospective cohort study at an urban academic
      medical center which included patients with a 25-hydroxycholecalciferol level measured within
      one year before being tested for COVID-19 and hospitalized from March 9th to September 7th,
      2020.

      Exposures: Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the last measurement of
      25-hydroxycholecalciferol less than 20 ng/mL before COVID testing (within one year).

      Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes investigated include length of stay, need
      for supplemental oxygen, ICU admission, need for invasive life support (mechanical
      ventilation, vasopressors, dialysis), and discharge status (discharged alive vs. death).
