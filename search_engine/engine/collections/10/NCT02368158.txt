      need recommendations corresponding to fitness of driving after their discharge from hospital
      to home or rehabilitation. A policy paper of the German Cardiac Society (DGK) of 2010
      discusses the aptitude of driving a car of cardiovascular patients on experience but only
      little trial data.Therefore predictors of reduced fitness to drive a car are determined via
      medical data in comparison to data elevated while "driving" in a simulator and evaluated via
      Lane Change Test (LCT). Also monitoring of the fitness of driving in the car, automotive
      monitoring via contactless sensors, could be helpful for judgement.Therefore possible
      evaluation of heart and breathing rate will be examined with contactless measurements via
      video camera.
