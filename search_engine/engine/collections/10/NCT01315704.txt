      disorders (ADRD), few studies have focused on cognitive motor effects of anti-dementia drugs
      and vitamin D.

      The objectives of this study are to

        -  Compare characteristics of gait and balance measured among patients with ADRD separated
           into 3 groups according to stages of disease (i.e., pre-dementia, mild and moderate
           dementia stages)

        -  To determine the effects of anti-dementia drugs and vitamin D on cognitive motor
           abnormalities

        -  To determine whether motor abnormalities could be associated with cognitive impairments,
           specifically executive dysfunctions

        -  To establish a database at Angers University Memory Center.
