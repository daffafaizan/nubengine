      high-risk ischemic stroke patients in adults. All patients included in the study should meet
      the inclusion criteria. All participants will receive one of antiplatelet drugs (Aspirin or
      Clopidogrel). Half of participants will receive Sanchitongshu and Aspirin or Clopidogrel,
      while the other half will receive a placebo and Aspirin or Clopidogrel. All participants will
      be assigned to either the active group or the control group randomly. During the clinical
      trail both doctors and patients are double-blind except serious adverse events occurred.
