      non-invasive, low intensity and low frequency electromagnetic fields targeting a patient's
      central nervous system (CNS) for motor rehabilitation. The technology behind the device
      utilizes machine learning (ML) tools to identify high-resolution spectral patterns, which
      characterize motor functions within EEG and MEG/EMG measurements taken during functional
      motor tasks. These patterns are then translated into a frequency-dependent, low intensity and
      non-invasive electromagnetic treatment, which applies similar patterns directly to a
      patient's CNS.

      BQ treatment is intended to improve upper limb motor function of chronic SCI patients, over
      18 years of age with an incomplete injury and upper limb motor impairment (AIS B - D,
      Cervical C1 - C8). The treatment will be administered as an adjunctive treatment along with a
      typical pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological treatment plan.

      Study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter study with physical therapy (PT) run-in
      phase, where each subject serves as his/her own control. Study population will include at
      least 8 individuals with traumatic or (incident-related) non-traumatic chronic cervical
      incomplete SCI (AIS B-D) who are 12 - 30 months post-injury, with score between 5 - 35 on
      GRASSP strength subscore on at least one side, and medically stable.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the BQ system treatment in
      improving upper limb motor function of chronic SCI subjects, compared to their own baseline
      after stability has been demonstrated during physical therapy run-in period, as measured by
      improvement in GRASSP strength subscore. An additional secondary objective of the study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of the BQ system treatment in improving motor recovery, spasticity,
      pain, QOL, and imaging outcomes in the stated population.
