      randomized controlled clinical trial. 72 patients who have been diagnosed with hypertensive
      bradyarrhythmia were selected and randomly divided into research group and control group. The
      five symptoms (palpitation, short of breath, angina, dizzy and lumbar debility) were graded.
      The research group received regular medication against hypertension and the personalized
      formulas based on syndrome differentiation, meanwhile the control group only received the
      regular medication. 2 weeks after treatment, all the symptoms were graded again.
