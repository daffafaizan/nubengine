      into one of three study groups. At the end of anaesthesia, groups H0, H1, and H2 were given
      intravenous (IV) saline, haloperidol 1 mg, and haloperidol 2 mg, respectively. All patients
      were given dexamethasone during the induction of anaesthesia. The overall early (0-2 h) and
      late (2-24 h) incidences of nausea, vomiting, rescue anti-emetic administration, pain, and
      adverse effects (cardiac arrhythmias and extrapyramidal effects) were assessed
      postoperatively. The sedation score was recorded in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU).
