      for lobectomy in humans. All patients planned to undergo a lobectomy by VATS at the CHUM -
      HÃ´pital Notre-Dame will be approached. In our institution, lobectomies are either done open
      (thoracotomy) or by minimally invasive approach, known as VATS (video assisted thoracoscopic
      surgery). This decision is based on the surgeon, tumor size, tumor localization and patient
      characteristics. Only patients already planned for a VATS lobectomy will be approached.
      Potential patients will be selected by going over the operation request forms. Patients
      booked for a VATS lobectomy will be approached either in the preoperative clinic or the day
      before surgery, when admitted. Aim is to recruit 20 patients.
