      recruited in this study after they sign the informed consent.5ml venous blood was extracted
      from the peripheral vein before the operation to detect the renal function, the genotype and
      enzyme activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ,and the levels of oxidative stress and
      inflammation.Another 5ml venous blood was extracted from the peripheral vein 24-72 hours
      after the operation to detect the renal function and the levels of oxidative stress and
      inflammation.Activated oxygen protein products , 4-HNE and hs-CRP as markers for oxidative
      stress and inflammation.The renal function index contains serum creatinineï¼Œurea nitrogen and
      cystatin C.
