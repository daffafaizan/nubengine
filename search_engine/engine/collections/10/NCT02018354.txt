    
      This study is a pragmatic study for a parallel groups, randomized clinical trial in which 600
      patients with anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency who are undergoing surgery, are
      randomly allocated to either ACL reconstruction alone (control) or ACL reconstruction with
      lateral extra-articular tenodesis (experimental). Surgeons, data collectors, and the data
      analyst will be blind to group allocation. The primary outcome is rate of failure. Secondary
      outcomes include disease specific quality of life, return to function and sport. Patients are
      followed for two years postoperative.
