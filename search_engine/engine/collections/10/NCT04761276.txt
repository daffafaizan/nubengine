      lenses (IOL) destined to replace the crystalline lens. While new surgical techniques for
      removing the crystalline lens have been developed, these lenses have been considerably
      perfected to resemble the natural crystalline lens as closely as possible.

      The objectives of the study is to evaluate efficacy and long-term safety of the Lucidis lens.
      Through this study, the objective is to obtain an up-to-date clinical evaluation of the
      medical device thus supplementing data from experimental trials. Clinical and functional
      changes in the implanted eyes among a patient population in which the opaque crystalline lens
      resulting from cataract was removed and replaced by a Lucidis IOL will be described.
