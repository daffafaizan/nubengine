release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue obtained from newborninfants .summary the role played by mobilization of free fatty acids (ffa) fromadipose tissue in producing the typically high serum ffa levels of humaninfants has been studied . ffa concentrations in the serum and subcuta-neous adipose tissue from the gluteal region were determined duringpostnatal development . a maximum level was reached within 24 hr afterbirth, after which there was a gradual fall . in serum the ffa level atthe end of 12 months was still higher than that in adults, while the ffalevel in adipose tissue was lower at 3 months than in adults .incubation of small pieces of adipose tissue in krebs-ringer phosphatebuffer containing 4 albumin led to release of ffa into the medium . thisrelease could be suppressed by the addition of glucose (200 mg/100 ml)for tissue from all age groups except the youngest (0-15 hr after birth)
