      prolonged and exaggerated immune responses to antigens and irritants. Psoriasis, a relatively
      common disease, is characterized by T cell-mediated inflammation in affected skin. In this
      study, the safety, tolerance, immunologic effects, and clinical activity of subcutaneous (SC)
      recombinant human (rh) IL-10 will be evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
      There will be 2 groups of patients, randomized to receive either 20 (micro)g/kg rhIL-10 SC 3
      times weekly (20 patients) or SC placebo (10 patients). This double-blind phase will continue
      for a total of 12 weeks and the principal evaluation will be the comparison between baseline
      and 12 week Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores. Patients will come for an initial
      screening visit at day 0, and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12, with follow-up visits at weeks
      16 and 20.

      All patients will be offered rhIL-10 at 12 weeks (following the blinded portion of the study
      protocol). Patients initially receiving active medication who wish to continue rhIL-10
      therapy will be kept on the drug. This open-label portion of the study will continue for up
      to an additional 12 weeks. Patients continuing with active drug will be evaluated at weeks
      14, 16, 20, and 24.

      Skin disease activity and toxicity will be assessed and recorded throughout the study. In
      addition, research studies will include functional assays to assess cytokine secretion and
      immunologic function of peripheral blood cells and immunohistochemical characterization of
      the inflammatory cells in skin.
