      common methods for treatment implant with inflammation include surgical and global
      non-surgical treatment.

      The non-surgical treatment includes soft tissue debridement with various tools which
      including manual, ultrasonic rotators, lasers and delayed release devices.

      Using an electromagnetic field to induce bony healing in fractures and around implants is
      being investigated for studies and was found to be effective and safe. The electric field
      lowers osteoclasts activity, speeds up osteoid construction and stimulates creation blood
      vessels development. Forty patients who will attend to the department of periodontology at
      Rambam health care campus, at the School ofpostgraduate Dentistry, which will meet the
      research criteria, will be recruited. All patients will exhibit a moderate-onset gum
      infection around one of the implants.
