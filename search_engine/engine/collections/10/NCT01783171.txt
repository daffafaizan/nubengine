    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and toxicity of the combination of
      MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) and dinaciclib in patients with advanced pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma (Level 2.5, determined August 2015: Dinaciclib 9 mg/m2 intravenously [IV];
      MK-2206 135 mg orally [PO]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the preliminary efficacy of the combination of MK-2206 and dinaciclib in metastatic
      pancreatic cancer patients as determined by disease control rate in an expansion cohort of
      patients at the MTD.

      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the combination of MK-2206 and
      dinaciclib.

      III. Analyze pre-treatment tumor specimens for activation of retrovirus-associated
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence (RAS) downstream pathway signaling as potential
      predictors of treatment benefit.

      IV. Correlate post-treatment pharmacodynamic (PD) changes in phosphorylated extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1
      (p-AKT), p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6), phosphorylated DNA-directed ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) polymerase II subunit RPB1 (pPOLR2), phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB),
      proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67), and cleaved caspase-3 in tumor biopsies and
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells with MK-2206 and dinaciclib exposure and treatment
      response to demonstrate proof-of-concept and assess for post-treatment predictive biomarkers.

      V. To assess the effect of polymorphic variations in candidate genes (cytochrome P450 3A4/5
      [CYP3A4/5], ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B [MDR/TAP], member 1 [ABCB1]) and other genetic
      alterations that may be discovered during the conduct of the study, on MK-2206 and dinaciclib
      disposition, toxicity, and efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1.

      ARM B: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO on day 1 of course 1.

      After day 1, all patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and dinaciclib
      IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
