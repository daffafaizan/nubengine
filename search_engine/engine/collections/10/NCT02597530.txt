      at acupoints to treat diseases by Jingluo (the system of meridians, through which energy is
      thought to ï¬‚ow through the body in Chinese medicine). It is usually applied to relieve pain.
      Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture on
      the consumption of intra-operative anaesthetics and on drug-related side-effects, with
      promising results. Compared with acupuncture or electroacupuncture, transcutaneous electric
      acupoint stimulation(TEAS) is a non-invasive technique and has some advantages, including no
      risk of infections or needle-induced contagious disease and reduced fear of stimulation. It
      can potentially be applied by any anaesthetist or pre-operative personnel with minimal
      training.Thus, investigators conducted this controlled, prospective, double-blinded clinical
      trial to investigate whether treating by transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation
      combined with general anesthetic during peri-operative could alleviate the dosage of
      anesthetic drugs compared with control and sham group.
