      rhinomanometry, subjects will be scheduled for two 15-minute exposure sessions with either:
      cold-dry air, or warm-moist air. Subjects will rate symptoms (and have their nasal airway
      resistance measured in triplicate) prior to exposure and at 15-min. intervals post-exposure
      until an hour has passed.
