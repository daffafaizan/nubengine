    
      This study is designed as 2 parts.

        -  Part 1 is a blinded, placebo-controlled inpatient trial in a total of 20 volunteers (14
           vaccinees and 6 controls) to determine the safety and immunogenicity. Volunteers will be
           vaccinated with a single oral dose of 104 colony forming unit (cfu) of WRSS1 or placebo
           given with bicarbonate buffer.

        -  Part 2 will be started approximately 60 days after WRSS1 vaccination. This part is an
           inpatient phase II efficacy trial involving a challenge with the S.sonnei 53G of 10
           vaccinees from the first part and 10 na√Øve controls.
