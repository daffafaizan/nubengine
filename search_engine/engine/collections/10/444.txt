5274. urinary excretion of estrone,estradiol and estriol by patients withprostatic cancer and benign prostatichypertrophyand hopkins c.e.urinary estrone, estradiol, and estriolfractions excreted by 21 patients withprostatic cancer, 17 patients with benignhypertrophy, and 59 clinically wellsubjects were assayed to determine whetherdifferences exist.  absolute levels ofestrone, estradiol, and estriol fractions werenot significantly different.  theexcretion of relatively lower levels of estroneand estradiol, and relatively higherlevels of estriol by patients with prostaticcancer compared to clinically wellsubjects resulted in significantly lowerproportions of the total estrogen beingexcreted as estrone and estradiol.  differences inthe proportions of estrogen frac-tions between patients with benign hypertrophyand clinically well subjects werenot significant.  with the exception of a significantlyhigher percentage of the totalestrogen being excreted as estrone by the patientswith benign hypertrophy,differences between that group and the cancergroup were also not significant.clinical variations between the 3 groups, andwithin the cancer and hypertrophygroups, preclude assignment of significantdifferences to prostatic dystrophiesalone.  cancer patients experiencing inanitiondue to a loss of appetite excretedsignificantly lower levels of estrone than patientswho reported no loss of appetite.significantly lower levels of estrone were excretedby patients with benign hyper-trophy hospitalized 6 days or more compared topatients hospitalized 5 days or less.a significantly higher urinary estrone-androsteroneratio was present in the cancergroup than in the clinically well group.  it is notbelieved, however, that an arbi-trary ratio can be used to suggest an internalestrogen-androgen imbalance.
