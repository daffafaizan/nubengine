      household members of patients diagnosed with active TB: holiday-based screening in a rural
      South African province (Limpopo) and off-peak (weekend/evening) screening in an urban
      settlement into which many residents of Limpopo migrate for work. The investigators will
      enroll index cases of TB plus their household contacts in each setting and randomize them to
      novel versus standard contact investigation. In Specific Aim 1, investigators will use whole
      genome sequencing of all cases, overlaying transmission trees with data on human movement, to
      evaluate associations between mobility and TB transmission in this population. In Specific
      Aim 2, investigators will employ a multidisciplinary approach to compare novel versus
      standard contact investigation in each setting along the following dimensions: (a)
      effectiveness (number of secondary TB cases diagnosed and starting treatment); (b)
      implementation (reach, fidelity, and maintenance of contact investigation outside of business
      hours); (c) cost-effectiveness (cost per disability-adjusted life year) and budget impact;
      and (d) projected population-level impact on TB incidence. Successful completion of these
      aims will have long-term impact by characterizing the role of mobility in fueling TB
      epidemics and testing two tailored approaches to improve TB control in highly mobile
      populations - an underserved group that is increasingly recognized as playing a major role in
      global TB transmission.
