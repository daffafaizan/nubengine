    
      Induction ATO 0.15 mg/kg/día IV in continuous perfusion 1-2 hours/day until complete response
      (CR) or maximum of 60 days.

      Oral hydroxyurea treatment (initial dose 2 g/day)is recommended in patients with leucocyte
      counts at relapse >10x109/L or in the two first weeks of induction.

      Isolated molecular relapsed patients will be treated with ATO (same dose) 5 days at week,
      during 6 weeks.

      Consolidation ATO 0.15 mg/kg/día IV 5 days at week, during 5 weeks, combined with oral ATRA
      45 mg/m²/day during the same 5 weeks.

      Post-consolidation therapy TPH (autologous or allogenic) in candidate patients. In case of
      molecular remission, is recommended autologous-TPH.

      Patients no candidates to auto-TPH or alo-TPH, should will follow treatment with ATO cycles +
      ATRA +/- Mylotarg.

        1. Option Alo-TPH If PCR post-consolidation is negative is recommended auto-TPH. However,
           if alo-TPH is decided, it will be done immediately without preceding chemotherapy.

           If PCR post-consolidation is positive, should done alo-TPH.

        2. Option Auto-TPH If PCR post-consolidation is negative it will be administered one cycle
           of MTZ + Ara-C follow by auto-TPH.

           In cas of failure: a) if patient has autologous stem cells preserved (PCR negative) are
           suitable for auto-TPH; b) patients with HLA-compatible donor who are suitable for
           allogenic stem cell transplantation should be transplanted; c) Patients who are not
           eligible for allogenic or autologous transplantation, receive various cycles with ATO +
           ATRA combined or not with Mylotarg.

           If PCR post-consolidation is positive and patient is eligible for allogenic TPH, should
           be done a allogenic TPH.

           If patient is no eligible for allogenic TPH or dont has compatible donor, will be
           administrate one cycle of MTZ + Ara-C and collect stem cells. Autologous transplantation
           will be done if after this cycle, a molecular remission is obtained. No molecular
           remission or no enough stem cells collection, patient follows treatment with subsequent
           cycles of ATO + ATRA combined or no with Mylotarg.

        3. ATO + ATRA combined or no with Mylotarg Patients no eligible to autologous TPH or
           allogenic TPH follows treatment with subsequent cycles of ATO + ATRA combined or no with
           Mylotarg.

      If Mylotarg is no possible, treatment will be with subsequent cycles of ATO + ATRA.

      ATO + ATRA + Mylotarg: Mylotarg 6 mg/m2 day 1, ATO 0.15 mg/kg days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12, and
      ATRA 45 mg/m2/d days 1 to 15. Doses of mylotarg should be reduced to 3 mg/m2 in patients aged
      over 60 years. Administration of 3 cycles with a month interval, follow of 3 to 6 cycles of
      ATO + ATRA without Mylotarg. After, ATRA 45 mg/m2/d 15 days every 3 months until complete two
      years of maintenance.

      ATO + ATRA: ATO 0.15 mg/kg days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12, and ATRA 45 mg/m2/d days 1 to 15, every
      29 days. Administration of 9 cycles, and followed by ATRA 45 mg/m2/d during 15 days every 3
      months until complete two years of maintenance.
