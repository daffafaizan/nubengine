      administered as an intravenous infusion over 48 hours, to adults with advanced or recurrent
      solid tumors or recurrent glioblastoma who have failed standard therapy, or for whom no
      effective standard therapy is available.

      The primary goal of the study is to find the highest dose of BAL101553 that can safely be
      given to humans and to assess what side effects occur. The study will start by treating
      patients with a low dose. Once it has been shown that this low dose is well tolerated, new
      patients will be treated at higher dose levels ("dose escalation"). Once the highest, well
      tolerated dose is identified, 20 new patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian
      cancer and 20 new patients with recurrent glioblastoma will be treated at that dose (this
      part is called "dose expansion") to further assess the tolerability and potential anticancer
      activity of oral BAL101553. The study will also measure pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic
      effects and assess biomarkers.
