      cost-saving at an estimated $89 billion in 2030. However, nearly all (99.6%) drug trials for
      AD have failed, and no drugs can yet prevent, cure, or even slow AD. This highlights an
      urgent and pressing need to develop behavioral interventions to prevent AD and slow its
      progression. Aerobic exercise and cognitive training are two such promising interventions.

      Aerobic exercise and cognitive training are 2 promising interventions for preventing AD.
      Aerobic exercise increases aerobic fitness, which in turn improves brain structure and
      function, while cognitive training improves selective neural function intensively. Hence,
      concurrent aerobic exercise and cognitive training may very well have an additive or
      synergistic effect on cognition by complementary strengthening of different neural functions
      because aerobic exercise and virtual reality cognitive training depend on discrete neuronal
      mechanisms for their therapeutic effects.

      The purpose of this Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the efficacy and
      additive/synergistic effects of a 3-month combined cycling and virtual reality cognitive
      training intervention on cognition and relevant mechanisms (aerobic fitness, physical
      function), in persons with subjective cognitive decline at risk for developing AD.
