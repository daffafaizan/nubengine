      Objective improvement of lung function, i.e.:

        -  Improvement of SO2, pO2 or pCO2 in oxygen dependent or improvement of FiO2 in
           respiration dependent patients ≥ 20 % or

        -  Reduction of oxygen need in oxygen dependent patients ≥ 1L O2/min with constant
           parameters at blood gas analysis (BGA) or

        -  Improvement of obstructive parameters ≥ 20 % or

        -  Improvement of lung function score (LFS) at least about one grade Improvement of lung
           function should be detectable at least by two consecutive examinations of lung function
           or BGA within at least four weeks.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Morphological improvement of BO/BOOP at CT scan

        -  Reduction of steroids about at least 20 %
