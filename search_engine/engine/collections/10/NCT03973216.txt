      primary care / emergency physician practicing in Toronto, Ontario. The program was started in
      2014 and is run through a medical centre in Toronto, Ontario. The purposes of the program are
      to understand:

        -  key concepts of yoga, mindfulness, compassion, acceptance and how these can help with
           personal transformation

        -  how stress is carried in the body (embodiment of stress) and how stress manifests as
           anxiety, pain, or other symptoms

        -  what happens when stress accumulates in the body

        -  the role of self-compassion in the response to stress

        -  how to cope with difficult emotions that may contribute to stress

        -  how to deal with difficult people and trying relationships

        -  the importance of connecting with, and caring for ourselves to reduce accumulated stress

        -  how to solidify healthier patterns to build resilience to stress faced in daily life.

      This study evaluates the 9 weekly sessions using a before-after interventional design.
      Participants have data collected at baseline, and at 9 weeks and 8 months after the yoga
      program ends, and changes in mental health outcomes are observed.
