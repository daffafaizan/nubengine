      respectively, and are established treatments to manage blood pressure (BP) levels for
      patients with hypertension; both medications are currently marketed in the United States and
      Europe as anti-hypertensive agents. This is a an open-label, randomized, single dose,
      three-way crossover study enrolling 24 healthy adult male and female subjects under fasting
      conditions. Each subject will participate in three treatment periods. The study consists of a
      screening phase, three treatment periods and a follow-up visit. Subjects will receive each of
      the following three treatments administered in a randomized three-way crossover design: a
      reference treatment consisting of a single 5mg amlodipine tablet and a single 100mg losartan
      tablet; a single fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 5mg amlodipine and 100mg
      losartan; and another single fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 5mg amlodipine and
      100mg losartan; all three treatments will be administered once orally and in a fasted state.
      Serial blood samples will be obtained at pre-defined timepoints for pharmacokinetic analysis
      of amlodipine, losartan and carboxylic acid (this is the primary active losartan metabolite).
      Safety assessments will include measurements of orthostatic vital signs, electrocardiograms
      (ECG), collection of adverse events (AE) and clinical laboratory tests.
