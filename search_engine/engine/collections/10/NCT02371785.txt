      and stents to blockages in the coronary arteries. This study will evaluate the feasibility of
      CorPath 200 System to deliver guide wires and balloons to blockages in non-coronary arteries.

      Guide wires and balloons are delivered to blockages in the lower limbs manually by doctors.If
      this study shows that guide wires and balloons can be safely delivered to blockages in the
      lower limbs, then it will be an alternative for physicians.
