      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
           in medically inoperable patients with centrally located stage I non-small cell lung
           cancer. (Phase I)

        -  To estimate the local control rate of SBRT at the MTD in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the rates of adverse events (other than dose-limiting toxicity) of ≥ grade 3
           that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment and that occurs within 1
           year after the start of SBRT in these patients.

        -  To estimate the rates of late adverse events (i.e., occurs > 1 year after the start of
           SBRT) in these patients.

        -  To estimate the local control and progression-free and overall survival rates in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy every 2 days over 1½-2 weeks [total of 5
      fractions (FX)] in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then
      every 6 months for 2 years, then annually.
