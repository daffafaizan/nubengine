      (CBPR) principles to identify the needs and preferences of community members with regard to
      energy balance. In the intervention phase, this group-randomized trial administers and
      evaluates an intergenerational, culturally appropriate energy balance intervention aimed at
      increasing fruit and vegetable intake and increasing physical activity among participants in
      6 distressed Appalachian counties. Faith institutions are recruited and randomized to
      treatment or wait-list control conditions, and participants are recruited and enrolled within
      those institutions. Focusing on Appalachian children, parents, and grandparents, local lay
      health advisors deliver a series of group presentations, adapted from We Can! and Media Smart
      Youth. In addition, the project provides culturally consonant leave-behind "booster"
      activities, including square dances, cooking classes, and community gardens.
