      for a CA to learn lifesaving CPR skills. We will modify the AHA CPR video using the new AHA
      recommendations for bystanders which suggests doing chest compression only CPR. Using the
      original AHA video and our modified chest compression only video, we will randomize family
      members of patients at high risk for CA to one of these groups. Our research assistants will
      also be blinded to which video these subjects will be watching. After watching the video, we
      will have the subjects perform CPR on a mannequin using a CPR recording device that records
      chest compression rate and depth. We will follow up with the family members at 3 months, 6
      months and 12 months to see if they retained their CPR knowledge and skills and to see if
      they had been in a situation where their CPR skills were needed and assess whether they
      performed their skills or not. We will also measure the number of people with whom the
      subjects shared their CPR Anytime kits-a quantity known as the multiplier effect to determine
      if they had shared the CPR Anytime kit with their family and friends, thereby increasing the
      possible number of lay persons trained in CPR and in turn able to perform bystander CPR if
      needed.
