        -  Determine if gene expression patterns that correlate with treatment response and
           survival can be identified using DNA microarrays in patients with newly diagnosed head
           and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and
           radiotherapy.

        -  Determine if protein expression patterns that correlate with treatment response and
           survival in HNSCC can be identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption
           ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS).

        -  Determine if the molecular signature of human papilloma virus-16 infection can be
           determined using DNA microarray and MALDI-TOFMS and correlate with gene and protein
           expression, treatment response, and survival.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples are analyzed by DNA microarray analysis and validated by
      quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Protein and gene
      expression patterns are analyzed by laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass
      spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry, and PCR. Samples are also analyzed by tissue microarray and
      immunohistochemistry.
