        -  Compare the bone mineral density in the lumbar spine after 12 and 36 months of therapy
           with zoledronate, calcium, and cholecalciferol (vitamin D) in women with breast cancer
           receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to intent to treat with tamoxifen (yes vs no) and node status (negative vs positive
      vs unknown [for patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning on the first day of adjuvant chemotherapy (or within 3 months after the
           first day), patients receive zoledronate IV over at least 15 minutes once every 3 months
           during months 1-24 and oral calcium and oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D) daily during
           months 1-36.

        -  Arm II: Beginning on the first day of adjuvant chemotherapy (or within 3 months after
           the first day), patients receive oral calcium and oral vitamin D daily during months
           1-36 and zoledronate IV over at least 15 minutes once every 3 months during months
           13-36.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 24 months.
