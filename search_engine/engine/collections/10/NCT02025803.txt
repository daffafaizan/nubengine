    
      In animal models, co-administration of TAS 114 and capecitabine has shown antitumor effects
      exceeding the maximum efficacy obtained by capecitabine alone. Developing a novel
      chemotherapy based on the combined use of TAS-114 and capecitabine may fulfill the need for
      more efficacious treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors.

      The study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor
      activity of the TAS-114/ capecitabine regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors, will be
      conducted in two parts: a Dose-Escalation Phase (Part 1) to determine the MTD; and an
      Expansion Phase (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy with the
      MTD.
