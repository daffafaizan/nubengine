      U.S. Time to progression in advanced disease remains poor and further study of newer agents
      with novel mechanisms of action is needed to improve duration and quality of life for NSCLC
      patients.

      Sorafenib is an oral-multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and tumor
      angiogenesis. Sorafenib has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of NSCLC both in
      combination with chemotherapy and as monotherapy. A recent intra-patient dose escalation
      trial of sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma showed positive response rates and tolerability up
      to 1200mg in 91% of patients.

      This study attempts a similar dose-escalation of sorafenib in NSCLC patients.
