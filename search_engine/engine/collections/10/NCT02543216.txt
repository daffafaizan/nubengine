    
      Lean and overweight subjects (BMI >20kg/m2 <29kg/m2 ) with CC and TT genotypes of FADS1
      polymorphism (rs174547) were recruited from the METSIM study (METabolic Syndrome in Men,
      currently >10000 men included from the population living in Kuopio). The potential
      participants were asked to contact study nurse if willing to participate. Twenty six subjects
      with CC genotype were selected after matching with thirty six subjects with the TT genotype
      for age, BMI and medication.

      Study diet were isocaloric following the habitual diet of the participants with a supplement
      of 30-50 ml (25-45 g) sunflower oil daily depending on body weight. Thus, approximately 16-28
      g (6 E%) LA daily were provided on top of the average intake of approximately 10-12 g (4.5
      E%). This dose of sunflower oil is not known to cause any side effects or adverse events and
      even higher doses have been safe.

      Food records were collected at the beginning (4 days) and during the third week of the study
      (7 days) to estimate daily intake of macronutrients and specifically of different fatty
      acids.
