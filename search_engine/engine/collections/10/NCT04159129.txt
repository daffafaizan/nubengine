      road in time. Patients who are unable to cross the road at this speed, expose themselves to
      an increased level of stress and possibly the risk of accidents. Thus, they are discouraged
      from participating in an active social life.

      An UK study (Nolan et al., Thorax 2018) showed that only 10.7% of the 926 patients with
      moderate COPD attained a walking speed of 1.2m/sec. As PR plays a key role in the management
      of chronic lung diseases in order to improve patientsÂ´ exercise capacity, the aim of this
      study was to evaluate the PR effects on the Walking Speed in patients with COPD or ILD. The
      investigators hypothesize that PR improves the ability to cross the road in the appropriate
      time.
