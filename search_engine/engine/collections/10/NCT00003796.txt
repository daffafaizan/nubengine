      I. Evaluate the response rate and time to treatment failure in patients with refractory
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast treated with irofulven.

      II. Assess the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      III. Determine the population pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic
      relationships of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive irofulven IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment continues every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
