      surgeons as an emergency. Whether or not such patients have appendicitis is crucial to their
      assessment. In UK practice, when the diagnosis is unclear, ultrasound scanning (US) is
      commonly used to investigate the problem. US is very safe but it will only visualise the
      appendix in the minority of cases. As a result, the sensitivity for diagnosing appendicitis
      in this setting is probably only 5-30%. Alternatively, computed tomography (CT) is an
      accurate way of diagnosing appendicitis in over 90% of cases. CT scans are readily available
      and with modern scanners, high quality images can be achieved with lower radiation doses.
      Unenhanced scanning avoids the use of contrast media and permits further reductions in
      ionising radiation exposure.
