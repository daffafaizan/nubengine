      post-authorization study in Germany and Austria. The study will evaluate the use of
      follitropin alfa (Bemfola®) in controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI.

      About 30 ART centres will be involved in the study. Upon site initiation, each investigator
      site will enrol the subjects who meet the inclusion criteria.

      As this is an observational study, there will be no additional treatment or diagnostic
      procedures performed on subjects other than those of the investigators' local routine
      clinical practice. The decision to start ART treatment and to use Bemfola® in controlled
      ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) following a GnRH antagonist protocol will be made
      independently by the investigators as per the ART centre's protocol, preceding patient
      enrollment for this study.
