      (RA), but its efficacy is highly variable and it can lead to severe side effects. There are
      currently no reliable predictors of methotrexate efficacy for people with early RA.

      Microbial dysbiosis (an imbalanced microbiome) has recently been implicated in RA, with
      associations between specific microbes and RA biomarkers or disease activity. Gut microbes
      have extensive capabilities in terms of xenobiotic (e.g. drug) metabolism. Several gut
      microbes are able to alter the drug methotrexate in vitro, and it is possible this could
      effect drug efficacy in vivo. Alternatively methotrexate efficacy could be affected by
      baseline microbial composition or alterations to microbial composition over the course of
      treatment.
