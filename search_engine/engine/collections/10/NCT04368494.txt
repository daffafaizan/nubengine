      condition begins between 20-30 years of age. Exercise is encouraged as an essential treatment
      of axSpA, with the potential to promote well-being, flexibility, posture and pain management.
      Axial spondyloarthritis is an inflammatory arthritis and raised levels of indicators can be
      detected in the blood (e.g C-reactive protein). These markers are released as a consequence
      of the condition, but some, such as TNF-alpha, also promote further disease development.

      In other patient groups with inflammatory diseases it has been demonstrated that regular
      exercise (brisk walking) can lower the levels of pro-inflammatory blood markers and increase
      levels of anti-inflammatory markers, independent of weight loss. Despite axSpA being an
      inflammatory condition with prescribed medication focused on reducing inflammation, there are
      no studies which have assessed the potential of exercise as an anti-inflammatory treatment in
      axSpA.

      This research study will investigate the effect of 12 weeks of a home-based walking exercise
      intervention on measures of systemic inflammation and body composition. Measures of
      well-being and disease activity will also be investigated using established and validated
      methods. There will be an exercise and control group, both containing 10 participants. In the
      control group, patients will carry on with their normal activity. This proof-of-concept study
      will determine the potential of exercise as an additional anti-inflammatory treatment for
      patients with axSpA.
