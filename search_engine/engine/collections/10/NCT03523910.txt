      different types of PAH, to determine the temporal changes in these interactions with PAH
      progression and to quantify the effects of exercise on right ventricular function. The
      inclusion of the subpopulation of PAH patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) was a result of
      the anticipation that this group has worse arterial stiffening than other groups, and
      consequently more inefficient right ventricular-pulmonary vascular interactions, which
      account for their worse prognosis.
