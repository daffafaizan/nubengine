    
      Monocular and Binocular Unaided (UCVA) and Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) will be
      measured at 6m in LogMAR units under photopic conditions (85cd/m2).

      Subjective Refraction will be performed to establish any residual refractive error will for
      distance, intermediate and near.

      Defocus Profiles (visual acuity over imposed defocus) are measured for each patient. The
      patient observes the 6m LogMAR chart through best distance correction, then defocusing is
      achieved by the addition of pairs of lenses from +2.00D to -4.00D in 0.50D steps.. The LogMAR
      acuity will be recorded and the data plotted.

      Contrast Sensitivity will be evaluated monocularly under photopic (85cd/m2) conditions and
      mesopic (4cd/m2) using the Pelli-Robson Contrast Sensitivity Chart.

      Near and intermediate performance will be evaluated using the Radner Reading Charts to assess
      acuity (LogRAD units) and reading speed in photopic conditions 85cd/m2
