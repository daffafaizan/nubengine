      significant departures from current trichiasis surgery procedure (bilamellar tarsal rotation
      procedure or BTRP), as described in the WHO manual, "Trichiasis Surgery for Trachoma-the
      Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation Procedure". These procedural departures were felt to contribute to
      adverse outcomes, including trichiasis recurrence, granuloma formation and lid contour
      abnormalities. This study team developed a new surgical tool, the TT clamp, to help improve
      surgical outcomes following BLTR.

      A randomized, single-masked clinical trial will be implemented in the Mtwara region in
      Tanzania. Study participants will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to surgery with the TT clamp
      or to surgery with standard BLTR equipment. All surgeries will take place at surgical centers
      in Mtwara and Lindi over an 8-month period.

      Baseline assessment for severity of trichiasis and other predictors of surgical failure will
      be carried out prior to surgery. Follow-up is planned at 2 weeks (for suture removal), 6
      weeks, 12 months, and 24 months post-surgery. At each follow-up visit participants will be
      assessed for evidence of unfavorable outcomes, including trichiasis recurrence, granuloma
      formation, and lid contour abnormalities. All outcomes will be assessed clinically by a
      trained observer who is masked to intervention status.
