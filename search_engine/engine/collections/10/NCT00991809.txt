      analgesics, in addition to their therapeutic anti-nociceptive effects, under some conditions
      produce pro-nociceptive effects. This phenomenon of pain or pain sensitivity being increased
      by prior opioid administration is called opioid-induced hyperalgesia. It is thought to be
      relevant both to pain management complications and to complications of opioid dependence and
      its treatment. This study investigated the time-course of opioid-induced hyperalgesia
      development in healthy normal volunteers (N=12 completers), using a series of acute
      alfentanil administrations (15 mg/kg mg intramuscular (IM) per day) spaced at 3-4 day
      intervals, with testing for pain tolerance using the cold pressor test (CPT), and mechanical
      quantitative sensory testing (MQST) each administered repeatedly over time within each
      testing day. The goal was to determine the time course of OIH development following acute
      opioid administration, and to assess whether this changes over repeated acute opioid
      administrations.
