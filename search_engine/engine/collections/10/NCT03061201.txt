      encoding the cDNA for the B-domain deleted human F8 (hF8). The secreted FVIII has the same
      amino acid sequence as approved recombinant anti hemophilic factors (Refacto® and Xyntha®).
      The SB-525 (PF-07055480) vector encodes a liver-specific promotor module and AAV2/6 exhibits
      liver tropism, thus providing the potential for long-term hepatic production of FVIII in
      hemophilia A subjects.

      The constant production of FVIII after a single SB-525 (PF-07055480) administration may
      provide potential benefit in durable protection against bleeding and the complications
      thereof without lifelong repetitive IV factor replacement administration.
