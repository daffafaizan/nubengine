      will be randomised into 4 treatment groups (15 patients per group) to receive either one of
      the 3 single doses of Paracetamol 3% (D1: 30 mg, D2: 60 mg, D3: 90 mg) or the placebo
      solution (P: 0.9% saline solution) by intrathecal injection (IT), according to the
      randomised, parallel-group design.

      Immediately after IT paracetamol or placebo administration, all patients will receive a
      single IT dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (Non-investigational medicinal product, NIMP)
      according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications. The time interval between
      paracetamol IT and chloroprocaine IT injections should not exceed 2 min.

      The study will include a screening phase (Visit 1, Day -21/-1), a treatment phase (IMP IT
      administration, anaesthesia and surgical procedure: Visit 2, Day 1) and a follow-up phase
      including an observation period (Visit 3), a final visit and two follow-ups (24 h post-dose
      and day 7Â±1).
