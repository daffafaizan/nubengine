      I. To evaluate the reduction in Vulvovaginal Symptom Questionnaire (VSQ) score at 3-month
      follow up after CO2RE laser treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the reduction in VSQ score after CO2RE laser treatment 6-month follow-up and
      12-month follow-up.

      II. To evaluate Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score before and after treatment with
      CO2RE laser.

      III. To evaluate Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) 6 score before and after treatment with
      CO2RE laser.

      IV. To evaluate vaginal health index score and vaginal caliber before and after treatment
      with CO2RE laser.

      V. To evaluate discomfort and pain during CO2RE laser treatment using the visual analog
      scale.

      VI. To evaluate treatment satisfaction after CO2RE laser treatment using 5-point Likert
      scale.

      VII. To evaluate adherence to aromatase inhibitor at 6 and 12 months after CO2RE laser
      treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the change in the vaginal cytology using vaginal maturation index at baseline
      and during follow-up.

      II. To assess serum estradiol level at baseline and after CO2RE laser treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo carbon dioxide fractional laser therapy over 10-15 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
