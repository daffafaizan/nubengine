      pregnant consume 400 micrograms of folate daily from supplements, fortified foods, or both,
      in addition to consuming food folate from a varied diet. Despite this recommendation, obese
      women have a lower folate status than women of normal weight which suggests that obesity may
      have a negative impact on folate metabolism. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
      determine if there are differences in the metabolic response to a single dose of folate
      between normal weight and obese women of child bearing age. The two groups of women will be
      given the currently recommended amount of folic acid, 400 micrograms, and blood samples will
      be taken before the vitamin is given and at various points afterwards to determine serum
      folate response to the folate dose. Results of this research should help determine if folate
      requirements are higher for obese than for non-obese women. The long-term goal of this and
      follow-up studies is to generate data that will contribute to the evidence base used by
      scientific advisory panels to determine whether dietary folate intake recommendations should
      be based on body weight.
