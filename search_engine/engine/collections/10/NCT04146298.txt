      cancer. Mutations in KRAS are implicated in the development of pancreatic cancer and are
      associated with poor prognosis of the patients. KRAS is an attractive target for cancer
      treatment because it is a driver mutation and is likely expressed by all cells in a tumor.
      Recently,T cells targeting mutant KRAS have been identified in patients with epithelial
      cancers, and these T-cell receptors (TCR) have been characterized. For example, TCRs that
      target mutant KRAS G12D peptides presented by HLA-C*08:02, and a TCR that targets a KRAS G12V
      peptide presented by HLA-A*11:01 have been identified. Mutant KRAS-reactive T cells appear
      capable of inducing tumor regression as highlighted in a patient with metastatic colorectal
      cancer who experienced regression of metastatic tumors after infusion of
      HLA-C*08:02-restricted KRAS-G12D reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The
      investigators will test the safety and activity of adoptive transfer of autologous T cells
      genetically engineered to express a TCR that targets mutant KRAS G12V in the context of
      HLA-A*11:01 in HLA-matched patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that express mutant KRAS
      G12V. The investigators will also measure the in vivo survival of engineered T cells.
