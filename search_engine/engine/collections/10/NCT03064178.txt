      experience. By understanding factors that influence pain experienced, practitioners can
      provide potentially provide accommodations for their patients. This study investigated if
      anticipated pain is similar to actual pain experienced and if there are certain factors that
      influence the amount of pain experienced and/or pain pill usage.

      Patients kept a 7 day diary in which they recorded anticipated pain (prior to periodontal
      surgery) and actual pain experienced for 7 days following the surgical procedure. Patients
      recorded their pain (anticipated and actual) using a visual analog scale (VAS). Patients also
      recorded daily pain medication and nutritional supplement use in the 7 day diary.

      Other information recorded included factors that could influence pain experienced and pain
      pill use. For pain experienced, the influence of the following factors were assessed: sex,
      age, type of surgery, nervousness, sedation use, smoking status, anticipated pain,
      nutritional supplement use and pain pill use. For pain pill use, the influence of the
      following factors were assessed: sex, age, type of surgery, nervousness, sedation use,
      smoking status, anticipated pain, nutritional supplement use and pain experienced. These
      factors were analyzed using regression analyses.
