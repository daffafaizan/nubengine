      pharmacokinetics have been partial; investigators know that imiglucerase undergoes a quick
      clearance from plasma compartment following the infusion (1/2 life: 1-6 min, from tissue:
      <24h), an observation apparently contradictory with usual infusion rhythm (one infusion every
      two weeks). Furthermore, by going by GD response, the rhythm of Infusion is sometimes
      diminished (for example, every 3 or 4 wks) without pharmacological rational ; In parallel,
      investigators demonstrated that monocytes represent a satisfactory surrogate of GD target
      cells and that enzyme activity into monocytes varies between individuals. Our hypothesis is
      that enzyme activity into monocyte compartment could be different and could be related to GD
      response.

      Primary purpose: to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Imiglucerase activity into target
      cellular compartment depending on dose and frequency of infusions.

      Secondary purposes : 1) to establish a possible relationship between the intra-monocytic
      activity of glucocerebrosidase and the clinical and biological activity of Gaucher disease
      and to define a possible threshold value of enzyme activity; 2) to establish a better
      correlation with known biomarkers of disease (routine markers and markers recently
      identified), which would better predict and / or monitor response to treatment ; 3) to
      compare the residual and natural rate of activity enzyme intra-monocytic for untreated
      patients (low severity disease).
