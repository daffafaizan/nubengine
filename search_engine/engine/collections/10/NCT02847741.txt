      cholesterol threshold in the occurrence of SB.

      555 inpatients suffering from a current Major depressive disorder (MDD), hospitalized in the
      Department of Emergency Psychiatry and Post Acute Care will be recruited.

      Each patient will attend a total of 5 visits during a follow-up period of 18 months (visits
      at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months)
