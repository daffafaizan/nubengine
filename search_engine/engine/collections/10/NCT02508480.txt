      usual (SAU) enhanced with a 60-minute peer-led group discussion session. The RCT will be at a
      large publicly funded community mental health agency in Massachusetts. A total of 192
      participants or 96 participants per group will be recruited over a period of 36 months across
      the three clubhouses of the agency where the intervention will take place. We plan to have
      randomization cohorts of 16 individuals per delivery of the Photovoice program at each of the
      three clubhouses. Given the projected sample size of 192 participants, we will have 12
      randomization cohorts - 4 at each clubhouse implemented at 6-month intervals. Participants
      will be randomized to either the Photovoice program (plus usual services) or the enhanced
      SAU. Participants will be assessed by a blinded rater at baseline, post-treatment, 3-month
      and 6-month follow-ups on a range of primary and secondary outcomes related to personal
      stigma, coping, and functioning. Primary analyses will test the hypotheses that the
      Photovoice program will lead to significantly greater reductions in self-stigma and perceived
      stigma, greater improvements in proactive coping with psychiatric prejudice and
      discrimination, and greater improvements in community functioning and integration than the
      enhanced SAU. Secondary analyses will evaluate whether the Photovoice program leads to
      greater gains than SAU in psychological adjustment, including wellbeing, personal growth and
      recovery. Individuals randomized to the enhanced SAU will be able to join the 10-week
      Photovoice program once they complete their 6-month follow up for the study.
