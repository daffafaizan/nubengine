      HIV infection. However, AZT is largely eliminated from the body through a biochemical
      reaction that takes place in the liver, and it is possible that patients with underlying
      liver disease may have altered AZT pharmacokinetics and may metabolize AZT differently, with
      the result that they are susceptible to an increased risk of serious drug toxicity. This
      study will examine the pharmacokinetics, elimination, and metabolism of AZT in patients with
      liver disease. Guidelines developed from the data will be helpful in managing AZT treatment
      of these HIV-infected persons and will indicate whether the dose of AZT administered should
      be adjusted to compensate for any changes in its bioavailability and/or pharmacokinetics.

      Patients are assessed and stratified according to liver function and severity of liver
      disease. Patients receive an intravenous (IV) dose of AZT on the first day of the study,
      followed by an oral dose 24 hours later on the second day of the study. Patients fast for 8
      hours prior to each dose and for 2 hours after each dose. Liver function tests are repeated
      on the first day of the study. In each patient, serial measurements of serum and urine AZT
      and its metabolite, 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-5'-glucuronylthymidine (GAZT), are monitored after both
      doses.
