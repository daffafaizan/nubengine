      intervention. A 1:1 randomization will be applied with intervention schools and matched
      control schools. The intervention school will recieve the BOOSTH intervention. The
      intervention duration is 6 months. Measurements will be performed at baseline and 3, 6 and 12
      months after the start.

      The investigational treatment is the BOOSTH physical activity intervention. Children in the
      intervention school will start with the BOOSTH intervention on top of the regular PE lessons.
      The child will receive the BOOSTH activity tracker. The child (under supervision of the
      teacher) needs to download the BOOSTH sync app and the BOOSTH game app. Therefore it is
      important that the school works with a device with Bluetooth. We will create a login account
      for each child. After installing the apps, the activity tracker measures step counts, which
      are translated into activity points. These activity points will be used to unlock levels in
      the BOOSTH game app. The child synchronizes their activity points, with Bluetooth connection,
      in the BOOSTH sync app and immediately the child can open the BOOSTH game app to play a level
      in the game. The child needs seven green lights (corresponding to 30 minutes of performed
      physical activity) to unlock a level in the game. The first four levels are for free, to gain
      the interests of the child, but thereafter the child needs to be physically active to unlock
      the rest of the levels in the game.
