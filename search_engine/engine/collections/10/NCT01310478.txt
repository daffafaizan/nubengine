      adminstration in routine clinical practice in China. It is very difficult to maintain
      steady-state of plasma concentration of this agent due to this manner of application.
      Continous infusional Endostar was designed to alter the imblance of concentration to avoid
      compromising efficacy of anti-angionesis therapy.The strategy of dose-escalation was used in
      this study in order to obtain the optimal dosage of Endostar for the next phase â…¡ trial.
