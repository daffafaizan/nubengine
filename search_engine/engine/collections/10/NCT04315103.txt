      been widely used for OA because of lack of clinical evidence. Based on in vitro and animal
      studies, combining HA and PRP may benefit from their dissimilar biological mechanisms for
      tissue repair and have potentials to synergistically promote cartilage regeneration, inhibit
      OA inflammation, modulate the disease process, and improve joint homeostasis in OA.
      Combination of HA and PRP has much potential for the treatment of OA, but the clinical
      evidence of this combination remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate
      the efficacy and safety of combined a single crosslinked HA (HYAJOINT Plus) with a single PRP
      versus a single PRP alone in patients with knee OA.
