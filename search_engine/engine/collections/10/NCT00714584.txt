      opioid receptors in the brain. Naltrexone does not possess morphine-like properties and
      exhibits minimal pharmacologic activity. Naltrexone is marketed as an oral tablet. A wide
      range of oral bioavailability values have been reported for naltrexone. The wide range in
      oral bioavailability of naltrexone appears to be due to differences in assay specificity and
      the method of estimation of bioavailability (use of total drug, free drug, or urinary
      excretion data rather than plasma level). This was a single-center, randomized (study drug
      assigned by chance), open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study in healthy volunteers.
      Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (AB or BA) with a
      washout period of 6 to 14 days between treatments. The washout period commenced the day of
      dosing, after drug administration. Blood samples for determination of blood naltrexone levels
      were collected at scheduled time points from the arm opposite to the 1 selected for
      naltrexone i.v. administration. Pulse, blood pressure, breathing rate, body temperature were
      measured at the times listed in the study schema. Healthy volunteers remained at the research
      facility for blood sample collection periods and were monitored for adverse events throughout
      the treatment periods.

      Treatment A: 1 mg naltrexone HCl administered i.v. over 15 minutes (naltrexone i.v.).
      Treatment B: 50 mg naltrexone HCl administered orally (naltrexone oral).
