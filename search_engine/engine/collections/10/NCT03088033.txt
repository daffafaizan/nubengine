    
      Following supine bicycle exercise testing to assess eligibility, the eligible patients are
      randomized to the treatment or control group.

      All patients will be sedated, and both treatment and control arm patients will undergo
      placement of a femoral venous access sheath after randomization.

      Patients randomized to the treatment arm will undergo a fluoroscopically and intra-cardiac
      echocardiography (ICE), or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guided trans-septal
      puncture and IASD System II implant procedure. Patients randomized to the control arm will
      undergo ICE from the femoral vein or TEE for examination of the atrial septum and left
      atrium.

      Patients will be evaluated at pre-specified time intervals and followed for 5 years.

      All patients will be unblinded after the 24 month follow up visit. Patients randomized to the
      control arm will be allowed to cross-over to the treatment arm at â‰¥ 24 months post-control
      procedure provided patient selection criteria are met at that time. Cross-over patients will
      then be followed for 5 years after cross-over.
