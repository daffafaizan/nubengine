      delivering Community Reinforcement And Family Training (CRAFT) principles via scalable
      digital coaching methods and determine its efficacy based on measured outcomes.

      Technical Objectives 1. Modify the WTV platform to produce a CRAFT-informed automated
      prototype and protocol for live coaching.

      Technical Objectives 2. Test prototype usability and reliability to deliver the protocol, and
      make any refinements needed.

      Technical Objectives 3. Demonstrate prototype efficacy. Testing three digital scenarios: A.
      Automated CRAFT, B. CRAFT Coach, C. Peer support, the current WTV platform interaction.

      As a result, when tested at baseline versus post-intervention, CRAFT conditions (Coach and
      Automated) are expected to achieve better outcomes than the peer condition in a) treatment
      entry, b) Concerned Significant Others (CSO) health and wellbeing, c) CSO and identified
      patient relationship, d) CRAFT adeptness.

      Results will substantiate the case for Phase II roll out of the platform at scale, plus
      commercialization and dissemination through an existing and growing network of partners.
