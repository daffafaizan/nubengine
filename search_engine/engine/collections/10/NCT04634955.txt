      procedure that is effective in radicular pain conditions such as herniated interverebral
      disc, spinal stenosis and failed back surgery syndrome.

      The incidence of inadvertent intravascular needle injection during lumbar transforaminal
      injection is reported as from 9.9% to 30.8%. In particular, S1 intravascular injection rate
      is more frequent than at the lumbar level.

      Previous study reported that guiding the needle toward the S1 foramen using the S1 scotty dog
      image as a bony landmark, not in the classic way, but in an oblique fluoroscopic view, during
      L5 and S1 transforaminal epidural steroid injection, can save procedure time and reduce the
      risk of radiation exposure.

      In this stidy, the investigators aimed to compare the incidence of intravascular injection
      rate by anteroposterior and oblique view approaches for S1 transforaminal epidural steroid
      injection. In addition, the investigators also compared the procedure time and radiation
      exposure between two approach method.
