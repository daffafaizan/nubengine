      Walking, 2. Mindfulness and Self-compassion focussed Walking (MSCW)) on tumor-specific
      symptoms of fatigue in women with breast cancer undergoing chemo- and/or radiotherapy. The
      results of both groups are compared with each other and with those of a control group.

      The MSCW program combines endurance based physical activity in the form of medically
      controlled walking, as well as standardized, evidence-based mindfulness exercise elements in
      a training program.

      The participants of both active groups (Walking and MSCW) practice for 12 weeks, once a week
      for 60 minutes under the guidance of a trainer in a group and 2 additional times (60 minutes
      each) independently at home.

      The purpose of this study is to prevent a sharp decline in quality of life due to fatigue
      symptoms by participating in the MSCW training program.

      A total of 135 participants will be included in the study. All participants are followed for
      1 year.
