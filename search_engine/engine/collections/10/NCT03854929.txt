      with diarrhoeal infections represent a significant proportion of the global infectious
      disease burden. With the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance observed in the
      organisms associated with children presenting with dysentery in Vietnam and the
      investigator's capacity to demonstrate international transmission events, new data regarding
      alternative treatment options such as azithromycin, in particular for the new
      highly-antimicrobial resistant S. sonnei, are urgently needed.

      The study team will perform a phase IV open label randomised controlled trial to compare the
      efficacy of AZI to CIP (standard-of-care) for the treatment of children hospitalised with
      dysentery in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Children aged 6 to 60 months presenting to the
      participating hospital with symptoms/signs of dysentery (diarrhoea with blood and/or mucus
      accompanied by 1 or more of: fever ≥37.8°C, abdominal pain and /or tenesmus) within the
      previous 72 hours will be enrolled to the study.

      After enrolment, participants will be managed according to WHO and local algorithms for
      children with bloody diarrhoea. In addition, after providing a stool sample, children will be
      randomly allocated to receive CIP 15mg/kg body weight/ twice daily or AZI 10mg/kg body
      weight/ daily for 3 days. After enrolment, children will be reviewed for clinical and
      microbiological response to treatment.
