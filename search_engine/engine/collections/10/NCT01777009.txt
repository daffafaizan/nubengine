      Patellar mobilization during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been debated, with some
      proponents of minimally invasive TKA suggesting that laterally retracting, rather than
      everting the patella may be beneficial. It was our hypothesis that by using randomized,
      prospective, blinded study methods, there would be no significant difference in clinical
      outcome measures based solely on eversion of the patella during total knee arthroplasty.

      Methods:

      After an a priori power analysis was done, 120 primary total knee replacements indicated for
      degenerative joint disease were included in the study and randomized to one of two patella
      exposure techniques: lateral retraction or eversion. Collaborating investigators and patients
      were blinded to randomization.
