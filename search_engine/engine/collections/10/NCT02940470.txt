      risk for recurrence and death compared with lighter women. There have been a few studies
      examining the effects of different interventions on weight loss in breast cancer survivors
      but very few have examined the effect of weight loss interventions on circulating levels of
      markers associated with cancer risk. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine
      how weight loss affects circulating levels of biomarkers associated with breast cancer risk
      and recurrence, and quality of life of overweight and obese breast cancer survivors. The
      central hypothesis is that weight loss will decrease the levels of markers adversely
      associated with breast cancer and increase quality of life in these women. To test the
      central hypothesis the following specific aims will be pursued:

        -  To assess the effects of two different weight loss interventions on biomarkers
           associated with breast cancer risk and recurrence

        -  To assess the impact of the weight loss interventions on quality of life and sleep

        -  To assess the impact of weight loss on measures of bone health
