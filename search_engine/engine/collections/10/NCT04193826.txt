      modality for device success in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation at increased
      risk for stroke and systemic embolism who are recommended for oral anticoagulation (OAC)
      therapy but have an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacological alternative to OAC.
      TEE will be used to confirm the ICE evaluation.
