      This activity may derive in part from destabilizing Mycn protein, impeding tumor
      angiogenesis, and/or other effects. SF1126 is a novel inhibitor of PI3 kinase and mTOR that
      includes an active moiety (consisting of LY294002) linked to an RGDS tetrapeptide that
      targets the active agent to integrin expressing tissues. In preclinical studies, SF1126
      results in marked concentration of LY294002 into tumors. In an adult phase 1 trial, a maximum
      tolerated dose of SF1126 was not identified up to doses of 1110 mg/m2 administered
      intravenously twice weekly on a continuous schedule. In this first pediatric phase 1 trial of
      SF1126, dose escalation will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design. Once a recommended phase 2
      pediatric dose is identified, an expansion cohort of 10 patients with tumors with MYCN
      amplification, Mycn expression, or Myc expression will be treated. All patients will
      participate in mandatory pharmacokinetic testing. Additional optional correlative studies
      will evaluate potential predictive markers and potential pharmacodynamic markers, including
      PTEN and PIK3CA aberrations, Myc / Mycn expression, and Myc / pS6 levels in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells.
