      design. Patients will be randomized equally to 1 of 4 treatment groups: MCC-257 20 mg,
      MCC-257 40 mg, MCC-257 80 mg, or placebo, given once daily for 24 weeks. The study will
      consist of 2 periods: 1) a screening period of up to 21 days prior to baseline, including a
      formal screening visit; and 2) a 24-week treatment period, during which patients will take
      the study treatment, and have various assessments performed during 4 visits.
