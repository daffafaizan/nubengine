      epitope peptides, which were derived from a cancer-testis antigen, URLC10, as targets for
      cancer vaccination against lung cancer. In this phase I trial, the investigators examine
      using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect
      of vaccine treatment for HHLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*0206-positive advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer patients who failed to standard therapy.
