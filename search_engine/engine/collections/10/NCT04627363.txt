      was effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Bevacizumab, an angiogenesis Inhibitors
      was effectively used for hepatocelluar carcinama (HCC) therapy. Toripalimab, an programmed
      cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody, was effective and tolerable in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor thrombus. No study has evaluated HAIC plus
      Bevacizumab and Toripalimab. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective, single-arm
      study to find out it.
