      will be assigned to +fondaparinux and no fondaparinux arms based on guidelines that were
      developed for and are considered the standard of care for the use of low molecular weight
      heparin in the same group of patients for the same indication. These guidelines will separate
      patients at risk for DVT into those that are high risk and very high risk. The primary
      efficacy outcome measures will be DVT and PE. Presence of DVT will be assessed with serial
      color flow duplex ultrasound during the patients in hospital stay at weekly intervals up to 3
      weeks and when the patient has symptoms of DVT. PE will be diagnosed according to clinical
      suspicion by the patients treating physicians and subsequent imaging by CT. We plan on
      enrolling approximately 100 patients in the +fondaparinux and 100 patients in the no
      fondaparinux arm. We will compare both the incidence of DVT and PE in these groups and to the
      incidences in the literature and historical controls. A second aim of the study is to
      evaluate the adverse outcomes such as increased bleeding in patients who receive
      fondaparinux. A third and final aim of the study is to describe the effect of fondaparinux on
      antifactor Xa levels in trauma patients.
