      14 weeks, consisting of a two-week run-in period, two treatment phases of four weeks each and
      a four-week washout period separating the treatment phases to prevent carry-over effects.
      Study visits were held at baseline (screening) and after the run-in period, treatment phases
      and washout period.

      To assess the effect of rikkunshito on intragastric pressure as an indirect measure for
      gastric motility, high-resolution manometry (HRM) was performed after the run-in period and
      after both treatment phases. During intragastric pressure measurement, a nutrient tolerance
      test was performed and symptom questionnaires were completed. Throughout the entire study,
      patients scored their gastrointestinal symptoms on a daily basis in the Leuven Postprandial
      Distress Scale (LPDS) diary. In addition, questionnaires on gastrointestinal symptoms and
      psychosocial state were completed each study visit.

      Safety measures performed each study visit included blood pressure, heart rate and weight
      assessment, performing an electrocardiogram, adverse event evaluation and physical
      examination. Furthermore, blood samples were collected during screening and after each
      treatment phase to check liver and kidney function. Serum levels of potassium, creatine
      kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-
      glutamyltransferase were assessed. Women of childbearing potential were asked to do a
      pregnancy test before study enrollment and before each treatment period.
