      system allows real time monitoring of the colonoscope position within the colon and is
      considered to be a useful supplement to achieve cecal intubation. However, the MEI system is
      costly, and trial results are equivocal regarding the actual benefits. A newly designed
      colonoscope (ColoAssist) with gradual stiffness throughout the colonoscope shaft has been
      developed to improve insertability. We want to investigate if we can achieve equal
      performance results with the ColoAssist instrument as with the MEI system in CRC screening.
      The study is designed as a two-center, single-blinded, randomized, controlled non-inferiority
      trial.
