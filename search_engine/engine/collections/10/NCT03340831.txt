      the following information will be collected: demographics, labs, clinical and diabetes
      history information (history of mild/severe hypoglycemia or DKA events in the past 6 months
      and SMBG testing frequency). There are 3 clinic visits: Study Entry, Month 6 and Month 12 .
      Monthly phone contacts will be made to assess for any mild/severe hypoglycemic or DKA events
      and any details surrounding an event. Clinic visits at Months 6 and 12 will capture frequency
      of SMBG testing, A1C level and PRO information. CGM data will be obtained during the study to
      assess for CGM adherence.
