        -  Determine the response rates in patients with metastatic or recurrent small cell lung
           cancer treated with irinotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin.

        -  Determine the median survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (yes vs no) and disease stage (metastatic vs relapsed).

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes and carboplatin IV over 15-30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
