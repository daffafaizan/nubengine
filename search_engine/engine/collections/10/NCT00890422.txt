      conclusions. One-third of these individuals will receive 3 injections in all: 2 on the first
      day and the third injection 4 days later (immunisation schedule 1). Another one-third will
      receive 2 injections in all: one on the first day and one injection 4 days later
      (immunisation schedule 2). The remaining one-third will also receive 2 injections, both of
      these on the first day (immunisation schedule 3). Participants will be assigned completely
      randomly (by chance) to one of these three groups. So each participant stands a 33% chance (a
      1:2 chance) of receiving any one particular immunisation schedule. If you agree to take part,
      the process will be as follows:

      Brief Overview of the Course of the Clinical Study:

      Vaccination scheme 1

      Vaccination scheme 2

      Vaccination scheme 3

      Vaccinations:

      I = Vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0,5ml

        -  Scheme 1: 2 vaccinations at U1 (day 0), one injection into the left and the right upper
           arm each, 1 vaccination at U2 (day 4), injection into the left upper arm

        -  Scheme 2: one vaccination at U1 (day 0) and at U2 (day 4), injections into the left
           upper arm each

        -  Scheme 3: 2 vaccinations at U1 (day 0), one injection into the left and the right upper
           arm each
