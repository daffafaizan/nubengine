      approximately 25 percent of AIDS patients are intravenous (IV) drug abusers, and it is very
      likely that an increasingly larger number of AIDS patients receiving AZT therapy will have
      had a history of IV drug abuse. The major chemical treatment for IV drug abuse is daily
      methadone maintenance therapy, and IV drug abusers who are HIV positive represent a large
      number of patients who will undergo long-term treatment with both methadone and AZT.
      Therefore, the study of potential drug interactions is essential.

      The 18 patients are patients with AIDS or ARC. Nine are control patients who are not
      receiving methadone and are not IV drug abusers. Nine are former IV drug abusers who have
      been maintained on methadone for at least 6 months and who have been receiving a constant
      daily dose of methadone for at least 1 month. Plasma and urine levels of methadone are
      determined over a 4 hour period. The dose of AZT: For the pharmacokinetic study of AZT,
      plasma and urine samples are taken after oral dose of AZT and an intravenous dose of AZT in
      the control and methadone groups.
