      postoperative renal dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
      Therefore, it is imperative to identify modifiable risk factors for postoperative acute
      kidney injury after nephrectomy in advance. According to a recent retrospective study, total
      intravenous anesthesia using propofol is significantly associated with lower incidence of
      acute kidney injury after nephrectomy, compared to the inhalation anesthesia. However, there
      is no prospective study which investigates the influence of type of anesthesia on
      postoperative renal function after nephrectomy. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to
      investigate the influence of type of anesthesia on acute kidney injury after nephrectomy by
      performing randomized controlled study.
