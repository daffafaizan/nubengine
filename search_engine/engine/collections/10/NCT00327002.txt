      I. Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on the Apo A-I production rate (calculated from the
           fractional synthetic rate and the fractional catabolic rate) in subjects with the
           metabolic syndrome and low HDL-C.

      II. Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on markers of reverse cholesterol transport by
           analyzing changes in serum cholesterol efflux capacity (an in vitro cell-based assay).

        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on the activity of lecithin cholesterol
           acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), lipoprotein lipase,
           hepatic lipase, and endothelial lipase.

        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on plasma lipids, lipid subfractions, free fatty
           acids, and the free fatty acid metabolite, beta-OH butyrate.

        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density
           lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle size using nuclear
           magnetic resonance (NMR).

        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on Apo A-II and Apo B-100 kinetics.

        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on hsCRP.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of LY518674

      Study Design:

      Study H8D-MC-EMBG is a single site, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel
      study. A minimum of 40 subjects with low HDL cholesterol and metabolic syndrome will be
      randomized to receive double-blind administration of LY518674 100 mcg/day or placebo for 8
      weeks. There is a safety visit every 2 weeks after treatment has been initiated, resulting in
      7 visits over 10 weeks. There are 2 inpatient visits at zero and eight weeks.
