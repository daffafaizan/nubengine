      Randomization will be done using computer generated randomization list. A specialized nurse
      will explain the method of bowel cleansing. Investigators (endoscopists) are blinded to bowel
      cleansing method.

      Endpoint:

      Primary end point is successful bowel cleansing rated by Boston bowel preparation (BBPS)
      scale. Successful bowel cleansing is defined as all segment is 2 or 3 points. Endoscopists
      will assess BBPS when colonoscopy withdrawal.

      Secondary end point was patient's tolerability and safety profile including adverse events.
      Patient's satisfaction to the different bowel cleansing method and adverse events (nausea,
      vomiting, dizziness, fatigue) will be investigated by questionnaire before colonoscopy. Blood
      test will be done before colonoscopy.

      Statistical analysis:

      Bowel cleansing success, patient's tolerability and safety profile will be compared between
      the two groups. Student t test for continuous variables and the chi-square test or Fisher
      exact test for categorical variables.

      Sample size:

      This study is non-inferioty study. Assuming bowel cleansing success rate 85% in the
      split-dose group, the significant difference between the two groups were hypothesized at 10%.
      Considering 80% power and 10% drop rate, a total of 352 participants is needed.
