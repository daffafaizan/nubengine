      avoid leaving participants untreated who had responded well to adalimumab treatment, so that
      participants were allowed to remain in the study until regulatory and/or reimbursement
      approval for the treatment of uveitis in adults was obtained for their respective countries.
      Data were collected through Week 366 (maximum), but because of decreasing sample size that
      became too small toward the end of the study to allow for meaningful conclusion, data cut off
      for efficacy analyses (intent to treat [ITT] population) occurred at Week 246, as less than
      10% of participants in the ITT set had visits beyond this timepoint.
