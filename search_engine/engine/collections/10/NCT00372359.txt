      of childhood, with symptoms consisting of inattentiveness, impulsivity and hyperactivity. The
      diagnosis relies on subjective criteria since there is no objective test for ADHD. Stimulants
      are the recommended treatment, during the last 2 decades both the rate of its use has
      increased, and the age for starting treatment has decreased. Adverse side effects have been
      few, none of which were serious.

      Recently, regulators of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been told on forty deaths
      among patients who took stimulants through 2003. Accordingly, a subcommittee of the FDA
      recommended that prescription drugs to treat ADHD should be accompanied by strong 'black-box'
      warnings that they may increase the risk of heart problems in some patients.

      To date, there does not appear to have been any study that has evaluated cardiac functions in
      these patients. In this study we will evaluate the possible long term effect of
      methylphenidate on cardiac functions, as to provide more knowledgeable basis for decisions on
      the treatment of ADHD patients with methylphenidate.

      Children age 8-18 years who were treated on methylphenidate for more then five years will be
      allocated in outpatient clinics. Complete EKG and echocardiographic examinations will be
      performed and cardiac functions, left ventricular mass and left ventricular muscle width will
      be compared to the normal range of values. The results will give us, for the first time, a
      basis to support or reject the causative relationship between these drugs and severe cardiac
      problems.
