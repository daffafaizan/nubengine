      and 8 additional visits after enrollment scheduled 6 months apart. Intervals of every 6
      months were chosen to insure that both acquisition and loss of infections may be assessed, as
      studies in women indicate that median duration of oncogenic infections ranges between 7-9
      months. Informed consent will occur during the run-in visit. The run-in and follow-up visits
      will include questionnaire administration, visual inspection of the skin and external
      genitalia, and the collection of urine, blood, oral cells, and penile skin samples If
      anogenital lesions are present at any of the clinic visits, they will be sampled as well.
