      placebo - benztropine) and psychological (cognitive-behavioral therapy vs. disease education)
      treatments for pain and disability due to temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). Patients 18
      to 65 years old meeting RDC criteria for TMD and other eligibility criteria complete a 3-week
      baseline monitoring phase prior to randomization. Active treatment consists of weekly visits
      for 8 week, then maintenance treatment for 6 months. Outcome measures include pain, physical
      and psychosocial function and are assessed at post-treatment, 3-months, and 6-months
