      generated against specific tumor antigens. The Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) and
      alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (AR) display several features which make them candidate diseases
      for trials of such immunotherapy. First, intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally able
      to eradicate bulk disease in patients with metastatic disease, but tumor relapse eventually
      occurs in nearly all patients. Second, tumor-specific chromosomal translocations resulting in
      the production of novel fusion proteins have been identified in the great majority of these
      tumors. Peptides derived from these fusion proteins have been shown to function as tumor
      antigens for cytolytic T cells in animal studies. Third, studies of immune reconstitution
      after intensive cytotoxic therapy have provided evidence that antigen-specific T cells can be
      generated in vivo when the adoptive transfer of peripheral T cells and antigen are provided
      during the period of T cell regeneration. This process can be augmented in murine models by
      the use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) active protease inhibitor, indinavir,
      potentially through inhibition of programmed cell death in expanding T cells. Merging these
      concepts, this protocol will attempt to eradicate minimal residual disease in pediatric
      patients with metastatic ESFT and AR via vaccination with tumor-specific peptides undertaken
      concomitant with autologous T cell transplantation and indinavir.
