      cancer relapse. EPA metabolite, Î”12-PGJ3 may represent a new chemotherapeutic agent for
      leukemia that targets leukemia stem cells. Selective targeting of cancer stem cells may be
      potentially a highly effective treatment for cancer. As most CML patients treated with a TKI
      will reach a complete cytogenetic response, quantification of residual BCR-ABL transcripts by
      quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is a critical tool to further monitor
      response kinetics. Addition of EPA to TKI may help decrease residual BCR-ABL positive (Ph+)
      leukemia stem cells.
