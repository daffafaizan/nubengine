      women. An intervention such as guided self-help via manuals (bibliotherapy) is a well
      accepted approach and accepted. Development of new technologies in recent years allows
      delivery of psychotherapy via CD-ROMs and web-based interfaces. These new technologies have
      not yet been implemented in Austria in treating bulimia nervosa (BN) patients. In particular
      patients will be involved, who would not attend medical care regularly. The aim of our study
      is therefore to deliver guided self-help via an internet platform (supported by email
      contacts) for 100 patients with BN and to investigate the practicability and effectivity of
      this approach as well as compliance of patients in this group.

      Patients will be found and contacted via internet, get specialized medical investigations,
      medical care and support via emails. As control group 100 patients with bulimia are treated
      with bibliotherapy only. Beside effectivity, predictors of outcome (clinical, comorbidity,
      indication to change, personality) are investigated.

      The proposed study is a randomised controlled trial for effectivity and practicability of new
      technologies in psychiatric treatment research.

      This is not a psychotherapy study but a study on psychoeducation, an approach which offers
      new and helpful opportunities for this patient group.
