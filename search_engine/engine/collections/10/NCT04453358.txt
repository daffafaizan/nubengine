      chronic lung infections and pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and chest tightness.
      Those with CF rely on numerous pharmaceutical and treatment-based therapies as part of their
      routine care to maintain lung health. Airway clearance, one such treatment-based therapy,
      uses breathing techniques and various vibrating devices to mobilize lung secretions and is
      considered a cornerstone of CF care. Vest therapy, a "shaking vest" that applies pressure and
      high frequency vibrations to the chest wall is the most commonly used technique for airway
      clearance in the U.S., but adherence to recommended goals for airway clearance is low.
      Barriers to adherence include the time limitations and unclear goal setting for effective
      treatment. A previous pilot study by this research team showed that CF patients find the use
      of airway clearance vests equipped with both pre-set and individually determined programing
      capabilities as well as electronic monitoring and transmitting capabilities to be acceptable
      and feasible. Information such as vest-use time, vest pressure measures, programming choices
      and symptom reporting is captured by these devices and transmitted to health care teams for
      review as well as provided to patients to provide feedback on treatment goals. This study
      aims to determine if providing patients with clearly stated treatment goals and the means to
      monitor and receive positive reinforcing feedback on vest use through interactive technology
      (i.e. virtual coaching) will improve vest therapy adherence in individuals with CF.
