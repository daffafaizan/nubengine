    
      Venous thromboembolic disease (VTD) is an entity constituted by deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
      and by pulmonary embolism (PE) produced as a result of the migration of a thrombus from the
      venous territory, usually originated in the lower limbs, to the tree pulmonary artery. VTE is
      a complex disease with a multifactorial cause, influenced by the patient's history, clinical
      risk factors, and genetic and environmental interactions.

      There is a clearly established relationship between VTD and the presence of an underlying
      cancer. In addition, ETV can be the first manifestation of cancer in some patients.

      Therefore, the objective of this clinical trial is to perform screening with 18DFG PET-CT in
      patients with unprovoked high-risk VTD to evaluate if it is possible to diagnose a great
      number of not diagnosed neoplasms at an earlier stage and to evaluate which impact would have
      on survival and the quality of life.

      For all this, we propose this clinical trial in which we will compare a limited screening
      strategy (usual management of patients with unprovoked VTE) versus extended screening
      (through 18FDG PET-CT), in patients at high risk of developing cancer in the follow-up.
