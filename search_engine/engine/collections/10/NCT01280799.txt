      behavioral treatment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) that is delivered in a
      separated family format. The treatment will combine a parent's skills curriculum that has
      demonstrated preliminary effectiveness in the treatment of AN, with a novel adolescent
      component based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT has been found to be useful
      in the treatment of an array of psychological difficulties, and may be particularly
      well-suited for the cognitive and behavioral avoidance and rigidity that characterizes
      individuals with AN and their caregivers.
