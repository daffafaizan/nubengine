      diagnosed with low grade ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube or low malignant
      potential (LMP) ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      In order to enroll in the Registry, you will be asked to complete a 65 page questionnaire
      that contains questions about your ovarian cancer diagnosis, gynecologic history, family
      history, general medical history, and health risk factors. This questionnaire will take about
      1 hour to complete.

      In addition, researchers will look at your medical record and pathology samples stored at M.
      D. Anderson to get information about your surgeries, treatments, disease course, and tumor
      grade. If your original surgery was not performed at M. D. Anderson, you may be asked to
      provide tumor specimens from that surgery before enrolling in the Registry.

      You will be contacted annually by the Registry Coordinator to update your demographic and
      health information.

      This is an investigational study. The Registry will eventually enroll both M. D. Anderson and
      non-M. D. Anderson patients. The number of registrants is unlimited because the Registry will
      be ongoing. This study is partially funded by a research grant from the Elizabeth Fund for
      the Study of Low Grade Ovarian Carcinoma.
