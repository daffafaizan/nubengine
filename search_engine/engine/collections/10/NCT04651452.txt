      affirmation (N=125) or reflective journaling (N=125) condition. Participants will complete
      baseline measures of physical symptoms, perceived stress, and other covariates. They will
      also be given an electronic pill bottle that will record whether they have daily opened and
      closed the bottle, signifying adherence to their prescribed medication regime. This pill
      bottle will sync to an online dashboard. Participants in both conditions will complete a
      brief essay online (or via paper and pencil for those who prefer or do not have internet
      access) every month for six months. Value affirmation condition essays will include prompts
      about important, core personal values. Reflective journaling essays will have prompts that do
      not include any core personal value content but ask participants, in part, to write about
      typical daily routines. Following the conclusion of the intervention, participants will
      report on their levels of perceived stress and physical symptoms. Six months following the
      post-intervention assessment, participants will again report their perceived stress levels
      and physical symptoms. A sample size of 250 has been selected for feasibility and because
      this sample size provides at least 80% power to detect differences for all three outcomes of
      interest.

      A substudy will be conducted on 120 of these participants who will complete their 3rd essay
      prompt in an fMRI scanner. In the scan session, participants will also complete a stress
      reactivity task. The substudy will allow examination of the neural mechanism of value
      affirmation and reflective journaling to determine whether these neural mechanisms lead to
      enhanced medication adherence rates and reductions in stress and physical symptoms.
