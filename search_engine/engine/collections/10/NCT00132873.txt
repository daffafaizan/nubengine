      Participants from the OMC-SXB-7 open-label trial may be entered without any requirement as to
      length of participation in that trial.

      Approximately 70 patients are expected to participate at up to 6 investigative centers
      located in Canada. The trial will continue for up to 24 months or until marketing approval,
      whichever occurs sooner.
