      (25 Gy in five fractions of 5 Gy) followed by 6 (six) 2-week cycles of TASOX followed by
      total mesorectal excision (TME) for patients with resectable rectal cancer (clinical T3c/dN0,
      T3c/dN1, T2N1). Eligible study subjects include adults who are candidates for curative intent
      sphincter-sparing surgery and lack high risk features such as tumor encroaching upon the
      mesorectal-fascia or low tumors who need an Abdominal-Perineal Resection (APR).
