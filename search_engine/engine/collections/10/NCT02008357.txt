      build-up in their brains who may be at risk for memory loss and cognitive decline due to
      Alzheimer's disease. The A4 study will test an anti-amyloid investigational drug in older
      individuals who do not yet show symptoms of Alzheimer's disease cognitive impairment or
      dementia with the aim of slowing memory and cognitive decline. The A4 study will also test
      whether anti-amyloid treatment can delay the progression of AD related brain injury on
      imaging and other biomarkers.
