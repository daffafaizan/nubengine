      Sepranolone (UC1010) on premenstrual symptoms in women with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder
      (PMDD) in comparison to placebo, administrated during the luteal phase of three consecutive
      menstrual cycles. Effect will be assessed by comparison of symptoms recorded daily by the
      patients using a validated rating scale for assessment of PMDD symptoms and impairment of
      symptoms on daily life of the patients. The scale is Daily Record of Severity of Problems
      (DRSP). Preceding the treatment period, the diagnosis of PMDD will be established in the
      study participants by at lest two menstrual cycles of prospective DRSP ratings by the
      patients. This period will also constitute the baseline data. The effect of study medication
      will be assessed as the change in symptoms from baseline to during treatment. The Total
      symptom score of the DRSP will constitute the primary variable and the late luteal phase
      ratings in the respective menstrual cycles, before and during treatment, will be used.

      The study will also include a follow-up (no treatment) cycle before patients final visit.

      The study is conducted in four European countries (Sweden, Germany, Poland and United
      Kingdom) and will include up to 225 patients.
