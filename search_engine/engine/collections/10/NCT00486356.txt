      Primary

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of capecitabine when given together with
           epirubicin hydrochloride and carboplatin in patients with progressive, unresectable, or
           metastatic cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate end-of-infusion levels of epirubicin hydrochloride and its metabolites with
           epirubicin hydrochloride dose and clinical toxicity in these patients.

        -  Correlate the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine with clinical toxicity in these patients.

        -  Determine the possible correlation between polymorphisms in the promoter region of the
           thymidylate synthase gene with clinical toxicity in these patients.

        -  Document antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine.

      Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride IV over 2 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes
      on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 2-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Peripheral blood is collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic studies before
      beginning study treatment and periodically during study. Samples for the pharmacogenetic
      studies are analyzed for correlation between polymorphisms in the promoter region of the
      thymidylate synthase gene and clinical toxicity. Patients also undergo bone marrow aspirate
      before beginning study treatment for molecular profiling studies.
