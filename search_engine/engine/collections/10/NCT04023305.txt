      sedation with sevoflurane will be enrolled in the study with inclusion criteria. They will be
      enrolled, depending on their morphotype (focal or nonfocal), as routinely assessed in
      participating centers using CT-scan, chest x-ray and/or lung ultrasound.

      These patients will receive inhaled sevoflurane as a standard practice of sedation that is
      routinely used in participating ICUs. After inclusion, the mechanical ventilation protocol
      must be initiated within two hours (if not already being used). In both groups, deep sedation
      followed by neuromuscular blockade must be initiated within four hours of inclusion.

      administration and after its cessation.
