      body. Lack of vitamin D is associated with coronary heart disease, cancer and immunological
      diseases, and also with obesity, hypertension and glucose intolerance. However, to see the
      full effect of vitamin D, one should not only look at single diseases or risk factors, but
      have a global approach using a combined clinical index. A similar line of thinking can be
      applied to genetic, proteomic and metabolomic studies on vitamin D. Thus, in the present
      study 50 subjects will be included and randomized to vitamin D 40.000 IU per week versus
      placebo for 2 months. Blood and adipose tissue samples will be collected before and after the
      intervention and analyzed for gene expression. Based on these results the investigators will
      proceed with the relevant proteomic and metabolomic profile analyses. If successful, this may
      reveal new aspects of vitamin D's physiology and metabolic effects.
