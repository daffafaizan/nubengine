      strategies such as CRS, the removal of all macroscopically detectable tumor, and HIPEC,
      instillation of heated chemotherapy in the abdominal cavity to remove residual cancer
      disease. The treatment is challenging and complex and associated with significant morbidity.
      Only patients with limited disease will benefit from the treatment, and better methods for
      patient selection are needed. The project group has a unique opportunity to address key
      questions because of acquired experience, an exceptional biobank and institutional database
      and novel animal models established at the Norwegian Radium Hospital.
