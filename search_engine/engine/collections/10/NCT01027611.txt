      injections were randomly assigned to receive either: proparacaine HCL 0.5% (Group 1),
      proparacaine HCL 0.5% + 4% lidocaine liquid drops (Group 2); or 3.5% lidocaine gel (Group 3)
      as topical anesthetic prior to injection. All procedures utilized a lid speculum and 5%
      povidone iodine. Approximately 10 seconds after injection, patients graded pain associated
      with the lid speculum, the needle, and with burning sensation on a pain scale of 0 to 10,
      with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the patient's worst imaginable pain. They
      also graded their overall injection procedure experience as Excellent, Very Good, Fair, Poor,
      or Awful.
