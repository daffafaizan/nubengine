      ways to engage multimorbid patients and their family members in Advance Care Planning through
      a Nurse Navigator led pathway versus usual care. Investigators propose to utilize Zelen's
      design (a more recent label/generalization for this type of design is the cohort multiple
      randomized controlled trial (cmRCT), a pragmatic clinical trial design whereby all
      participants are randomized prior to informed consent, and then only patients randomized to
      the interventional arm are approached for consent and subsequently enrolled in the
      intervention group.
