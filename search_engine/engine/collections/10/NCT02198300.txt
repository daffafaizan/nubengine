      strategies: BiOSS LIMÂ® stent implantation or rDES implantation (envelope randomization, 1:1).
      If the patient was enrolled to rDES Group there was a second randomization: with or without
      final kissing ballooning (FKB). Clinical follow-up was performed with office visits or
      telephone contacts at 1 and 12 months after intervention. Adverse events were monitored
      throughout the study period. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed at 12 months unless
      clinically indicated earlier.
