      of interventional drainage, endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) or even
      reoperation. Strategies leading to a reduction of the rate of this complication are valuable.
      SMOFlipid 20% is a fat emulsion which is primary indicated for parenteral nutrition. Because
      of its fatty content this solution is white. This allows the clear intraoperative
      identification of open bile ducts at the liver resection surface when it is administered
      retrograde through the cystic duct. Consequently, open bile ducts can be sutured preventing
      the postoperative development of BL. If the rate of bile leakages can be reduced, resources
      for interventions and relaparotomy will be saved. This study is to investigate intraoperative
      administration of SMOFlipid 20% in terms of prevention of BL within 30 days after surgery.
