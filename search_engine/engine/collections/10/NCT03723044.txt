      contraindications to this study. The maximum duration of the individual participation of each
      subject in this study is 5 hours in two sessions. Each session lasts 2h30. Both sessions are
      spaced a maximum of 14 days apart. Each session includes EEG headset placement and oculometer
      calibration (20 min), followed by recording EEG and eye tracking activity during a visual
      cognitive task where the participant will be presented with multi-stable visual stimuli to
      watch. for one or two minutes after the tests. By repeating the essays and the conditions of
      presentation, each session will be organized in six blocks of 20 minutes each, interspersed
      with a break.
