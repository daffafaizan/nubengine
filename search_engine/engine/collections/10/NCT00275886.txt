    
      Specific Aim #1: Characterization of the gastric infiltrating T cells from H. pylori
      gastritis patients A. Patients H. pylori infected gastritis and asymptomatic patients are
      selected from National Taiwan University hospital. The gastric biopsy specimen are taken from
      endoscopic biopsy in routine health check up or panendoscopic examination for the despeptic
      patients. HP negative gastritis patients will also be studied for negative control.

      B. Immunohistochemical identification of T cells and expression of chemokine receptors.

      Specific Aim #2 . Isolation and characterization of chemokines and chemokine receptors of the
      infiltrating lymphocytes in H. pylori-associated gastritis tissue

      A. Isolation of gastric infiltrating lymphocyte B. Identification of the expression of
      chemokine receptor in gastric infiltrating lymphocytes by flow cytometry C. Detection of
      expression of chemokines in gastric tissues
