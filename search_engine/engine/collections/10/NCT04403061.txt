      inflammatory state (cytokine storm) leading to respiratory distress, ICU admission and risk
      of death. Thus, several biological agents, antagonists of the different cytokines (IL-6,
      IL-1) have been used for patients with severe disease. However, there are no data about the
      cytokine changes, at admission and after therapy, and its predictive value, a fundamental
      knowledge to establish the best therapeutic strategy.

      The first line of immune defense is the interaction of the virus with innate immunity cell
      members. The toll like receptors (TLRs) family is a group of pattern recognition receptors
      that include many different molecules (21-23). These bindings can activate dendritic cells,
      monocytes, macrophages. There is an important RNA and DNA connection, activation of TLRs, the
      production of type I interferons, and the development of some autoimmune diseases. TLR7 and
      TLR8 specifically recognize simple-chain RNA of viruses and are expressed in endosomal
      membranes. TLR8 is expressed in regulatory cells (Treg) and its activation results in
      inhibition of its regulatory functions. Natural killer cells (NK) respond to alterations of
      class I HLA molecules present in infected cells (24-26). An increase in class I HLA
      expression could lead to an increase in NK activation by increasing its ability to produce
      IFN-gamma. Therefore, the reasons for KIR binding are often variable between individuals and
      between populations.
