      sexual function that impacts their quality of life, mood, and their intimacy and relationship
      with their partners. These issues can be very distressing to patients and their loved ones.
      The Investigators want to know if the introduction of an intervention focused on improving
      sexual function may improve a participant's overall care and quality of life.

      The main purpose of this study is to compare two types of care - the study intervention
      versus enhanced standard care which includes receiving an educational handout about sexual
      dysfunction. The main goal is to assess if the intervention will improve participant's sexual
      function, quality of life, and mood.

      The intervention includes a comprehensive assessment by a transplant clinician (a transplant
      physician or nurse practitioner) who is trained in sexual dysfunction assessment to explore
      the reasons for sexual dysfunction and focus on ways to improve symptoms.

      -- If the transplant clinician feels additional help is needed by a sexual health expert, the
      participant will be referred to the sexual health clinic. In the sexual health clinic, the
      participant will be evaluated by an expert physician who will also focus on strategies to
      improve sexual function.

      The study will use a series of questionnaires to measure sexual function, quality of life,
      physical symptoms, and mood. Study questionnaires will be completed in the clinic or remotely
      with assistance provided as needed.
