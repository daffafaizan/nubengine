    
      This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy and toxicities of moderately
      hypofractionated conformal radiation combined With S-1 for esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.

      All patients will receive two cycles of S-1 (40mg/„é°, BID, po) on D1-14, D22-35, combined with
      thoracic radiotherapy of 60 Gy/24 fractions for GTV and 40 Gy/16 fractions for CTV. The
      primary end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that passes from the first
      day of radiotherapy to the date on which disease progresses. Progression-free survival will
      be calculated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.Toxicities will be graded according
      to CTCAE v. 4.0.
