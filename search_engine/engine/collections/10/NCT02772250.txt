      one-third of all colonoscopies in reported series.Inadequate bowel cleansing results in
      negative consequences for the examination, including incomplete visualisation of the colon,
      missed lesions, procedural difficulties, prolonged procedure time and reduced time interval
      until follow-up, and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy cost.

      The adequacy of a bowel preparation is closely linked to patient compliance with both dietary
      and purge instructions.One study performed in Asia showed that non-compliance with bowel
      preparation instructions, lower education level, and a long wait for the colonoscopy
      appointment were independent risk factors for poor bowel preparation. Another study performed
      in China showed that telephone re-educationï¼ˆTRE) about the details of bowel preparation on
      the day before colonoscopy significantly improved the quality of bowel preparation and PDR.
      So,it is reasonable to hypothesise that efforts to improve education and maximise patient
      compliance during the preparatory period will enhance the efficacy of bowel preparation.

      The study compares the efficacy of bowel preparation between the face-to-face re-education
      (FFRE group) and telephone re-education (TRE group) in patients.
