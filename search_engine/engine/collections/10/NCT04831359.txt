      increase to 45% by 2030(1). The introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents significantly
      improved survival, but also revealed large spectrum of cardiotoxicity manifestations (2).
      There are many factors that increase the risk of cardiotoxicity caused by different
      chemotherapeutic agents, such as type of chemotherapy, cumulative dose, concomitant or
      previous radiotherapy, and comorbidities (3). Chemotherapeutic regimens which contain
      anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, cisplatin, taxanes and trastuzumab cause
      early and late cardiotoxicity (4).

      The majority of published studies are focused on left ventricle dysfunction in patients
      receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy. However, the right ventricle has been ignored for a long
      time and a little attention has been directed to show the effect of chemotherapy on right
      ventricle function. Right ventricle dysfunction is associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality in many cardiovascular diseases (5). The structure of cardiomyocytes and blood
      supply between the left and right ventricles are similar. Given the smaller mass and fewer
      myofibrils of right ventricle, chemotherapy may theoretically cause a more significant impact
      on it (6).

      The right ventricle has a complex geometric shape which includes smooth muscular inflow,
      outflow and a trabecular apical region so echocardiographic assessment of right ventricle is
      difficult (7).

      M-mode echocardiography, two-dimensional echocardiography, conventional Doppler
      echocardiography, and myocardial Doppler tissue imaging are all used to evaluate right
      ventricular function and provide accurate prognostic information especially when used in
      combination
