      procedures with spinal anesthesia were selectedï¼Œthe Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and
      information scale was used to evaluated the degree of preoperative anxiety one day before the
      surgery. Patients in preoperative anxiety group were randomly allocated to two groups:
      butorphanol group (Group A) and physiological saline group (Group B); Patients in
      non-preoperative anxiety group were also randomly allocated to two groups: butorphanol group
      (Group C) and physiological saline group (Group D). In Group A and Group C, patients received
      an intravenous loading dose of 15ug/kg butorphanol 5 min before starting the surgery, then
      followed by infusion of 7.5ug/kg/h butorphanol and stopped infusion until the Ramsay sedation
      score reached 4 points, Group B and Group D received an infusion of the same volume of
      physiological saline. The sedation scores were recorded 10 min after getting into the
      operation room and 5, 10, 15, 30min after infusion of butorphanol or physiological saline.
      The duration when Ramsay sedation score reached 4 points in Group A and C, adverse events and
      post-operative visual analgesia scale scores were also recorded and compared.
