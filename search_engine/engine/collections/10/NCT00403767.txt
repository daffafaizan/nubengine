    
      Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for stroke and non-central
      nervous system (non-CNS) systemic embolism, will be randomized (assigned by chance) to
      receive treatment with rivaroxaban or warfarin, two different anticoagulants (substances that
      prevent blood clots). Treatment will be double-blinded (neither the patient nor study staff
      will know which study drug is assigned to patients during the study). Patients assigned to
      rivaroxaban will receive rivaroxaban 20 mg orally (p.o.) once daily (OD) plus warfarin
      placebo p.o. OD titrated to a target sham international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5.
      Patients with moderate renal impairment at screening will receive rivaroxaban 15 mg p.o. OD.
      Patients assigned to warfarin will receive warfarin p.o. OD titrated to a target INR of 2.5
      plus rivaroxaban placebo p.o. OD. The maximum expected length of treatment is up to 32 months
      but may be extended up to 4 years.
