      uncommon. The ability of low level laser therapy to reduce swelling and inflammation that
      subsequently reduces pain has been well documented. This study aimed to evaluate the ability
      of low level laser therapy to reduce post-operative pain and swelling for individuals
      undergoing bilateral breast augmentation surgery, by 24 hours post-surgery.
