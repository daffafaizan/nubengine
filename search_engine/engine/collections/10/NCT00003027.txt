        -  Compare response rate, duration of response, and survival rate in patients with
           metastatic malignant melanoma treated with cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine with
           or without interleukin-2 and interferon alfa-2b.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of these regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to performance status
      (0 vs 1), prior interferon (yes vs no), and number of involved sites. Patients are randomized
      to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes daily immediately followed by
           vinblastine IV on days 1-4. Patients also receive dacarbazine IV over 60 minutes on day
           1 following vinblastine.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I. Patients also receive interleukin 2
           (IL-2) IV continuously on days 1-4 and interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) daily
           before IL-2 on days 1-4 and after IL-2 on day 5, followed by filgrastim (G-CSF) (SC)
           daily on days 7-16.

      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 18 months, every 6 months for 18 months,
      and then annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 482 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
