      cancer surgery. The study aims to compare exercise practices with virtual reality-based
      exercise training during radiotherapy period after breast cancer surgery. Patients were
      randomly divided into 3 groups as virtual reality group, exercise group, and control group,
      considering the order of arrival at the clinic and the type of surgery (mastectomy and
      breast-conserving surgery). Patients in virtual reality group received virtual reality-based
      exercise training using Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect (Redmond, WA). Patients in exercise group
      received an exercise program including range of motion, posture, stretching and breathing
      exercises. Both exercise groups participated in the exercise program for 30- 40 minutes, 3
      days a week, as long as radiotherapy continued (5-6 weeks). Patients in the control group did
      not receive any exercise intervention as is done in the current practice. Assessment methods
      were applied at the beginning and at the end of the radiotherapy for all groups. Shoulder
      range of motion was measured using universal goniometer. Hand grip strength was measured
      using Jamar hand dynamometer. Shoulder proprioception was measured using Cybex (Lumex,NY,USA)
      isokinetic dynamometer. Upper extremity functional status, kinesiophobia, anxiety and
      depression level, fatigue and quality of life were evaluated with various questionnaires.
