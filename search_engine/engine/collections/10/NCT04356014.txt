    
      Context: Palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) associated to livid telangiectatic erythema during
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare phenomenon seldom reported in literature. To our
      knowledge no case has been described in subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) so far.
      Pathogeny and etiologic origin are not clear: it could be no-specific cutaneous manifestation
      of SLE, verrucous chilblain lupus, lichen planus, discoid lupus erythematosus lesions,
      overlap syndrome or coexistence of both diseases.

      Objective:

        1. Determine clinical immunological and histopathological features of patients with PPK and
           livid telangiectatic erythema-associated suffering from SLE and SCLE

        2. Describe the different therapeutics used and efficacy assessment Methods: Multicentric
           retrospective descriptive study reporting 14 patients with SLE or SCLE suffering from an
           acral livid erythematosus keratoderma, with clinical data regarding lupus erythematosus
           and acral keratoderma, immunological blood samples findings and histopathological
           results of keratoderma and livid erythema biopsies with direct immunofluorescence if
           performed. The treatments set down in order to heal are noted followed by efficacy
           assessment: total failure, partial remission, complete remission.
