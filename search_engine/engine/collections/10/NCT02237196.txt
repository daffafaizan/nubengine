      the disease-modifying mechanisms of allergen-specific immunotherapy by combining it with
      other anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating agents. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a
      cytokine which appears to be instrumental in both initiating and maintaining allergic
      sensitivity to antigens, and Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) investigators hypothesize that
      blocking TSLP during the administration of cat immunotherapy will induce durable immune
      changes that lead to tolerance.

      CATNIP will be conducted at multiple sites in the US and enroll cat-allergic adults who will
      be randomized to four possible treatment groups: immunotherapy plus MEDI9929/AMG 157,
      immunotherapy plus placebo, placebo plus MEDI9929/AMG 157, or two corresponding placebos.
      This study is specifically enrolling cat allergic individuals who do not live with cats in
      order to limit exposure to the allergen outside of the study. Treatment will be given for
      about one year, followed by one year off therapy.
