      antiseptic drug products. In this study, benzalkonium chloride disinfectant spray will be
      compared to a positive control, and two negative control for irritancy potential on normal
      skin according to Chinese Patch Test Guideline (China Health Authority 2002). The skin
      irritation assessment will characterize the test products individually in terms of
      symptomatology using a 5-point categorical scale ranging from 0 (no visible reaction) to 4
