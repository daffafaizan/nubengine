    
      Vulvar dermatoses are skin disorders that affect the vulva, causing pruritus, irritation and
      pain. Although the prevalence of these disorders is unknown, it is well accepted that the
      vulvar symptoms are a common problem for women.

      LabiaStick#01 has emollient agents whose main function is to increase the skin hydration,
      provide physical protection and decrease the symptoms and possibility of recurrence of vulvar
      dermatoses.

      The medical device should be applied once daily, in the evening, after intimal hygiene care.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of LabiaStick#01 on the
      relief of pruritus caused by symptomatic non-hypertrophic chronic vulvar dermatoses.
