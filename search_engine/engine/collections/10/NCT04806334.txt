      undergo transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) and are felt by the treating
      physician to harbor MIBC. Prior to TURBT, ALL subjects will undergo axial imaging for
      clinical staging in the form of contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (standard of
      care). The pelvic MRI will be multiparametric (mp)-4D MRI incorporating high resolution
      diffusion weighted imaging (HR-DWI). Both the abdominal and pelvic MRI will have an official
      intrepretation by a radiologist, thus both can be used in the care of the subject. Next, ALL
      subjects will undergo TURBT at which time fresh frozen bladder tumor will be collected and
      subjected to single cell RNA sequencing. Pathologic stage will be determined and reported on
      both the TURBT specimen and radical cystectomy specimen. From the above radiogenomic data,
      the investigators will show feasibility, which the investigators will define as know-how to
      create a radiogenomic workflow and to learn about the correlation structure between the
      radiomic and genomic parameters of interest, which will allow the investigators to design
      future studies with adequate power.
