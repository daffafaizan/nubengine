      the sacrum, with application of contact on the sacrotuberous ligament which relieves fatigued
      and strained muscles, particularly intrinsic muscles of the back. Surface electromyography
      (EMG) is a method of analyzing the activity level of superficial muscles. It is convenient
      and advantageous when studying muscle relaxation which occurs in biofeedback studies
