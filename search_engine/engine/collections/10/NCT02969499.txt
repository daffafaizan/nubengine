      psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In this study, the participants will have already
      been treated with antipsychotic medications as per usual practice but still do not have
      adequate symptoms control. One of the options in current clinical practice is to consider
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant BPSD, particularly in those with
      psychosis and/or substantial aggression. Therefore, the study involves offering ECT to these
      individuals and measuring the patient's clinical status and severity of symptoms before and
      after ECT treatments by using standardized rating scales. Further, background information
      about the patient will be collected, such as their age and medical conditions.

      ECT for BPSD has been done previously as reported in the medical literature. It has shown
      significant benefit for individuals when medication does not provide enough symptomatic
      relief. This research project is part of a larger multi-site study done in conjunction with
      Ontario Shores academic research group in Ontario, Canada. Active recruitment began in
      Ontario since October 2012, but our UBC site is hoping to recruit further subjects to the
      total of 30 participants between the two sites.
