      Clinic who are treatment planned for tooth extraction and placement of dental implant(s) will
      be interviewed for possible participation in the study. Forty extraction sites will be
      included in this study to provide statistical significance.

      The ridge preservation sites, using either NuOss XC or NuOss particulate, will be selected
      randomly. The first site will be selected using the flip of a coin. Thereafter, every other
      site will be grafted using NuOs XC. The ridge preservation procedure will involve tooth
      extraction with as little trauma as possible to preserve all four bony socket walls,
      curettage of the socket to remove all periodontal ligament fibers and granulation tissue,
      placement of the graft material into the socket and coverings the graft material with
      long-lasting collagen membrane. Facial and lingual mucoperiosteal flaps will be elevated to
      facilitate securing of the membrane with long-lasting absorbable sutures. Patient will be
      given prescriptions for analgesics and antibiotics as necessary.
