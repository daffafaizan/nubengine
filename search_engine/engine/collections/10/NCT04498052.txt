    
      The purpose of this project is to increase appropriate low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)
      lung cancer screening through the development and wide dissemination of patient-centered
      clinical decision support (CDS) tools that (1) are integrated with the electronic health
      record (EHR) and clinical workflows, (2) prompt for shared decision making (SDM) when
      patients meet screening criteria, and (3) enable effective SDM using individually-tailored
      information on the potential benefits and harms of screening. The study will promote standard
      of care that is endorsed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the US
      Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This project is supported both operationally and by
      an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) R18 grant.

      This project will leverage Decision Precision, a validated Web-based tool for LDCT SDM
      developed at the Veterans Health Administration, as well as an initial version of Decision
      Precision+, an EHR-integrated version of the tool which can be accessed directly in the EHR
      and auto-populate relevant patient data in the tool instead of requiring manual data entry.

      This study will be an 18-month interrupted time series study conducted at the University of
      Utah Health primary care clinics.
