      study in which cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive escalating doses of L19-IL2 in
      combination with a fixed dose of Rituximab (375 mg/m2).

      Phase II - Activity Evaluation: Open-label, multi-center, prospective study during which 14
      enrolled patients will receive a fixed dose of Rituximab (375 mg/m2) in combination with
      L19-IL2 at the RD defined during the Phase I part of the study.

      The study is designed to establish whether L19-IL2, administered in combination with
      Rituximab is well tolerated and can achieve objective responses and clinical benefit to
      patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.
