      likelihood that individuals will purchase oral fluid-based HIV self-tests at alternative
      prices. Such an approach is useful for estimating the price sensitivity (or elasticity) of
      demand for HIV self-tests. The study will also estimate the extent to which demand for
      self-tests differs by certain distribution channels such as retail outlets, public sector
      health facilities, and other community-based venues. Importantly, the experiment will also
      test whether the provision of HIV self-tests can be targeted more cost-effectively to reach
      high-risk persons and non-recent testers by examining the demand for self-tests in these
      populations in responses to various prices and distribution strategies. The results of the
      study will provide vital information required by policy makers and implementers on the
      optical pricing and distribution strategies for introducing HIV self-tests and scaling up
      HIVST in resource-limited settings. In a subsequent study with additional funding, the study
      will also seek to determine the long-term implications of offering self-tests at very low
      prices initially; specifically, it will assess whether free distribution initially suppresses
      individuals' willingness to pay for self-tests in the future. Roughly 12 months after the
      initial voucher offer, participants who provided a mobile phone number they can access within
      their household will be contacted via phone-based text messages and offered the same HIV
      self-tests again at one common non-zero price. The purchases at 12 months will once again be
      monitored and linked to participants via a unique identifier that is included in the text
      messages.
