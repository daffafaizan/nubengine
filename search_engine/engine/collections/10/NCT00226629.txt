      technique. The use of Endovascular stent grafts(EVAR) to treat aortic aneurysms has been
      ongoing for approximately 8-10 years. Use of EVAR to treat aortic aneurysms in high risk has
      been reported to be beneficial. However, the costs of this therapy are quite significant and
      therefore in order to best understand the cost effectiveness of this type of aneurysm
      treatment, an extensive prospective comparative evaluation is required. This study will
      compare outcomes and cost-effectiveness for patients receiving EVAR, with high surgical risk,
      and OSR, with low surgical risk, and OSR, where there is high surgical risk and not suitable
      for EVAR based on anatomical complexity. Demographic, medical, health care resource
      utilization, cost, and quality of life information is collected from participating patients
      over a period of a year following repair.
