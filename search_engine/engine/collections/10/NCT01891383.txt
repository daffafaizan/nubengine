      75 retirement home residents without a history of TBI who are age-matched to the cases will
      also be recruited. Participants will be evaluated in a single visit, which will include
      neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive assessment. The evaluation will take approximately 4
      hours. In some cases, the evaluation may be split into two 2 hour sessions.
