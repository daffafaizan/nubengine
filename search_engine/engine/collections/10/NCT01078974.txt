           treatment cycle lasts 28 days during which time participants will take Pomalidomide
           orally once a day. Dexamethasone and rituximab will be administered intravenously on
           weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and on weeks 12, 13, 14, 15.

        -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of Pomalidomide in combination with
           dexamethasone and rituximab which can be administered safely without severe or
           unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of
           the study drug. The dose participants will get will depend on the number of participants
           who have been enrolled in the study and how well they have tolerated their doses.

        -  As long as there is no evidence that the participant's Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
           has progressed, they can continue to receive Pomalidomide for up to 52 weeks.
           Participants will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up tests at least every
           three months for four years.
