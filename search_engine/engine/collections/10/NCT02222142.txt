      reduce mortality in cardiac surgery owing to its preconditioning induced cardioprotective
      effect. Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCAB) surgery still requires cardioprotective
      strategies due to coronary hypoperfusion during anastomosis. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the possible cardioprotective effect and clinical outcomes of propofol versus
      isoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing OPCAB using propensity matching.
