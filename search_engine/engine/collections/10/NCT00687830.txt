    
      Two bowel preparation regimens of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), commonly referred to as
      "Golytely" will be tested for their efficacy (bowel cleansing effect) and patient
      tolerability. The goal is to reduce the failure rates of afternoon colonoscopies, for which,
      one of the main reasons attributed is inadequate bowel preparation. For the afternoon
      colonoscopies, the conventional PEG regimen given on the evening prior to the day of the
      colonoscopy will be compared with the novel PEG regimen given on the morning of the day of
      the colonoscopy. The comparison will be drawn for two measures - bowel cleansing effect
      measured from the questionnaire given to the gastroenterologists performing the colonoscopy
      and the patient tolerability evaluated from the information gathered from the patient's
      questionnaire.
