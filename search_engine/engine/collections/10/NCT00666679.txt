      approximately 6 weeks). In a crossover manner, eligible patients will also receive
      montelukast (powder, 1 mg once-daily, for approximately 2 weeks) followed by placebo; or will
      receive placebo followed by montelukast. The order of when each of these 2 treatments are
      added to the mometasone will be randomized.
