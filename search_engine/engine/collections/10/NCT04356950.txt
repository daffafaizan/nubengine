      medical support, the development of an acquired coagulopathy, from a sepsis-induced
      coagulopathy to an overt-DIC, which is a strong risk factor for death. Understanding this
      coagulopathy is a prerequisite before specific interventional studies. Conventional
      coagulation tests, like prothrombin time PT and aPTT, only reflect 5% of the total thrombin
      generation and are insensitive to the patients' natural anticoagulants. The investigators
      thus wish to analyze the coagulopathy of SARS-CoV-2 using a global analytical test reflecting
      the full complexity of thrombin generation then inhibition, the thrombin generation test
      (TGT), in its version designed to analyze the thrombotic risk (initiation by an intermediate
      concentration of human Tissue: 5 pM), in its fully automated and standardized technical
      version. This test analyzes not only the generation of thrombin and its various informative
      phases (initiation phase, propagation phase culminating at the peak of formation, inhibition
      phase with natural anticoagulants) but also the capacity for an exogenous addition of
      purified thrombomodulin (TM), which quantifies the anticoagulant activity of the patient's
      protein C activated by thrombin, to inhibit this generation of thrombin.

      The aim is to assay this TGT version in a centralized way, on the patients' plasma obtained
      at hospital admission, just after checking the positive COVID-19 testing , together with the
      traditional blood tests including platelet counts, PT, D-dimers (DDi) and soluble fibrin
      monomers (FMs). The various quantitative biological parameters describing the results of the
      TGT assay, together with relevant covariates, will be tested using multivariate analysis for
      their capacity to be risk factors for clinically-relevant qualitative outcomes.
