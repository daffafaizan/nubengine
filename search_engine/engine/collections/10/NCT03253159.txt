      alleviate patient anxiety. However, alternative techniques, additional non-pharmacological,
      have proven effective in alleviating pain and anxiety perioperative. These techniques are
      retained relaxation therapy, reinsurance, breathing techniques and medical hypnosis as a
      technique of choice. Regarding medical hypnosis techniques, many studies have shown that
      performing a hypnotic technique performed perioperative could reduce the doses of
      anesthetics, postoperative pain, length of stay in the post room Interventional (SSPI) and a
      number of postoperative adverse effects.

      Among the various techniques of hypnosis that can be offered to patients in the
      perioperative, conversational hypnosis is to accompany the patient on admission to the block
      to realization of general anesthesia. This technique aims to suggest a pleasant environment
      and not anxiety.

      This study evaluate the impact of this support in reducing postoperative major adverse
      effects in particular on the pain but also on anxiety, comfort, nausea, vomiting, and
      fatigue.
