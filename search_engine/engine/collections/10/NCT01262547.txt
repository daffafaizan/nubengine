      skin with dermabrasion. Several small pieces of pigmented skin (1.75mm) from the patient are
      taken from another area with the use of a suction blister device. The harvested pigmented
      skin is adhered to a sterile elastomeric substrate and placed on the previously dermabraded
      affected area.

      Originally the primary outcome was percentage of change in pigmentation with UV photos at 10
      weeks in sites undergoing grafts compared to control sites. However, because we were unable
      to take UV photos, we had to revise our primary outcome.
