      institutions in Asian countries participating in the study and will engage in data analysis.
      J-CaP which has previous experience of engaging in a similar study in 2010 wll be a sponsor
      for A-CaP study, the aggregated results of which have been reported. The registration period
      for this study will be three years followed by 7 years of follow-up study, and research will
      be implemented across a wider range of Asian countries, with new institutions participating
      for the purposes of this study. As this study will be an observational study the acquisition
      of data will be relatively simple, and as the content of the study will be almost identical
      to the study conducted by J-CaP in 2010, a system for research implementation is already
      established at J-CaP.
