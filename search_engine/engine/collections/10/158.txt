changes in sphingosine and fatty acid components of the gangliosides indeveloping rat and human brain .rat brain increases in weight after birth in three stages.. (i)rapidly for the first 2 weeks, (ii) at a lower rate from 2 to 5 weeks,and (iii) at a still lower rate from 5 weeks to 5 months . during thesucceeding period, designated iv, it maintains constant weight up to 1year of age . brain ganglioside content increased linearly during i andii, more slowly during iii, and diminished during iv . the appearance ofmeasurable amounts of brain sphingomyelin and cerebroside succeeded thatof ganglioside .ceramide with c -sphingosine and c fatty acid was found in a largeproportion of all three sphingolipids upon their first appearance inmeasurable quantity . c fatty acid in cerebroside rapidly declined to anegligible level, while in gangliosides and sphingomyelin it declinedslowly but remained the major fatty acid component .cerebrosides and sphingomyelin contained c -sphingosine almostexclusively at all stages of rat brain growth . gangliosides contained c-sphingosine almost exclusively at birth, but subsequently accumulated c-sphingosine until they had nearly equal quantities of each base type .changes in human brain gangliosides resemble those in rat . intay-sachs disease, gangliosides have c -sphingosine predominantly, and ahigh content of c fatty acid .
