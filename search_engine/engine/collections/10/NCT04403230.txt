      on teeth prepared without finish line.

      This prospective study included 149 teeth treated using biologically oriented preparation
      technique (BOPT). The sample (149 teeth) was divided into two groups: Seventy four teeth
      restored with crowns, and 75 teeth supporting fixed partial dentures (FPD). Restorations were
      fabricated with zirconium oxide cores and ceramic coverings. Patients attended regular annual
      check-ups when probe depth, presence of inflammation with bleeding on probing, presence of
      plaque, gingival thickness, marginal stability, biological or mechanical complications, and
      the patient's level of satisfaction were registered.
