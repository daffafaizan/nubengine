      and recurrent behavior. Invasive or intensive treatments with surgery or radiation therapy
      can lead to good tumor control, but at the expense of significant side effects along with a
      high risk of local recurrence after surgical excision. Low dose regimens of standard
      chemotherapy drugs have been favored as a conservative first-line treatment; however,
      refractory and recurrent tumors are not uncommon. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      the efficacy and safety of using hydroxyurea, an anti-neoplastic agent with relatively few
      side-effects, as a novel treatment for primary, unresectable desmoid tumors, desmoid tumors
      that have had an incomplete primary resection, or desmoid tumors that have recurred after
      other therapy.

      Patients presenting to our oncology center with a new diagnosis of desmoid tumor, or a
      recurrent desmoid tumor, will be eligible for this study. After informed consent, physical
      examination, and baseline imaging studies (CT/MRI), patients will receive oral hydroxyurea at
      a starting dose of 20 mg/kg daily. Laboratory tests will be performed at set intervals to
      maintain the appropriate dose and monitor for cytopenias. Clinical evaluations, physical
      examinations, and/or imaging studies will be conducted every three months to assess for
      changes in tumor size. Patients will remain on hydroxyurea as long as there is a response or
      stability in tumor size and associated toxicities are manageable. Data will be collected
      regarding the response to the drug, the duration of the response, and the occurrence of
      adverse events. The goal of the analysis will be to determine the efficacy of hydroxyurea as
      a treatment modality for desmoid tumors.
