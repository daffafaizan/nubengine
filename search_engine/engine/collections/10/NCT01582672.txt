      electroporated dendritic cell (DC) based immunotherapy, AGS-003, plus standard treatment
      (initiating with sunitinib). The primary objective in this study is to determine the median
      OS achieved by this combination compared to the OS resulting from use of active control
      (standard treatment), in a population of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
      with nephrectomy indicated, and with remaining metastatic disease.
