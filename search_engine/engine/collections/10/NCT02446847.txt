    
      The proposed study is a Phase II, open label study to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral
      activity of two and four infusions of 3BNC117 in HIV-infected subjects on combination ART
      during a brief analytical treatment interruption.

      After meeting enrollment criteria sixteen subjects with 3BNC117 sensitive virus (<2μg/ml
      IC50) will receive two (Group A) or four (Group B) intravenous infusions of 3BNC117,
      administered at 30 mg/kg.

      In both dosing groups, antiretroviral therapy will be discontinued 2 days after the first
      3BNC117 infusion (day 2) until week 12. Combination ART will be resumed at week 12. ART will
      be resumed sooner if plasma HIV-1 RNA level is ≥ 200 copies/ml or if CD4+ count drops < 350
      cells/μl and either result is confirmed upon repeat measurement. Participants will be
      followed weekly until week 12 for safety assessments and for monitoring plasma HIV-1 RNA
      levels (viral load). CD4+ T cell counts will be monitored every 2 weeks until week 12.

      Participants may remain off antiretroviral therapy after week 12, with weekly viral load
      monitoring, if viral rebound does not occur by week 12. Participants will be followed for a
      total of 36 weeks.
