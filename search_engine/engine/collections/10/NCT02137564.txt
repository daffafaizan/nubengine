      I. Evaluate the tolerance and clinical response of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) tumors to PF-03084014
      (gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014) with assessments of partial response (PR) and
      complete response (CR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of PF-03084014 on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load in
      plasma and the effect of PF-03084014 on cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ cell number.

      II. Assess the effect of PF-030840414 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
      tumors on Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latent and lytic gene expression.

      III. Assess effects of PF-03084014 on activation of Notch target genes including
      tumor-associated endothelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation markers.

      IV. Assess effects of trough PF-03084014 drug levels on clinical response and toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PR, CR, or stable disease (SD) at the end
      of 4 courses may receive an additional 4 courses of gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
