      I. To obtain nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) samples from non-lactating women subjects at least
      40-years-old.

      II. To analyze the samples using a novel protein nanopore-based detection platform to
      evaluate the efficacy of the platform for breast cancer diagnosis through detection of
      biomarkers.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants and healthy volunteers undergo collection of nipple aspirate fluid from both
      breasts.
