    
      A total of 48 patients with T1D are planned to be studied in 4 cohorts of 12 patients (9 on
      active and 3 on placebo treatment). Within each cohort, sentinel enrollment will occur and
      safety assessment will occur before remaining participants are enrolled. The treatment period
      will be 12 weeks with once weekly dosing leading to 12 doses in total. Dose escalation will
      occur after data safety review (as described in section 4.9.2). An MMTT to assess insulin
      secretion will be done at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The follow-up (FU) period will be
      1 week after the last dose, as well as 4, 6 and 12 months after the first dose.
