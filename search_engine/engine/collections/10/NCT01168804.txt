      myeloma patients is unfavourable, with no remaining chance for cure. Therefore the search for
      new treatment regimens, including drugs with novel, and different, mechanisms of action is
      mandatory.

      Both bendamustine and bortezomib are not yet established parts of standard first-line
      regimens, but showed to have high activity both in chemo-na√Øve and pre-treated patients. The
      novel mechanism of action of the proteasome inhibitor and the non-cross resistance of
      bendamustine to other alkylating agents established in the first-line treatment of multiple
      myeloma seem to recommend a combination of the two drugs for salvage therapy. The promising
      response data in a series of relapsing MM patients treated with bendamustine, bortezomib and
      prednisone support this assumption, as well as the feasibility and tolerability of the
      combination.

      In summary, there is some evidence for a favourable risk/benefit ratio for the combination of
      bendamustine, bortezomib and a glucocorticoid drug, warranting the exploration in a larger,
      prospectively designed multicenter phase II study.
