      differs between patients whom have computer-assisted TKA and those treated with conventional
      intraoperative instrumentation.

      Three months after surgery follow-up radiographic data will provide evidence on the initial
      implant position as determined with a series of x-rays including: full length standing,
      standard AP weight bearing, lateral, patellar, kneelingfilm views and CT evaluation. In
      addition, a correlation betweeen the CT measures and the kneeling x-ray can be performed at
      this time. Clinical (Knee Scale Society, WOMAC, and SF-36) data will also be obtained at the
      three month interval.
