      I. To find the maximal tolerated dose for the combination of irinotecan and Triapine® in
      patients with refractory solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To find the severity and frequency of toxicity associated with this combination and to
      observe for and record any antitumor activity.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of Triapine®/irinotecan on the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl
      radical in vivo by Electron Paramagnetic Spectroscopy (EPR) in buccal mucosal cells,
      peripheral blood lymphocytes and in tumor biopsies. Formation of low molecular weight
      iron-Triapine® chelates will also be assessed by EPR.

      II. To evaluate the effect of Triapine® /irinotecan on cell cycle in vivo by measuring
      S-phase arrest in buccal mucosal cells.

      III. To evaluate the effect of Triapine® /irinotecan on MDR gene expression and polymorphisms
      in blood.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of Triapine® /irinotecan on ribonucleotide reductase R2 mRNA and
      Immunohistochemistry.

      V. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on day 1 and 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 2 hours on
      days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and 3-AP (Triapine®) until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, 6 additional patients are treated at that dose.

      Patients are followed until disease progression.
