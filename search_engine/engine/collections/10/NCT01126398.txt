        1. To develop a novel, psychometrically sound, trauma patient expectation instrument that:
           a) demonstrates content validity; b) considers patient and surgeon expectations; c)
           predicts orthopedic outcomes; d) is reliable; e) is patient friendly; and f) is easy to
           score and interpret. This will be known as the Trauma Expectation Factor (TEF).

        2. To develop a novel, psychometrically sound, trauma patient outcomes instrument that: a)
           demonstrates content validity; b) measures current condition in the same domains as the
           expectation instrument; c) demonstrates construct validity; d) demonstrates criterion
           validity; e) is reliable; f) is patient friendly; and g) is easy to score and interpret.
           This will be known as the Trauma Outcomes Measure (TOM).

      Hypotheses:

      H#1. A simple pre-surgical questionnaire that measures patient expectations (i.e., Trauma
      Expectation Factor) after an ankle fracture requiring surgery will predict an "expected"
      score on a standardized disease-specific ankle instrument (i.e., AAOS Foot and Ankle Core
      Score).

      H#2. A similar instrument that is reworded to assess current condition (i.e., Trauma Outcomes
      Measure) instead of expectations, is a valid, reliable, and responsive measure of a traumatic
      patient's condition.

      H#3. Patient and surgeon expectations of final outcome status are different; however, the
      differences get smaller over time.
