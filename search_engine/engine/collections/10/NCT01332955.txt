    
      This phase II pilot trial is designed for HIV-1 and HCV genotype 1 coinfected patients who
      had previously failed a peginterferon-ribavirin regimen.

      Intervention Design:

        -  Induction, Lead-in, phase: day 0 to week 4 PegInterferon alpha-2a, 180 µg subcutaneous
           injection, once weekly + Ribavirin (weight-based dose) 1000 mg for subjects weighing <75
           kg or 1200 mg for subjects weighing ≥75 kg, b.i.d.

        -  Telaprevir phase: week 4 to week 16 PegInterferon alpha-2a, 180 µg subcutaneous
           injection, once weekly + Ribavirin (weight-based dose) 1000 mg for subjects weighing <75
           kg or 1200 mg for subjects weighing ≥75 kg, b.i.d.

           + Telaprevir 750 mg q 8h (or 1125 mg q 8h in association with Efavirenz)

        -  Maintenance phase: week 16 to week 48 or 72 PegInterferon alpha-2a, 180 µg subcutaneous
           injection, once weekly + Ribavirin (weight-based dose) 1000 mg for subjects weighing <75
           kg or 1200 mg for subjects weighing ≥75 kg, b.i.d.

      The duration of the maintenance phase is determined by the RVR at week 8 (4 weeks after
      Telaprevir start.

      Complete RVR (not measurable HCV-RNA at week 8): maintenance from week 16 to week 48

      _Partial RVR (HCV-RNA below 1 000 UI/mL but still measurable at week 8): maintenance phase
      from week 16 to week 48

      And stable antiretroviral treatment for over 3 months among the authorized combinations:
      (tenofovir 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, atazanavir 300 mg, ritonavir 100 mg) q.d. or
      (tenofovir 300 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, efavirenz 600 mg) q.d. or (tenofovir 300 mg,
      emtricitabine 200 mg q.d. and raltegravir 400 mg b.i.d.) once Drug-Drug interaction data will
      be available. Patients who could not receive one of these 3 combinations can be included if
      they are receiving a stable combination of at least 3 drugs among the following: tenofovir,
      emtricitabine/lamivudine, efavirenz, atazanavir-boosted or not, raltegravir (once Drug-Drug
      interaction data will be available). These patients cannot participate in the pharmacokinetic
      study.

      The trial will enroll 80 subjects. The proportion of patients included, presenting with
      cirrhosis (METAVIR F4) will remain below 50% of all patients The proportion of patients
      included, null-responders to previous HCV treatment (HCV-RNA decline at week 12 less than 2
      log10 UI/ml) but no cirrhosis (maximum equal METAVIR F3) will remain below 30% of patients.
