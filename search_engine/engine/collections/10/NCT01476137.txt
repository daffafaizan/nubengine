    
      This is an open-label, two part, Phase I/II study to investigate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212
      administered in combination with the AKT inhibitor GSK2110183 in subjects with solid tumors
      and multiple myeloma.

      In Part 1, the safety and tolerability of a range of doses for GSK1120212 and GSK2110183
      dosed in combination will be investigated; pharmacokinetics will also be analyzed to
      determine whether there is a drug-drug interaction between GSK1120212 and GSK2110183 when
      dosed in combination.

      The second part of the study will focus on evaluation of the clinical efficacy of the
      combination as well as the pharmacodynamic response in subjects with proteasome-refractory
      multiple myeloma (Part 2A) or solid tumors, putatively endometrial and triple negative breast
      cancer (Part 2B).
