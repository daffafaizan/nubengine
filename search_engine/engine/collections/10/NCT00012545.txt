      gene therapy. Our goal is to procure umbilical cord blood (UCB) from newborns at risk for
      sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, and related disorders as well as normal newborns and
      store clinical grade cord blood units (CBU) for future use in clinical transplantation or
      gene therapy. Cord blood units will be collected from an indefinite number of subjects until
      50 CBU from newborns with homozygous sickle cell disease have been cryopreserved. Maternal
      subjects will be identified as being at risk to have an infant with sickle cell disease, will
      be between the ages of 18 and 45 years, and will meet specified medical history criteria.
      Mothers will have to deliver at INOVA Fairfax Hospital (collection provider site) and the CB
      will be collected by NCBP collectors ex utero, will be transported to the NCBP CB facility
      and will be processed, tested and stored. Frozen CBU will be transferred to the NIH for
      clinical transplantation or gene therapy studies upon NIH request.
