      treatment acceptability and efficacy.This includes evaluating the efficacy and acceptability
      of CBT-AR in reducing primary ARFID symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, and to assess
      whether improvement in individual symptoms is related to the timing of relevant
      interventions. The investigators hypothesize that from pre-treatment to post-treatment,
      subjects with ARFID will decrease severity of self-reported ARFID symptoms, decrease
      self-reported anxiety and depression, and improve psychosocial functioning. The investigators
      further hypothesize that overall, subjects with ARFID will have reduced phobic avoidance,
      sensory sensitivity, and/or low appetite in comparison to their pre-treatment symptoms.
