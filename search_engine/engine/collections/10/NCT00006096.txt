        -  Compare the recurrence-free interval and survival in patients with stage I, II, III, or
           IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with involved inguinal lymph nodes treated with
           adjuvant radiotherapy with or without cisplatin.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      primary surgical resection (yes vs no) and node status (N1 vs N2). Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients also receive cisplatin IV
           over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.5 years.
