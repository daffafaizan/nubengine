      contains questions regarding attitudes towards being required to perform CPR (6 questions),
      previous experience in performing CPR (time since last performance and number of
      performances) and attitudes during the latest CPR performance (8 questions). All attitude
      questions are constructed as multiple choice questions.

      Results regarding attitudes towards being required to perform CPR and attitudes during the
      latest CPR performance will be presented descriptively. To analyse a possible effect of time
      since CPR performance and number of CPR performances on attitudes during the latest CPR
      performance logistic regression will be used. Response variables will be "yes" or "no" on 8
      specific attitude questions with predictors consisting of time since CPR performance (0-3
      months ago, 4-23 months ago and >24 months) and number of CPR performances (1-3 times, 4-10
      times and >10 times).
