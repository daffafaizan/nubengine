      at high risk for developing pressure ulcers (PUs). PU standard prevention includes
      repositioning, early mobilization and the use of special support surfaces. The use of
      prophylactic dressings might reduce friction and shear forces and/or modify the microclimate
      of the skin and might therefore protect the skin and underlying tissues from
      pressure/deformation injury. The primary objective of this study is to determine if
      preventive silicone dressings (MepilexÂ® border) applied to the heels and to the sacrum in
      addition to PU standard prevention reduces PU incidence category II, III, IV, and deep tissue
      injury compared to PU standard alone in at risk hospital patients.
