    
      Borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) patients who have successfully underwent R0/R1
      resection of PDAs following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, between 1-3 months after the completion
      of planned adjuvant chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two arms
      (56 per arm). Patients in Arm A will be given anti-PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab, every 2 weeks
      for a maximum of 26 doses if there is no radiographic evidence of disease recurrence.
      Patients in Arm B will be observed. Blood draws for immune monitoring and serum banking will
      be collected at the following time points:

      Arm A - before Cycles 1, 2, 4, 7 and End of Treatment (EOT) visit; Arm B - before Cycles 1,
      4, 7, and End of Treatment (EOT) visit
