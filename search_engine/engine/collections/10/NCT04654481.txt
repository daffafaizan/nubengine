      Mount Sinai's COVID-19 Post-Recovery Center of Excellence and Respiratory Institute. Fifteen
      subjects (determined by the last digit of their medical record number) will receive a HFCWO
      device (AffloVest), digital thermometer, pulse oximeter, and spirometer at their home.
      Participants will be trained remotely to use the AffloVest and spirometer. In addition all
      subjects will be asked to complete a series of online mental health and respiratory symptom
      assessments via REDCap. A 15 patient control group meeting inclusion criteria will be
      recruited from the Mount Sinai COVID-19 Post-Recovery Center of Excellence and Respiratory
      Institute using the same screening process. This group will not receive the HFCWO
      intervention but will receive a digital thermometer, pulse oximeter, and spirometer at their
      home (with training via telehealth), asked to complete all REDCap and respiratory symptom
      assessments. Consent for both groups will be obtained by a Mount Sinai clinician-researcher.

      Study Duration Approximately 30 days plus 60 and 90-day check in

      Objectives To investigate the addition of HFCWO therapy to the prescribed care regimen to
      support the diaphragm during airway clearance among post-COVID patients with COPD and chronic
      productive cough as a way to limit the advancement of pulmonary symptoms and need for
      critical services during recovery from COVID-19.
