      lifestyle intervention for diabetes prevention. Participants who do not achieve >2.5% weight
      loss by week 5 of the intervention will transition into augmented care with an enhanced
      training program that addresses values clarification, decision making, planning, and problem
      solving. The impact of the enhanced intervention will be evaluated at 4, 12 and 18 months
      from baseline to determine if implementing early enhanced training helps participants achieve
      and maintain weight loss similar to those who received the standard intervention.
