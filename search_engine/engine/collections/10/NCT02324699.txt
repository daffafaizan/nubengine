      disease. To address questions regarding the effect of co-induction on mucosal healing, the
      study will include colonoscopic assessment of mucosal healing. Finally, colonic biopsies in
      this study will allow to elucidate further the mechanism of action of vedolizumab in Crohn's
      disease through immune phenotyping studies.
