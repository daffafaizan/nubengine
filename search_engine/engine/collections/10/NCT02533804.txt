      Nona Institute (LNI), carried out by the Lake Nona Medical City Residents and Partners (the
      Researchers), and sponsored by Florida Hospital. The project is designed to study patterns,
      predictors and strategies for improving human health and wellness. Data will be obtained over
      many years using surveys/interviews, medical tests, and health information from 3rd parties
      (i.e., health care claims data) obtained with participant permission.
