    
      Goal:

      Create comprehensive patient-multiomic profile
      (PRO-Visualosome-microbiome-transcriptome-pharmacokineticome) to develop algorithm-based
      personalized IBD therapy

      Design Prospective observational cohort study.

      Study aim To detect predictors of response to biologics using a layered multiomic approach

      Cohort size Up to 140 patients in 2 years

      Study duration -Patients will be followed up to 2 years (possible extension) or until
      treatment discontinuation or intestinal surgery

      Study procedures All study procedures will be performed for the purpose of the study

      Baseline

      Disease activity using Harvey Bradshaw score at all timepoints and visits

        -  baseline PROS -PROMIS10/SIBDQ/IBD control/PRO2 using DATOS app

        -  colonoscopy with Intestinal biopsies

        -  Blood for transcriptomics

        -  Blood/serum for serum and cellular markers

        -  Stool for microbiome/metabolomics (if colonoscopy done- a rectal swab during colonoscopy
           will be performed)

        -  Pillcam CD following patency capsule - if failed patients still will be included and
           continue follow- up without capsule endoscopy

        -  MRE

        -  IUS

        -  Fecal calprotectin home kit with CALPROSMART

        -  Basic chemistry

        -  Joint US (if joint symptoms) Repeated assessment -every month

        -  PROMIS10/SIBDQ/IBD control/-via DATOS app (during the first 14-16 weeks- PRO2 will be
           evaluated weekly) Continuous monitoring (mobile device via DATOS app)

      First follow-up visit (12-14 weeks)

        -  Calprotectin

        -  Microbiome

        -  Blood for transcriptomics

        -  Blood/serum for serum and cellular markers, drug levels, CRP

      Every 3 months

      - Home calprotectin (Calprosmart) +microbiome

      Every 6 months

        -  Clinic visit

        -  Pillcam CD

        -  IUS

        -  Blood for transcriptomics

        -  Blood/serum for serum and cellular markers, drug levels, CRP

        -  Calprotectin (home +ELISA) + microbiome

      Upon failure (need to switch medication -defined by treating physician) or end of study

        -  Clinic visit

        -  Calprotectin *Home +ELISA)

        -  Microbiome

        -  Serum for transriptomics, metabolomics

        -  Blood/serum for serum and cellular markers, drug levels, CRP

        -  Repeat Pillcam CD (if not done within 6 months)

        -  Repeat IUS +thermal imaging (if not done within 6 months)

        -  MRE

             -  Drug levels will be done at every infusion for IV drugs and every 6 months for SC
                biologics and at the end of induction (week 8-16)
