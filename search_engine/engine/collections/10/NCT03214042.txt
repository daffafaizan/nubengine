      treatment of chronic back pain due to intervertebral disc degeneration, but adverse
      reactions, such as accelerated regression of adjacent segments, are often inevitable during
      the treatment.

      At present, various pedicle screw-based posterior dynamic stability systems of the lumbar
      spine have become an alternative fusion therapy for lumbar degenerative diseases. Dynamic
      stability is defined to reduce the loading on the intervertebral disc/articular surfaces, to
      maintain movement under mechanical load, to limit the abnormal movement of the spinal
      segment, and to reduce the stress on the bone-screw interface dynamically and stably. An
      ideal fixation system will be stable enough to maximize the fusion rate without the need for
      excessive rigidity, as well as to maintain maximum load and physiological posture of the
      vertebral segment, thereby reducing the horizontal stress of the adjacent segment.
