      have already had a bronchoscopy and lung resection or will have a bronchoscopy and lung
      resection for squamous cell carcinoma. The investigators plan to prospectively collect 5
      bronchoscopic biopsies, 10ml blood and one tumor and adjacent normal samples from 200
      qualified patients who meet the study criteria. If a patient has already had a bronchoscopy
      and has consented to have samples stored for research at the Mayo Clinic Rochester we will
      access them for the research study if available. Otherwise, if the patient has already had
      surgery and tissue has not been stored for research the investigators will consent patients
      to use their clinical specimens for the research study. The investigators will then extract
      DNA from tissue sections and blood and use a custom targeted sequencing panel of 23 cancer
      driver genes with significant mutations in squamous cell carcinoma that they have developed
      to find the prognostic biomarkers. The DNA will be used in a PCR reaction to generate
      amplicons for library preparation using Illumina Nextera XT library preparation protocol and
      targeted sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq sequencer. The reads will be aligned to the HG19
      using BWA aligner and variant detection performed with Agilent SureCall and GATK analytic
      tools.
