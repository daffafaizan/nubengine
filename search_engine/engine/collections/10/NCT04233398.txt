      intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of benign thyroid nodules. this study will
      include 240 patients with benign thyroid nodules that meet all ths the inclusion / exclusion
      criteria and will be randomly divided into two groups at 1: 1 ratio. Patients in the test
      group will be treated with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), while patients in the
      control group will be actively observed and followed up by ultrasound examination. The
      primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the test device in
      the treatment of benign thyroid nodules, and the secondary objective is to evaluate the
      safety of the test device in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules and the improvement of
