      of four to five and accounts for up to 15% of strokes in persons of all ages and 30% in
      persons over the age of 80 years. The use of vitamin K antagonists is highly effective for
      stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and is recommended for
      persons at increased risk. However, food and drug interactions necessitate frequent
      coagulation monitoring and dose adjustments, requirements that make it difficult for many
      patients to use such drugs in clinical practice.

      Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that may provide more consistent and predictable
      anticoagulation than warfarin. It has been reported to prevent venous thromboembolism more
      effectively than enoxaparin in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and was non-inferior to
      enoxaparin followed by warfarin in a study involving patients with established venous
      thrombosis. This trial was designed to compare once-daily oral rivaroxaban with dose-adjusted
      warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular
      atrial fibrillation who were at moderate-to-high risk for stroke
