      patients with histologically confirmed or clinically suspected metastatic neuroendocrine
      prostate cancer. Subjects will be treated with MLN8237 at 50 mg twice daily for 7 days
      repeated every 21 days. Individual dose reductions will be made on the basis of the AEs
      observed. Therapy will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity as a result
      of MLN8237, or withdrawal of patient consent. Patients will be followed with history,
      physical, and blood tests at each visit to monitor for toxicity. Response and progression
      will be evaluated by CT/MRI scan and bone scan after every 3 cycles and determined using
      RECIST v1.1. PSA and serum chromogranin A and NSE will be followed every cycle. CTC counts by
      CellSearch will be performed at baseline, at 4-6 weeks, and upon progression. Patients will
      be followed for survival endpoints following completion of this study until death.
