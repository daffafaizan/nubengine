    
      This is a 32-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      trial assessing the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 300 mg in two different dosing
      regimens: every 4 weeks (Q4W) and every 2 weeks (Q2W) in approximately 108 patients with
      biopsy-proven forms of lichen planus.

      There will be a screening period (up to 4 weeks prior to baseline), a treatment period 1
      (baseline to Week 16), a treatment period 2 (Week 16 to Week 32) and a follow-up period (8
      weeks after Week 32).
