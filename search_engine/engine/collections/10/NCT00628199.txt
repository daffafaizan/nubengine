      potential to give us new basic knowledge about human development. Current work will focus on
      developing this basic knowledge. In the future, human embryonic stem cell lines (hESC)
      derived from genetic reprogramming and SCNT may also have the potential to develop into cell
      types that are useful for cell-based therapies to treat human disease and disability.
