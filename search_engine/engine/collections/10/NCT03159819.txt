    
      For patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who have not been cured with first line
      chemotherapy, and who are not willing to undergo second line chemotherapy after the failure
      of first line chemotherapy while there are no effective therapies for their unmet medical
      needs known at this time, and for patients with advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      which has relapsed after surgery or for which there is no surgical indication, who have not
      been cured with or refused to receive other standard regimens, single or multiple doses of
      CAR-CLD18 T cells will be given to observe safety and efficacy of CAR-CLD18 T cells.

      Primary objectives:

      Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the autologous T cells transduced with
      anti-Claudin18.2 lentiviral vector in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

      Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of CAR-CLD18 T cells in patients with gastric
      adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma with the following parameters:

      Time of tumor progression (TTP);

      Disease Control Rate (DCR);

      Objective Remission Rate (ORR);

      Overall Survival (OS).
