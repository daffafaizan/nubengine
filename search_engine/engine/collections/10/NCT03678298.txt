    
      The primary objectives of the study are: (1) the identification of specific risk factors for
      in-hospital mortality, in order to perfect the clinical management of patients with
      complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs); (2) the identification of specific risk
      factors for multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) isolation in patients with cIAIs, in order
      to improve the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial therapy.

      The secondary objectives are: (1) the description of the clinical, diagnostic and treatment
      profiles of patients with cIAIs in Italian surgical departments; (2) the analysis of
      epidemiology and patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility of the microorganisms isolated in
      samples in intra-operative samples of peritoneal fluid or purulent exudate/discrete abscesses
      in patients with cIAIs; (3) the identification of specific risk factors for post-operative
      complications in patients with cIAIs.
