      the study, which will be randomly assigned, one kidney to machine perfusion and the other to
      cold storage. All 400 patients will be followed for 1 year. The primary endpoint is delayed
      graft function (requiring dialysis in the first week after transplantation) and duration of
      delayed graft function. The second endpoints: GFR at week 1, month3, month6 and month 12
      post-transplant.
