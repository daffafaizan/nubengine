      efficacy and safety is mostly unproven.

      The use of the complex homeopathic remedy Ovaria comp. for the relief of climacteric symptoms
      will be examined in this three-armed intervention trial and measured with the menopause
      rating scale II before and after each study phase of 12 weeks. Participants will receive the
      verum during two treatment phases of 12 weeks and the placebo during one treatment phase of
      12 weeks in different sequences and are stratified for post- and perimenopausal status.
