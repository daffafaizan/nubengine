      The validation of the six-minute stepper test to prescribe endurance training in severe to
      very severe chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease involves two steps :

        1. Patients with severe to very severe chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease who
           performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing and are referred to pulmonary
           rehabilitation will be approached to participate in the study.

           Eligible patients who agree to participate in the study and sign informed consent will
           perform two six-minute stepper test. Their performance and heart rate (first and last
           3minutes) will be compared with those obtained at the first ventilatory threshold from
           the previously performed incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (usually used for
           the prescription of endurance training in pulmonary rehabilitation) using multiple
           regression in order to derive a predictive equation.

        2. The validity of this predictive equation will be assessed in an independent
           cross-validation group issued from a completed multicenter observational study
           (NCT03244137). This cross-validation group will be formed with those patients of this
           cohort who performed both the incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (and had a
           determined first ventilatory threshold) and the six-minute stepper test. The heart rate
           prescription for endurance training from the direct measurement of the the first
           ventilatory threshold will be compared to the heart rate derived from the
           6minute-stepper test using the predictive equation determined in step 1. Data will be
           compared using the mean absolute difference between both prescriptions and a
           Bland-Altman analysis.
