      evaluate the safety and preliminarily efficacy of MRG003. Based on the safety and efficacy
      data obtained from the Phase IIa, the study design of the second stage Phase IIb single-arm
      study either will be adjusted or the trial will be stopped. If the initial Phase IIa data
      support the continuation of the study, in the second stage, approximately an additional 55
      subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of MRG003.
