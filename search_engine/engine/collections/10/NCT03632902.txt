    
      Retrospective analysis of the investigators experience in the last 8 years with the airway
      management in endovascular therapy for unruptured aneurysms. A total of 206 participants will
      be included from 2010 to 2018. Airway management (anticipated difficult airway, need for LM
      repositioning, orotracheal intubation because of failed laryngeal mask insertion, airway
      complication), intraoperative monitoring, aneurism size and location, intraoperative and
      perioperative complications will be registered.

      Statistics will be compared between groups with t test or x test, as appropriate.
