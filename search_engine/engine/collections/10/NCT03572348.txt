    
      A randomized controlled trial comparing vessel-sparing anastomotic repair (vsAR) and
      transecting anastomotic repair (tAR) in isolated short bulbar urethral strictures (maximum 3
      centimeter) for both surgical and functional outcome, to demonstrate that vsAR is not
      inferior to tAR regarding the surgical outcome, and to demonstrate a benefit for vsAR over
      tAR regarding postoperative erectile function.
