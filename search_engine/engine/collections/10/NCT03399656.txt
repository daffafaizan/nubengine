    
      The investigators will conduct a 3-armed placebo-controlled 16-day intervention with the
      dietary supplement Avmacol® to determine the bioavailability with repeated dosing of a simple
      tablet-based intervention in the study participants. As shown in Scheme 1, the 3 arms are: 1)
      4 tablets of Avmacol® daily for 14 days; 2) 2 tablets of Avmacol® daily for 14 days together
      with 2 placebo tablets to maintain parity in consumption; and 3) 4 placebo tablets daily for
      14 days. In addition, all participants will receive 4 placebo tablets for 2 consecutive
      run-in days prior to commencing intervention in the 3 distinct arms. Consecutive overnight
      (12-hour) urine samples will be collected during the 2-day run-in, the 14-day intervention
      and during a 5-day run-out period (total = 21 days). Additional day-time urine collections
      will be made at 2 timepoints: the day after administration of Avmacol® tablets begins and the
      day after the last administration of Avmacol® tablets. A blood sample will be collected at
      the beginning of the run-in and after the last Avmacol® dose (Day 17 for intervention groups,
      and for the placebo group) from each participant. The tablets will be taken before dinner
      each day.
