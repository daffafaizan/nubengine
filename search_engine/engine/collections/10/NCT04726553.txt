      produced less neutralizing antibody to influenza vaccine which was directly or indirectly
      associated with increased flares and autoantibody production after immunization. Anifrolumab
      is an inhibitor of signaling through the Type I interferon alpha beta receptor. The current
      study is an open label parallel group pilot study to examine the impact of anifrolumab on
      development of neutralizing antibodies to quadrivalent influenza vaccine in patients with
      SLE. 10 patients with moderately to severely active SLE will initiate treatment with
      anifrolumab while continuing standard of care medications and 10 will receive only standard
      of care medications. Two weeks after baseline all will receive influenza vaccine. Blood
      samples will be drawn at baseline (Day 0), just prior to immunization (Week 2), and Weeks 4,
      8, 12 and 16. Disease activity, gene/cytokine expression, autoantibody production and patient
      reported outcomes will also be tracked.
