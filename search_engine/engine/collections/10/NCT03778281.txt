      by rapid glottis closure and a short high-pitched sound, commonly known as "snoring", is one
      of the common adverse reactions of chemotherapy. Intractable hiccups seriously affect the
      rest and eating of patients, reduce the quality of life, and increasingly attract the
      attention of oncologists. At present, the drugs or methods used in the treatment of
      chemotherapy-related hiccups mainly include chlorpromazine, Ritalin, diazepam, phenacetin,
      metoclopramide and traditional Chinese medicine, but these drugs or treatments usually have
      poor efficacy and short remission time. The adverse reactions were serious and the clinical
      use was not satisfactory. Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivative that
      activates the GABA-Î² receptor, inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, and
      reduces monosynaptic or multisynaptic transmission in the spinal cord. Skeletal muscle
      relaxation, originally used in patients with spinal cord injury, is gradually used to treat
      intractable hiccups caused by diaphragmatic spasm.

      This study was an open-label, randomized, prospective study comparing the efficacy and
      adverse effects of baclofen versus metoclopramide in the treatment of chemotherapy-related
      hiccups. Patients with hiccup after chemotherapy were randomly divided into two groups. One
      group was treated with baclofen and the other group was treated with metoclopramide. The
      efficacy and adverse reactions of the two groups were compared.Ineffective in the two groups
      will cross to another group and then observe the efficacy.
