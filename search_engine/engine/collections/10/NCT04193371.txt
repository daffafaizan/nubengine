      endocrine and metabolic disorder during the reproductive years. PCOS is characterized by
      anovulation, hyperandrogenism and metabolic dysfunction.Obesity is ~40% higher in women with
      PCOS than in healthy women. Overweight results in irregular cycles, insulin resistance and
      infertility. Acupuncture is assumed to reduce weight The overall hypothesis is that if the
      Body mass index (BMI) decreased, ovulation can be induced, hyperandrogenism decreased, and
      insulin sensitivity improved in these women. Although several treatment strategies have shown
      efficacy, importantly, there is a need for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) to
      strengthen the evidence base for clinical and policy decision-making. Therefore, the
      investigators aim to compare the effect of acupuncture, with usual care (lifestyle
      management) for weight loss, and improvement and prevention of reproductive and metabolic
      dysfunction in overweight and obese women with PCOS.
