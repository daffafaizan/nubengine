      treatment. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) may be proposed up to 6 hours and from 6 to 24 hours
      after stroke onset if multimodal imaging demonstrates the presence of a substantial ischemic
      penumbra.

      Despite the major benefit associated with MT, more than half of patients will remain disabled
      at 3 months. The rate of complete reperfusion after MT appears to be a major factor affecting
      functional outcome. However, this rate of complete reperfusion is only achieved in 50 % of
      the patients due to, at least in part, distal microcirculatory impairment and or erratic
      emboli.

      In coronary artery disease, new antiplatelet agents, with a very short half-life, such as
      P2Y12 inhibitors (P2Y12I), have been shown to reduce in-stent thrombosis, myocardial
      infarction and death. The IV route for P2Y12 inhibitors administration is adapted to the
      stroke population who has frequently dysphagia that prevents per os drug administration. In
      addition, the very short half-life of the drug is quite interesting for the management of
      hemorrhagic complications or emergent surgical interventions and early antithrombotic
      secondary prevention initiation.

      Hpothesis: subgroup of patients treated from 0 to 24 hours after onset with a demonstrated
      ischemic penumbra on perfusion imaging, the administration of P2Y12I in addition to MT and
      best medical management (BMM) may increase reperfusion rates and improve functional outcome
      compared to MT with BMM alone.
