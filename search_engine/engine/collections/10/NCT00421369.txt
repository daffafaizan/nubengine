      Current treatment approaches emphasize the achievement of remission. Remission implies
      virtual absence of depressive symptoms and is associated with better function and a better
      overall prognosis than response, which is usually defined as a 50% reduction in symptom
      severity. Sixty percent or more of patients treated optimally with antidepressants remain
      un-remitted and will need additional treatment. A potentially effective but under-exploited
      strategy to augment antidepressant effects is concurrent administration of the thyroid
      hormone, triiodothyronine (T3). We previously demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety
      of T3 administered concurrently with the SSRI, sertraline, in the context of a randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Although all the patients were euthyroid, remission
      rates were significantly higher in the sertraline plus T3 group and were associated with
      significantly lower baseline T3 values and a significant decrease in serum thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH) values during the course of treatment.

      The study aims to:

        -  Delineate a sub-population of depressed patients treated with sertraline, who are more
           likely to respond to T3 augmentation on the basis of thyroid function and genetic
           variation in thyroid pathway genes.

        -  Investigate the appropriate timing for the addition of T3.

        -  Assess the efficacy of reboxetine, a specific noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, as a
           further supplement to the treatment of un-remitted patients. The results of this study
           could have a significant, direct clinical impact on the pharmacological treatment of
           MDD.
