      dental rehabilitation. The DEX group (n=26) received 2 Âµg/kg DEX in apple juice, and the
      control group (n=26) received 0.5 mg/kg midazolam in apple juice.

      The patients' scores on the Ramsey sedation scale (RSS), parental separation anxiety scale,
      mask acceptance scale, post-anesthesia emergence delirium scale (PAEDS), and hemodynamic
      parameters were recorded. The data were analyzed using chi-square test, Fisher's exact test,
