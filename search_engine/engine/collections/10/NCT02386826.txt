      short expected survival. c-MET signalling promotes invasive growth and has been described in
      various cancers. INC280 is a highly potent and selective c-MET inhibitor which also
      penetrates the blood-brain barrier. In this open-label, multicenter Phase 1b study,
      investigators determined the optimal dose of the INC280/bevacizumab combination to administer
      to patients. Enrollment has now expanded in order to treat 3 cohorts of GBM patients: those
      who progressed after ≥ first-line standard therapy, those who progressed after ≥ second-line
      therapy with INC280/bevacizumab, and those with unresectable GBM.
