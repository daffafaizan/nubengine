      Because most CAR-T cells are generated from the patient's own T cells and are individualized
      products, and there are individual differences between patients, the generation of customized
      CAR-T cells is an expensive and time-consuming process. Universal CAR- iNKT cells are an
      ideal product for cell therapy. In this study, we prepared universal iNKT cells expressing
      hCD19 CAR and IL-15 to treat refractory, relapsed, or high-risk B-cell tumors.
