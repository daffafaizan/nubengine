      helpful in management of COPD patients in conjunction with or separately from self-reported
      symptom scores using the COPD Co-PILOT application. Current techniques (such as patient's
      self-reported symptoms) have limited sensitivity and specificity with regard to predicting
      decompensation. Measurement of respiration parameters and the variability of the parameters
      may detect worsening COPD. Changes in respiration patterns may occur sufficiently far in
      advance of decompensation (e.g. >5 days prior to patient symptoms) such that it would allow
      an opportunity for earlier intervention with medical assessment and current therapeutic
      approaches.

      The specific primary aim includes evaluation of the correlation of respiration rate
      parameters to indicators of healthcare utilization including drug changes, office or ER
      visits, hospitalization, or other clinical interventions. Secondary aims include evaluation
      of (i) the sensitivity and specificity of respiration rate monitoring results to predict COPD
      worsening requiring medical intervention, (ii) the sensitivity and specificity of respiration
      rate monitoring results in conjunction with COPD Co-PILOT scores or components to predict
      COPD worsening requiring medical intervention, and the correlation of respiration rate
      parameters to episode duration as defined by number of days from COPD Co-PILOT Score >1 to
      resolution (COPD Co-PILOT Score <1 for 7 consecutive days).
