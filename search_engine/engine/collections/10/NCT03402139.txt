      cardiovascular disease-related death and type 2 diabetes in low birth weight infants.
      However, the molecular mechanisms underlying developmental programming of childhood obesity
      remain poorly understood. Alterations in DNA methylation during fetal life have been proposed
      to be one of the mechanisms that regulate this phenotype. Here, the investigators address
      major questions about early childhood obesity programming by studying purified subpopulations
      of CD3+ T-cells from intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) newborns who have an increased
      risk for obesity and other metabolic disorders in adult life. The investigators will
      correlate altered CD3+ T-cell DNA methylation profiles in cord and peripheral blood samples
      and functional changes in CD3+ T-cells with adiposity in childhood.
