      subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The study will consist of 2
      treatment periods, 5 days per period. The subjects will receive a single 4 mg RISPERDAL
      conventional tablet in period 1 and a single 4 mg orally-disintegrating tablet in period 2;
      or the orally disintegrating tablet in period 1 and conventional tablet in period 2. A
      washout period of at least 10 days between Day 1 of Period 1 and Day 1 of Period 2 will
      separate the 2 treatments. In both treatment periods plasma concentrations of the drug will
      be measured. Serial blood collections will be made beginning at 0 hour (immediately before
      study drug administration) and continuing up to 96 hours after study drug administration in
      each period. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study using physical examinations,
      electrocardiogram recordings (ECG), clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry,
      urinalysis), vital signs measurements, pregnancy testing, drug screening, and monitoring of
      adverse events. The study will be approximately 6 weeks long (including the screening
      period). Subjects will enter the study facility 3 days before the first administration of
      study medication on Day 1 of the first period. They will remain at the facility until all
      study-related procedures are completed on Day 5 of the second study period, a period of
      approximately 18 days. 4 mg risperidone (either conventional tablet or orally-disintegrating
      tablet), single dose, oral intake
