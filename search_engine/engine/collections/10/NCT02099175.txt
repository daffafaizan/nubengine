      disease. Technical improvements in surgical approaches have been reported, providing less
      invasive surgery with lower morbidity. In this scenario, multimodality treatment seems the
      best approach, even if there is lack of prospective data.

      Some studies explored the role and feasibility of induction chemotherapy (CT) and the
      prognostic value of response to CT. Histology and molecular pattern can guide the type of
      administered CT. The first drives the choice of drug to be associated with Cisplatin, while
      mutational status of p53 (wild type, WT vs mutated, MUT) is a predictive value for response
      to CT with Cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin in ITAC.

      In addition, heavy ion therapy may produce less toxic side effects in a particularly critical
      area exposed to late RT toxicities and potentially can help in organ preservation strategies
      when exenteratio orbitae is requested.
