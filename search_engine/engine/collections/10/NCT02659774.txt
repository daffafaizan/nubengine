      3000 corporations in Hong Kong. The questionnaire will examine the employers' knowledge,
      attitudes and practices in promoting smoking cessation in the workplace.

      In Phase II, a longitudinal study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      smoking cessation intervention offered by the Department of Psychology, the University of
      Hong Kong. A total of 600 smokers from corporations will be recruited and interviewed before
      the intervention at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at 1-, 4-, 12-, 26- and
      52-week post-intervention follow-ups, in an attempt to evaluate their smoking behaviours,
      knowledge on smoking and satisfaction of the smoking cessation services. Self-reported
      quitters (did not smoke in the past 7 days) will be invited to participate in the
      bio-chemical validation by assessing their exhaled carbon monoxide level and the saliva
      cotinine level.

      Process evaluation: Qualitative interviews, including in-depth interviews and/or focus group
      will be conducted within 1 month after 12-month follow-up.
