      Primary

        -  Determine the partitioning of sulindac and its metabolites in women at high risk for
           breast cancer by measuring drug and metabolite levels in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF)
           after 6 weeks of therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine prostaglandin levels in the NAF of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine if NAG-1 levels are induced in the NAF of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine if C-reactive protein levels are reduced in the NAF of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine if NAG-1 levels and/or karyometric features in ductal epithelial cells are
           modulated in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study.

      Patients undergo nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) collection. Patients are then randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sulindac once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral sulindac twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues
           for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients
           then undergo a second NAF collection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients (15 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
