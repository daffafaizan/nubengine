    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the immunological effects of 2 different schedules of vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM
           vaccine, fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM vaccine, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) administered with
           standard adjuvant chemotherapy in women with high-risk stage II or III breast cancer.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of obtaining determinations of CD4 response in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM: Beginning 2-3 weeks after surgery and before initiation of standard
           adjuvant chemotherapy, all patients receive vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously
           (SC) on day 1 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4 of week 1.

        -  Fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM: Patients are treated on 1 of the following schedules:

             -  Arm I: During chemotherapy, patients receive fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM vaccine SC on day 1
                and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4 of weeks 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, and 23. After
                chemotherapy, patients receive additional vaccinations on weeks 26, 38, and 50.

             -  Arm II: Prior to chemotherapy, patients receive fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM vaccine SC on
                day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4 of week 2. After chemotherapy, patients receive
                additional vaccinations on weeks 26, 38, and 50.

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-7 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV
           over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients then receive paclitaxel IV
           over 3 hours on day 1 of weeks 15, 18, 21, and 24. Treatment continues in the absence of
           disease progression (after at least 1 course of chemotherapy) or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy during weeks 26-32 in the absence of disease
           progression.

      Patients with hormone-receptor positive tumors receive oral tamoxifen for 5 years beginning
      on approximately week 32.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 (14 per treatment arm) patients will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
