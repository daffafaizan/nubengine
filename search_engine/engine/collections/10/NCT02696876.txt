    
      The synovium is a rich source of potent chondrogenic mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).
      Gaining access to this valuable source of regenerative cells could improve the outcome of
      joint restorative procedures. To avoid costly two-stage procedures and ex vivo manipulation,
      exploiting these autologous cells in a minimally invasive way with minimal manipulation could
      provide a novel cost-effective approach.

      This study will evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of a novel medical device (a
      synovial brush) and procedure (synovial brushing) to increase the number of autologous
      minimally manipulated MSCs in the knee. Twenty patients undergoing microfracture for isolated
      chondral defects will be randomly assigned to either a control group (microfracture only, 10
      patients) or the intervention group (microfracture plus synovial brushing, 10 patients). The
      device is intended to increase the number of MSCs within the joint as a final stage during
      surgery, aiding repair by bolstering those MSCs recruited from the bone marrow.
