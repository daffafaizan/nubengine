      phase, subjects will receive KHK2898, administered intravenously, once every 2 weeks. A
      treatment cycle will consists of total of two doses per cycle. Part 2 of the study will
      enroll subjects with squamous cell type tumor to receive KHK2898 at a dose to be determined
      following completion of Part 1.

      All subjects will receive study therapy until disease progression, the development of
      unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or Investigator
      decision, up to a maximum of six cycles (approximately six months). After six cycles of
      KHK2898 therapy, the subject may continue to receive the drug after discussion with the
      Sponsor and determination that the subject is experiencing a best response of at least stable
      disease (SD) and is not experiencing any unacceptable toxicities or dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs).
