      measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by
      dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information
      System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure
      will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static
      address based GIS measures of access.

      Primary Aim:

      To compare Dynamic vs Static GIS measures of physical activity (PA) supportivity and their
      associations with PA behaviors, body mass index (BMI), and biological markers.

      Secondary Aim:

      To compare Dynamic vs Static GIS measures of access to healthy food and their associations
      with dietary intake, BMI, and biological markers.

      Exploratory aim:

      Social environment (e.g. eating with others) has been identified as an important determinant
      of health, but assessment of this has been limited to self-report through surveys or text
      prompts. Images from a person worn camera (the SenseCam) provide an objective and continuous
      assessment of social environment e.g. number of social interactions per day, eating alone or
      with others. In a subsample of participants (N=30), we propose to explore whether portable
      SenseCam measures of social interactions & social behaviors from person view images are more
      strongly related to breast and colon cancer risk factors than self-reported social
      environment measures. Behaviors and built environments (especially food locations) can also
      be coded to validate the accuracy of the GIS measures and the machine learned behavior
      categories employed in the full sample.
