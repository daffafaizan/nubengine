      Arterial hypertension and high blood pressure (HBP) are major risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) and stroke; they are also risk factors for lowered cognitive functioning.
      Except for diabetes, there have been comparatively few studies of other common risk factors,
      particularly with regard to interrelationships among risk factors which may adversely affect
      cognitive ability.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study examines associations between cognitive functioning and three cardiovascular risk
      factors: 1) high blood pressure; 2) high total plasma homocysteine (tHcy), and 3) ApoE e4
      genotype. These associations are examined cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally, using
      data collected at a follow-up visit of members of a cohort that has been followed for the
      past 18-19 years. Longitudinal data are used to examine both current and change in cognitive
      functioning. Some analyses are prospective (e.g., high blood pressure and change in cognitive
      functioning), while others are cross-sectional (e.g., ApoE e4 and current cognitive
      functioning) or retrospective (e.g., tHcy and change in cognitive functioning). Structural
      equation models are used to examine cross-sectional data in elucidating a general theoretical
      model. Two-stage growth curve analyses and survival analyses are appropriate methods for
      analyzing the longitudinal data. The study includes a very comprehensive set of measures that
      have already been collected or will be collected during the follow-up visit. All potential
      confounders of the association between the three target predictor variables and the various
      domains of cognitive functioning appear to have been included in this design.
