      consequences for the patient. Although most patients are able to report their pain scores, a
      minority are unable to do so and assessing their pain can prove to be a challenge for
      healthcare professionals. In recent years, facial recognition tools have been developed based
      on the premise that subtle facial variations signifies pain. However, changes in body, and
      head posture can also represent pain. As such, these tools are with their limitations and are
      only validated on certain groups of patients, thus may not be sensitive enough to detect pain
      in post-surgical patients.

      This pilot study will be conducted on 20 patients presenting for major gynaecological
      surgery, with the obtained data used to fine tune the algorithm. The patients will be
      video-taped pre-surgically in the pre-evaluation anaesthetic clinic and post-surgically in
      the ward. They will be asked to rate their pain scores on the numerical rating scale and fill
      in questionnaires on their psychological and quality of health status. The pain scores will
      be correlated with the results obtained from the pain assessment algorithm. The refined
      algorithm can be subsequently evaluated with a larger group of patients undergoing different
      pain conditions, and could potentially be used in clinical practice as a tool to assess pain
      if found to be sensitive.
