      Minnesota. However, there are a significant number of adults in Minnesota who regularly use
      ST. There is a need for a low-cost cessation program that can be widely delivered to ST users
      who may have little or no access to conventional and/or group treatments. Self-help
      interventions can make a significant contribution in reaching this population. The telephone
      provides a unique low-cost delivery system that can expand the reach of a self-help cessation
      program to underserved groups of tobacco users. The primary objective is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of telephone-based counseling in promoting smokeless tobacco cessation among
      Minnesota residents. It is hypothesized that a greater proportion of individuals assigned to
      the telephone calling group will quit their use of smokeless tobacco products and all tobacco
      products compared to the comparison group not receiving calls. We plan to recruit 400
      smokeless tobacco users who are interested in quitting their use of smokeless tobacco and
      randomize them to telephone counseling for smokeless tobacco cessation or to a comparison
      group that receives the same mailed self-help materials. All subjects will be assessed
      pre-intervention, and at 3- and 6-months.
