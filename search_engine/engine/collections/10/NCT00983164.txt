      population. HCV is the leading cause of acute hepatitis and chronic liver disease, which may
      lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The combined therapy with interferon with or without pegylation associated with ribavirin has
      shown greater sustained virological response than monotherapy with interferon-alpha, however
      this response still represents around 60% of cases. The mechanisms by which HCV causes
      cellular damage are not yet well understood, however immune liver damage, direct cytotoxic
      damage mediated by different viral products and also oxidative stress have been implicated in
      the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C. Several studies support that reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) and oxidative stress are involved in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C, despite that
      increased ROS levels in HCV patients might be beneficial by suppressing HCV replication. ROS
      are involved in several diseases and cause oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, proteins and
      carbohydrates.
