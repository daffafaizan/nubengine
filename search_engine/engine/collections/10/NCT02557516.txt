      IPH2201 will result in a substantial complete response (CR) rate, especially CR without
      minimal residual disease (MRD), as this has been shown to be associated with long-term
      clinical benefit.

      Up to 45 patients were planned to be enrolled. During the phase 1 part a 3+3 dose escalation
      design was employed. Four doses were planned to be assessed if the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) was not previously reached: 1, 2, 4 and 10 mg/kg.

      During phase 2 part, patients received monalizumab in combination with ibrutinib; monalizumab
      was given at the dose recommended upon completion of the phase I portion.

      The primary objective of the phase 1 was to assess the safety of monalizumab given
      intravenously as a single agent and in combination with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed,
      refractory or previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.

      The primary objective of the phase 2 was to evaluate the anti-leukemic activity of the
      combination of monalizumab and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed, refractory or previously
      untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
