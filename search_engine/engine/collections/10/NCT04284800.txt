      cardiac conditions that make them prone to develop a serious arrhythmia. Currently, there are
      two main CIED devices that deliver defibrillation therapy - transvenous internal
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and subcutaneous ICD. Conventional wisdom indicates that
      defibrillation causes myocardial injury. However, some studies including one by the present
      investigators have reported that external direct current cardioversion does not result in
      myocardial injury. There have been studies showing that ICD shocks results in myocardial
      injury. The concern with previous studies using transvenous ICDs is that the measurement of
      injury was done during DFT testing at the time of ICD implantation or when the patient came
      into hospital after an ICD shock. The confounder with DFT testing is that myocardial injury
      could have occurred during ICD implantation when the lead is screwed into the myocardium
      rather than during the testing. With hospitalization, the precipitating event that caused the
      arrhythmia stimulating the ICD discharge (e.g. an acute coronary syndrome) might also be the
      cause of myocardial injury. We plan to eliminate these confounders by recruiting patients who
      are undergoing a DFT procedure electively, remote from their ICD implantation date or
      clinical events.

      In terms of the subcutaneous ICD implantation (in which the leads are not screwed into the
      myocardium), there is little data about myocardial injury when a shock is delivered. The
      investigators will attempt to determine if subcutaneous ICD shocks cause myocardial injury by
      assessing their troponin levels at the time DFT is performed during implantation.
