    
      This is a prospective two arm phase 2 trial investigating the technical and clinical
      performance of tumor-targeted (rather than prostate targeted) radiotherapy.

      Cohort 1 (Control group): This group consists of patients who have had previous radiation.
      This group will not receive any active treatment but will have a biopsy at 3 years from the
      time they completed their radiation therapy. Patient in this group will also continue to have
      their PSA checked per standard practice

      Cohort 2 (Experimental group): Patients in this group will receive one of 2 treatment arms of
      their choice. In addition to the MRI-guided prostate biopsy at 3 years and regular standard
      of care PSA checks, this group will also complete a quality of life questionnaire and have
      regular imaging per standard practice.

      Both groups will be followed by the research team per protocol.
