    
      This study is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, single-center, three-period,
      six-sequence, balanced crossover study in healthy male and female subjects to assess the
      relative bioavailability of 200 mg of cenobamate given as an oral tablet or oral suspension
      and to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of a 200 mg dose of cenobamate
      given as an oral suspension in fasting and fed conditions.

      The study consists of a 28-day screening period, followed by single dose administration of
      cenobamate (tablet or suspension) on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 43, an assessment period of 62
      days and a follow-up visit on Day 69. All subjects will be confined to the clinical site from
      Day -1 (the day before period 1 dosing) until the morning of Day 4, Day 20 (the day of the
      last PK sampling for period 1) until the morning of Day 25, and Day 41 (the day of the last
      PK sampling for period 2) until the morning of Day 46. Outpatient visits will be performed
      regularly until the 456-hour PK sampling for each period. The follow-up visit will occur on
      Day 69 (Â±1 day).
