      offices (RSIOs) in the two southern counties of Sweden. Persons accepting participation are
      clinically examined and interviewed of the course of events leading up to the burnout and the
      patient's expectations of changes necessary to facilitate return to work are recorded. The
      patientÂ´s supervisor is then interviewed at the workplace, responding to the same questions
      on perceived main causes of the subordinate's sick leave and changes necessary to facilitate
      return to work. Finally, the core intervention takes place, namely a dialogue being initiated
      between the patient and the supervisor to find solutions to facilitate return to work. Out of
      those who do not want to participate, without giving any specific reason for that, a control
      group is matched by length and degree of sick leave at the time of the intervention.
