    
      Patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (P.F.O.A) is a highly prevalent disease and an important
      source of anterior knee pain and Disability during daily activities (kneeling, squatting,
      climbing stairs, getting up from low chair).

        -  Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) occurs due to the loss of the cartilage of the
           patella and the trochlear groove. It has been reported that valgus knee alignment,
           dysplasia of the patella or trochlea, malrotation of the tibia, and direction or force
           of the quadriceps femoris can influence the progression of this disease.

        -  In approximately half of the patients diagnosed with P.F.O.A there is no any structural
           changes or significant pathological changes in articular Cartilage Therefore, PFOA is a
           diagnosis of exclusion. )

        -  Isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis is not rare and radio-graphic evidence of
           deformity can be observed in 17.1-34% of female patients and 18.5-19% of male patients
           in the age of ≥55 or ≥60 years old. According to some studies it is reported that
           patellofemoral osteoarthritis in 79% of 100 cadavers aged ≥65 years.

        -  In spite of its high prevalence, treatment of this painful disorder is challenging due
           to the diversity of causes of the disorder and the lack of knowledge on articular
           regeneration, little information is available in the literature about the best
           conservative or surgical treatment options.

        -  Non-operative treatment options for patellofemoral osteoarthritis include patellar
           bracing, physical therapy intervention, corticosteroid injections, patellar taping, and
           strengthening of the quadriceps muscle. Although a significant reduction in
           patellofemoral pain after a 6-week physical therapy regimen has been reported, this is
           considered a potential short-term fix for many patients. Ultimately, surgical treatment
           is necessary to provide a long-term solution.

        -  Arthroscopy is one of The surgical options is which is minimal invasive and effective in
           selected patients. Arthroscopic partial lateral patellar facetectomy with circumpatellar
           denervation, this joint-preserving technique provides relief of anterior knee pain by
           eliminating excessive pressure on the lateral facet of the patella and improving
           patellar mobility. Moreover, this technique features a faster recovery period after
           surgery and less morbidity.

        -  The indications for this procedure are isolated P.F.O.A in patients with an overhanging
           lateral facet of the patella with anterolateral knee pain and no response to
           conservative treatment. (Gang Zhao et al., 2015 Jun)

      The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of arthroscopic management of resistant cases
      anterior knee pain to medical and physiotherapy ( by circumpatellar denervation plus or minus
      lat. facetectomy according to stage of O.A ) and Comparison between pre and post-operative
      results in pain reduction, improving knee joint by using 2 knee scores

        1. Scoring of patellofemoral disorders( Kujala) score

        2. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) followed by an average follow up to
           12 months ( 6th weeks ,3rd month ,6th month , 12th month) It is prospective case series
           study Patients with isolated patellofemoral pain will be treated with arthroscopy and
           then Compare between pre and post-operative results in pain reduction, improving knee
           joint function, quality of life, and deferring arthritic progression.
