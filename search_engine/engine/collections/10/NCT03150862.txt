    
      An open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of Pamiparib in combination with radiation therapy (RT) and/or
      TMZ.

      In dose escalation/Phase 1b, Pamiparib will be combined with RT (Arm A) or RT and TMZ (Arm B)
      in participants with newly diagnosed unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM) and in Arm C of the
      study Pamiparib will be combined with TMZ in participants with methylated or unmethylated
      recurrent/refractory GBM.

      The dose expansion/Phase 2 phase will enroll up to 4 cohorts: participants with newly
      diagnosed unmethylated GBM in Arms A and B, and 2 cohorts of participants with
      recurrent/refractory GBM grouped by O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status -
      unmethylated or methylated - in Arm C.

      Participants in Arms A and B are treated until completion of RT and participants in Arm C may
      continue treatment in the absence of safety concerns and disease progression.
