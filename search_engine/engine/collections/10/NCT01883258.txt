      age-matched healthy controls. Research volunteers with type 2 diabetes who meet the inclusion
      criteria will be randomized to the aerobic interval training group, continuous moderate
      exercise group or non-exercise control group. At the end of the 8-week randomized control
      exercise intervention, baseline measures will be repeated.
