      amelioration of obesity-related diseases, where most therapeutic approaches have failed.
      Plant-polyphenols have shown the capacity to ameliorate obesity-induced metabolic
      disturbances. A combination of polyphenols (LC-HS) derived from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (HS)
      and Lippia citriodora L. (LC) (lemon verbena) (MetabolaidÂ®) was assessed for triglyceride
      accumulation and AMPK activation in the hypertrophied adipocyte model 3T3-L1. A dietary
      supplement containing 500 mg of LC-HS was evaluated in a double blind, placebo-controlled and
      randomized trial in 56 overweight subjects for two months. Anthropometric and circulating
      biochemical parameters were determined.
