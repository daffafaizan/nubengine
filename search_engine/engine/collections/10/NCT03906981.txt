      using Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing (HOMINGS) technology
      in the mixed dentition as well as the levels of salivary proteins in caries-free compared
      with caries active Arab children. The study protocol was approved by the Health Science
      Center Ethical Committee at Kuwait University.

      One hundred 6-9 year-old children with caries active and caries-free status will be recruited
      from randomly selected public schools in Kuwait. After DNA purification from supragingival
      plaque samples, HOMINGS will be performed. To get an insight into the host factors involved
      in this complex interplay between the host and the bacteria, stimulated saliva from the study
      subjects will be analyzed by proteomics. For children in both groups supragingival plaque
      samples will be collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of all teeth. After preparing
      the samples, the aliquots of purified DNA samples will be shipped to The Forsyth Institute
      for Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing (HOMINGS) protocol.
