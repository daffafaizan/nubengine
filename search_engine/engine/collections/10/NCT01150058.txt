        -  To determine, in vitro, the cytotoxic activity of novel CD33-targeting immunoconjugate
           agents in cell samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

        -  To define the characteristics of AML cells responding to or resisting these agents.

      OUTLINE: Cell samples are thawed and used for in vitro studies to determine the cytotoxic
      activity of novel CD33-targeting immunoconjugate agents, including gemtuzumab ozogamicin, for
      genotyping characterization by flow cytometry-based assays and/or western blot, and
      colony-forming cell assays.
