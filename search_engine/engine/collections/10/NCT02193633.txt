    
      This is a multi-centre, Phase I clinical trial of the combination of AZD2014 and weekly
      paclitaxel.

      Two intermittent BD dosing schedules of AZD2014 in combination with paclitaxel will be
      evaluated. The 3 days on 4 days off schedule will examine 3 continuous days of AZD2014 per
      week in combination with weekly paclitaxel. The 2 days on 5 days off schedule will examine 2
      sequential days of AZD2014 dosing in combination with weekly paclitaxel. For both schedules,
      a dose escalation 3+3 design will be used to establish the MTD and the recommended Phase II
      dose. Approximately 15 patients with solid tumours will be entered into each schedule during
      the dose escalation of this phase.

      The expansion part of the trial will be used to further assess the tolerability of AZD2014 in
      combination with weekly paclitaxel. For the 3 days on 4 days off schedule 10 patients with
      ovarian cancer and 15 patients with squamous lung cancer will be enrolled and treated at the
      MTD established from the dose escalation phase. Accrual to these expansion arms may commence
      as soon as the MTD is determined and proceed in parallel with the dose escalation phase of
      the 2 days on 5 days off schedule. Once the MTD has been determined for the 2 days on 5 days
      off schedule 15 patients with squamous lung cancer may be enrolled.

      Determination of the MTD and decision to enter the expansion phase for each schedule will be
      made by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) taking into consideration the safety data and
      available PK/PD data.
