      clinical efficacy as conventional doses of docetaxel (75mg/m2 body surface area) in terms of
      clinical and pathological response rates in metastatic breast cancer. We further hypothesize
      that tumor genomic and proteomic changes and serum proteomic changes would correlate with
      tumor response. We are also looking to correlate drug pharmacokinetics with treatment
      toxicity, genotype of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and peripheral mononuclear
      cell gene expression profiles. The primary objectives are to evaluate the clinical response
      rate of 70mg docetaxel with ketoconazole in metastatic breast cancer, and to evaluate the
      pathological response rate in the primary tumor following four cycles of docetaxel and
      ketoconazole.
