      questions about their experiences in managing their cancer while taking care of their job
      responsibilities. Patients will be asked to complete a survey that asks questions about their
      breast cancer treatment, their job, and how they manage their responsibilities while
      undergoing cancer treatment.

      The first initial meeting will be conducted at a time and location that is convenient for the
      patient. This meeting should last about an hour to an hour and a half.

      Three and six months after the initial interview, study participants will be asked to
      complete a follow-up survey by either telephone or Internet/Web, depending on their
      preference. These telephone surveys will last between 15-30 minutes.
