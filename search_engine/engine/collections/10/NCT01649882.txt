      the actual structures of interest (ETT tip and carina) are difficult or impossible to
      visualize reliably (due to their air contents reflecting ultrasound beams) one can use
      surrogates:

      The cuff of the ETT can be visualized as it is in- or deflated or it can be filled with an
      air-fluid(saline) mixture to delineate it inside the trachea.

      For the same reason (air reflecting ultrasound beams) the carina is difficult to visualize
      and one can use the aortic arch which is positioned just anterior to it instead.

      This study apart from determining feasibility of the method may produce enough data from
      ultrasound exams to develop/derive a more pre-cise algorithm than available today aiding in
      positioning the endotracheal tube in regards to anatomic-al landmarks (teeth, gums, lips)
      even without the use of ultrasound.
