      (Optiflow, intervention) and the Venturi mask (control), on the outcome of extubation.
      Available data suggest that Optiflow can improve oxygenation and patient's comfort in
      critically ill patients after extubation. The study hypothesis is that Optiflow may reduce
      the extubation failure rate in these patients.

      In the intervention group, patients fulfilling inclusion criteria and not presenting any of
      the exclusion criteria will receive high-flow oxygen through nasal cannula (Optiflow, Fisher
      & Paykel Healthcare Ltd., New Zealand) after extubation. The oxygen concentration (FiO2) will
      be set to reach an oxygenation target similar to control patients (see below), while the gas
      flow rate will be set at 50 L/min.

      In the control group, patients fulfilling inclusion criteria and not presenting any of the
      exclusion criteria will receive oxygen through a standard Venturi mask after extubation. The
      FiO2 will be set to obtain a arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) between 92% and 98% (or
      between 88% and 95% in hypercapnic patients). Further FiO2 modifications will be performed by
      the attending physicians to meet the oxygenation target.
