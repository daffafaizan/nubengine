    
      This multicenter randomized phase II study will enroll approximately 150 patients with
      metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Patients are randomized in Arm A(FOLFOX4 in combination with
      weekly Cetuximab) or Arm B (FOLFOX4 in combination with biweekly Cetuximab). Both efficacy
      and safety data will be collected. The investigator will assess response to treatment every 8
      weeks based on the imaging.

      Following permanent treatment cessation, patients will be followed-up for survival.
