      infiltration anesthesia (LIA) with an equal dose and same anesthetic performed by the
      surgeon, as an adjuvant to treat postoperative pain after unilateral mastectomy.

      Primary endpoint: the use of opioid's in the postoperative period. Secondary endpoint:
      Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score recorded at the 2nd, 8th, 16th, 24th hour after
      surgery. 0 means no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable. In addition at the same time,
      we will look to the degree of arm mobilization where there will be 3 possible groups: 1.
      restricted, 2. fair mobilization and 3. free mobilization.

      There are 2 treatment arms: 1st arm is the standard therapy, namely the local infiltration
      anesthesia. 2nd arm is the experimental arm, namely the SAPB. Patients are randomised into
      each arm after screening.
