      photo-oxidation process and sterilized using aseptic processing techniques. The primary
      endpoint for patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) undergoing carotid endarterectomies
      (CEA) will be rate of ipsilateral central neurologic events; the primary endpoint for all
      other vascular procedures will be primary patency. The secondary endpoints include all-cause
      reoperation rate, device-related reoperation rate, explant rate, restenosis rate, secondary
      patency (hemodialysis access repair (HAR) only) and survival. A goal of 100 patients will be
      enrolled at approximately 10 sites. The enrollment period will span a minimum of 8 months
      from Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and site activation. Candidates for this study
      are adults who require vascular repair or reconstruction surgery that necessitates the use of
      a patch. Patients will be consented pre-operatively and enrolled patients will be followed
      for approximately 6 months after PhotoFix surgery. Data will be collected at 5 time points:
      baseline (pre-operatively), intra-operatively, 1 month post-operatively, 3 months
      post-operatively, and 6 months post-operatively.
