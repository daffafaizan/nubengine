      testing an early cognitive training program for patients in the ICU. This cognitive training
      program was developed at Mount Carmel Health System in conjunction with occupational
      therapists and has not been previously evaluated.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate whether the trial can accrue a sufficient number of patients
      within a reasonable time period to complete a randomized trial for efficacy.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate whether the trial can be conducted as designed.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the likelihood that the trial can retain a sufficient number of
      patients through the end of follow-up.

      Assessments include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA), Richmond Agitation and
      Sedation Scale (RASS), Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU (CAM-ICU) and a validated
      quality of life survey.
