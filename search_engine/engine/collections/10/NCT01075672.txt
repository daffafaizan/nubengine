      psychosocial treatment approaches for mental health and health related behavioral problems.
      Despite their documented efficacy, there is a scarcity of licensed mental health
      professionals who are available to treat patients with problems that would be amenable to
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). While CBT interventions have a strong base in terms of
      efficacy in randomized trials, effectiveness and dissemination studies are lacking in
      comparison, and hence, these interventions are not reaching the patients in most need of
      services. Complicating the problem further, insurance companies typically do not reimburse
      for services provided by trainees who are not licensed. This is a public mental health
      problem because it limits the degree to which CBT clinicians can be trained to deliver these
      treatments, and a particular problem at MGH because referring providers do not have a place
      to send their patient for CBT services, as trainees constitute a large portion of clinical
      staff. To address this issue, the current study seeks to document outcomes of CBT
      interventions delivered by credentialed but not licensed trainees. This information can be
      used to guide policy and reimbursement guidelines for trainees, as well as promote the
      ability to disseminate efficacious interventions. Information gained from this project will
      be used to provide feedback to insurance companies, licensing boards, and mental health
      community stakeholders regarding decision making re: reimbursement for care provided by
      supervised trainees. Additionally, this may be used as a pilot study for a comparative
      effectiveness study comparing trainees to licensed staff psychologists.
