      source of water death will occur in days. When Benton and Young (2015) reviewed the topic
      they concluded that in healthy adults, mild dehydration (in the range of a loss of 2% body
      mass) had been found to adversely influence mood and cognition. However, it is unclear at
      what degree of hypohydration these effects begin to emerge.

      This study was designed to determine whether small changes in hydration, of the level that
      might occur on a day to day basis, influence cognition and mood. During a dehydration
      protocol (sitting in a room heated to 30 degrees for four hours) young adult participants
      receive either drink two 150ml cups of water or nothing. Effects on memory, attention and
      mood are monitored.
