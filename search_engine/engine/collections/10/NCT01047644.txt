    
      This is a phase II, non-blinded, non-inferiority prospective cohort trial of patients with
      ports (PAC) after a systemic therapy to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PAC flushes
      in 3 months intervals. Patients with any type of cancer are eligible. The study will extend 1
      year from enrollment of the last patient. Each enrolled patient will have his or her port
      flushed five times in 3 month intervals.

      Patients will be enrolled after the completion of systemic therapy and after completion of
      the restaging follow up, which is the time period from 4 weeks to 3 months after
      discontinuation of the chemotherapy. Once patients are enrolled to extended interval PAC
      flushes, they will be followed for one year. At the end of the year patients will return to
      standard PAC flushes. If patients experience any PAC malfunction, it would be considered a
      PAC failure and the flushing will reverted back to the schedule recommended by the
      manufacturer.
