      can significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza in the entire community compared to
      TIV. We hypothesize that â‰¥70% uptake of LAIV compared to a similar uptake of TIV among
      healthy children and adolescents will reduce laboratory-confirmed influenza in LAIV colonies
      by 50% compared to TIV colonies. Other specific objectives are to determine if LAIV reduces
      influenza in the healthy children and adolescents immunized and if LAIV reduces the following
      relative to TIV in all participants: influenza-like illness, antimicrobial prescriptions,
      physician-diagnosed otitis media, school or work-related absenteeism, physician visits for
      respiratory illness, lower respiratory infection, pneumonia, hospitalizations, and death. We
      will assess reactogenicity in both study groups.
