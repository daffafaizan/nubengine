      in mild and severe cases. Prolonged treatment time can cause many adverse effects such as
      pain, discomfort, external root resorption, white spots and dental caries. Decreasing the
      treatment time for tooth movement has been the focus of both the clinicians and the patients.
      For the last few decades, investigators have recommended many treatment approaches intending
      to reduce overall treatment time such as low friction and self-ligating bracket systems,
      low-level laser irradiation, electrical currents, pharmacological approaches, local
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection and surgical approaches like dentoalveolar distraction
      and selective alveolar decortication or corticotomy
