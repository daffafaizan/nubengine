    
      48 patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee who have been appropriately designated
      for treatment with a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups; one group (24 patients) will receive a Depuy Attune PCR knee implant, and one group
      (24 patients) will receive a MicroPort Orthopedics Evolution Medial Pivot knee implant
      utilizing standard and modern techniques. These two implants are designed to recreate the
      kinematic motion of a native knee articulation using different biomechanical design
      philosophies.

      The patients will be monitored post-operatively using subjective and objective measures.
      Subjective patient reported outcomes will be analyzed using the Knee Injury and
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), recorded preoperatively, as well as at 6 weeks, and 3
      months postoperatively. Objective outcomes will be measured by having the patients perform
      four activities over force plates that will measure the amount of force a patient generates.
      The four activities will be: walking, standing from a seated position in a chair, squatting
      to a seated position, and walking up stairs. These objective measures will also be recorded
      preoperatively, 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. The patient reported outcomes and the
      objective measures will then be compared between the two groups.
