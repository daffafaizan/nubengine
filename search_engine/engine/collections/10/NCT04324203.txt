      activities that can promote their physical and mental health.

      Objective: This study explored the effects of a combination of three-dimensional (3D) virtual
      reality (VR) and horticultural therapy (HT) on institutionalized older adults' physical and
      mental health.

      Methods: The study applied a quasi-experimental design. A total of 106 older adults from two
      long-term care facilities were recruited and assigned to the experimental (n = 59) or control
      (n = 47) group. The experimental participants received a nine-week intervention. Both groups
      completed three assessments: at baseline, after the intervention, and two months later. The
      outcome variables included health status, meaning in life, perceived mattering, loneliness,
      and depression.
