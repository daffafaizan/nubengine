      (Ad4)-based HIV vaccines when administered via the intranasal route to healthy human
      volunteers. It is hypothesized that the vaccines will be safe for human administration and
      will elicit immune responses to the HIV components. All study activities will be carried out
      at the NIH.

      Each study vaccinee will receive 5x10^8 viral particles of either Ad4-Env150KN or
      Ad4-Env145NFL, administered as an intranasal spray at months 0 and 2. An intramuscular
      protein booster vaccination with the heterologous soluble trimeric protein
      VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) with alum will be administered to all vaccinees at month 6.
      Specimens to evaluate immunogenicity will be taken at baseline and at specified time points
      through month 12. The HIV-specific immune responses will be assessed by cellular immune
      function assays (intracellular cytokine analysis, flow cytometry-based killing assays), as
      well as measures of humoral immunity (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and
      neutralization assays).

      The overall goal will be to compare the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad-HIV vaccine
      regimens. Participants who have previously received another HIV vaccine and/or are Ad4
      seropositive will be enrolled into an exploratory arm to be analyzed separately.

      Household contacts willing to participate and all intimate contacts (current and/or those
      expected within the first 4 weeks after vaccination) will also be enrolled and monitored for
      transmission of the vaccine virus by serology.
