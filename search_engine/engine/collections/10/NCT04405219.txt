      with each other. In the preoperative period, high anxiety scores are related to surgery and
      anesthesia stress. High anxiety scores in the smoker group both in the preoperative period
      and in the postoperative period are associated with smoking cessation. While the pain scores
      were similar in the postoperative period, high anxiety scores strengthened the idea of
      smoking withdrawal and this study gained value. We believe that future studies with a large
      number of patients, with different parameters and multiple centers will strengthen the
      results.
