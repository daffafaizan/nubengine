      predictor of mortality1. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended by current
      guidelines without clear specifications on the time of initiation of treatment due to a lack
      of data. While some centers initiate DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel prior to TAVI to
      reduce the rate of periinterventional embolic events, others start these medications after
      the procedure.Data on antithrombotic therapy during TAVI are scarce and no randomized
      evaluation has been performed to demonstrate what the best strategy is during the procedure.

      Therefore, the objective of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of pre- versus
      postoperative dual antiplatelet loading with Aspirin and Clopidogrel on volume of
      periinterventional cerebral ischemic lesions as quantified by diffusion weight MRI (DW-MRI)
      and neurocognitive function in patients undergoing transfemoral aortic valve replacement. The
      statistical trial design assumes superiority of preloading with DAPT regarding the primary
      endpoint.
