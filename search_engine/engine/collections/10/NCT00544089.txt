      scans cell morphology and chromosomal ploidy in the same cell of hematologic line using
      digital technology, to recognize germ cells of the testis by their morphology and
      cytogenetics. Testicular tissues which obtained from 15 men were enzymatically digested and
      the cells received were fixed on slides. The cells were stained by Giemsa May Grinwald
      staining and scanned automatically in a bright field for cell morphology. Fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH) using centromeric probes for chromosomes X, Y and 18 was performed
      on the same slide after destaining. The cells were automatically scanned and classified
      according to the ploidy of the chromosome signals. The presence of IL-18 in the same men's
      testis was examined parallelly, by immunohistochimical staining using specific antibody for
      human IL-18.
