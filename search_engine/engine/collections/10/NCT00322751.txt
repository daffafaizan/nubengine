      poor pulmonary function. These patients have usually very limited treatment options because
      of the compromised lung function. Chemoradiation is usually superior to radiation alone, but
      has not been extensively tested in this patient population. Topotecan is a drug approved for
      lung cancer that has synergistic activity with radiation. The study will determine what is
      the safest dose of topotecan to use with radiation in this patient population
