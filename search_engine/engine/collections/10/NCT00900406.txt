        -  To establish a DNA bank from donor and recipient (prior to transplant) peripheral blood
           for SNP studies.

        -  To establish a tissue bank for gene expression studies using donor and recipient
           (post-transplant) peripheral blood samples.

        -  To establish a tissue bank for proteomic studies using donor and recipient blood and
           urine samples.

        -  To establish a tissue bank for various studies using biopsy specimens.

        -  To establish a tissue bank for flow cytometric studies using recipient
           (post-transplant), and sample from stem cell product.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood samples are collected from donors prior to stem cell mobilization
      and from patients prior to starting preparative regimen. Samples are studied by single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, SNP array, proteomic analysis, gene expression, and
      other immunological laboratory methods. Blood, urine, and tissue samples are preserved for
      future studies. Extra skin biopsies and gastrointestinal biopsies are performed at diagnosis
      of graft-vs-host disease and preserved in a tissue bank for flow cytometric studies.
