      contributes to $317 billion expenditures in healthcare, indirect loss of earnings and
      disability benefits. Determining whether it is possible to deliver more effective and wider
      reaching smoking cessation interventions to individuals with serious mental illness is a high
      priority. Smartphone apps are a wide reaching technology that could provide individuals with
      serious mental illness the necessary skills for quitting.

      This feasibility trial will test whether a tailored smoking cessation app for people with
      serious mental illness, Learn to Quit, results in higher levels of engagement with smoking
      cessation content as compared to an app designed for the general population, NCI QuitGuide.
      The trial will also demonstrate whether it is possible to (a) feasibly recruit and retain
      individuals with serious mental illness in an mHealth clinical trial, and (b) successfully
      gather smoking cessation outcomes. Ninety individuals with serious mental illness will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the experimental condition, participants will
      use the Learn to Quit app. In the comparator condition, participants will use the NCI
      QuitGuide app. Participants in both conditions will receive Nicotine Replacement Therapy
      (standard dosing of nicotine patch + 1-week course of 4mg nicotine lozenges) and technical
      coaching. Study duration will be 4 months, with four follow-up appointments at 1-month,
      2-month, 3-month, and 4-months.
