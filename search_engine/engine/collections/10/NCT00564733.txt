      I. Assess the response rate in patients who do not demonstrate an early response to
      carboplatin/paclitaxel as determined by FDG-PET ("initial non-responders") who are
      subsequently treated with three additional courses of docetaxel/gemcitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the ability of FDG-PET to predict response to therapy as measured by computed
      tomography (CT).

      II. Evaluate the early and late changes in tumor FDG uptake (change in standardized uptake
      value [SUV]) in all patients and correlate with overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: All patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT scan between days 18-21.

      Patients are then assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I (Responders): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 additional courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II (Initial non-responders): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 8. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT scan between days 18-21 of course 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 81-84 and then
      periodically thereafter.
