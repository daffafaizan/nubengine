      create a sufficient dataset to train a learning system to achieve the stated objective. The
      data required will feature footage (images/videos) from inside the oesophagus. The preferred
      data would contain associated diagnosis notes and description, however, data without
      diagnosis can still be used. All data can and will be anonymised, as personal information
      will not be useful in this work.

      The data will be labelled by either researchers, or professional clinicians and prepared
      ready to feed into a chosen learning AI system. Through an iterative learning process, the
      chosen AI system will learn to discriminate between severity of Barrett's oesophagus and
      output optimal biopsy target.
