      traditional IV access in patients determined to have difficult IV access based on the
      Difficult Intravenous Access (DIVA) scale. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized
      to traditional IV access or ultrasound guided IV access. If randomized to ultrasound guided
      IV access, the IV will be placed under direct visualization. Following IV placement or when
      attempts at IV access have ceased, the patient and family will be asked to complete a series
      of questions related to their satisfaction regarding IV placement. The follow-up phase
      examining duration of the IV and any related complications will continue until the IV placed
      as part of the study has been removed.
