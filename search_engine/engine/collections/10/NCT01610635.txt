      compare different intervals between blood donations to try to find the optimum interval for
      which it is safe for different donors to give blood. The study will look at whether intervals
      should be tailored by age, gender, genetic profile, and other characteristics. Study findings
      should help to improve the well-being of future blood donors in England and enhance the
      country's blood supplies.
