    
      Monocentric, prospective cohort, case-control type study. The population concerned is
      composed of patients with early onset anorexia nervosa (AM) and control subjects (two
      groups).

      The objectives of this study are to:

      Describe the cognitive treatment of early-onset AM patients with specific stimuli of the
      disorder (eating and body images) compared to age- and sex-matched control subjects:

        -  children controls not achieved with normal body mass index(BMI);

        -  children with unbalanced insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes, therefore subject to a
           strict diet that requires good nutritional knowledge and no weight judgment disorders.

      Describe the links between cognitive treatment and clinical phenotype in patients with early
      onset AM, in particular severity of eating behaviour trouble symptomatology (TCA),
      psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, neuropsychological profile.

      30 patients with early-onset AM. Two groups of control subjects (matched for age and gender):
      30 subjects from the general population with a normal Body Mass Index (BMI) and 30 subjects
      with chronic somatic pathology (type 1 diabetes) without weight variation (good knowledge of
      dietary caloric values without impaired judgment about the caloric value of foods and
      representation of the body image of self and others) A total of 90 participantsPatients and
      controls without eating disorders will be recruited at Robert Debr√© Hospital, after signature
      of the authorization by the holder(s) of parental authority present at the time of
      hospitalization All patients treated in the department benefit from extensive phenotypic
      exploration, carried out in routine care.

      For controls, phenotypic exploration will require a half-day evaluation.
