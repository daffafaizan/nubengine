        -  the update of the MACH-NC meta-analysis showed that actually only concurrent
           chemo-irradiation trials found a significantly improved survival (in particular the
           addition of cisplatinum alone to radiotherapy)

        -  the addition of docetaxel to the cisplatinum-5FU regimen (TPF) when compared with
           cisplatinum--5FU (PF)

        -  the addition of cetuximab to irradiation

      On this basis we decided to carry-out a randomized phase II for previously untreated patients
      requiring a total laryngectomy:

      All patients after a complete work-up including a CTscan will receive 3 cycles of TPF(T: 75
      mg/m², P: 75 mg/m² and 5FU 750 mg/m²).

      Patients with response over 50 % (endoscopy and CTscan) will be randomized to receive either
      irradiation (70 Gy) and cisplatinum (100 mg/m² on D1, D22 and D43) or irradiation (70 Gy)
      with cetuximab (loading dose of 400 mg followed by weekly 250 mg for a total of 8 cycles.

      Patients with less than 50% decease in tumour volume after TPF, patients with residual or
      recurrent disease after either RT-CDDP or RT-cetuximab will get salvage total laryngectomy.
