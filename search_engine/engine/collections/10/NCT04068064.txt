      emotional association bias towards gaming, compulsive choice of gaming pictures, cue-induced
      craving for gaming, the severity of gaming behaviors in individuals with IGD.

      As with the underlying neural mechanisms, the experiment aims to test whether EABM training
      will alter the activation of reward circuits in response to gaming pictures, the activation
      of executive control network (mainly refering to the prefrontal cortex) regarding regulation
      ability for craving and response inhibition ability.
