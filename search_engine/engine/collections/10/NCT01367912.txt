      receptivity and embryo. This conflict was the starting point of our study. The investigators
      thought that this luteal decrease in E2 level could be prevented by adding estradiol just
      before the receptivity window is open, instead of adding earlier in the luteal phase which
      could result in defective embryo implantation.
