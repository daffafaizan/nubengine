    
      All subjects who qualify for this trial are to have 4 to 8 clinically typical, visible and
      discrete AK lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the face or scalp.

      Eligible subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups:

        -  Treatment Group A: Ingenol mebutate gel 0.015%, once daily for 3 consecutive days for
           the first treatment course. At 8 weeks after treatment initiation, subjects who present
           with existing AKs or newly emergent AKs in the treatment area will receive one more
           treatment course of ingenol mebutate gel 0.015%, daily for 3 consecutive days.

        -  Treatment Group B: Diclofenac sodium gel 3%, (0.5 grams), twice daily for 90 days.
