    
      This protocol is designed to characterize the clinical and laboratory profile of patients
      with Fabry disease who have residual levels of Alpha-galactosidase (Alpha- Gal A) activity.
      Normally these are patients with the later onset or milder forms of the disease, sometimes
      referred to as the cardiac and/or renal variants. Enzyme Enhancement Therapy is a novel
      therapeutic approach to treatment of lysosomal storage diseases that has recently been
      proposed, for patients who produce low levels of endogenous enzyme. We plan to evaluate this
      therapy in later-onset Fabry disease patients and in preparation we need to develop sensitive
      outcome measures for this subset of patients. Thirty patients with enhanceable Alpha- Gal A
      activity will be recruited. If on enzyme replacement therapy, they will be asked to miss up
      to two biweekly infusions. These patients, along with five control patients with
      non-enhanceable(classic) Fabry disease, will undergo a comprehensive five day evaluation at
      the NIH Clinical Center that will include a complete physical examination, functional studies
      of the heart, eye, kidney and sweat function, imaging of the brain and the heart and a number
      of blood and urine tests, as well as a skin biopsy.
