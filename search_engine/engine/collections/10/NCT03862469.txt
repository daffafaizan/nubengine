      cycle study. In the first two menstrual cycles, study participants will chart their symptoms
      and use Easy@Home Ovulation strip to chart their ovulation using the PreMom app. This period
      will separate study participants into two groups: those with vs. without the PMS diagnosis.
      Study participants will continue to perform ovulation testing during their third menstrual
      cycle. They will attend one individualized task session and provide 8 serum samples at
      specific ovulation-guided menstrual cycle times.
