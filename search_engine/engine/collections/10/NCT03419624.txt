      added to high-dose intensive insulin therapy compared to Placebo added to high-dose intensive
      insulin with active insulin up-titration for change in HbA1c from baseline to week 28 shall
      be explored and generate initial data on the primary outcome. We hypothesize that SGLT-2
      inhibition and GLP-1 receptor agonism may be a rational combination therapy that addresses a
      broad range of pathophysiological defects associated with T2DM in obesity and may reduce
      HbA1c levels in patients with severe insulin resistance. In a third treatment arm, patients
      will be treated with Exenatide monotherapy added to high-dose intensive Insulin therapy to
      study additive effects of Dapagliflozin and Exenatide.
