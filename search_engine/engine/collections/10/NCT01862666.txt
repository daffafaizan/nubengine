      endoscopy with biopsy of suspected BE lesions is the only available method. However, the
      endoscopic recognition of early dysplasia in BE relies on the subjective visual recognition
      by an endoscopist. The subtle mucosal variations and early dysplastic changes in the
      esophagus may easily be missed. The development of a wide-field, high resolution endoscopic
      microscopy could enhance the early detection and treatment of dysplasia in BE.
