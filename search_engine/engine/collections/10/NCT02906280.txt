    
      All patients with (suspected) stage IV lung carcinoma identified on spiral computed
      tomography scan and requiring an EBUS-TBNA investigation to obtain intrathoracic hilar or
      mediastinal lymph node tissue for diagnosis, subtyping and genotyping of lung cancer are
      eligible for participation in this study. Procedural technique : patients undergo an
      EBUS-TBNA procedure with either the Flex 19 Ga needle or the 22 Ga needle ; all procedures
      are performed using a linear array echoendosope under moderate sedation (standard practice).
      Primary endpoint of the study is the presence of core tissue that is defined as a continuous
      string of material as observed on the microscopic examination. Secondary endpoints are
      elements relevant to molecular analysis.
