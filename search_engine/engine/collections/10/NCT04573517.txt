      pregnant women undergoing induction of labor. Recruitment will occur on the Labor and
      Delivery unit at the time of induction, after the decision has been made to place a Foley
      balloon for cervical ripening. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to early or delayed
      amniotomy.

      Subjects randomized to early amniotomy will undergo amniotomy within 2 hours of Foley balloon
      removal. Subjects randomized to delayed amniotomy will undergo amniotomy at least 4 hours
      after Foley balloon removal.
