      guidance of radiotherapy, stand to improve the therapeutic ratio. Improved imaging can reduce
      uncertainties by 1) improving the accuracy and reproducibility of organ or tumor delineation,
      and 2) guiding and adapting delivery to account for organ motion. This paradigm has been
      widely accepted in the radiotherapy community, and much research has addressed the technical
      and dosimetric aspects for a sound clinical implementation. However, direct evidence of a
      clinical translation to improved patient outcomes is limited. In this study, we hypothesize
      that the integration of advanced imaging for treatment planning and guidance will safely
      enable a reduction of dose delivered to normal tissues, and will improve toxicity and quality
      of life (QOL) outcomes in patients receiving external beam radiotherapy for low or
      intermediate risk prostate cancer.
