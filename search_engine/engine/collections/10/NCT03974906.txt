    
      This is a single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients aged > 60 undergoing
      lumbar decompression surgery will be randomly assigned to either a GDT ( goal directed fluid
      therapy) group or a control group, who received conventional anesthesiologist-directed fluid
      therapy. Perioperative lactic acid concentrations with 7 different time point, intraoperative
      fluid balance and postoperative complications from admittance to 30 days after surgery were
      recorded. This study will investigate whether GDT would reduce the postoperative
      complications in elderly patients undergoing lumbar stenosis decompression in the prone
      position.
