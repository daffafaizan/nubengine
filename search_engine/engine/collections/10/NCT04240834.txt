      Study. There will be 1220 ACS patients at high risk for ischemic events after successful PCI
      with implantation of at least one drug eluting stent who will be enrolled in Fuwai Hospital,
      China. Then those included subjects will be randomized to either Ticagrelor plus low-dose
      Aspirin (50mg daily, LD group) or Ticagrelor plus regular dose Aspirin (75mg daily, control
      group) for 12 months. The primary endpoint of the current study is to determine the impact of
      low-dose Aspirin plus Ticagrelor versus standard DAPT for 12 months on major adverse cardiac
      and cerebral events (MACCEs), and the secondary endpoint is to determine whether the protocol
      of low dose Aspirin plus Ticagrelor reduces bleeding events, sufficiently inhibits platelet
      function, and increases the medication adherence among the included patients. In summary, the
      present study is to provide new evidence and strategy about the anti-platelet protocol for
      ACS patients at high risk for ischemia.
