      at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center with tibial and femoral fractures suitable
      for operative repair will be prospectively enrolled. Inclusion criteria will include any
      patient with a tibia fracture or femur fracture requiring intramedullary nailing. Retrograde
      intramedullary nails will be excluded as will nails which are not interlocked. The goal for
      enrollment is 24 tibial and 24 femoral fractures. Data including operative time, C-arm time,
      and "nail misses" will be obtained in the operating room for 24 tibial and 24 femoral nails.
      Surgeons who perform the procedure will have had experience using the freehand technique and
      will be trained with the guided wand prior to the experiment. Locking will be performed with
      the freehand and the wand technique in alternating order for the two interlocking screws. The
      order of which technique is utilized first will be randomly assigned. All procedures will be
      timed, and fluoroscopy time, radiation time, and any "nail misses" will be documented. All
      tibial nails will be locked with 2 mediolateral screws and all femurs with 2 lateral to
      medial screws.

      Patients will receive follow-up for complications for a 6 month period after surgical
      procedure. Intervals of follow-up will be at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.
      Anterior-posterior and lateral images will be performed as are already customary and usual at
      these time intervals.

      Outcome Measure(s) The goal is to prospectively assess the "wand" technique as a reliable
      alternative to standard interlocking screw placement which reduced operative time, C-arm
      exposure and inadvertent "nail misses." Additionally, it is expected that there will exist no
      complications related to the use of this technique.
