      the management of pediatric bipolar disorder. A recent study found that nearly 50% of
      patients taking immediate-release CBZ had side effects while only 20% of patients had
      side-effects after switching to an extended release (ER) version of the drug, despite high
      doses. In addition, with an ER formulation of CBZ there is a potential for decrease in
      peak-related side effects and improved efficacy with higher blood levels. Thus, an ER
      formulation of CBZ may improve effectiveness and adherence to treatment.

      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Equetro in the
      treatment of bipolar I, bipolar II, and bipolar spectrum disorder in children ages 6-12 over
      the course of 8-weeks. We propose that during this exploratory study there will be sufficient
      safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of Equetro in the treatment of Pediatric Bipolar
      Disorder. The results of this study will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger
      randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical
      power.
