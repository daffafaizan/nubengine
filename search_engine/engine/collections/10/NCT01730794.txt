    
      Study Goal To compare the ability of NAVA vs. conventional lung protective ventilation in a
      multicenter, unblinded, randomized, controlled fashion to provide invasive ventilatory
      support during acute respiratory failure in adults who are expected to require ventilatory
      support for greater than 72 hours.

      Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the use of NAVA compared to conventional lung protective
      ventilation will result in a decrease in the number of days of mechanical ventilation. It is
      further hypothesized that NAVA compared to conventional lung protective ventilation will
      result in a decrease in the length of weaning, the length of ICU and hospital stay, and
      mortality.

      Primary Outcome

      â€¢ Number of invasive ventilator free days.

      Secondary Outcome

        -  Mortality

        -  Length of Invasive Ventilation in survivors

        -  Length of ICU and hospital stay

        -  Incidence of barotrauma (defined as the presence of any extra-pulmonary air that was not
           present at study enrollment).

        -  Ventilator associated pneumonia (development of a pneumonia 48 hrs after entry into the
           study).

        -  Development of ARDS (after enrollment into the study; defined as a rapid onset, a
           P/F<200 mmHg, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that are not of cardiac origin).
