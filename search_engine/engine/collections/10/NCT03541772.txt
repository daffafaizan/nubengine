      To assess the efficacy and safety of OV in patients with head and neck tumors during
      treatment with radio-chemotherapy.

      Materials and Methods

      Patients diagnosed with Head and Neck Carcinoma, and indicated to follow a radiotherapy
      treatment concurrent with Radiosensitizing Chemotherapy, were included in a phase II,
      randomized, prospective, controlled and double-blind study in two treatment arms: RT + CT +
      Placebo (n = 30) and RT + CT + OV (n = 30) during one year in a tertiary center (INOR), with
      the aim of evaluating the reduction of toxicities of RT-CT and improve the quality of life of
      patients during these oncospecific treatments.
