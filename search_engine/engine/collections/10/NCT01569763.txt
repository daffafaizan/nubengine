      month. Approximately 20-25% of healthy premenopausal women have abnormal uterine bleeding.
      Menorrhagia can have a negative impact on a woman's lifestyle and self-perception, often
      leading her to seek definitive treatment. Pharmacologic treatment for menorrhagia is not
      always successful, and dilatation and curettage typically provides relief for only a few
      menstrual cycles. Traditionally hysterectomy has been the definitive treatment for
      menorrhagia. This clinical study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the Aurora
      Endometrial Ablation System to provide a therapeutic treatment for menorrhagia due to benign
      causes by ablating the endometrial lining of the uterus in pre-menopausal women for whom
      childbearing is complete. Subjects who are randomized to the control group will receive
      hysteroscopic rollerball/resection ablation. Subjects randomized to the test arm will be
      treated with the Aurora Endometrial Ablation System.
