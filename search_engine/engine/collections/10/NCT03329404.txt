      conventional RBCs, or to receive conventional RBCs followed by Mirasol-treated RBCs. The
      blood centers will collect the donor RBCs and supply the Mirasol-treated RBCs to the hospital
      sites for transfusion into patients. Hospital sites will order conventional RBCs as per their
      normal process, from their standard vendor.

      Blood transfusion is the mainstay of care for individuals with thalassemia major. The purpose
      of transfusion is twofold: to improve the anemia and to suppress the ineffective
      erythropoiesis. A transfusion episode for these thalassemia patients are the routine
      transfusions administered on a regular schedule for the life of the patient.

      The crossover trial design will consist of 2 treatment periods. Each period will include a 50
      day wash-in phase (Day 0 of the wash-in = Day 0 of the treatment period) followed by 2
      transfusion episodes. An end of study treatment follow-up visit will occur 2-4 weeks after
      the last per protocol transfusion, prior to the next standard of care transfusion. A final
      study visit will occur at least 60 days after the last per protocol transfusion.

      The primary objective of the PRAISE study is to determine if percent survival of RBCs derived
      from Mirasol-treated WB is non-inferior to conventional RBCs when transfused into patients
      requiring chronic RBC transfusion support. The secondary objectives include comparing other
      efficacy and safety endpoints between treatment groups.
