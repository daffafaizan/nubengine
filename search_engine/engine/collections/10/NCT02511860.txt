      tests such as the complete metabolic panel (CMP) as well as the effect on blood pressure over
      time. Participants will self-monitor their blood pressures and undergo lab testing. They will
      also complete symptom inventories to determine subjective factors that change with burdock
      consumption, such as menstrual water retention. Subjects will undergo electronic body
      composition testing before and after the intervention.
