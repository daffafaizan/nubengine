      will be randomly assigned via an random number table to either the SQJZ herbal mixtures or
      placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratify by age and gender. All participants
      are asked to maintain the regular medication schedule during the 12-week intervention.
      Assessments are conducted prior to the intervention and at 4-week, 8-week and 12-week
      directly after the intervention. Also, long-term effects will be assessed at 24 weeks of
      follow-up (from post-enrolment). The assessments will be performed by a blinded investigator
      who is not involved in the randomization.
