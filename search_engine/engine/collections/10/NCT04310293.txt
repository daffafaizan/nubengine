      ovarian response. While this is commonly due to diminished ovarian reserve, as indicated by
      advanced age and/or elevated basal day 3 FSH concentrations, a subset of these patients are
      <41 years old and have normal FSH concentrations.

      To overcome this problem several strategies have been reported, with limited success.

      With approval of our Board, 100 women with a history of previous poor response to vigorous
      gonadotrophin stimulation. All with AFC ≤3, AMH;≤0.5 and they give only ≤3 oocytes in their
      previous cycles will be included in this study using this new protocol: clomiphene citrate
      150 for 7 days starting on DAY2, associated with HMG 300 IU & Groth hormone 8 units in
      alternating days (i.e.; HMG on D2,4,6,8 while GH on D3,5,7,9) then folliculomonitoring will
      be started on D9, then Antagonist may be added till triggering then will see the response
      compared to their own ovarian response before in their previous trials
