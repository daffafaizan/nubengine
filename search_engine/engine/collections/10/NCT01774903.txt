      prospective (study following participants forward in time) study conducted to assess the
      efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl in Thai participants with chronic low back pain. All
      participants start treatment with 12.5 micrograms (Âµg) per hour patch. The patches will be
      replaced every 3 days. On Day 3, and every 3 days thereafter, the TTS-fentanyl dose increases
      will be considered based on rescue medication consumption and pain assessment. No increase in
      TTS-fentanyl dose will be performed within the 72-hour dosing interval. The duration of the
      treatment will be 30 days. Primary efficacy assessment will be pain control rated by
      participants. Assessment time points will be at Day 0 (baseline), on Day 15 and Day 30 (trial
      end). At the end of study, global preference on efficacy, side effects and overall
      satisfaction will also be rated by investigator and participants. Participants' safety will
      be monitored throughout the study.
