      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (complete response [CR], unconfirmed CR, and partial
           response) in patients with previously untreated stage III or IV follicular B-cell
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with rituximab and denileukin diftitox.

        -  Assess the overall survival, time-to-progression, duration of response, and time-to-new
           therapy in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether this regimen depletes or inhibits the function of regulatory T cells
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive denileukin
      diftitox IV over 15-60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment with denileukin diftitox repeats every
      21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected at baseline; on day 1 of courses 2-4; and 1 and 4 months after completion
      of study treatment for research studies. Research studies include analysis of peripheral
      blood lymphocyte subsets expressing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD25, and CD26 by flow cytometry;
      quantitation of CD4+, CD25+ regulatory T cells by flow cytometry; tumor-specific
      Î³-interferon-secreting T cells by enzyme-linked immunospot assay; tumor-specific cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte activity; and immune activation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years
      after registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study.
