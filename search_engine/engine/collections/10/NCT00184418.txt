      in general, second that changes in activity in psychiatric status affect activity in the
      immune system and third that there are connections between certain psychiatric
      conditions/disorders and certain features of the immune system.

      All patients admitted to a psychiatric acute ward covering an area with a population of
      130.000 and with around 1000 admittances to an acute psychiatric ward a year (some
      readmittances) are asked to participate in the study. Patients fill in a question form
      regarding psychiatric as well as somatic health with emphasis on diseases involving immune
      activity. When possible also slight information on the family is registered. Both at the time
      of admittance and after recovery clinical laboratory tests on somatic status are registered.
      In addition the level of different cytokines is measured. The psychiatric state and precise
      diagnoses are registered during the stay. The data will be analysed to uncover connections
      between psychiatric stress in general as well as specific psychiatric diagnoses and activity
      in the immune system.
