      when an adolescent is a victim of cyberbullying, the risk of developing numerous mental
      health problems increases. Tackling the problem of cyberbullying victims' worsening mental
      health involves at least (1) reducing bullying itself, as this would reduce the prevalence of
      victimization, and (2) building resilience in the victims so that their mental health does
      not worsen. In recent years, a number of preventive interventions have been developed aimed
      at reducing cyberbullying but not so much focused on building resilience in the victims. Very
      recently, interest in scientific social psychology has grown due to a new approach to
      interventions, which have been called "wise interventions." This approach involves a set of
      rigorous techniques, based on theory and research, that address specific psychological
      processes to help people thrive in various life environments. The main objective of this
      project is to extend the previous findings to the mental health effects of online
      victimization in adolescents. In this project it will be designed and evaluated the
      effectiveness of an wise intervention aimed at (1) reducing online bullying, as this would
      reduce the prevalence of victimization; and (2) building resilience in victims so that the
      negative impact of victimization on their mental health will be reduced. The secondary
      objective will be to evaluate the moderating role of gender and the degree of development in
      the effects of the intervention.The study will involve the evaluation of the intervention in
      a sample of around 600 adolescents randomly allocated to experimental and control condition.
