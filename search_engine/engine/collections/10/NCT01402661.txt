      patterns, effectiveness, and safety of DMARDs (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs),
      biologic agents, and any other treatments currently used in the management of RA.

      The design is a prospective, non-interventional registry for patients with RA under the care
      of a rheumatologist. Longitudinal data are collected from both patients and their treating
      rheumatology providers during routine clinical encounters using a structured and standardized
      data collection method. The scope of data collection includes but is not limited to patient
      demographics, disease duration, medical history (including all prior and current treatments
      for RA), smoking status, alcohol use, disease activity and severity, pain, as well as other
      clinician- and patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities and adverse events, infections,
      hospitalizations, and other targeted safety outcomes. After the enrollment visit, RA patients
      and physicians will complete the follow-up questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical
      encounters. The goal is to collect data from patients and providers at six month intervals.
      Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result
      of general questioning by the Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with the
      Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.
