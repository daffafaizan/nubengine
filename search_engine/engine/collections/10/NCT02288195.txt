    
      This randomised, open-label, multicentre,phase 3 trial began in August, 2014, as an adjuvant
      trial comparing capecitabine-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with chemotherapy alone,in
      patients aged 18 years to 75 with clinical stage II-III locally advanced rectal cancer from
      six Chinese institutions.

      Patients with local advanced rectal cancer (T2N+ or T3-4aNany,M0, CRM≥2mm, 12cm from the anus
      verge) were scheduled to Group A: receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (4 cycles of XELOX:
      oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 day 1，capecitabine 2000mg/m2 days 1-14, repeated every 21 days) followed
      by radical surgery and 4 cycles of XELOX ( oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 day 1，capecitabine 2000mg/m2
      days 1-14, repeated every 21 days) and Group B :chemoradiotherapy (50.4 Gy plus capecitabine
      1650 mg/m² administered orally and concurrently with radiation therapy for 5 days per week.)
      followed by radical surgery and 6 cycles of XELOX ( oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 day 1，capecitabine
      2000mg/m2 days 1-14, repeated every 21 days) The primary endpoint was overall survival;
