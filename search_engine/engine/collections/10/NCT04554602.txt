      (MRI coelioscopy ). Fusion ultrasound is a no-invasive scientific technical which allow with
      security to evaluate the progress of endometriosis lesions. During 39 months, 200 patients
      will be follow. In one arm, there is the control group with women without endometriosis. In
      the second arm, there is the patient with endometriosis. We will compare monitoring
      differences between gold standard and fusion ultrasound ( Cost assessment,exams duration,
      reproductibility, the link between symptoms and evolution of the lesion size).
