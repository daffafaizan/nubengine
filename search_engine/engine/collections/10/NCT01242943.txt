      tumor blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a
      rare event in the adult (exception made for the female reproductive cycle), but is a
      pathological feature of most aggressive types of cancer. The study aims at determining the
      therapeutic potential of the L19SIP antibody in SIP format, labelled with the radionuclide
      131I, for the treatment of patients with different cancer types. The study follows a Phase I
      study performed with 131I-L19SIP in over 30 patients with cancer, which has shown an
      excellent tolerability at radioactive doses as high as 150 mCi and therapeutic benefit for
      some patients enrolled in the study.
