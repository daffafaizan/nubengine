      I. To determine the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), using intradermal injections of
      autologous dendritic cells harvested from peripheral blood precursors and pulsed
      (co-cultured) with tumor lysate derived from surgical tissues in patients with low-grade
      gliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor overall survival (OS), and cellular immune responses in brain tumor patients
      injected with tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on
      days 0, 14, and 28.
