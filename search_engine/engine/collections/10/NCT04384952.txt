      by developmental, neurological or sensory (vision or hearing) disorders.

      After summer break, the reading performance of dyslexic children declines more than those of
      non-dyslexic children. Indeed, during the summer, dyslexic children are less inclined to read
      and their consultations with speech therapist are usually suspended.

      Intensive reading therapy programs proved to be efficient during the summer, to maintain
      reading level of dyslexic children. However these programs are expensive and not easy to
      generalise. Some other studies tested reading therapy programs applied by parents at home. It
      proved to be effective and feasible.

      Thus, the hypothesis of the present study is: a parent-administered reading therapy program
      during the summer break could stabilise the reading performance of dyslexic children (grade 3
      to 5) after the summer. On the contrary the investigators assume the control group reading
      performance would decrease.

      With a controlled randomised trial, the investigators will compare the reading performance of
      two groups of dyslexic children with the same type of dyslexia (with visual information
      treatment deficit). All of them are diagnosed by the Reference Centre for learning
      disabilities (CRTLA), a Robert Debr√© Hospital's Unit, Paris (France).

      Intensity and duration : 6 weeks during the summer break. 15 minutes/day, 5 times per week.

      Intervention group : Parent-administered reading therapy program. Control group : Dyslexic's
      Holiday Workbook (Hatier Editor). This study's main objective consists in evaluating the
      effectiveness in reading performance of a parent-administered reading training program during
      the summer break for dyslexic children.
