      situations, like during dental treatment. This cross over trial aimed to analyze the use of
      music as a distraction resource during children dental treatment, evaluating their cardiac
      and respiratory frequency. Thirty-four children took part in this study, 16 boys and 18
      girls, from 4 to 6 years old, with no previous dental experience, who had two carious lesions
      on occlusal surfaces of molars, from the 2 municipalities of southeast Brasil. Children were
      selected through oral clinical exams, conducted in public schools. After parents signed a
      written consent; children were allocated in two groups: treatment with music (G1) and
      treatment without music (G2). Children acted as controls of themselves: the cross between
      groups allowed all children to be treated with and without music. Three dental visits were,
      scheduled in a weekly basis, the first for anamnesis and clinical examination; the second and
      third for the modified atraumatic restorative treatment (ARTm). The Mozart Symphony No 40 in
      G minor K550 was played in headphones. Cardiac and respiratory frequencies were obtained
      using a pulse oximeter, with the measures being taken in three moments: in the beginning of
      the treatment, during the intervention (use of a rotating device) and at the end of the
      treatment. Data were compiled and analyzed through the statistic software Statistical
      Analyse. The Wilcoxon test was used for inter and intra groups comparison (p<0,050).

      Music worked as a reassuring instrument during children dental treatment.
