    
      This United Kingdom study will comprise a single blind, primary care, post-market evaluation
      of a novel neuromuscular electrical stimulation treatment for urinary incontinence . Women
      with GP determined urinary incontinence (urgency, stress or mixed) will be randomised into
      one of two groups (intervention or control). The control group will receive routine care via
      their GP practice. The intervention group will receive the electrical stimulation device.
      Treatment will last for 12 weeks with a Quality of Life (QoL) primary end point immediately
      post treatment with a second phase to explore the impact of a further 12 weeks maintenance
      programme in the intervention group compared to routine care. There will be a further two
      year follow-up assessment.
