      eligible for this study if they had two or more good quality embryos. All categories of
      female or male factors infertility except uterine factor infertility were eligible for
      participation in the study. Immediately prior to embryo transfer, women were randomly
      allocated to either treatment (cleaning the cervical canal) or control groups. In treatment
      group, excess mucus and debris were cleared from the cervical canal using a sterile cotton
      swabs. The cervical discharge was scored as mucosal, bloody, combination of mucosal and
      bloody, or infected. Control group had no cervical cleaning before embryo transfer. Then, the
      embryos were loaded into the transfer catheter by the embryologist and were deposited into
      the uterine cavity by one experience physician. The primary endpoint was clinical pregnancy.
      Fertilization, Implantation, abortion, and live birth rates were the other outcomes of
      interest or secondary outcomes.
