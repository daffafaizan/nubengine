      form of the peptide human relaxin-2) on portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis.
      The investigators will measure portal pressure by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and
      hepatic blood flow by indocyanine green (ICG) clearance to evaluate the potential benefits of
      the drug. In a recently completed small exploratory open-label phase 2 study (EudraCT no.
      201200023626, NCT01640964), Part B demonstrated that serelaxin can lower portal pressure.
