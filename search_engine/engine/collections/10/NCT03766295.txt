      modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor
      microenvironment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      masitinib in combination with gemcitabine with respect to placebo in combination with
      gemcitabine for the treatment of non resectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
      cancer patients with pain related to the disease. Approximately 330 patients with pain Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) > 20 and/or treated with 'opioid analgesics' dose â‰¥ 1 mg/kg/day at
      baseline will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the masitinib and placebo arms, respectively.
      The primary outcome measure is overall survival (OS).
