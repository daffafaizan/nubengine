      rehabilitation clinic. All patients eligible for the study were informed about treatment and
      possible risks, and a consent form was signed. Determined evaluations were made to the
      patients. After 3 weeks of treatment, patients will be invited to the controls and the
      long-term effects of the treatments will be investigated.

      Patients with a diameter difference of more than 50 ml between two extremities and patients
      without Sudeck Atrophy will be included in the treatment.

      The study was planned as a single blind with randomized control. The physiotherapist who
      performed the treatment received manual lymph drainage therapy training.

      The patients were distributed to groups with a computer-based data distribution system. While
      the patients are sent for treatment, they are directed according to the first assessment. The
      person who performed the assessment and those who received treatment were planned
      differently.

      The primary purpose of the study was to investigate the long-term effectiveness of complex
      decongestive therapy on traumatic edema, as well as to evaluate long-term hand functions.
      Other objectives are to investigate the long-term effects on range of motion, muscle
      strength, grip strength, pain, and daily living activities.
