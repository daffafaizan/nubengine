      I. Determine if sponge cytology with FISH is a reliable screening tool for esophageal
      dysplasia/cancer, and determine its sensitivity and specificity, compared to the gold
      standard procedure (upper endoscopy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if the cytology screening with FISH biomarkers is more cost effective than upper
      endoscopy for the screening of esophageal cancer and the surveillance of esophageal
      metaplasia and dysplasia.

      II. Determine the limitations and future needs to improve this technique.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants swallow the capsule (Oesotest from Actimed) and then wait 10 minutes before the
      sponge is pulled out through the esophagus by gentle traction on the string. Cytology samples
      from the sponge are harvested and analyzed by FISH. Participants then undergo standard EGD or
      upper endoscopy.
