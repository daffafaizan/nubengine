      provides improved pain control and decreased opioid use compared to bupivacaine when injected
      during a transversus abdominis plane block for donor nephrectomy patients.

      Background and treatment procedure: Liposomal bupivacaine is a multi vesicular formulation of
      bupivacaine that has been shown to provide up to 72 hours of analgesia compared to
      bupivacaine which provides up to 24 hours of analgesia post injection. These two medications
      have been compared using a infiltration or injection at the site of incision but have yet to
      be compared when used during a TAP block. A TAP block is an injection of local anesthetic
      under the covering of the transversus abdominis muscle layer. This layer is found using an
      ultrasound which is a beam of high frequency sound that allows one to visualize images in the
      body. Then using this ultrasound we can see our needle as it pierces the covering of the
      transversus abdominis muscle layer and watch as the local anesthetic is injected into this
      plane. This is done on both sides of the abdomen to provide analgesia to the skin, muscle,
      and fascial layers of the abdomen.

      Population: Adult patients who are undergoing a donor nephrectomy Rationale: It will be
      useful to determine if one formulation or the other provides better and longer lasting pain
      control for patients undergoing abdominal procedures.
