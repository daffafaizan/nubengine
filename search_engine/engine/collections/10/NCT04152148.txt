           BAT4306F in patients with CD20-positive B-cell lymphoma, when the injection dosage
           escalates, to ultimately determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting
           toxicity (DLT), and recommended dosage for phase II clinical studies ( RP2D);

        2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAT4306F(for injection);

        3. To evaluate the immunogenicity profile of BAT4306F(for injection);

        4. To evaluate the efficacy profile of BAT4306F (for injection);Using the Lugano criteria
           (2014), the 2008 IWCLL efficacy evaluation criteria, and the 2014 IWWM-7 efficacy
           evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the efficacy of related diseases at week 7,
           week 13, and week 19. The index of evaluation was ORR (including CR, PR, SD and PD, ORR
           is the proportion of patients with CR and PR).
