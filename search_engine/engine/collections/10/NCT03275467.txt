      period. It will be investigated if the infusion of suspended stool from healthy donors
      improves the symptoms of MC patients by restoring their disturbed intestinal microbiota. This
      procedure is known as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

      MC patients (n=10) will be randomised to receive FMT using stool from one of two healthy
      donors.

      At baseline, blood samples and mucosal biopsies will be obtained from the descending colon.
      In addition, faecal samples will be collected and patients will complete symptom
      questionnaires. The first FMT will be administered by colonoscopy, FMT 2-3 by enemas. Faecal
      samples will be collected and questionnaires will be completed at different time points
      during the study. The patients will be followed-up at 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months
      after receiving FMT 1, however, the follow-up after 6 months will be optional. Additional
      biopsies from the descending colon and blood samples will be collected 6 weeks after the
      first FMT.
