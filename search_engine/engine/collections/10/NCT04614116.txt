      molecules. Evolutionary, it is an essential process that allows the survival at lower
      temperatures. Since the discovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) it is believed that this part
      of the adipose tissue can dissipate energy for heat thanks to the uncoupling protein 1
      (UCP1). Since energy expenditure is increased as a consequence of thermogenesis,
      pharmacological induction of this pathway presents an interesting therapeutic target to
      counter obesity. However, recent investigations indicate that white adipose tissue (WAT) is
      much more versatile and probably essentially indispensable for thermogenesis.

      To investigate the mechanism of this futile cycle in WAT we plan to investigate the glucose
      metabolism in 24 healthy volunteers with 2 exams (one with and one without external cooling)
      with two substitutes for glucose. We will use 18F-FDG to quantify the glucose influx into WAT
      using dynamic PET/CT scans and 13C-Glucose to analyze the downstream metabolites.
