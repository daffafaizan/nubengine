    
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is a common debilitating condition that affects the extensor
      muscles of the forearm at its junction with the lateral humeral epicondyle. This pathology is
      commonly treated by a surgical intervention. However, advances in research have allowed the
      discovery of new and less invasive techniques for its treatment, for example the infiltration
      of cytokine rich serum.

      The aim of the study is to compare the common treatment of this pathology, arthroscopic
      resection (surgical intervention) with a new technique, infiltration of cytokine rich serum
      (CRS) (proteins derived from the patient's own blood) with respect to medium and long-term
      pain reduction.

      The study will include a total of 86 patients. Patients will be included by randomization
      into two groups:

        -  GROUP 1: 43 patients will be treated with 2 infiltrations of cytokine rich serum.

        -  GROUP 2: 43 patients will be treated by a regular surgical treatment consisting of
           arthroscopic resection.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CRS as compared to
      arthroscopic resection in reducing pain in the medium term (6 months) in patients with
      chronic lateral epicondylitis.
