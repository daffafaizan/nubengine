    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Describe the significant quality of life (QOL) concerns and long term survivorship
           issues of women diagnosed and treated for early stage ovarian and endometrial cancer
           five or more years ago.

        -  Identify mechanisms which contribute to a gynecologic cancer survivorship model through
           comparison and prediction of high versus low QOL associated with long term adjustment
           and survivorship. Examine social support, coping efforts, self-efficacy, meaning
           associated with survivorship, performance status, and age at diagnosis as potential
           predictors.

        -  Identify and compare factors that predict high versus low QOL for women with early stage
           endometrial cancer completing participation in GOG-99 clinical trial. Conduct
           exploratory analysis examining long term QOL concerns of survivors randomized to surgery
           arm with or without radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete one telephone interview with a professional female interviewer.
      The interview lasts approximately 60 minutes and is audiotaped.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 197 early stage endometrial cancer survivors and 114 early
      stage ovarian cancer survivors will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
