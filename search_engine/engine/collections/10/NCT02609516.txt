      morbidity has been studied extensively. However, it remains unclear whether having two or
      more chronic diseases concurrently (or 'multimorbidity') plays a role in contributing to the
      inequalities gap in survival. This is particularly relevant given an ageing population and
      the trend of a widening in the life expectancy gap across several European countries.

      Multimorbidity incidence increases rapidly with age. Estimates of the prevalence of
      multimorbidity in older people range from 55% to 98%, mainly due to the selection of diseases
      included, population coverage (hospital, community) and data source (self-reported surveys or
      clinical records). However, across all studies there is a clear and consistent pattern of
      higher prevalence rates at older ages, with multimorbidity.

      Many aspects of the patient health trajectory remain under-explored. Patient case-mixes are
      likely to vary across socioeconomic groups, alongside a host of prognostic factors, including
      the clustering of multiple risk factors, age of onset, and disease presentation, progression
      and management in the presence of multiple health conditions.
