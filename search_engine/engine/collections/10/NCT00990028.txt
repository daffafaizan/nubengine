      is the main cause of death and disability between 18 and 40 years. In addition it originates
      expensive expenses in health care systems.

      Head injury produces damage by primary mechanisms related to impact, then by biochemical ways
      which are activated and they carry to secondary damage. Many studies have been conducted for
      explaining secondary injury, the majority conclude there is a kind of ischemic lesion related
      maybe with changes in cerebral flow and metabolism. All these changes are associated to a
      immunological response. Up to now some drugs are directed to modulate the immunological
      system, although many of them have been ineffective.

      Statins o inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase are drugs used in dyslipidemia, frequently for
      reduction in LDL. Experimental and clinical studies in stroke have shown improvement in
      outcome. The toxicity related to statin is myopathy and hepatopathy, both with low incidence
      without fatal cases. Rosuvastatin has been postulated be the most powerful with longest life
      and toxicity similar to another statins. Many studies have suggested an important
      immunomodulator effect after statins administration, The investigators have previously
      demonstrated the possible effect of statin on amnesia and disorientation improvement with
      patients who suffered a moderated head injury (Glasgow 9-13). The aim of this new study is to
      analyze the possible immunomodulator role of statins on head injury.
