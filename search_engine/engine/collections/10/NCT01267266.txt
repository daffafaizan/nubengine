      I. Determine if AZD0530 (saracatinib) increases time to radiographic progression in men with
      CRPC compared to placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the adverse events related to AZD0530 in this population. II. Explore the role of
      FYN and other SRC kinase expression as a predictor of response to AZD0530.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      LEAD-IN PHASE: Patients receive oral saracatinib once daily during for 8 weeks. Patients who
      achieve disease regression or a PSA decrease of > 50% continue to receive open-label
      saracatinib. Patients who do not show radiographic evidence of new metastases on bone scan
      and CT, disease regression, or a > 50% decrease in PSA continue on to the randomized phase.

      RANDOMIZED PHASE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral saracatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon progression, patients
      may crossover to arm I.

      Tissue samples may be collected for correlative studies. After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed up for 12 months.
