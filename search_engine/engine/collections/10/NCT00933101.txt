      advanced vessel wall thickness than normal subjects. This is influenced by the degree of
      their blood sugar control. If this is happening in adolescents, we want to know what
      proportion of adolescent children with type 1 diabetes show signs of early blood vessel
      damage. We also want to learn if these signs of damage are linked to other factors such as
      how long someone has had diabetes, blood sugar control or individual differences because of a
      difference in genetic make-up.
