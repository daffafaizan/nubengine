    
      A total of two imaging protocols will be used as "protocol options" in this study (only one
      of the protocols will be used for each enrolled subject): (1) "Two-day protocol," which
      involves MRI of subjects who have had a recent abnormal PET/SPECT study and includes an
      optional second-day visit; (2) "One-day protocol," which involves the subjects undergoing
      stress myocardial perfusion SPECT and MRI in the same day.

      Two blinded readers will interpret MR and SPECT/PET studies by consensus to assess the
      presence of perfusion deficits at stress and rest.
