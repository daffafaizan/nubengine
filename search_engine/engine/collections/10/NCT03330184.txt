      usually used as an antibiotic drug, has been reported a potential glucose-lowering effect in
      vitro and in vivo studies. Bifidobacterium, as a familiar probiotics, can modulate gut
      microbiota and improve glucose and lipid metabolism in animal experiments. Therefore, the aim
      of this study is to assess the beneficial effects of Bifidobacterium and Berberine
      Hydrochloride on lowering glucose and delaying progress to diabetes in patients with
      prediabetes and to detect the potential mechanism.
