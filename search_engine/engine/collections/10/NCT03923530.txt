      (narrow aortic to ventricular end-diastolic pressure difference, indexed to heart rate) after
      TAVR suffer from poor long-term survival. This hemodynamic value can be referred to as the
      aortoventricular index (AVi). In a single center observational study, the 2-year mortality
      rate for patient with a value â‰¥0.6 mm Hg/bpm was 25% compared with 36% for patients with a
      value <0.6 mm Hg/bpm. An abnormal AVi was an independent predictor for poor survival.
      Hypertension and diastolic dysfunction are 2 highly co-morbid conditions among these
      patients. Currently, there is lack of appreciation that pressure measurements obtained at the
      time of TAVR can provide long-term prognostic value. There is also a lack of understanding on
      how to improve outcomes and quality of life among such patients.

      Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist approved for use for treatment of
      hypertension. Animal studies have shown that aldosterone receptor antagonists can decrease
      interstitial myocardial fibrosis. The non-selective aldosterone receptor antagonist,
      spironolactone 25 mg daily compared with placebo was shown to improve diastolic function, as
      assessed by echocardiography, among 28 elderly subjects. A meta-analysis of eleven studies in
      942 subjects found that aldosterone receptor antagonists improve diastolic function and
      markers of cardiac fibrosis without significant changes to left ventricular mass or
      dimensions. In a randomized controlled trial, eplerenone was found to be safely tolerated
      among asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis.
