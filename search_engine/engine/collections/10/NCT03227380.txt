      minimally invasive techniques, the increased incidence of early-stage tumours, and the
      possibility of caring for patients with compromised health and/or limited respiratory
      function without compromising the oncological outcome, compared to current alternatives such
      as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (1).

      One of the challenges in the development of the thoracoscopic segmentectomy technique we have
      published (2-5) is the orientation (6-7) and the division of the intersegmental plane, by
      contrast to segmentectomy by thoracotomy where this is helped by palpation and the manual
      traction which can be used on the segment, along the intersegmental vein. The most commonly
      used technique to separate two adjacent segments remains stapling, despite its high cost and
      sometimes giving a less anatomical section, with a risk to encroach on the intersegmental
      vein. Moreover, there can be a partial plicator of the spared segment(s) which could in
      theory make them less functional.

      We have however shown that the postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were much lower
      than that of patients who had a thoracotomy, dropping from 42% for thoracotomies to 16% for
      thoracoscopies, the surgical approach being an independent predictive factor for
      postoperative complications (8).
