    
      Specific aim 1: To examine the impact of energy and protein adequacy on clinical outcomes.

      Specific aim 2: To describe world-wide patterns of nutritional therapies in the
      PICU.environment: use of guidelines/use of adjuncts (acid suppression, motility,
      etc.)/glycemic control strategy/etc. To describe these practices in subgroups of: cardiac,
      surgical, medical, oncology/stem cell transplant patients in the PICU.

      Specific aim 3: To examine enteral nutrition practices, including timing, route (gastric vs.
      post pyloric), adjuncts, and enteral nutrition (EN) intolerance definitions, in PICU patients
      worldwide Specific aim 4: To examine the current practices around parenteral nutrition
      prescription during the first week of critical illness in the PICU; time of initiation (early
      vs. late), rationale, threshold for initiation.

      Primary predictor: nutritional adequacy (energy, protein) Secondary predictors: nutritional
      status, use of guidelines/site level indicators (location, staffing), use of adjuncts (acid
      suppression, motility, etc.), EN intolerance, subgroups (cardiac, surgical, medical,
      oncology/stem cell transplant), EN route/timing
