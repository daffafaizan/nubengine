    
      This study is intended to prospectively gather information regarding the performance of an
      endoscope-mounted radiofrequency (RF) energy device, which utilizes RF energy for the
      coagulation of gastrointestinal tissue in the setting of bleeding of radiation proctitis. The
      study device, the HALO90 Ablation catheter, has an FDA 510(k) clearance for human use.

      The study design is a single-site, prospective clinical trial to gather performance data
      regarding a 510(k)-cleared, endoscopically-guided radiofrequency energy ablation device for
      the coagulation of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis.

      Study subjects will have experienced bloody stools due to proctitis following pelvic
      radiation for cancers of the prostate or uterine endometrium. The study will include female
      and male adult patients who have received pelvic radiotherapy for such indications as cancer
      of the prostate or endometrium and have subsequently experienced recurrent hemorrhagic
      radiation proctitis.

      As part of this protocol, focal areas of the epithelial lining of the diseased colon, rectum,
      and/or anus will be treated with the study device. The aim is to obtain information about the
      hemostatic effect of this device. The treatment settings evaluated in this study have been
      previously established with this device in the esophagus in "treat and resect" protocols, as
      well as in clinical trials for Barrett's esophagus with long-term follow-up.
