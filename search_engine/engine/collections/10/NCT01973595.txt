    
      This is a randomized, crossover study. After obtaining informed consent, healthy adults aged
      18-40 years with children aged 3-6 years will be randomized to either consume almonds and
      almond paste during the first arm of the study or during the second arm of the study. During
      the intervention period, adult participants will consume 1.5 ounces of almonds per day, and
      children will consume 0.5 ounces of almonds per day for 3 weeks. After a 4-week washout
      period, participants will be crossed to the other treatment (no almond consumption or almond
      consumption).

      Participants will complete daily questionnaires throughout the intervention period, and one
      week before and after each intervention period. Blood samples will be collected from adults
      at the baseline and final time points of each intervention. Stool samples will be collected
      during the pre-baseline and final weeks of each intervention. Dietary intake will be assessed
      weekly during each intervention period. Gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaires will be
      completed weekly during each intervention.
