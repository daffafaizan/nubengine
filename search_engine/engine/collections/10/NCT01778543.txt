      The objectives of this study are to 1) define ocular and systemic associations in a cohort of
      well-phenotyped participants with uveal coloboma, 2) define risk factors and microforms of
      coloboma in relatives of affected individuals and 3) establish a repository of DNA and/or
      lymphoblastoid cell lines from participants with uveal coloboma and their relatives for use
      in laboratory investigations.

      Study Population:

      Six hundred (600) individuals of at least one year of age with documented uveal coloboma and
      their relatives will be enrolled.

      Design:

      This is a natural history/genetic repository study. Six hundred (600) participants will be
      enrolled over fifteen years. Participants will undergo a complete age-appropriate baseline
      eye examination and physical examination and provide a blood, buccal cell/saliva, or DNA
      sample.

      Outcome Measures:

      The tests, data, and samples collected will be analyzed to better understand the genetics of
      uveal coloboma. In particular, ocular and systemic associations will be defined in a cohort
      of well-phenotyped participants with uveal coloboma, as will the risk factors and microforms
      of coloboma in relatives of affected individuals.
