      training module to learn and practice mindfulness techniques. Recruited participants will be
      randomly assigned to an intervention group or a wait-list control group. Parents in the
      intervention group will attend the training, which involves 6 weekly, group sessions. Data
      will be collected from both the intervention and wait-list control groups 1-3 weeks prior to
      the intervention period and 1-3 weeks following the end of the intervention period. This data
      will be collected through self-report questionnaires, in-home observations, hair sample from
      parents, an activity tracker for parents, and records on developmental assessments and
      attendance of the target child from Head Start. The wait-list control group will be offered a
      training after measures are completed. Intervention group participants may be invited to take
      part in focus groups after the training is complete. At these focus groups, they will engage
      in a discussion of their experiences and opinions about the class. Some participants may be
      invited to individual interviews to share their experiences and aid further revision of the
      program.
