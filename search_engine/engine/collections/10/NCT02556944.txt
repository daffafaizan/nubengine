      functional vision from far to near independent of glasses. Many clinical studies on
      diffractive MIOLs, refractive MIOLs, or hybrid MIOLs in enhancing quality of vision showed
      promising outcomes. Several studies have confirmed the satisfactory visual outcomes of Tecnis
      MIOL with +4.00 D add power. The purpose of study is to assess the visual performance after
      cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of multifocal IOL with two different add power
      (+2.75 D or +3.25 D) in one patient.
