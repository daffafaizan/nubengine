        -  Determine whether an FDA-approved device that combines fludeoxyglucose ^18F
           positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) and CT scanning (FDG-PET/CT) can accurately
           locate and determine the extent of disease in patients who are undergoing treatment for
           bone or soft tissue sarcoma.

        -  Determine whether FDG-PET/CT scanning is effective in evaluating the response of sarcoma
           to treatment.

        -  Determine whether the new FDG-PET/CT device improves the ability to evaluate treatment
           response early and accurately.

        -  Correlate changes in glucose metabolic activity early and late after treatment with
           overall and progression-free survival.

        -  Correlate changes in glucose metabolic activity early and late after treatment with
           degree of tumor necrosis at the time of surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to disease
      (high-grade soft tissue sarcoma vs low-grade soft tissue sarcoma vs osteosarcoma).

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose ^18F positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scanning at
      baseline and then within 2 weeks and 12 weeks after the start of treatment (total of 3
      scans).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
