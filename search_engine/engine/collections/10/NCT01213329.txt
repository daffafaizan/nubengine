      transplanted patients whom have received a kidney (50 recipients and 50 donors totaling 100
      anticipated participants). This will be done to see how the Standard of Care (SOC)
      anti-rejection medication, Alemtuzumab (Campath 1-H®) affects these cells- Campath 1-H®
      reduces the number of T cells produced by one's body. We will look for these cells using a
      number of laboratory tests; It will require the subjects to each give 65mL of blood at each
      of the 3 visits that occur during phase 1. Up to 12 subjects will be chosen from phase 1 to
      participate in phase 2 depending on lab results.

      In phase 2, subjects will be randomized to one of the three following groups:

      Group one: Continue normal immunosuppression with tacrolimus and Cellcept® (control group)

      Group two: Cellcept® will be tapered down to 70% in three months. Tacrolimus will be
      continued at the same dosage.

      Group three: Tacrolimus will be reduced to 70% in three months. Cellcept® will be continued
      at the same dosage.

      There will be an analysis of these cells at different time point, pre and post kidney
      transplant. The data collection will allow us to study the stability over time of particular
      phenotypes (cell structures) and T cell function. We will also evaluate how the two different
      "minimizing protocols" effect the cell structure. Results from laboratory testing may allow
      us to define certain criteria that can be broadly applied in solid organ transplant
      recipients. This may allow for safe reduction of the anti-rejection medication that
      transplant recipients receive.
