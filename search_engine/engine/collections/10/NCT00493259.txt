      adolescents who were treated in the Insulin Resistance Syndrome Clinic at Children's Mercy
      Hospital in the past year. New patients will be screened at baseline, 4 and 12 months to
      evaluate if there is improvement in the BMI Z-score, HgA1c, lipid profile or waist
      circumference when depression and/or altered health related quality of life are identified
      and treated in this population.
