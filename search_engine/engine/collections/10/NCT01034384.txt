    
      Objective:

      To compare the effects of complete abstinence or smoking denicotinized research cigarettes to
      smoking ad libitum nicotinized research cigarettes on the following measures: withdrawal
      symptoms and quality of sleep; MAO-A and MAO-B activities; hormonal responses (HPA, HPT);
      mood, cognitive and psychometric performance; functional brain activity, and physiological
      responses.

      Study Population:

      Participants are 125 men who are at least 18 years old, report smoking at least 15 cigarettes
      per day, have not used any illicit drug except marijuana in the past year, have no history of
      drug or alcohol dependence, and have already experienced tobacco withdrawal symptoms when
      they had no access to cigarettes.

      Design:

      Smokers will be randomized into one of the following 3 groups: a) complete tobacco abstinence
      for 8 days; b) denicotinized research cigarettes for 8 days, or c) control group smoking
      nicotinized research cigarettes during the entire study (16 days). Because there are few
      studies comparing functional brain activity in smokers and nonsmokers, a group of nonsmokers
      will serve as a control group for the brain imaging studies.

      Outcome Measures:

      Withdrawal symptoms, mood, quality of sleep, cognitive performance, temperature, blood
      pressure and heart rate, MAO-A parameters: plasma DHPG (dihydroxyphenylglycol), HVA
      (homovanillic acid), 5HIAA (5-hydroxyindolacetic acid); MAO-B parameters: urinary excretion
      of phenylethylamine, platelet MAO-B activity; hormonal parameters: serum ACTH, cortisol, TSH,
      thyroxine, triiodothyronine; EEG; cigarette liking; expired air CO; and functional brain
      activity.
