      a single intravenous dose of anidulafungin. The volunteers to be enrolled will not have
      either candidiasis or any other fungal infection. This is a single center study. Up to a
      total of 35 adult volunteers will be consented for the study at the Clinical and
      Translational Research Center (CTRC). Eighteen of these volunteers are needed to complete the
      study. The others will likely be screen failures, which is more likely in the BMI > 40 kg/m2
      group. Volunteers will be admitted to the CTRC for an overnight stay. Half will be female and
      half male. Six volunteers will have a body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m2, six will have
      a BMI 25-40 kg/m2, and six will have a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2.

      ** BMI groups will only be used for patient enrollment and not for data analysis. total body
      weight will be used as a continuous variable for data analysis. **

      Volunteers will have height and weight measured after they have consented to participate. All
      volunteers in each category will receive a single dose of intravenous anidulafungin of 100
      mg. The volunteers will have blood drawn via an intravenous catheter just prior to the dose,
      and then at 1.5, 8, 16, and 24h after the drug dose. The intravenous catheter is then removed
      after the 24h blood draw, and the volunteer discharged from the study. The volunteer will be
      asked to return to the CTRC outpatient center at 48 and 72 hours to have the final 2 blood
      draws conducted. Subjects who are excluded from study participation due to their laboratory
      results will be provided with a copy of their results and an explanation of the reason for
      ineligibility.
