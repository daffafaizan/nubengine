      both education and employment. Norway is a high-income welfare society with low unemployment
      rates, but the employment rates are very high in the population with psychosis and
      schizophrenia. Norway have a strategy for work and mental health, and through this strategy,
      the government has supported some pilot projects which focus on new ways of supporting people
      with serious mental illness in gaining employment. This study focuses on a representative
      sample participating in a pilot study. The sample consists of admitted patients who have
      received vocational rehabilitation under admittance. The study design is qualitative in
      nature with open- ended questions to allow the sample to express their opinions, attitudes
      and thoughts about the assistance they have had during their rehabilitation stay in hospital.
