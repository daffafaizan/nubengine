      support intervention for DT LVAD. Six DT LVAD programs from across the U.S. will participate
      in a stepped-wedge randomized study design. In this design, each site participates in both
      the control and intervention phase with the timing of the transition randomly assigned. Sites
      all begin in the control phase, where usual care consists of the current education, decision
      making, and informed consent process. When sites reach their randomly assigned time to
      transition to the intervention, their coordinators and key staff will participate in
      communication training and decision coaching. The pamphlet and video decision aid will be
      formally integrated into the existing education, decision making, and informed consent
      process. In both pre- and post-phases, the investigators will enroll patients and caregivers
      and survey them prior to their DT LVAD decision (baseline) and then at 1 month and 6 months
      after to determine the interventions effect on decision quality and a host of secondary
      outcomes. These patient- and caregiver-centered outcomes will be compared within each
      hospital before and after implementation to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.
      The investigators will also survey clinicians before, during, and after implementation of the
      shared decision support intervention. The implementation will be guided using the well-known
      RE-AIM evaluative framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance).
      Formal study of the implementation will promote widespread dissemination of this DT LVAD
      shared decision support.
