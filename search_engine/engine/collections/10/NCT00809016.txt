      Primary

        -  To assess the value of pre-treatment PET in determining the target volume in patients
           with head and neck cancer undergoing three-dimensional conformational radiotherapy and
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate variations in weekly fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET imaging during the first 5
           weeks of treatment.

        -  To determine the relationship between changes in tumor metabolism during radiotherapy
           and control tumor at 3 months and at 1 year post-treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F18 PET (FDG-PET) in addition to conventional imaging at
      baseline. Patients undergo standard three-dimensional conformational radiotherapy and
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

      Some patients also undergo weekly FDG-PET during treatment.
