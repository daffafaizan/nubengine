      grade I and II infants (1-12month) undergoing elective cataract surgery in one eye under
      general anesthesia were studied. Infants were randomly allocated to one of the two groups:
      subtenon block Group (SB) with dexmedetomidine (n =40) or intravenous dexmedetomidine Group
      (IV) (n =40). After securing the airway, infants in Group (SB) received SB block with 0.05
      mL/kg of 0.5%bupivacaine and 0.5µ/kg dexmedetomidine mixture, whereas infants in Group (IV)
      received 1µ/kg IV dexmedetomidine after induction of anesthesia. Surgery started after 5 min
      of study drug administration. Postoperative assessment for number of infants requiring rescue
      analgesia and rescue antiemetics was the primary outcome. CRIES pain scale score , vomiting
      scale score during4-h study period, incidence of oculocardiac reflex and any surgical
      difficulty were the Secondary outcomes.
