      reported that VCI index using several echocardiographic parameters measured. A transthoracic
      echocardiographic study was performed using an Aloka SSD 2200 echocardiograph fitted with
      2.5MHz probe with continuous-wave，pulsed and color Doppler (Japan). Using pulsed Doppler，each
      parameter is measured as following; the deceleration rime of E wave of tricuspid inflow，the
      gradient between right ventricle (RV) and right atrium (RA) by continuous Doppler，the VCI
      variation from the corresponding maximum expiratory diameter (measured at 2 cm from the RA
      and in dorsal decubitus) to its diameter during inspiration. All measurements were taken at
      the end-expiration in order to standardize the samples. VCI index = [tricuspid E deceleration
      (ms)] x 0.11 + [RV/RA gradient (mmHg)] x 0.16 - [VCI variation (mm)] (VCI, vena cava
      inferior; tricuspid E, tricuspid E wave; RV, right ventricle, RA, right atrium).

      Na, Cl, K, creatinine, BUN and uric acid in serum and urine were measured by the usual
      methods before and after the correction of plasma volume. Further, osmolality and vasopressin
      in plasma and osmolality in urine were also measured by the usual methods.
