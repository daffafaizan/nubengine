    
      This is a non-interventional, controlled, non-randomized multicenter clinical study that
      compares a new diagnostic device, the Unyvero LRT55 Application (based on molecular
      diagnostic methods) to either (1) a composite reference method (for non-atypical
      microorganisms), (2) a composite PCR-based method for 3 atypical microorganisms or (3) a
      PCR-based reference method for resistance genes.

      The study will use leftover lower respiratory tract samples taken from subjects suspected
      with lower respiratory tract infections: (a) Specimens taken prospectively for
      standard-of-care (i.e. microbiology testing) from hospitalized subjects. (b) Banked specimens
      for rare microorganisms.

      As the device is under investigation, the test results provided by the Unyvero LRT55
      Application will not be made available to the treating physician and therefore will not be
      used for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.
