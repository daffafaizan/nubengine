      bisphosphonate and denosumab. The globally accepted term is Medication-Related Osteonecrosis
      of the Jaws (MRONJ). Since 2003 there has been a worldwide focus at medication-related
      osteonecrosis, even though there still exist several of unanswered questions - one of them is
      the effect of a drug holiday in relation to tooth extraction. A drug holiday is a temporary
      discontinuation of a drug and has been suggested among risk reduction strategies in the
      literature. It is still unknown whether a drug holiday plays a significant role in relation
      to tooth extraction for the development of osteonecrosis. The investigators want to
      investigate the importance of an antiresorptive drug holiday (bisphosphonate, denosumab) in
      relation to tooth extraction.

      The aim of this trial is therefore to clarify the meaning of high-dose antiresorptive drug
      holiday related to tooth extraction with primary mucosal closure in cancer patients and
      reveal how a drug holiday affects the health related quality of life. A continuation of the
      patients' antiresorptive treatment can possibly lead to increased risk of osteonecrosis of
      the jaw, but with the operation procedure with primary closure it is unlikely. It is
      beneficial for the cancer patients to continue the high dose antiresorptive therapy because a
      drug holiday is a stop in their anti-cancer treatment with risk of increased pain as well as
      unwanted skeletal events to occur, and potentially progress of metastases to follow.
