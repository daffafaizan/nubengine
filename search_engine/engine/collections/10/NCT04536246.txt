      Sampling was taken between February 2016-2017 (1 year) in one orthopaedic center. The
      instruments used for evaluation are rolimeter and PRO questionnaires (IKDC, Tegner-Lysholm,
      and KOOS) with data mining between 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post operation.

      To obtain a valid and accountable research data, the investigators collected the information
      based on 2 parameters and then crosschecked the results.

      After clinical data was obtained, the investigators translate the results into a statistical
      data using SPSS ver.24 and simplified the data for national registry and academic purposes.

      According to previous studies, and research hypothesis, functional outcome of patient
      undergoing arthroscopic-assisted ACL reconstruction is better in BQT group compared to SBHT
      group, both in subjective and objective parameters given.
