      administered to general hospital inpatients with hyperglycemia favorably affects in-hospital
      complications and mortality, need for intensive care, or length of stay. The secondary aim is
      to determine if the magnitude of benefit derived from this therapy differs (a) in patients
      with known vs. newly diagnosed diabetes, or (b) in medical vs. surgical patients. The study
      will analyze data from a natural experiment that occurred when the applicant institution
      introduced universal physiologic insulin therapy as the standard of care for hyperglycemia. A
      quasi-experimental before-and-after study will compare in-hospital complications, mortality,
      and resource use in patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes before vs. after implementation of
      this standard (n≈6400). Outcomes measured at 7 nearby acute-care teaching hospitals during
      the same two time intervals will provide parallel control data (n≈35,000). Data from the
      control hospitals will make it possible to evaluate whether temporal changes in patient
      characteristics or other variables affecting hospitals in the region could explain effects
      that might otherwise be erroneously attributed to the intervention. Given the high prevalence
      of comorbid diabetes in the hospital and the possibility that universal physiologic insulin
      for managing hyperglycemia may not deliver the intended benefit or could even do more harm
      than good, answering this question is an important goal.
