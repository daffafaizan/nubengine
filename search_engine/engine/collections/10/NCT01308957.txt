      chronic illness, poor appetite and diet, and reduced physical activity. The ensuing decline
      in physical function is a major cause of frailty, disability and death. Treatments that can
      reverse or reduce the age-associated loss of muscle mass are therefore much needed. Evidence
      is emerging that consumption of fish or fish oil derived long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA) may be important for maintenance of muscle mass and physical function
      throughout the life-span. However, the effect of LCn-3PUFA supplementation on muscle mass,
      muscle strength and overall physical function is not known. The goal of this study therefore
      is to determine the effect of LCn-3PUFA supplementation on muscle mass, muscle strength and
      physical function in older adults.
