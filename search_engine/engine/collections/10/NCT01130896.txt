      the risk of clinically indicated MR imaging in patients with implantable cardiac devices. All
      devices will undergo a complete interrogation and testing of thresholds, sensing, battery
      voltage and impedances prior to and following imaging. Pre-MRI, devices will be programmed to
      setting that will ensure MRI safety. During imaging, patients will blood pressure, heart rate
      and O2 sat level will be monitored continuously.
