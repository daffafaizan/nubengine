      and the Medical Research Center of Connecticut/Yale-New Haven Hospital Langone Medical
      Center. Patients with IBS-D will be recruited from outpatient gastroenterology clinics at
      these institutions and referrals from the medical community.

      FMT capsules and placebo capsules, provided by OpenBiome, Medford, MA, will be used for this
      study. Patients will be randomized to undergo FMT using fecal capsules (experimental group)
      or placebo capsules (control group) via a computer-generated program. All patients will
      cross-over into the alternate arm of the study at 12 weeks. Therefore, all patients enrolled
      will receive the experimental drug during the course of the study. Each patient will be
      enrolled in the study for a total of 6 months.

      Intestinal microbiome analyses using DNA sequencing and non-cultivation-based approaches (16S
      DNA technology) will be performed in all patients in the experimental and control groups to
      assess stability of the microbiome over time.
