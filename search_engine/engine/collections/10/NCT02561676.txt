    
      Chronic pain (pain that is present for a long period of time) is common among people with
      spinal cord injury (SCI). The pain is often severe and can affect daily activities.
      Unfortunately, common treatments such as medications provide incomplete relief from chronic
      pain. Thus, persons with SCI have to find alternate ways to live a happy, healthy, and
      productive life, even with some pain.

      The purpose of this study is to compare how well two different web-based education programs
      reduce the level to which chronic pain interferes with daily activities and well-being.
