      patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including Progressive Non-fluent Aphasia (PNFA),
      Semantic Dementia (SD), patients with a disorder of social comportment and personality (SOC),
      and non-aphasic patients with executive dysfunction (EXEC). MRI studies of cortical atrophy
      and fMRI studies show correlated neural defects in FTD subgroups. The investigators will
      obtain converging evidence from multiple sources to test hypotheses about the neural basis
      for cognitive functions such as semantic memory, grammatical processing, and social
      functioning in these FTD subgroups, while improving clinical care for these patients. Recent
      studies have linked progressive supra nuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple systems atrophy (MSA)
      to FTD. The investigators will obtain comparable neuropsychological and biomarker data in
      order to compare these patient groups.
