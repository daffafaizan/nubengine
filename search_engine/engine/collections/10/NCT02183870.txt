      with adenocarcinoma of the lung harbouring ROS1 translocations. In individual treatment
      attempts and an ongoing phase I trial crizotinib has shown remarkable effects on this
      selected subgroup of lung cancer patients. Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
      blocking the catalytic activity of rearranged ALK and ROS1 as well as MET. The patients
      eligible for the trial will be treated with 250mg crizotinib twice-daily. Tumor response to
      treatment will be assessed every 6 weeks by CT or MRI scans. In case of progression treatment
      beyond may be conducted if clinically indicated. To identify mechanisms of resistance to
      crizotinib treatment, an optional re-biopsy may be performed in these cases and fresh frozen
      tumor material will analyzed at the University of Cologne.
