      implementation of target skin markers. On this scanner, it is often difficult for the
      radiation therapist to pinpoint the target volume. To improve the definition of the target
      volume, image fusion techniques with other imaging tests were developed.

      To improve the pre-radiotherapy identification, setting up markers echo-endoscopy has been
      described without major complications. The impact on targeting radiotherapy was mainly
      described for the prostate.

      The marking of digestive tumors was described by the establishment of Trustees, radiopaque
      markers in the lymph nodes, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and bile ducts.
