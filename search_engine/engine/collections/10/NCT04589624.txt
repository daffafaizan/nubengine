    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To obtain pilot metabolic imaging data from hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging
      (hpMRI) methods in patients with thyroid tumors receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and/or
      systemic therapy (e.g., target therapy, checkpoint inhibitors).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess early metabolic changes in response to nonsurgical therapy, including
      standard-of-care fractionated XRT and/or systemic therapy.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Healthy volunteers undergo MRI over 30 minutes.

      ARM II: Patients with thyroid cancer undergo hpMRI over 30 minutes at baseline, and at 1 week
      after the initiation of treatment. During the scan, patients also receive hyperpolarized
      13-C-pyruvate intravenously (IV) over 30 seconds and may receive a standard MRI contrast
      agent at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study intervention, thyroid cancer patients are followed up at 1 day.
