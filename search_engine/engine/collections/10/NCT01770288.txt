      anti-nociceptive properties of the individual and the anaerobic-evoke pro-nociceptive
      activity in determining the maximal performance during anaerobic exercise. Moreover, the
      interaction between psychological factors and pro- and anti- nociceptive processes that are
      operated during anaerobic exercise, need to be investigated.

      Methods: Forty healthy men and women, between the ages of 18-40 will be involved in the
      study. Each participant will complete 3 psychological questionnaires regarding their
      personality traits: Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and
      Perceived Stress Questionnaire. Pain psychophysics tests will be used for evaluating the
      individual pain perception, prior and subsequent to the anaerobic exercise: (1) DNIC will be
      tested using a paradigm of two remote noxious stimuli with one, the 'conditioning stimulus'
      (immersing the hand in tub containing 8Â°c water), inhibiting the other, the 'test pain'
      (pressure pain threshold) in order to assess the endogenous analgesia (EA) efficiency (2)
      heat and pressure pain thresholds, and (3) temporal summation of painful heat and mechanical
      stimuli that reflect the neuroplasticity of the central nervous system following peripheral
      noxious stimulation. In addition, Anaerobic performance will be evaluated during Wingate
      test,and blood lactate will be measured. Gene related pain ill be tested using saliva samples
      .
