      infusion of saline for 1 hour is compared with infusion of GLP-1 0.7 and 1.2 pmol per kg
      minute for another 1 hour. Plasma GLP-1 and GLP-2 is measured by RIA. Responses to GLP-1 will
      be measured after food intake as prandial response to GLP-1. The outcome will be evaluated as
      change in motility index from baseline to meal-stimulated conditions and during influence of
      GLP-1. Further in vitro studies of gastrointestinal muscle strips, precontracted with
      bethanechol or electric field stimulation, are planned to investigate the response to GLP-1
      or GLP-1 analogue ROSE-010. GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptor immunoreactivity is localized by
      immunohistochemistry. Receptor mediated mechanisms are studied with GLP-1 receptor blocker
      exendin(9-39)amide, nitro-monomethyl arginine to block nitric oxide synthase and tetrodotoxin
      to block sodium channels and nerve conduction.
