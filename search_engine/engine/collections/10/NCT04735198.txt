      tumor (jejunum, ileum or proximal colon) who require primary tumor surgery. Randomized, proof
      of concept clinical trial.

      Background: The prevalence of midgut NET has increased due to advances in diagnostic tests
      and its indolent course. When patients are diagnosed, they might be tributary to surgical
      treatment requiring an extensive bowel resection, and medical treatment with somatostatin
      analogs. Both treatments are related with gallbladder stone formation. The ENETS and NANETs
      recommend prophylactic cholecystectomy in patients with midgut NET who require primary tumor
      surgery, However, there is a lack of scientific evidence reinforcing this recommendation.

      Objectives: The main objective is to evaluate the cumulated incidence rate of biliary stone
      disease in patients with midgut NET who require primary tumor resection, two years after the
      surgery.

      Design: It's a multicentric, open-label and randomized clinical trial. Patients will be
      recruited from the General Surgery Services of the six Hospitals participating in the study.
      Patients must fullfill inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      It is expected to recruit a maximum of one hundred patients in two years (50 per group).
      Patients will be randomly assigned into the Experimental group (primary tumor resections) or
      Control group (primary tumor resections combined with cholecystectomy). The investigators
      will follow up patients until week 104 after surgery (8 visits).
