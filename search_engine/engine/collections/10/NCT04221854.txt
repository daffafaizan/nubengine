    
      A large cohort of participants will be asked to collect stool sample for either Stool-based
      SDC2 DNA Methylation Test or Fecal Immunochemical Test. Subjects who have positive results
      will undergo colonoscopy within 6 months.

      Representative histopathology slides from tissue biopsied or excised during colonoscopy and
      those from subsequent definitive surgery may be retrieved in order to be evaluated by
      pathologists to confirm the diagnosis and staging.
