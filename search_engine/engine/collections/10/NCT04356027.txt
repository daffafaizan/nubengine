      lesions pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and (optional) post-PCI procedure, and
      the corresponding pressure tracings and physiology indices. Up to 30 centers in the US will
      enroll approximately 310 patients. The expected duration of enrollment is approximately 15
      months. The total duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be approximately 27
      months.
