      pronounced, delayed rehabilitation and an increase in the total cost for nursing and
      treatment.

      Experimental studies has shown that infusion of remifentanil over some period of time, can
      result in acute opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia (1-2).

      One clinical trial has shown that intraoperative infusion of remifentanil gives acute opioid
      tolerance with subsequent increased postoperative pain and increased opioid consume
      postoperative (3).

      The development of opioid tolerance probably has several mechanisms. One topical mechanism is
      opioid induced influence of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor and its intracellular
      second-messenger-systems. This results in central sensitization to pain stimulus in the
      dorsal horn and the brain (4-5), with following development of hyperalgesia.

      Several strategies can be successful to reduce or prevent opioid induced hyperalgesia, for
      example NMDA-receptor antagonists, alfa-2 agonists, opioid rotation or combination of opioids
      with different receptor selectivity (6-8).

      The theoretical background for pre-treating the opioid receptor with an other opioid
      (fentanyl) that gives less tendency to hyperalgesia than remifentanil, is that it can reduce
      the development of tolerance and hyperalgesia of remifentanil.

      The aim of this trial is to examine the possibility that i.v. administration of fentanyl 1,5
      µgr/kg before start of remifentanil infusion for anesthesia gives less development of
      tolerance/hyperalgesia postoperative than fentanyl given in the end of surgery (the
      traditional method).

      This is to be measured by less pain postoperative (VAS, visual analog scale, and a five point
      verbal rating scale) and less fentanyl consumed (measured by using PCA).
