      women that histology was similar between biopsies and hysterectomy in only 67% of cases.
      Others studies conclude thatit is difficult to conclude about focal disease with blind
      biopsies.

      A study compared blind biopsies to biopsy performed under hysteroscopic guidance in women
      using Tamoxifene and conclude that guided biopsies were more specific (80% versus 68.9%) and
      a better positive predictive value (68.9% versus 43.7%) for all kind of endometrial
      pathologies
