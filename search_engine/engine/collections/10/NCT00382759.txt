      mg/m2 x 3-5 days) and 200 cCy TBI followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) from a matched-sibling donor.

      Neutrophil recovery occurred in 89% of the patients at a median time of 15 days. On day +30,
      10 patients had > 95% donor chimerism, and 21 patients had mixed chimerism. The cumulative
      probabilities of grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD were 51% and 84% respectively.
      Transplant-related mortality at 100 days and 1 year was 5% and 9% respectively. The
      probabilities of 1-year overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 55% and 47%
      respectively. The estimated 1-year probability of OS and PFS for patients in early disease
      stages were 87% and 74% respectively , which were significantly higher than the survival and
      PFS estimates of 12% obtained in patients with advanced disease stages at the time of
      transplant
