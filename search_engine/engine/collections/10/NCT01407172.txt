      groups of patients:

        1. Patients without PAD as defined by ABI>0.9 and <1.3.

        2. Patients with asymptomatic PAD as defined by ABI<0.9 but no symptoms

        3. Patient with symptomatic PAD as defined by the presence of typical or atypical
           claudication symptoms or critical limb ischemia in conjunction with ABI <0.9.

      This will be a single center study performed at LSUHSC-Shreveport. Patients undergoing
      cardiac catheterization or peripheral angiogram via a major arterial approach at the LSUHSC
      cardiac catheterization laboratory meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      eligible and given an opportunity to participate. Those providing informed consent will be
      interviewed for the presence of claudication symptoms, by use of the San Diego Claudication
      Questionnaire and the presence of known risk factors for PAD. The medical record will be
      reviewed for collection of baseline clinical data including known risk factors for vascular
      disease as well as medications etc. Ankle Brachial Index will be measured by the standard
      technique of non-invasive measurement of bilateral arm and ankle pressures and recorded in
      all patients.

      Plasma free H2S level quantification via high performance liquid gas chromatography, as well
      as plasma nitrite levels and nitric oxide levels by chemiluminescence assay will be
      performed.
