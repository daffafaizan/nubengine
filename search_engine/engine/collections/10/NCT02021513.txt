      patients. This study is a single blind placebo-controlled pilot for SLE patients with 25
      scheduled to receive omega-3 (EPA 2.25g/DHA 2.25g) daily and 25 scheduled to receive placebo
      (olive oil), for 6 months. Pre and post supplementation assessments will be made to determine
      if EPA and DHA levels increase, and if the levels of lipid peroxidation products, other
      cellular energy intermediates, and inflammatory markers are affected by EPA/DHA.
      Additionally, lupus disease activity, fatigue, quality of life, and diet will be assessed to
      determine if these parameters are related to the metabolome in SLE.

        -  Aim 1:

           - To determine if the metabolomic disturbances of lupus patients improve following
           supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids.

        -  Aim 2:

             -  To determine if lupus disease activity, fatigue, and quality of life improve and
                are related to the metabolomic profile changes.
