      tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain at the branching point of the superolateral branch
      (slMFB) from the main medial forebrain bundle (MFB).

      The exact stimulation coordinates are:

      MNI152 coordinates:

      left: x(lat.)=-5, y(ap)=-14, z(vert.)=-8 right: x(lat.)=5, y(ap)=-14, z(vert.)=-9

      MCP coordinates:

      eft: x(lat.)=-6, y(ap)=-1, z(vert.)=-6 right: x(lat.)=4, y(ap)=-1, z(vert.)=-7

      All coordinates refer to the MNI152 brain. Legend: slMFB = superolateral branch of medial
      forebrain bundle, MNI152=Montreal Neurologic Institute brain 152 coordinates, MCP =
      mid-commissural point coordinates, lat. = lateral, ap= antero-posterior, vert. = vertical.

      In addition to the described intervention, we will record EEG activity within the implanted
      regions during cognitive paradigms (Fell and Axmacher, Nat Rev Neurosci 2011). Specifically,
      we will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying classification learning, working memory
      and exploration of rewarded spatial locations and explore oscillatory responses following
      stimulation of the target regions. These experimental paradigms will be conducted on the
      first day after electrode implantation.
