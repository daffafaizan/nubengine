      (percentage rate) in the intervention arm as compared to the control arm. One secondary
      endpoint is to compare the rate of MRSA disease (number of infections per 1,000 patients and
      10,000 patient days) in the intervention and control arms. The other secondary endpoint is to
      determine the cost of MRSA screening and decolonization and compare it to the cost of MRSA
      disease treatment (both medication cost and the expense of any needed hospitalization for
      therapy of MRSA infection therapy) in the control arm. Achieving our primary goal of MRSA
      control will also demonstrate two secondary goals wthe investigators aim to achieve: one
      being that a scientific, planned approach to the issue of specific healthcare-associated
      infection in LTCFs can resolve these problems and the other that a partnership between acute
      and long-term care (e.g., ongoing relationship spanning at least 5 years) is beneficial in
      dealing with patient safety and quality practices across the United Sates Healthcare
      continuum.
