        -  To assess whether a reduced computed tomography (CT) schedule or magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) could be used as safe and effective alternatives to standard CT-based
           surveillance in the management of patients with stage I seminoma of the testis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 surveillance arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/retroperitoneum* at
           6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months in the absence of disease progression.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo CT scan of the abdomen/retroperitoneum* at 6, 18, and 36 months
           in the absence of disease progression.

        -  Arm III: Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
           abdomen/retroperitoneum* at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months in the absence of
           disease progression.

        -  Arm IV: Patients undergo MRI of the abdomen/retroperitoneum* at 6, 18, and 36 months in
           the absence of disease progression.

      NOTE: *Patients with a history of ipsilateral inguino-scrotal surgery also undergo imaging of
      the pelvis.

      Patients complete questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study to assess
      health-related quality of life; utilization and cost of healthcare services (including the
      cost of CT- or MRI-based surveillance and the management of any recurrence); and
      acceptability of allocated scanning schedule.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.
