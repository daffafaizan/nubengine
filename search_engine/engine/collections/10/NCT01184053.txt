    
      This is an open-label, single arm, single institution, phase II trial designed to assess the
      response rate and safety of Trisenox速 in women with recurrent endometrial carcinoma.
      Trisenox速 will be administered at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days (D1-5)
      every 4 weeks. A 4-week period will be defined as a cycle of treatment. Marker and non-marker
      lesions will be assessed every 2 cycles (every 8 weeks) and the response assigned according
      to Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) RECIST guidelines. Safety will be assessed by routine
      physical, laboratory and ECG evaluations. Up to 10 patients will be enrolled into the study.
      Patients are expected (excluding any unforeseen toxicities) to receive a minimum of 2 and a
      maximum of 6 cycles of Trisenox速. (Patients with at least documented stable disease may be
      eligible for >6 cycles). Patients will be followed for 6 months after their last dose of
      Trisenox速.

      For this trial we would allow one prior cytotoxic regimen since the time of recurrence and
      patients may have had one prior regimen as part of their induction chemotherapy. Patients
      will be treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day for days 1-5 every 28 days and patients may remain on
      trial until progression of disease.
