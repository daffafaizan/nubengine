    
      This is a double blind randomized controlled trial of Ortho tricyclen™ vs. Trinessa™ (generic
      equivalent) to determine if they have similar effects on bleeding patterns, namely days of
      menstrual flow, amount of bleeding, and intermenstrual bleeding. Women will score these
      parameters using a survey with objective measures for days of bleeding, amount of flow, and
      days of breakthrough bleeding. As secondary outcomes, we will compare the side effect
      profiles of each in regards to nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, menstrual cramps, mood
      changes, and thromboembolic events.

      Patients will record in their daily diary if one of the outcomes occurs or not. We will
      observe whether the events occur and the number of occurrences within the six month time
      period.
