      with a portable telemedicine system. In cases of emergencies, where intravenous analgesia is
      necessary, the paramedics can use this system to contact a so called "tele-EMS physician"
      after consent of the patient is obtained. The tele-EMS physician has an audio-connection to
      the EMS team and receives vital parameters (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood
      pressure) in real-time. The transmission of still pictures - taken with a smartphone - and
      video streaming from the inside of the ambulance can be carried out, if meaningful. The
      tele-EMS physician supports the EMS team and can delegate the application of morphine and
      other analgesics. This can be carried out to bridge the time to the arrival of an EMS
      physician or in less severe cases without an EMS physician on-scene.

      All regular ambulances of the five districts are not allowed to administer analgesics without
      an physician on-scene. They have to call an Advanced Life Support response unit, staffed with
      an EMS physician, who carries out all kinds of ALS interventions.

      The safety, efficacy and the quality of analgesia should be compared with regular EMS.
