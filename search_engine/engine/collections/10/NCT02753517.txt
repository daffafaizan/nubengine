    
      The main aim of the study is to determine the predictive value of (99m)Tc-mebrofenin
      hepatobiliary scintigraphy in assessing the postoperative risk of liver failure within 3
      months of extended hepatectomy of 4 or more segments in noncirrhotic liver. The main endpoint
      is the three-months postoperative liver failure, defined as an increased International
      Normalized Ratio (INR) and concomitant hyperbilirubinemia (according to the normal limits of
      the local laboratory) on or after postoperative day 5 according to the international
      classification of the ISGLS (International Study Group of Liver Surgery) and classified
      according to its severity in grade A (no change of the patient's clinical management), grade
      B (deviation from the regular course but without invasive therapy) and grade C (invasive
      treatment)

      Secondary objectives are:

      To determine the predictive value of (99m)Tc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy in
      assessing the risk of postoperative morbi-mortality (according to Clavien-Dindo
      classification) within 3 months of extended hepatectomy of 4 or more segments in noncirrhotic
      liver, and the duration of intensive care unit stay and of hospitalization.

        -  To assess the correlation between the results of the hepatobiliary scintigraphy and the
           presence of parenchymal abnormalities such as steatosis, fibrosis or
           chemotherapy-induced injuries (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, steatohepatitis) at the
           histological analysis of the non tumoral liver parenchyma.

        -  To assess the sensitivity of hepatobiliary scintigraphy in jaundiced patients who had a
           preoperative biliary endoscopic or radiologic drainage, considering the existing
           competition between mebrofenin and bilirubin on hepatic receptors.

        -  To analyse the inter-centre reproducibility of the hepatobiliary scintigraphy (Central
           review by the principal investigator of 25 scintigraphy examinations per centre)
