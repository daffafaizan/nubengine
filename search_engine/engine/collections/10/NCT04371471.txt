      systemic inflammation are two key responses. Along with hypotension, this triad can lead to
      end-organ failure and death in critical illness. In critical illness, serum cortisol is
      dissociated from its tissular activity. We have developed a formula that calculates tissular
      action of cortisol called the cortisol index. It correlates in chronic ambulatory illness,
      and acute illness such as myocardial infarction (manuscript pending). Elevated neutrophil to
      lymphocyte ration (NLR) is a marker of systemic inflammation and predictor of mortality on
      admission to the emergency department. We have confirmed this in a retrospective and
      prospective study (manuscript pending, data available upon request).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a triage score (STC-19) based on patients'
      biological state at the time of diagnosis, to objectively determine which patients are most
      likely to require intensive medical services within 24-48 hours of presentation of the
      emergency department.
