      laboratory settings as the result of accidental releases of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas (e.g.
      in the case of fire) or salts in the case of suicide attempts.

      In fact, cyanide poisoning is considerably more common than is generally appreciated.
      Multiple clinical [1-4] and post-mortal studies [5-10] have demonstrated that HCN contributes
      to the toxicity of fire smoke.

      Cyanide acts primarily through its strong affinity for the iron-containing heme moiety,
      binding to numerous critical enzyme systems in the body and rendering them inactive [11]. Of
      late, increasing attention has been paid to the relationship of cyanide and nitric oxide. The
      interactions appear to be complex, with cyanide inducing nitric oxide production by binding
      to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [12], as well as binding to nitric oxide synthase.
      The latter may be overcome by the presence of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.

      Probably, the majority of the cyanide poisoning cases are due to smoke inhalation in
      closed-space fires.

      So far, there are no clear data available on the prevalence of cyanide poisoning in smoke
      inhalation.

      This information would be of great interest for all emergency physicians since a proven or
      supposed cyanide poisoning does not only requires an intensive supportive care, including the
      administration of supplemental oxygen and artificial ventilation, blood pressure support, and
      anticonvulsants, but also a rapid administration of a cyanide antidote.

      Therefore, it is the goal of this survey to assess the prevalence of cyanide poisoning in
      smoke inhalation victims. Only the data of patients with a cyanide measurement before
      specific antidote treatment will be included.
