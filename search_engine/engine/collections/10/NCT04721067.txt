      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on changes in circulating levels of hsCRP at 24 weeks in
      virologically-suppressed, HIV-positive adults with insomnia, defined as having an Insomnia
      Severity Index (ISI) score â‰¥ 11. Secondary objectives include comparing changes in hsCRP at
      12 weeks, changes in other circulating inflammation biomarkers (IL-6, sCD14, sCD163,
      CD14+CD16+ monocytes) at both 12 and 24 weeks, and ISI scores and other self-reported patient
      outcomes at both 12 and 24 weeks.
