    
      Controversy currently exists regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic steroid therapy for
      patients considered at high risk for post-extubation stridor. Studies regarding the efficacy
      of prophylactic corticosteroids for intubated patients have yielded conflicting results due
      to differences in the number, dose, or type of corticosteroids administered.

      Only a limited number of prospective trials involving adults and evaluating the benefits and
      the dose of corticosteroid therapy prior to extubation have been conducted.The present study
      was conducted to evaluate the effects of prophylactic dexamethasone therapy for a subset of
      high-risk patients who had been intubated for > 48 hours and who were undergoing their first
      elective extubation in an ICU setting.
