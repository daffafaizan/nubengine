      The first assessment will take place when they are 6-12 months post the end of treatment.
      Participants and their parents/legal guardian will complete an assessment of social and
      cognitive functioning by completing questionnaires about social, emotional, behavioral, and
      executive functioning. If the study participant agrees, they will identify another adult
      (that is, teacher or daycare employee) who may be contacted to complete questionnaires about
      the participant's social and behavioral functioning. A follow-up study visit will occur about
      two years later.
