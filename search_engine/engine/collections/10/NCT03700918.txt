      pre-set stakes array and internal adjustment cord that can be adjusted at a later stage after
      the outer layer of the ring and stakes are encapsulated in new tissue growth. Once implanted,
      the ring is designed to serve as a foundation for promoting new annular tissue growth,
      effectively growing a new adjustable annulus around the valve.
