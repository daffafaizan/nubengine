      waves, especially the gamma frequency (~30 - 100 Hz) waves. Recently, the investigators' lab
      found that gamma entrainment using light and sound stimulation, which the investigators call
      GENUS, improves memory and decreases toxic accumulation of amyloid and tau in AD mouse
      models. This study aims to translate these findings in the mouse models to be used in mild
      Alzheimer's patients. The investigators will recruit 40 patients diagnosed with mild AD who
      will be randomly assigned to two study arms. Cognitive and mental health evaluations as well
      as memory tests will be performed on all subjects. All subjects will also be exposed to the
      GENUS device, which can deliver light and sound waves at different frequencies. The GENUS
      device is composed of a panel with light-emitting diode (LED) illumination and speakers for
      auditory stimulation. Each of the 2 groups will have different combinations of light and
      sound settings. The investigators will use electroencephalography (EEG) to check for how the
      participant's brain waves respond to the stimulation, and use questionnaires to evaluate for
      safety and tolerability.
