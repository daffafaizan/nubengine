      engaged in mindfulness meditation or physical activities for five weeks. They performed from
      15 to 30 minutes during their lunch breaks. The investigators randomly assigned participants
      to three experimental conditions: 1) mindfulness meditation, 2) physical activity, 3) control
      group (lunch break as usual). Online questionnaires before and after intervention assessed
      long term changes regarding recovery processes, perceived stress, health, mindfulness and
      burnout. For daily changes, a mobile application was developed to assess changes once per day
      immediately after work. The investigators also collect saliva samples to map cortisol and
      immunoglobulin A excretion across the intervention period. The investigators had two
      follow-up measures one and six months after the intervention.
