    
      This is an in vivo study using serial IM testosterone undeconate injections in participants
      undergoing knee surgery with limited weight bearing post-operatively which includes
      partial/total knee replacement, ACL reconstruction/revision, meniscal allograft
      transplantation and articular cartilage paste grafting. The design is a randomized,
      controlled, double blind, longitudinal study of intra-muscular injections of testosterone
      versus saline control. Pre-operative and post-operative assessments will include: serial MRIs
      and manual measurements of quadriceps cross-section and knee pain and function survey, KOOS.
      Blood analysis will be performed for therapeutic assessment and safety. The participant will
      receive two testosterone undeconate injections, once during their pre-operative visit and
      once during their 1 month visit. Timing of assessments will be pre-operative, 1-4 days
      post-operative and 1, 3, and 6 months. Measurement of the control group versus experimental
      group at all time points may identify differences in participant response to testosterone
      injections.
