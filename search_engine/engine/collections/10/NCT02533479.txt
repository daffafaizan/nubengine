      trial for 1 month. The participants follow a caloric restriction, 30-40% respect to the usual
      diet of each participant, three alternate days weekly along 4 weeks. After the caloric
      restriction period the participants realized an exercise stress test. For each participant
      one blood sample and muscular biopsy were obtained after acute exercise and caloric
      restriction intervention. All the participants were informed of the purpose and demands of
      the study before giving their written consent to participate. The study protocol was in
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for research on human participants and was
      approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Consell Catal√† de l'Esport.
