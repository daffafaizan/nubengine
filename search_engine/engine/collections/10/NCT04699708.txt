      neonatal transition have not been studied. Volume ventilation in the Neonatal unit has been
      shown to improve outcomes such BPD or death. Despite the proven benefits of volume
      ventilation in the neonatal unit volume guided resuscitation at birth remains an unproven and
      under-studied technique.

      CO2 data, serving as a proxy marker for tidal volume, might enable titration of tidal
      volume/pressure thereby providing optimal ventilation during neonatal resuscitation.
      Currently there is insufficient data on Co2 levels for preterm babies requiring
      resuscitation. This data would help in finding out optimal resuscitation strategies
      (Pressures/volume, frequency of breaths) rather than providing the same for all infants
      throughout the process of resuscitation and would help us in better interpretation Co2 levels
      in the future resuscitation.

      Investigators aim to study the impact of various clinical (Gestation, Birth weight, need for
      intubation/bag-mask ventilation) and resuscitative factors (use of inflation pressures,
      ventilation pressures, frequency of breaths, face mask ventilation, intubation) on CO2 during
      preterm stabilisation.
