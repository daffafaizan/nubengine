      subcutaneously administered unacylated ghrelin in people with PAD. The results of this pilot
      study may be used to design a randomized trial of unacylated ghrelin, in subsequent study, to
      improve functioning and prevent mobility loss in older people with PAD.

      In our primary specific aims, we will 1) establish the association of increasing doses of
      subcutaneous unacylated ghrelin with circulating levels of unacylated ghrelin 2) assess the
      safety of increasing doses of subcutaneously administered unacylated ghrelin in six patients
      with PAD age 55 and older. We will relate peak and Area Under the Curve values of unacylated
      ghrelin to brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) values. To achieve these aims, six
      PAD participants age 55 and older will receive a single subcutaneous injection of unacylated
      ghrelin at doses of 10 ug/kg, 20 ug/kg, and 40 ug/kg, respectively, on three separate days at
      least one week apart. Unacylated ghrelin levels will be measured at baseline and at defined
      intervals after each subcutaneous injection (30 minutes, 60 minutes, 1.5 hours, 3 hours, 6
      hours, 8 to 12 hours and 24 hours). Brachial artery FMD will be measured at baseline, before
      the unacylated ghrelin injection, approximately six hours, and 24 hours after each unacylated
      ghrelin injection. Blood will be collected and stored for potential later analyses of
      circulating biomarkers, such as inflammatory biomarkers.

      This is a Phase I study to guide dose finding for a pilot study of unacylated ghrelin in
      people with PAD.
