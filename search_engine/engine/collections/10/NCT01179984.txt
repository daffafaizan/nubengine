    
      Single-arm, non-randomized, prospective, multi-center study using the Bard速 LifeStent速
      Vascular Stent Delivery System in subjects with lifestyle-limiting claudication or ischemic
      rest pain that are candidates for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting
      with lesion(s) in the infra-inguinal segment (superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or
      proximal popliteal artery). Subjects will be treated with PTA followed by implantation of the
      Bard速 LifeStent速 Vascular Stent.

      Clinical follow-up for all subjects will be performed prior to hospital discharge, 30-days,
      and 12-, 24-, and 36-months post-index procedure.
