      the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of HIV, HCV infection has
      emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HCV/HIV coinfected patients. One
      infection often accelerates the progression of the other, and effective management strategies
      for both infections need to be developed for HCV/HIV coinfected patients. This study will
      determine whether HIV ART followed by HCV therapy taken concurrently with ART results in
      better treatment outcomes compared to HCV therapy alone.

      This study will last up to 102 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      arms. Arm A participants will receive 24 to 30 weeks of ART consisting of tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) and either efavirenz (EFV) or
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). If deemed eligible, Arm A participants will continue their ART
      regimen and begin a concurrent PEG/RBV regimen for up to 48 weeks. At Week 48, participants
      in Arm A will stop PEG/RBV and will be followed for an additional 24 weeks on ART alone.

      Arm B participants will receive PEG/RBV alone for up to 48 weeks. At Week 48, participants in
      Arm B will be followed for an additional 48 weeks with no treatment.

      There will be 20 study visits over 102 weeks for Arm A participants and 18 study visits over
      96 weeks for Arm B participants. Blood collection and clinical assessment will occur at all
      visits, and urine collection will occur at selected visits. Participants will also be asked
      to complete adherence questionnaires. Participants in this study are encouraged to also
      enroll in ACTG A5128.
