    
      Medical institutions or physicians will be asked to periodically complete the survey forms
      for all patients registered. Survey forms include baseline information available, and then
      data collected every 6 months, as available including: demographic information, concomitant
      medications/therapy, treatment record, ECG, Echocardiogram, computed tomography scan /
      magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), Fabry symptoms, labs, functional disorder, blood
      concentration of GL-3, and anti-agalsidase beta antibody test (IgE testing) to survey whether
      the productions of antibodies to agalsidase beta is a causal factor of treatment-related
      reactions.

      The survey period shall be approximately 7 years from June 1, 2004 during which survey shall
      be undertaken as follows:

        -  The observation period for each patient shall range from 1 to about 7 years after
           starting treatment

        -  Registration period: June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2010

        -  Survey period: June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2011

      In institutions for which retrospective surveys are feasible, the survey period will trace
      back to the date of approval (January 29, 2004), as far as possible.
