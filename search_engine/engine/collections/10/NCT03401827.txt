      that the improvement of clinical outcome due to anticancer drugs is not clear compared to
      other carcinomas. In particular, the 5-year survival rate of metastatic pancreatic cancer is
      still only about 2%, and the clinical results have improved somewhat with the combination
      therapy of chemotherapy as the first-line treatment. However, effective secondary
      chemotherapy after these first-line treatment failures is limited. Meta-analysis has reported
      that life expectancy is significantly increased in patients receiving second-line
      chemotherapy after failure of primary chemotherapy. However, it is not yet clear which cancer
      treatment is most effective. In the NCCN guideline (ver. 2017.2), the second trial of
      chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer is the most recommended
      clinical trial.Recently, FOLFIRINOX has been used in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic cancer who have good performance in Korea. The response rate of the
      treatment is 30%, and many patients require secondary chemotherapy. In a practice guideline
      published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel(GnP) is
      the only recommended combination for patients failing primary treatment with FOLFIRINOX. In
      light of the results of previous reports, the efficacy of GnP as a second-line treatment
      after FOLFIRINOX may be expected to be considerable, but there is a lack of studies reporting
      GnP therapy on the second line after FOLFIRINOX failure as a first-line treatment. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the efficacy of GnP as a second-line treatment after failed
      FOLFIRINOX treatment for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
