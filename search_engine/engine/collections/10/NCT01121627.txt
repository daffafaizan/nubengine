      disease that influences not only the motor but also the cognitive and autonomic systems. The
      main cognitive impairment in individuals with PD is found in executive function (EF). EF is
      defined as a set of cognitive skills necessary for planning, monitoring and executing
      sequences of complex activities. Previous studies have revealed some relation between
      cognitive states and physical functions in healthy adults. Few studies have examined the
      effect of computer-based cognitive training on various populations. These studies showed a
      positive emotional-cognitive effect in those populations. This type of intervention plan was
      also applied to PD patients. However, there are no reports on the effect of intentional
      cognitive training on gait functions. The purpose of the study is to assess whether cognitive
      training, designed to improve EF ability, can also improve gait function in PD patients.
