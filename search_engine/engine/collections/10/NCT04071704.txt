      computerized search of the academic literature will be performed to identify all relevant
      HRQoL issues for and existing HRQoL questionnaires currently used among patients with
      sarcoma. In parallel, semi-structured interviews will be conducted worldwide with patients
      with sarcoma(N=154) and health care professionals (HCPs; N=30; phase 1a). The patient sample
      will be stratified to capture diversity across the sarcoma population tumour location
      (extremities, axial, head and neck, thorax, retroperitoneal/intra-abdominal and
      gynecological), stage (localized vs. metastatic disease ) and type or lines of treatment .

      This list of HRQoL issues generated by the a) literature search, b) relevant items from the
      Item Library, and c) semi-structured patient and HCP interviews, and will be consolidated
      into a comprehensive list of issues for all languages of collaborating countries.

      In phase 1b, the new list of HRQoL issues will be presented to another group of patients with
      sarcoma(N=475) and HCPs (N=30). Patients and HCPs will be asked to rate the HRQoL issues on
      relevance (4point Likert scale) and to prioritize the 25 most important issues.
