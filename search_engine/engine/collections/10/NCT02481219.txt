    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, consecutive, randomized study. Average-risk subjects
      undergoing CCE without optical colonoscopy will be consecutively enrolled and randomized 1:1
      to receive one of two bowel preparation regimens prior to PillCam CCE.

      Subjects will be enrolled at 5-10 clinical sites in the United States. Subjects who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be screened for study participation at a baseline visit and will be
      evaluated on the procedure day or until capsule excretion. A telephone follow-up will be
      conducted 5 to 9 days post-capsule ingestion to verify capsule excretion, assess patient
      well-being, and capture any adverse events.
