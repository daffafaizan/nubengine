      and immediate effectiveness of single or multiple rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids and
      because in the literature consulted no study was found that addressed economical features
      comparing single with multiple rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids, this study was designed
      to compare, in a double blinded, randomized and controlled model, the results of single
      hemorrhoidal ligation in three sessions with triple hemorrhoidal in a sole session in terms
      of immediate effectiveness, patient satisfaction and costs.

      Patients enrolled in the study, after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, signed the
      consent form, and responded to a questionaire about epidemiological data and hemorrhoidal
      symptoms, are (and will be) randomly allocated to one of the two arms of the study: G1: a
      single major hemorrhoidal group is ligated in each of three sessions of hemorrhoidal
      ligation, while the two other hemorrhoidal groups are submitted to sham ligation (a McGown
      aspirating type of hemorrhoidal ligator is employed); G2: all three major hemorrhoidal groups
      are ligated in the first session of treatment and in the next two sessions only sham
      ligations are performed. Three sessions of hemorrhoidal and/or sham ligation are performed in
      all patients, each spaced by one month from the other. A final consultation is held 1 month
      after the third ligation session in order to gather all the results of the treatment.

      After each session of hemorrhoidal ligation patients receive a chart containing a modified
      level of pain scale (Wong & Baker) and are asked to indicate pain level (from 0 to 5: 0 = no
      pain, 5 = unbearable pain) at fixed intervals (immediate post-ligation, 12 h post-ligation,
      24 h post-ligation and each other day until 7 days post-ligation). Investigators gather this
      information about pain, and patient well-being post-ligations, from 8 programmed telephone
      calls to the patients after each session of hemorrhoidal (or sham) ligation.

      Three months after the first session of hemorrhoidal ligation all patients are examined in
      order to observe treatment effectiveness and gather data about complications, patient
      satisfaction, number of days of occupational absenteeism linked to each session of treatment
      and number of analgesic pills necessary for pain relief.

      Comparative costs of each modality of ligation are raised taking into consideration the
      salaries of health professionals involved in the treatment, the salaries of the patients
      (calculation of absenteeism), the value of consumables used in each session of effective
      ligation, the depreciation price of permanent material employed and the price of medications
      patients have to buy.

      Patients are blinded to the modality of hemorrhoidal ligation employed and the statistician
      does not know the nature of each treatment group.
