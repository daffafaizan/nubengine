    
      The study is designed as a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial to
      provide evidence on the effects of vildagliptin on key biomarkers of atherothrombosis and
      inflammation. The investigators plan to prospectively enroll 80 patients with proven coronary
      artery disease ,Diabetes type2 and randomize them in a 1:1 ratio to either
      vildagliptin-metformin therapy (n=40) or glimepiride /metformin therapy (n=40).

        1. All participants agreed to take part in this clinical study and provide informed
           consent.

        2. Patients with Coronary artery diseases.and uncontrolled Diabetes type2 who's taking
           metformin only will be enrolled (n=80) from endocrinology clinic at Alexandria Armed
           Forces hospital.

        3. Complete physical, laboratory, radiological assessment will be done for all patients to
           exclude any signs of inflammation or thrombosis.

        4. Serum samples will be collected for measuring the biomarkers.

        5. All enrolled patients will be mentioned as two groups; Group I (n=40) are patients who
           the endocrinologist prescribed them vildagliptin plus their metformin to control their
           blood sugar level. Group II (n=40) are patients who the endocrinologist prescribed them
           glimepiride plus their metformin.

        6. All patients will be followed up during 3 months' period.

        7. At the end of 3 months on the new regimen, steps 4 and 5 will be repeated.

        8. Statistical tests appropriate to the study design will be conducted to evaluate the
           significance of the results.

        9. Measuring outcome: The primary outcome is the change of serum levels of the measured
           inflammatory markers after 3 months.

       10. Results, conclusion, discussion and recommendations will be given.
