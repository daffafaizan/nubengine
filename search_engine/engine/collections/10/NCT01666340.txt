      training on morbidity and mortality. Generation 100 will be the first randomized, controlled
      clinical study where the primary objective is to study the effects of exercise training on
      morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Furthermore, the researchers will investigate whether
      there is a relationship between the exercise intensity and health benefits, with particular
      focus on major health problems in the elderly population. In addition to being a study, this
      is also an initiative to improve public health in all healthy individuals between 70-75 years
      of age in the Trondheim municipality. The participants will either be randomized to
      supervised exercise or follow current guidelines for physical activity on their own. Clinical
      examinations, as well as questionnaires, will be administered to all participants at
      baseline, after one year, after three years, and after five years. Additionally, participants
      will be followed-up by linking to relevant registers for up to 20 years.

      Also data will be collected with the purposes of (a) investigating genetic predisposition for
      fitness and cardiovascular diseases, and (b) identification of potential targets for
      therapies.

      The study seeks to determine if exercise training gives the seniors a longer active and
      healthy life.
