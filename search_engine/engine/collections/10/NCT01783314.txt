      causes are chronic alcohol use and hepatitis C infection. The condition can progress to
      cirrhosis and liver failure, and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.
      Presently, biopsy remains the only reliable way to test whether the various treatments that
      have been proposed are working, but the risks of biopsy preclude frequent re-assessment.
      Hence, truly personalized treatments are hampered by the lack of a non-invasive, low-risk,
      but appropriately qualified test by which periodic assessments may be made.

      In July of 2008, the FDA approved a new drug called Eovist that is absorbed by liver cells
      and can be seen in the liver when performing an MRI. The amount and time course of Eovist
      absorption will be different between health and fibrotic liver tissue. We believe that these
      parameters, in combination with hematological and immunological blood tests, can predict the
      degree of liver fibrosis without the need for biopsy. This would allow improved assessment of
      potentially important interventions that might alter the course of the underlying disease.
      Thus development of this non-invasive biomarker might not only obviate the need for biopsy,
      but might in addition allow more intensive periodic assessments that are not possible
      currently.
