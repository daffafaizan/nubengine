      other surgeons trained to perform the procedure. Data collection will focus on post-operative
      wound failure, infection ratwes, analgesic requirements, time lost from work or school, wound
      care requirements, and 6 month recurrence rates. These outcomes will be compared to outcomes
      using conventional pilonidal surgical intervention using published data.
