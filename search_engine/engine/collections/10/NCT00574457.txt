      teaches instrumentation, scanning, measurement, quality assurance, and interpretation. They
      also will learn about CV risk assessment, intervention, and how to use an ultrasound-based CV
      risk stratification and treatment algorithm. After certification, each site will recruit 70
      patients from their practice (total N=350). Subjects will complete their routine office visit
      and a pre-test survey designed to assess motivation and intention to change. The physician's
      initial plan of action based on usual care will be recorded. Next, the subject will have a
      standardized CV risk carotid ultrasound. The physician will revise his/her treatment plan
      based on the scan results and an ultrasound-based risk assessment algorithm that includes CV
      risk factors and ultrasound data. Evidence-based treatment recommendations for lifestyle
      changes and risk factor targets will be provided. The physician's scan-based plan of action
      will be recorded. The subject will be informed of the results and repeat the survey. All
      images, interpretations, and recommendations will be reviewed by the UW AIRP.
