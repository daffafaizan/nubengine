      biofeedback group, patients will be instructed to control muscle activity, whereas in the
      placebo group patients will not. In each patient 3 sessions will be performed over a 10-day
      period. Physiological (muscular activity by EMG) and clinical outcomes (number of rumination
      events by questionnaries administered daily for 10 days) will be measured before and after
      treatment.
