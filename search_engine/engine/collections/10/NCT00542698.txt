      States. Although physical activity is a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes, it is
      difficult to change physical activity behaviors and up to 60% of individuals with diabetes do
      not participate in regular physical activity. The use of a nurse counseling intervention
      based on established behavior change theory with technology-derived graphical representations
      of glucose information created a unique opportunity to test the feasibility of motivating
      people with type 2 diabetes to change physical activity behaviors. The consent form described
      the study protocol, participant expectations, benefits, risks, and the process of maintaining
      participant confidentiality.
