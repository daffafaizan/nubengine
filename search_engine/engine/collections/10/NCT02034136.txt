    
      Methods : A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study in 60 subjects
      who are not taking drugs that could affect metabolic and vascular function. Subjects will be
      randomized into a Korean red ginseng (3.0g/d) group or placebo group for a 4-week study.

      We will collect anthropometric measurements, blood for laboratory testing, inflammatory
      marker, hormones and mitochondrial DNA copy number.

      Subject : Older than 40 years of age, presented with metabolic syndrome. Subjects were
      excluded if they were taking drugs that could affect metabolic and vascular function,
      including BP control drug, anti-diabetic drugs and lipid-lowering drugs.

      Measurement : We will collect anthropometric measurements and blood for laboratory testing at
      the initial(week 0) and final (week 4)visits. Serum levels of blood glucose, insulin, total
      cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,triglyceride, and DNA copy number of mitochondria.
