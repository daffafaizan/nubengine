    
      In order to compare the effects of two itopride doses (100 mg and 200 mg three times daily)
      and placebo on gastric emptying and small bowel transit, gastric accommodation, and
      postprandial symptoms in female and male healthy volunteers, the following methods, which
      have been extensively used and validated in the laboratory, will be used:

      Scintigraphic gastric emptying of solids and small bowel transit; single photon emission
      computed tomography to measure gastric accommodation; and the nutrient drink test to measure
      maximum tolerated volume and postprandial symptoms.

      Based on data acquired using the same methods in the laboratory, the sample size of 15
      subjects per group provides 80% power to detect an effect size of 16% in the primary endpoint
      of the study, that is a change in gastric volume (postprandial - fasting). This magnitude of
      change is considered clinically relevant.
