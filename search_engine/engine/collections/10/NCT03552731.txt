      who are undergoing treatment for cancer. We want to understand how common these issues are in
      order to better screen for, and treat people suffering from them. Past studies have shown
      that people with anxiety or depression and cancer have worse outcomes, and a study evaluating
      how common these issues are has not been done. Patients presenting for chemotherapy will be
      identified and approached for participation by members of the research team. The purpose and
      design of the study will be explained. After informed consent is obtained, the surveys will
      be administered by the study team. Completing surveys will take 20 minuets. Relevant
      demographic information will be collected from the patients EMR. Recruitment will extend over
      one year period. Those determined to be suffering from anxiety or depression will be given
      the option of psychiatric follow up or intervention.
