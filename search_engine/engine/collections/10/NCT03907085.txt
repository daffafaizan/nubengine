      and exercise in patients with calcaneal spur. The patients were randomly assigned to receive
      either HILT + exercise (n=21) or placebo HILT + exercise (n=21). Pain severity (with visual
      analog scale (VAS) and with Roles and Maudsley score (RMS) ), functionality (with Foot and
      Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS)), plantar pressure measurement (with pedobarographic assesment),
      and quality of life (with short form-36 (SF-36)) of the patients were evaluated at baseline,
      at 4 weeks, and 12 weeks.
