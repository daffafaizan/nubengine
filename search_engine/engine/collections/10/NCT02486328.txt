      anesthesiologists or endoscopists and cognitive dysfunction after this procedure has not been
      fully investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different sedation
      regimes applied by anesthesiologists or endoscopists on early cognitive dysfunction.
      Following ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 100 patients were randomly
      divided into two groups. In Group MM where drug regime was solely determined by endoscopists,
      2 mg midazolam and 20mg meperidine was given intravenously and additional 1-2mg midazolam and
      20mg meperidine (wtih a maximum total of 5 mg midazolam and 50 mg meperidine) was given when
      facial pain scale (FPS) was greater than 3. In Group RP where drug regime was solely
      determined by anesthesiologists, 100 mcg/kg/min propofol infusion and 1 mcg/kg remifentanil
      bolus was administered and additional 0,5 mcg/kg remifentanil bolus was given when FPS was
      greater than 3. Bispectral index (BIS) and hemodynamic monitorization was carried out
      throughout the procedure and BIS 60-80 with FPS<3 was targeted. The time to Observer
      Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAAS) score to reach 3 was measured after the
      procedure and Trieger Dot Test (TDT) and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) was repeated
      at 5th, 15th and 30th minutes.
