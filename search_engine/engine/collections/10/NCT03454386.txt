      abdominal pain related to defecation and associated with changes in stool frequency and/or
      form. IBS is a stress sensitive disorder and its severity has been shown to be moderated by
      both acute and chronic stress. Furthermore, resilience, which is defined as the ability to
      positively adapt and thrive in the presence of stressors and adversity, has been shown to be
      lower in those with IBS and associated with more severe symptoms. Therapies aimed at stress
      reduction in IBS have been found to be effective in the management of IBS. To our knowledge,
      there are no reports in the literature of a therapy to target resilience in the IBS patient
      population.

      The Stress Management and Resilience Training (SMART) program was developed by Dr. A. Sood at
      the Mayo clinic to reduce stress, decrease symptoms related to stress and enhance resiliency.
      This is accomplished by targeting human attention and interpretation of events, people and
      the world. Furthermore, methods to strengthen the skills of gratitude, compassion,
      acceptance, forgiveness and understanding of a higher meaning are taught. Previous studies
      have demonstrated that this program can improve stress, anxiety, resilience and quality of
      life of participants.
