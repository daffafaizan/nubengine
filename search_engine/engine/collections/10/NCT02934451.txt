      misalignment and head and neck defects in individuals with moderate to severe Osteogenesis
      Imperfecta (OI).

      Investigators will look at results from the Longitudinal study of OI to complete the study
      evaluations. Several x-rays will be performed for this study. Participants will have a 3D
      scan of the mouth and a Cone Beam CT scan of the jaw at a baseline visit and at 3 years after
      the baseline visit. These study visits can be at the same time as the Longitudinal Study of
      OI study visits.
