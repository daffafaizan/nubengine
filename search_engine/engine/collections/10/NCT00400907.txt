        -  Gain information on the long-term efficacy of 6 courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride, prednisone, and vincristine)-like chemotherapy with vs
           without rituximab (plus involved-field radiotherapy to primary bulky disease) in young
           patients with good-prognosis diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated on
           protocol CAN-NCIC-LY9.

        -  Gain information on late toxicities, including secondary neoplasm occurring in young
           good-prognosis patients treated on protocol CAN-NCIC-LY9.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients successfully completing treatment on protocol CAN-NCIC-LY9 are followed every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 667 patients will be accrued for this study.
