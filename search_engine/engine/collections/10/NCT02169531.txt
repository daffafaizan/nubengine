      without medication. The patients will come to our hospitals for the treatment. A small amount
      of peripheral blood will be drawn and processed and cultured in our laboratory. The cultured
      cells (autologous) will be infused intravenously back to patients. Levels of plasma
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other metabolic parameters before and after the therapy will be
      compared. The therapy is planned to take four weeks for each patient.
