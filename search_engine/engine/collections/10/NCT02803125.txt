      older Veterans to better, fuller functioning. This project will determine the feasibility and
      acceptability of such an intervention. The intervention developed will then be compared to a
      support group control condition. Primary outcomes are psychosocial functioning and quality of
      life, with PTSD and depressive symptoms as secondary outcomes. A complementary objective is
      to improve attitudes toward mental health treatment and to increase readiness for change and
      engagement in evidence-based psychotherapies, as appropriate. Results from this study will
      provide feasibility data for future development and testing of the intervention protocol.
