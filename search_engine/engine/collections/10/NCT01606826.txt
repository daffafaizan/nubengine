      treatments. The SARP will gain a better understanding of asthma and its endotypes, in
      children and adults, by defining the disease at the molecular and cellular levels in the
      context of the temporal phenotypic expression of the disease. To this end, the SARP
      investigators will utilize both mechanistic and evoked phenotype approaches to: 1)
      characterize developmental molecular, cellular and physiologic phenotypes in children and
      adults with mild to severe asthma, and 2) to further elucidate the evolving pathobiology and
      pathogenesis of severe asthma and its sub-phenotypes and 3) compare these features over time.
      This approach involves a shared longitudinal protocol conducted across all participating
      centers which includes common information on all SARP participants. Additionally, the SARP
      investigators have each identified mechanistic research questions to be included in the
      shared longitudinal protocol. Together, these longitudinal and mechanistic approaches will
      enable prediction of phenotype stability/fluctuation and pharmacologic responses and
      identification of novel, disease-modifying targets for treatment.
