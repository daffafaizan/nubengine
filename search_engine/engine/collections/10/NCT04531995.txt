      at an earlier stage than previously feasible and -- by more timely intervention -- help
      physicians to eliminate or mitigate the severity of an unfavourable event, reduce the
      required intensity of countermeasures, or otherwise reduce patient risks.

      A highly reliable identification of situations classified as "low-risk" by CANKADO could also
      enable a more focused utilization of resources as well as enhanced patient comfort and
      decreased stress, e.g., due to less frequent monitoring visits or reduced need for invasive
      diagnostics.

      The OMCAT Register aims to provide learning databases in cancer comprising both PRO data
      using PRO-React and "ground truth" (outcome data verified by the physician during patient
      examinations). Intelligent learning and knowledge engineering procedures will utilize this
      PRO data to provide high-quality event prediction algorithms. The ground-truth data enables
      so-called "supervised learning" techniques of artificial intelligence, because predicted
      events can be verified with a high level of certainty from ground-truth data.

      The PRO data of a patient provide what is known in engineering, physics, and statistics as
      "time series" of observations. The unique feature of PRO time series for applications in
      cancer is the very high "sampling frequency" (e.g., daily or better) compared to
      examinations, which generally occur at fixed, and much less frequent intervals. Prediction
      algorithms based on PRO data would thus be ideally suited to reduce the delay in detecting
      events, for example, by triggering physician appointments or indicating the need for more
      intensive medical diagnostics.
