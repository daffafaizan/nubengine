      transplant can speed up recovery of T cells in the patient. This approach can cause severe
      graft versus host disease (GVHD). The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving a
      donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) with methotrexate can accelerate immune recovery in
      recipients of T cell-depleted stem cell transplants. Thirty days after a T-cell depleted
      transplant, patients will be given a DLI. They will be monitored for immune recovery as
      measured by CD4 count and for GVHD toxicity.

      Patients will be separated into six cohorts based on dose of DLI received: 3 x 10^4, 4 x
      10^4, 5 x 10^4, 6 X 10^4, 8 x 10^4, and 10 X10^4 cells/ kg of body weight. A minimum of 3
      patients will be tested at each dose starting with the lowest dose. Dose escalation will
      continue until the dose associated with CD4 count >100 at Day +120 after transplant without
      significant GVHD is determined. All patients will receive thirteen doses of methotrexate
      after the DLI to prevent GVHD. Patients will be followed for 2 years for outcomes.
