      limited by retention screw loosening at the junction of the implant fixture and abutment; a
      situation that leads to micro-movement between components.

      A number of clinical complications may arise when implant components separate. Micro-movement
      between the implant abutment and seating platform is thought to contribute to the formation
      of a "biological gap", the most notable consequence being gradual resorption of crestal
      alveolar bone over time.

      We hypothesize that the "ACE CONNECT" two-piece implant design with an internal connection
      will limit screw loosening by providing a stable junction between the body of the implant and
      the abutment; a more stable junction will limit micro-movement and prevent the formation of a
      gap between components. Limiting the gap will lead to less inflammation of peri-implant soft
      tissues and reduced resorption of bone adjacent to the implant.
