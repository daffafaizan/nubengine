    
      Purpose of Study: The primary objective of this study is to determine if using a hemostatic
      agent (FloSeal Matrix™) in the tunnel of the endoscopically harvested Greater Saphenous vein
      will decrease bleeding from that site. Secondary objectives are to determine if there is a
      decrease in the infection-rate at the site of the vein-harvested leg where the FloSeal
      Matrix™ was used compared to the ones where FloSeal Matrix™ was not used.

      Background and Significance: FloSeal Matrix™ is indicated in surgical procedures (other than
      ophthalmic) as an adjunct to hemostasis when control of bleeding by ligature or conventional
      procedures is ineffective or impractical. It works on wet, actively bleeding tissue and
      conforms to irregular wound surfaces. It is proven to control bleeding from oozing to
      pulsatile flow. The EVH wound bed is irregular and hemostasis is, at times, difficult to
      obtain using conventional procedures such as ligature or cautery.

      Design and Procedures: This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial that compares the
      effects of applying FloSeal Matrix™ to the EVH wound bed to not applying FloSeal Matrix™ to
      the EVH wound bed.
