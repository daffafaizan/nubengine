      radioactive palladium-103 (Pd-103) sources on bio-absorbable, flexible, bio-compatible
      membrane. The CivaSheet can be custom cut in the operating room. The CivaSheet is 5 cm wide
      by 15 cm long and has a rim to allow an easy surface to suture. This flexible device can
      contour the surgical cavity delivering highly conformal and targeted radiation dose.
      CivaSheet can deliver a very high radiation dose to the surgical margin to potential prevent
      local cancer recurrence.

      Sarcoma patients have up to 80% local recurrence rates, depending on histology and location
      of disease presentation. CivaSheet will be implanted at the surgical margin follow tumor
      removal. Monitoring the rate of acute toxicity is the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints
      include disease progression and recurrence rates.
