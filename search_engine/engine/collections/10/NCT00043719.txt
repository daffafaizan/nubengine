      (cells responsible for bone formation) may lead to fractures, osteopenia, and osteoporosis in
      postmenopausal women. During postmenopause, decreased estrogen levels and decreased nitric
      oxide production occur; estrogen replacement therapy has been shown to restore serum nitric
      oxide levels to normal. Reversing nitric oxide deficiency by using nitroglycerin may prevent
      further bone loss. The Nitroglycerin as an Option: Value in Early Bone Loss (NOVEL) study
      will test the safety and efficacy of nitroglycerin ointment for the treatment of osteopenia
      in postmenopausal women.

      Patients will be enrolled in the study for 3 years and will be randomly assigned to one of
      two groups. The first group will receive nitroglycerin ointment, while the second group will
      receive placebo ointment. All patients will be given a calcium supplement with vitamin D to
      be taken daily, and will be instructed to rub the given ointment on their skin daily. Study
      visits will occur at Month 2 and every six months after Month 2. Phone interviews will be
      conducted with patients every 2 months throughout the study.
