      CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cell therapy in subjects with refractory and relapsed B-NHL. Subjects
      will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5, -4
      and -3 followed by infusion of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells. Safety and efficacy of CD19/CD20
      Dual-CAR-T cells therapy will be monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the
      clinical efficacy and safety of CD19/CD20 Dual-CAR-T cells therapy in patients with
