      of the heart even over the clothing of the subject, which allows several applications in
      out-of-hospital monitoring. The proposed scenarios for cECG revolve around the
      unobtrusiveness of the measurement with an inferior signal quality to gold standard ECG. The
      electrical spikes, that come into existence due to the paced rhythms given by a pacemaker,
      are only visible in ECG signals recorded by adequate medical instrumentation. Whether cECG
      can deliver enough signal quality to identify the electrical spikes of the paced rhythms
      needs to be investigated by recording simultaneous normal and capacitive ECG signals.
