    
      This is a randomized, phase III study to evaluate the ability of thalidomide maintenance
      therapy to prolong relapse-free survival(RFS), in diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma(DLBCL).Patients will be enrolled after successful standard induction therapy (CR or
      CRu following standard R-CHOP-like therapy with 8 infusions of rituximab plus CHOP-like
      chemotherapy (4-8 cycles). Patients will be followed until an event occurs as defined in the
      protocol. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of thalidomide maintenance therapy as compared to
      observation in patients with DLBCL who have achieved a complete remission after appropriate
      first-line therapy, measured by RFS, 226 patients with DLCBL will be recruited.
