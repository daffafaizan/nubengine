    
      Two overnight sleep studies, a placebo night and a drug night, will be performed
      approximately one week apart in random order. The placebo or drug will be administered 2
      hours before lights out. At least 15 minutes of quiet wakefulness will be recorded to
      quantify the participant's EMG GG activity while awake and at sleep onset (alpha-theta
      transition at the electroencephalogram).

      During the second part of the night, the participants will be connected to a modified
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine (Pcrit3000, Respironics) which can provide
      a wide range of pressures between 20 and -20 cmH2O in order to modify upper airway pressure
      and measure pharyngeal critical collapsing pressure (Pcrit), ventilation at 0 cmH2O when UA
      muscle are passive and active as well as change in EMG GG as a function of epiglottic
      pressure (muscle responsiveness).

      Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be calculated in each night from the part of the study off
      CPAP.
