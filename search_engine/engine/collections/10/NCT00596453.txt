      Hopkins Outpatient Center in Baltimore, MD. If a patient fits the eligibility criteria and
      signs a consent form, the patient will have his blood drawn for the first PSA measurement.
      The patient must return to the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center one week later for a second
      PSA measurement. The patient will be randomized to receive treatment with placebo or
      Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride for 14 days. The patient must return to the Johns Hopkins
      Outpatient Center at the end of the treatment cycle for the third PSA measurement. The
      patient will return one week later for his biopsy and fourth PSA measurement.
