      with known mild NCD, healthy age-matched older adults and participants with non-communicable
      diseases and to predict their deterioration in cognitive function over a period of 12 months.
      Moreover, this study is to characterize and evaluate any concurrent validity between
      emergence of deterioration in the VRWMT and clinical tools of functional performance in older
      adults. Additionally, the potential of inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation biomarkers to
      increase our ability to detect early NCD risk over and above the predictive validity of the
      VRWMT. The study findings will bring both social and clinical significance to ageing and NCD
      research. The combination of behavioural and biomarkers of pathological significance offers
      an innovative approach that potentially addresses the limitations intrinsic to either measure
      alone.
