    
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease. This means that the immune system (the part
      of the body which helps fight infections) mistakenly attacks and destroys the cells that
      produce insulin (islet cells found in the pancreas called islet cells). As these cells are
      destroyed, the body's ability to produce insulin decreases. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)
      is one of the major autoantigens (a protein that the immune system is reacting to) involved
      in the autoimmune process underlying T1DM.

      GAD-Alum is Recombinant human (rhGAD65) and is used as an antigen-specific immune modulator.
      Previous studies have shown that it may slow or prevent autoimmune destruction of pancreatic
      islet cells by introducing "immune tolerance". By administering excess autoantigen, the body
      may stop its attack on its own cells that produce insulin. If the immune system's attack can
      be halted in a patient with recent onset T1DM, than residual insulin secretion may be
      maintained. This may be beneficial in decreasing acute and long-term diabetic complications
      as well as improving glucose control.
