      individuals with MPS disorders, have deficiency or malfunction of specific lysosomal enzymes
      leads to an abnormal accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides or
      glycosaminoglycans) in the arteries, skeleton, eyes, joints, ears, skin, and/or teeth. These
      accumulations may also be found in the respiratory system, liver, spleen, central nervous
      system, blood, and bone marrow. This accumulation eventually causes progressive damage to
      cells, tissues, and various organ systems of the body. Due to such an extreme variability in
      clinical presentation as well as wide range of disease spectrum, but insufficient MPS disease
      awareness in Taiwan, these resulted in a delay diagnosis or even miss diagnosis with other
      clinical symptom thus patient often received inappropriate treatment. In order to address the
      current issue of delay diagnosis among MPS patient, it is critical to develop a MPS screening
      algorithm for high risk patients in Taiwan.
