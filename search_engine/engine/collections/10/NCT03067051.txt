      prostate, which makes it one of the most common cancer types. It affects the lives of the
      subjects in many ways.

      After treatment the subjects PSA levels are being closely monitored to detect potential
      recurrence. A high number of subjects will get recurrent prostate cancer. The treatment
      options for recurrent cancer are more limited than for primary tumors as secondary treatment
      partly depends on which treatment the subject has previously undergone.

      Treatment of recurrent prostate cancer may, depending on the standard treatment of the
      primary disease, include the following:

      Radiation therapy.

        -  Prostatectomy for subjects initially treated with radiation therapy.

        -  Hormone therapy.

        -  Pain medication, external radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy with
           radioisotopes such as strontium-89, or other treatments as palliative therapy to lessen
           bone pain.

      The objectives of this study is to demonstrate that the use of the SpectraCure P18 System
      (Interstitial multiple diode lasers and IDOSEÂ® Software) and verteporfin for injection (VFI)
      is a safe treatment for recurrent prostate cancer.
