    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of NY-ESO-1 vaccination (Anti-DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein +
      poly-ICLC) given in combination with decitabine 20 mg/m^2 intravenously and nivolumab 3 mg/kg
      in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low blast count acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML).

      SECONDRY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess immune and molecular epigenetic responses following combination therapy with
      nivolumab, decitabine and NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 (NY-ESO-1) vaccination.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To record the response rate (complete response, partial response and hematological
      improvement) in MDS or low blast count AML patients treated with the combination in order to
      provide descriptive characteristics.

      II. To record the overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and time to AML
      transformation (TTT) (for patients with MDS at diagnosis) enrolled on the study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 intracutaneously and poly ICLC
      subcutaneously (SC) on day -14, on day 15 of courses 1-4, and then on day 1 of every 4
      courses thereafter. Patients also receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 15 and decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses with nivolumab and
      decitabine repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days.
