      limited by high restenosis rates. Coronary stenting using bare metal stents significantly
      decreases restenosis in CTO compared to balloon angioplasty alone, but restenosis rates still
      reach 32-55%. In 200 patients with CTO, randomized in the PRISON I study we demonstrated a
      restenosis rate of 22% after bare metal stent (BMS) implantation as compared with 33% after
      conventional balloon angioplasty. During the past few years, sirolimus (rapamycin), a
      cytostatic macrocyclic lactone with anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties,
      delivered from a polymer-encapsulated stent was shown to almost eliminate the risk of
      restenosis in selected groups of patients. The drug zotarolimus (ABT-578), a sirolimus
      analogue, is designed to inhibit the cellular process that leads to restenosis. In the PRISON
      II study we have randomized 200 patients with CTO to either BMS implantation or
      sirolimus-eluting stent implantation and we demonstrated a reduction of in-stent binary
      restenosis from 36% to 7% and in-segment binary restenosis rates from 41% to 11% in favour of
      the sirolimus eluting stent. However, no data are available on direct comparison of the
      clinical efficacy, safety, and angiographic outcome of particular drug-eluting stents in
      patients with CTO and there may be differences between various drug-eluting stents. The
      PRISON III study is designed to address this issue and provide information about two
      different drug-eluting stents. It is a prospective randomized, single blinded trial comparing
      the relative safety, clinical efficacy and angiographic outcomes of sirolimus and
      zotarolimus-eluting stents in patients undergoing successful recanalization of CTO.
