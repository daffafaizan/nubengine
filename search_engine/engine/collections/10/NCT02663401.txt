      healthier choices at the point of purchase.

      Recently, the French government is considering the introduction of the 5-Colour Nutrition
      Label as a front-of-pack nutrition label.

      Evaluations of the 5-CNL suggest it is efficient in helping consumers making healthier
      choices. However, its impact in vulnerable populations has not yet been tested.

      Students are thought to be a vulnerable population due to their limited resources and to
      their unhealthy food choices.

      The objective of the present study is to investigate the impact of the introduction of the
      5-CNL in campus cafeterias on the nutritional quality of food purchases.

      The intervention is conducted during several months, with another similar cafeteria serving
      as control for the intervention.

      Data on purchases is collected regularly, and the nutritional quality of purchases is
      evaluated over time between the intervention situation and the control situation
