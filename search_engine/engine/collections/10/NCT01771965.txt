      (CB) intervention to promote behavioral health treatment engagement among at-risk Veterans
      who call the Crisis Line but are resistant to behavioral health services. This randomized
      controlled trial will recruit 80 Veterans who report current suicidal ideation at the time of
      the Crisis Line call and are resistant to seeking behavioral health treatment. Half of the
      participants will receive the brief, individualized CB intervention and half will receive
      standardized procedures from VA's Crisis Line (i.e., usual care). The effectiveness of the
      intervention will be tested on 1) attitudes toward behavioral health treatment rates, and 2)
      initiation of and adherence to treatment (assessed by the number of sessions attended). The
      investigators will also assess the impact of the intervention on suicidal ideation (SI) and
      explore the impact on the most common symptoms observed in Veteran suicide decedents (e.g.,
      depression).
