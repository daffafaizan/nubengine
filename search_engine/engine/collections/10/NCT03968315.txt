      I. To determine whether thymoma staging by MRI is as accurate as staging by CT as compared to
      surgical staging.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether evaluation of phrenic nerve paralysis by functional MRI is as
      accurate as the fluoroscopic "sniff test" as compared to surgical evaluation of phrenic nerve
      involvement.

      II. To determine whether fast novel MRI sequences are as accurate as conventional MRI
      sequences for staging thymoma, when comparing to surgical staging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo an MRI scan over 45-60 minutes and a diaphragm fluoroscopy 30 days before
      surgery.
