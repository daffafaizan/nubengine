    
      3. Secondary objective #1: Examine outcomes on three secondary measures: percent days
      abstinent from all substances, negative consequences of drug use, and HIV high risk
      behaviors.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Outcomes on the secondary measures will be better in MI-PC than in MI-IOP.

           4. Secondary objective #2: Test hypotheses concerning potential mediators of the
           predicted main effect favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP.

        -  Hypothesis 1: The predicted advantage of MI-PC over MI-IOP will be mediated by greater
           increases in motivation, self-efficacy, commitment to abstinence, and self-help
           involvement in MI-PC.

           5. Secondary objective #3: Test hypotheses concerning effect of additional MI
           intervention after initial non-engagement persists through 12 weeks.

        -  Hypothesis 1: A second telephone MI intervention will produce higher rates of subsequent
           engagement and less cocaine use than no further MI.
