      TAVR with a SAPIEN 3 valve and are being discharged to home will be eligible for Phase 1.
      Once consented prior to discharge, patients will complete the KCCQ, PROMIS Questionnaires, 5m
      walk, chair stand, and handgrip tests. During phase 1, all subjects will have a Fitbit and
      answer quality of life questions on the iPad about their activities and quality of life.
      After 30 days, the subject will return to complete the PROMIS Questionnaires, 5m walk, chair
      stand, balance tests, and handgrip tests, as well as a KCCQ. If the subject has consistently
      provided data throughout Phase 1, they will be asked to continue on to Phases 2 and 3 and
      complete a 6 minute walk test at this baseline visit. For Phase 2, subjects will be
      randomized to one of two arms. In one arm, they will have a daily activity goal and
      resistance exercises; in the other arm, there will not be a daily activity goal and no
      resistance exercises given. After 6 weeks, the subject will return to complete the 5m walk, 6
      minute walk test, chair stand, balance tests, and handgrip tests, PROMIS Questionnaires, as
      well as a KCCQ. Five months after enrollment into Phase 2, subjects will be given a Fitbit to
      track their daily activity for 1 week (Phase 3). They will also complete a KCCQ, PROMIS
      Questionnaires, and end of study questionnaire.
