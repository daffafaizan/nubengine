      the efficacy of combining intralesional triamcinolone and topical pirfenidone compared with
      the isolated application of these drugs. The interventions will last 6 months but the
      individuals will be assessed monthly to determine recurrences for 6 more months. The scar
      size will be measure at weeks 12, 24 and 52.
