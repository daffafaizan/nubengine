    
      Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) involves extensive
      inflammation in the lungs that can lead to rapid respiratory failure. These conditions are
      most commonly caused by pneumonia, generalized infection, or severe trauma to the lungs, but
      can also be less commonly caused by smoke or salt water inhalation, drug overdose, or shock.

      For some people, ALI/ARDS resolves without treatment, but many severe cases result in
      hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU), where 30% to 40% of cases end in mortality.
      Current treatments for ALI/ARDS include assisted breathing with a ventilator, supportive
      care, and management of the underlying causes.

      Upon admission to the ICU, Rosuvastatin or placebo was administered through an enteral
      feeding tube or administered orally following extubation when patients were able to safely
      take oral medications. The type and placement of the enteral feeding tube (nasogastric,
      nasoenteric, PEG, orogastric, oroenteric, etc.) and the ability to safely take oral
      medications was determined by the patient's primary team. Study drug was blinded with an
      identical appearing placebo. The first study drug dose (rosuvastatin or placebo) was
      administered within 4 hours of randomization as a loading dose of 40 mg.

      Blood pressure, heart rate, ventilation settings, and various blood factors were measured
      during treatment. Phone-based follow-up assessments occurred at months 6 and 12 after ICU
      discharge and included measurements of health-related quality of life; psychological,
      neurocognitive, and physical activity outcomes; healthcare utilization; and mortality.
