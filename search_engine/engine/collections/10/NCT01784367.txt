      driven extracorporeal device for removal of carbon dioxide from the blood in oder to avoid
      intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure
      retaining carbon dioxide due to the failure of their ventilatory muscle pump and not
      responding to prior non-invasive mask ventilation. Since intubation with subsequent
      (prolonged) invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with considerable side effects this
      new strategy has the potential to improve overall clinical outcome in this selected patient
      group.
