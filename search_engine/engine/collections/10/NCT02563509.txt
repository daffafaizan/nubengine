      improve the clinical therapy effects and effectively reduce the morbidity and mortality by
      reconstituting the immune systems of HIV infected patients and combining multiple therapy
      strategies. Therefore, the research could develop an cloning amplification system of
      immunocytes in vitro, and improve the antiviral immune system severely damaged before by
      transfusing the clone cells modified by specific HIV antigen. So HIV infected patients could
      discontinue the traditional anti-viral drug, but not develop opportunistic infections,which
      could obviously increase the life qualities of these patients.
