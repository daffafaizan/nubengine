    
      Prospective, single center, clinical pilot study to test the hypothesis that lipid rich
      EpiCeram® is superior in improving skin barrier function compared to Aveeno Daily
      Moisturising Sheer Hydration Lotion®.

      Primary Objective: To compare skin barrier function, assessed by TEWL AUC, between
      non-lesional areas of the skin treated with EpiCeram®, Aveeno Daily Moisturising Sheer
      Hydration Lotion® or no emollient use for one week.

      Secondary Objectives: To assess lipid and protein profiles of skin tape strips from
      non-lesional skin, after a week of either EpiCeram®, Aveeno Daily Moisturising Sheer
      Hydration Lotion® or no treatment.

      Exploratory Objectives :

        -  To study whether the effects on TEWL on lesional and non-lesional skin persist 24 hours
           after cessation of therapy.

        -  To evaluate whether baseline food and environmental allergy sensitization (assessed via
           skin prick testing during screening) affects the outcomes. See protocol section 3.1 for
           allergen details.

        -  A central repository of blood samples will be stored for future use to assess plasma
           biomarkers to help characterize clinical outcome data.
