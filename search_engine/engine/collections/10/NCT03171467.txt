      tubes. This has led a number of professional societies worldwide to recommend consideration
      of prophylactic salpingectomy at the time of elective gynecologic surgery or tubal
      sterilization.

      This study explores the acceptability and feasibility of incidental (opportunistic,
      risk-reducing, prophylactic) salpingectomy at the time of a common nongynecologic procedure
      in women, i.e. elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCHE). The study addresses whether
      women â‰¥45 years would accept opportunistic salpingectomy and the technical feasibility (time,
      port placement, complications) in women who consented to salpingectomy.
