      individuals who are experiencing mental stress. The main objective of the study is to
      investigate the extent to which Selfapy leads to a significant reduction in depressive
      symptoms. As this study is the first to evaluate the program Selfapy, also quality of life
      and acceptance of the program are evaluated. The primary outcome is the PHQ-9 as a measure of
      the severity of depressive symptoms, combined with the BDI-II. Secondary outcomes are rates
      of quality of life and satisfaction with the program, which were measured with the
      WHOQOL-BREF and ZUF-8. The study is conducted as a randomized-controlled trial with parallel
      assignment into three conditions over the course of three months. The groups were organized
      into one wait-list control group, one that received Selfapy with additional peer support and
      one that received Selfapy with therapeutic guidance.The wait-list control group received
      access to the program after completion of the post-survey.
