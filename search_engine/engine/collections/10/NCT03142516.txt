    
      Phase II, multicentre, single-arm trial. Elderly patients with good performance status and
      RAS/BRAF wild-type unresectable mCRC will be evaluated before being included in this trial.
      Eligible patients will receive panitumumab plus FOLFIRI for disease control until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision or the patient's withdrawal of
      consent.

      Tumour response will be evaluated by investigators using RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumours) version 1.1. Tumour response will be evaluated every 8 weeks until
      disease progression is documented. Disease response will be confirmed no less than 28 days
      after the criteria for response are first met. Radiographic progression of subjects with
      symptoms indicating disease progression will be evaluated at the time of symptom onset.

      Following disease progression, information will be collected on the subsequent lines of
      treatment chosen by the investigator and survival at follow-up visits held every 12 weeks (Â±
      4 weeks) until completion of the trial (approximately 24 months after inclusion of the last
      patient in the trial).

      A blood sample will be taken at baseline and at the time of disease progression in order to
      determine the RAS/BRAF mutation status.
