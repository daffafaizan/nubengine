      behavioral disturbances, antipsychotic prescriptions have limited efficacy and substantially
      increase risk of death. Despite an FDA 2005 "black box" warning and multiple professional
      physician society guidelines discouraging their use, physicians continue to frequently
      prescribe antipsychotic medications as first-line therapy for behavioral disturbances among
      patients with ADRD.

      Objective: This study will measure the impact of a multi-pronged electronic health record
      (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) tool intervention to reduce physician prescriptions of
      new antipsychotic medications among older adults with ADRD.

      Design, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a pragmatic parallel cluster-randomized trial
      design, the study will randomize eligible physicians from a large urban academic medical
      center to either receive an EHR CDS tool (intervention) or not (control) when they prescribe
      a new antipsychotic medication during a visit with a patient with ADRD. The intervention will
      include three components: (1) alerts the prescriber that antipsychotic prescriptions increase
      mortality; (2) offers non-pharmacological behavioral resources for caregivers; and if the
      prescriber does not cancel the order (3) auto-defaults the prescription to contain the lowest
      dose and number of pills (n=30) without refills. In addition, the PI will email all providers
      randomized to the intervention arm in order to make them aware of the components of this
      intervention and its motivation. Acknowledging the clinical complexity of this vulnerable
      patient population, the multidisciplinary study team attempted to design the intervention to
      maximize impact while minimizing clinician burden. Over a one-year timeframe, the study team
      will compare the cumulative total of new antipsychotic pill-days prescribed (primary outcome)
      by physicians in the intervention group versus in the control group.

      Hypothesis: This pragmatic trial will advance understanding of how a multi-pronged EHR CDS
      tool can potentially reduce harmful, low-value care among older adults with ADRD.
