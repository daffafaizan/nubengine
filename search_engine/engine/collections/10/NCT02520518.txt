      92 overweight/obese adults (body mas index > 27.5 kg/m^2) will be recruited for participation
      and randomly assigned to one of four 12 week treatments: 1) daily oral administration of
      dapagliflozin with ad-libitum dietary intake; 2) daily oral administration of dapagliflozin
      with supplemented dietary intake to achieve weight maintenance; 3) daily oral administration
      of a placebo plus dietary restriction such that weight loss is matched to participants in
      treatment 1; or, 4) daily oral administration of a placebo with ad-libitum dietary intake.
