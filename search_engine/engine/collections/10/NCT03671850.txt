    
      NK/T-cell lymphoma is a malignant tumor originating in NK cells and T lymphocytes. ENKL is
      associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and typically occurs in the nasal area,
      being termed ENKL, nasal type.EBV is a common virus in the herpes family. EBV infection in
      patients with lowered immunity such as those with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or
      those taking immunosuppressants after bone marrow transplant may induce lymphoproliferative
      diseases or cancer.

      VT-EBV-N (EBV-CTL) is a cytotoxicity T lymphocyte (CTL) targeting EBV expressed tumor cells
      indicated for ENKL. Antigen-presenting cells derived from the patient's own blood is used to
      activate T-cells in a test tube to recognize EBV, which are then expanded in vitro and
      infused into the patient's body. Targeted immunotherapy using EBV-CTL is a safe form of
      treatment that can improve long-term disease-free survival rates by boosting antitumor
      immunity without affecting other tissues apart from tumor cells.
