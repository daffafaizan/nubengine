      (cAMP) system plays critical roles in several brain diseases, particularly in mood disorders
      and drug addiction. cAMP is synthesized from adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) by adenylyl
      cyclase and metabolized by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Among components of
      the cAMP pathway, PDE4 appears to be critical for antidepressant effects.
      4-[3-(cyclopentoxyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidone (rolipram) is an inhibitor of PDE4. As a
      positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging agent, rolipram has good properties such as
      high affinity of 1-2 nM and appropriate lipophilicity (Log P) of ~3. A rat study gave an
      estimation of low radiation absorbed doses of the active enantiomer (R)-[11C]rolipram.

      absorbed doses have not been estimated from human whole body imaging studies and a method to
      measure binding of (R)-[11C]rolipram in human brain has not been established.

      The purposes of this protocol are to estimate radiation absorbed doses of (R)-[11C]rolipram
      by performing whole body imaging studies on healthy human subjects and also to establish an
      accurate method to measure PDE4 levels in brain by performing test retest brain imaging
      studies. The results of this overall study are required to apply this PET ligand in various
      neurological and psychiatric disorders in the future.
