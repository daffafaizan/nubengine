      patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis, who had undergone prior bilateral total
      ethmoidectomy and later presented with recurrent nasal obstruction/congestion symptoms and
      bilateral ethmoid polyposis. The S8 PK study assessed the safety, implant delivery to the
      ethmoid sinus, and systemic exposure to mometasone furoate (MF) by measuring plasma MF and
      cortisol concentrations through 30 days post-procedure.
