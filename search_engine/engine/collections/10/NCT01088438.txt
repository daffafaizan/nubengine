      conditions into diagnostic and management categories that permit the application of "best
      evidence" guidelines, and the ability to individualize or - more precisely - to contextualize
      care for patients whose circumstances and needs require variation from the standard approach
      to care. Most assessment in medical education places heavy emphasis on biomedical
      decision-making with little emphasis on how to incorporate contextual factors that may be
      essential to planning patients' care.

      The goal of this project is to demonstrate and provide validity evidence for an innovative
      standardized patient (SP) method of assessing medical students in the clinical years on their
      ability to detect and respond to individual contextual factors in a patient encounter that
      overcomes the aforementioned challenges.

      During the project, fourth-year medical students participating in a Medicine sub-internship
      will be randomized to an intervention group or a control group; the intervention group will
      receive additional training in the application of qualitative methodology to elicit and
      incorporate contextual factors in the clinical encounter. All students will participate in an
      SP assessment consisting of four SPs, blinded to trial arm, presenting cases with and without
      important biomedical and contextual factors in a counterbalanced factorial design.
      Performance will be compared between trial arms. In addition, performance will be compared
      with United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 2 clinical knowledge scores to
      determine whether contextualizing ability is independent of clinical knowledge, and
      consistency of performance across individual SP cases will be studied to determine the number
      of cases necessary to achieve sufficient reliability for the assessment to be used.
