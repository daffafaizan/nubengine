      and home level, focused on determinants of food intake. Dietary intake is based on three
      non-consecutive days of weighed and estimated food intake. Oral health and dyshphagia risk
      are assessed. Person directed care practices, mealtime environments and home level variables
      of food cost, production and delivery are ascertained.
