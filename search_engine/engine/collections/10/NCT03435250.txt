    
      The purpose of this Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AG-270, administered as a single agent or in combination with
      taxane-based chemotherapy, and to characterize its dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when given
      daily by mouth to participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma with homozygous
      deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP).

      In each arm of the study, successive cohorts of participants will receive increasing oral
      doses of AG-270 to determine the MTD, the dose with maximum pharmacologic activity or the
      maximum feasible dose, as a single agent and in combination with taxane-based chemotherapy.
      In the subsequent dose-expansion parts of the study, additional participants in each
      treatment arm will be treated at the MTD (or one of the described alternative doses) to
      further characterize that dose's safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and to detect preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity.
