      undergoing interventional procedures. These anchoring catheters are support catheters used in
      conjunction with guidewires to access discrete regions of the coronary and peripheral
      vasculature. They may be used to facilitate placement and exchange of guidewires and/or other
      interventional devices beyond stenotic lesions, including CTOs. The goal of this registry
      study is to collect prospective observational data on the performance of the Roxwood
      CenterCross™, CenterCross™ Ultra, CenterCross™ Ultra LV, MultiCross™, and MicroCross™ 14,
      14ES and 18 MicroCatheter devices through 24 hours and the safety of the devices through 30
      days in native coronary and peripheral arteries with a stenotic lesion or CTO. Additionally,
      the catheters will be evaluated for the ability to facilitate a guidewire successfully
      penetrating the proximal cap of the stenotic lesion or CTO and the infusion of saline and
      contrast agents as confirmed by angiography.

      Of the 100 intended participants to be treated, it is anticipated that at least 50
      participants will be enrolled and treated using the Roxwood MicroCross™ 14, 14ES and/or 18
      MicroCatheter and 50 participants will be enrolled and treated using the CenterCross™,
      CenterCross™ Ultra, CenterCross™ Ultra LV, and/or MultiCross™ devices.

      Adverse Events will be coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
      (MedDRA). Data from the study will be collected via electronic data capture (EDC). Clinical
      data will be extracted in the desired format by the BTG Data Management from the EDC on an
      ongoing basis to support data review activities. An independent monitor will visit the
      investigational site and review the Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). Data entered in the
      EDC will be immediately saved to a central database and changes tracked to provide an audit
      trail.
