renal renin in unilaterally nephrectomized hypertensive rats.juxtaglomerular index, renal pressoractivity and width of the zona glomerulosawere normal in unilaterally nephrectomizedhypertensive rats maintained on a normalsodium intake, increased in thosesubjected to sodium depletion and decreasedin those receiving 1% saline.  this indicatesthat renin formation and secretion aremost likely the result of the sodium stateof the animal rather than loss of a renin-stimulatingagent in the contralateral orunclipped kidney.  failure of sodium to influencethe degree of hypertension inunilaterally nephrectomized hypertensive ratsmilitates against a direct quantitativerelationship between blood pressure and therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
