      the effectiveness of routine back exercises in improving balance of back pain patients. No
      study has concentrated on balance training in back pain patients.

      Objective: Compare balance exercises and routine back exercises in improving balance and
      other functional outcomes.

      Procedure: Back pain patients attending physiotherapy department of tertiary care teaching
      hospitals will be recruited voluntarily. Randomised to either balance and routine program
      based on simple lottery method. Balance training comprises of 5 exercises - single leg
      squats, dead lift, single leg raises, lateral step-ups and forward reach outs. Routine back
      exercises includes 5 sets - pelvic bridges, dynamic dead bug, prone planks, situps, lateral
      planks. 10Repetition Maximum, 2 Sets/ day, five days a week, 2 weeks. Baseline balance (star
      Edward, berg balance) and functional test (sit to stand) and pain (Visual analogue score) and
      post 2 weeks outcome scores will be analysed through paired and unpaired for between and
      within groups.
