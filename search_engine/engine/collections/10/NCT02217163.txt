    
      Carfilzomib is administered over 30 minutes as an infusion. For cycle 1 only, Carfilzomib is
      administered at 20mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 2, followed by escalation to 36 mg/m2 on days 8,9,15
      and 16 on a 28 day cycle. Patients who tolerate 36 mg/m2 dose are kept at this dose for the
      subsequent cycles on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 on a 28 day cycle. Dose and schedule
      modifications for intolerable side effects are detailed in the protocol. Additionally
      Cyclophosphamide is given a fixed dose of 500mg once per week orally, along with
      dexamethasone, given on the days of Carfilzomib administration, 30 minutes to 4 hours prior
      to Carfilzomib. Patients will undergo blood tests weekly and serum protein electrophoresis
      every 4 weeks during treatment. Within completion of 5 cycles of treatment, patients would
      undergo stem cell collection using chemotherapy and GCSF mobilization. After completion of 6
      cycles of treatment, autologous bone marrow transplantation will be performed. Three months
      following bone marrow transplantation, subjects will undergo further 2 consolidation cycles.
      After consolidation, subjects will undergo disease assessment by blood and subjects who are
      in CR will undergo bone marrow investigations and MRD analysis MPFC. Patients who achieve MRD
      negativity by MPFC will be managed expectantly by watch and wait. Patients who are MRD
      positive at this stage will receive maintenance for 2 years or till disease progression.
      Follow up would extend till a minimum of 2 years from completion of the study. At the end of
      2 years post maintenance or expectant monitoring, subjects who are in CR will undergo disease
      assessment by blood and bone marrow investigations and MRD analysis MPFC.
