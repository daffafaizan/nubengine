        -  Determine whether immunization with multiple antigens comprising GM2, Globo-H, Lewis y,
           TF(c), sTn(c), Tn(c), and glycosylated MUC-1 32(aa) conjugated to keyhole limpet
           hemocyanin plus QS21 induces an antibody response against these individual antigens and
           breast cancer cells expressing these antigens in patients at high risk for breast cancer
           recurrence.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive Globo-H-GM2-Lewis-y-MUC1-32(aa)-sTn(c)-TF(c)-Tn(c)-KLH conjugate
      vaccine with QS21 adjuvant subcutaneously weekly on weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, and 19.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 months.
