      differentiate between lesions of the upper and lower motoneuron. In cat studies, it was shown
      that the IWT is a C-fiber mediated lower motoneuron segmental reflex and that these
      unmyelinated C fibers are associated with cold receptors. This explains the positive IWT in
      patients with upper motoneuron lesions. In healthy humans, the IWT is positive up to the age
      of 4 years and becomes negative thereafter since the reflex is centrally inhibited. However,
      this reflex might be unmasked by a neurological disease and/or injury.

      Considering that C-fibers are involved in the pathogenesis of detrusor overactivity, the IWT
      seems to be a useful diagnostic tool in daily practice. However, although there are many
      studies published on the IWT, it is unclear whether the detrusor contraction during the IWT
      is provoked by the ice water or whether it might be caused by the rapid filling. Therefore,
      we designed this randomized, double-blind trial.
