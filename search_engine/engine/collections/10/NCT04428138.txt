      common pathophysiological pathway between these clinical conditions is linked to
      extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations. Arterial diseases, mainly represented by carotid
      stenosis, peripheral artery disease and arterial aneurysms, are widespread in western
      population and are responsible of high rates of morbidity and mortality. These diseases are
      also related to some ECM alterations.

      Aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the prevalence of arterial disease among
      patients with inguinal hernias. The primary endpoint of this study is to provide new
      epidemiological evidences on this association that may help physicians in novel preventive
      strategies. The study will consider the inclusion of consecutive patients assessed for
      inguinal hernia over 1 year period in order to study the prevalence of concomitant arterial
      disease, by means of office visit, echo duplex scan of the aorta and its main branches,
      carotid arteries and lower limb arteries.
