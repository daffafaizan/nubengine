      the use of AquamantysÂ® System from Medtronic Advanced Energy (formerly Salient Surgical
      Technologies) in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty via the anterior supine
      intermuscular surgical approach in terms of blood loss, transfusion and wound healing based
      on early collected data. Data will be analyzed using StatsDirect in standard fashion to
      elucidate any difference between control and treatment groups. Wound healing will be assessed
      by a blinded observer and based upon a simple and subjective criteria: a) as expected, b)
      better than expected or c) worse than expected. The blinded observer is experienced in the
      care of the surgical patient and wound evaluation.
