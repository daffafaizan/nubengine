    
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG
      (commercialised as LGG), a pilus-less derivative L. rhamnosus GG (LGG-PB12)combined with a
      putative prebiotic PromitorTM (soluble corn fiber) i.e. a synbiotics and PromitorTM (SCF
      alone) on the faecal microbiota composition, metabolism and immunity in healthy individuals
      aged 60-80 years.

      It consists of a 3 week randomised intervention treatment periods with the synbiotics,
      prebiotic and placebo control. Any adverse medical events which occur during the trial (e.g.
      headache, gut symptoms) should be recorded in a diary along with medication taken.
