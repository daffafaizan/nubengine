      The technique of adding remifentanil to a local anesthesia is used in 22% of the procedures
      realized in The CHU de Caen Outpatient unit. Decreasing opioid dose, whose side effects are
      numerous and widely described, as well as reducing anxiety are daily challenges to ensure
      comfort and successful care.

      We propose a prospective, randomized, monocentric, open label study to evaluate the impact of
      the use of an audiovisual distraction device on the intraoperative consumption of opioids, on
      the patient's pain and peroperative anxiety.

      ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) will be used for peroperative overall comfort measurement.
      We will analyze if audiovisual distraction can integrate existing techniques such as
      hypnosis.

      Finally, we will also assess the medico-economic impact of this technique in order to
      establish a benefit / cost ratio.
