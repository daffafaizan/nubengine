      Primary

        -  Compare the tumor response rates (complete and partial response) in patients with
           relapsed or refractory advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with bortezomib with
           vs without docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Compare time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the overall and 1-year survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and bortezomib IV as in arm
           I.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses
      beyond confirmation of CR.

      Quality of life is assessed on day 1 of each treatment course (before drug administration)
      and at 30 days after the completion of study treatment.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 155 patients (75 for arm I and 80 for arm II) will be accrued
      for this study within 1 year.
