      been scheduled for exploration, and possible esophagectomy. Prior to surgery, patients will
      be randomized to one of two groups. Group A will have a pyloroplasty performed as part of the
      esophagectomy procedure. Group B will not have a pyloroplasty performed. Postoperative
      patient outcomes will be assessed for 24 months.
