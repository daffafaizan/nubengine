      that have sharply attenuated practice effects and are not prone to ceiling effects for use in
      preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials in which participants are cognitively within
      normal limits. To implement this, we will conduct an innovative parallel group study in which
      320 healthy, non-cognitively impaired older subjects are randomized to one of two groups
      based on assessment type (novel instruments vs. established) and receive three serial
      assessments over a one year period. Novel cognitive measures include tests of executive
      function, episodic memory, and processing speed combined into a single composite. Novel
      functional measures involve computerized performance based, ecologically relevant
      instrumental activities. We will compare our novel No Practice Effects (NPE) cognitive
      battery and Miami Computerized Functional Assessment Scale (CFAS) against established
      measures that include the ADAS-COG in order to determine which battery (novel or established)
      has better psychometric properties and is less sensitive to practice effects in this clinical
      trials structure.
