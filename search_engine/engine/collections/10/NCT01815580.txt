      women who are unaware of their HIV status and 1) report high risk behaviors for acquiring
      HIV-1 infection or 2) who have symptoms of acute retroviral syndrome or 3) who have a sexual
      partner with newly-diagnosed acute or recent HIV infection. HIV testing will be conducted for
      several thousand MSM and transgender women from study opening until July 2015. In Step 2,
      high risk HIV-1 uninfected MSM and transgender women with high risk for acquiring HIV will be
      tested at regular intervals for incident HIV-1 (using tests for HIV p24 and/or HIV RNA).
      (During this period, men will receive standard HIV prevention interventions.) In Step 3,
      individuals with acute or recent HIV-1 infection will be enrolled in a 48-week randomized,
      open-label study of the effects of immediate vs. deferred ART on the decay dynamics of HIV
      viral load in plasma, semen and rectal secretions. (ART will be provided prior to 24 weeks
      for any participant in the deferred ART arm who meets initiation criteria.) All participants
      will be followed for 48 weeks after which they will continue ART from other sources.
