      of inhaled nitric oxide on the outcome of survival and incidence of bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia. This trial has a planned enrollment of 138 infants with 68 infants with delayed
      pulmonary transition assigned to either the treatment or placebo group. There is no
      enrollment restriction based on gender, ethnicity, or race. Enrollment is expected to take 36
      months with an additional 12 months for data analysis.Infants with early pulmonary
      hypertension will be randomized to the treatment or placebo group. Treatment will continue
      until resolution of pulmonary hypertension or through Day 14, whichever comes first. Serial
      echocardiograms will be performed every 48 hours +/-12 hours until Day 14. Oxygen saturation
      levels will be averaged every 24 hour period following enrollment. This study will provide
      evidence for the beneficial effects of early diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary
      hypertension in preterm infants.
