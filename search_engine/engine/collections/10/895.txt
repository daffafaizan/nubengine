concept learning in culturally disadvantaged children asa function of verbal pretraining.while research indicates that verbal pretraininghas a positive influence on the discriminationlearning performance of subjectsof normal intelligence, a comparableinfluence has not been shown for other typesof conceptual tasks for retarded subjects.the purpose of this experiment wasto investigate the effects of stimuluspretraining on concept learning by subjectswho had a 'high risk' of being classifiedas mentally retarded at some future time.a group of 27 'higher risk' and 27 'lowerrisk' subjects was randomly divided into3 pretraining groups: verbal label, attention,and control.  subsequent to pretraining onthe stimuli used for transfer task 1, subjectsin each group were presented with aconcept learning task (transfer task 1).after reaching the criterion of learning ontransfer task 1, subjects were presentedwith a second, new, concept learning task.analysis of the data revealed that therewere no significant performance differencesbetween risk groups and that pretraininghad a significantly positive effect on performance.
