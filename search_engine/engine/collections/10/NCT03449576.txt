    
      PTSD is associated with significant interpersonal difficulties that interfere with
      functioning. As such, this work is intended to evaluate the empirical support for a novel
      treatment that fills a significant gap in the treatment options available to Veterans with
      PTSD who suffer with interpersonal difficulties. In this study the investigators will (i)
      evaluate the efficacy of Trauma Management Therapy (TMT) for treating PTSD-related
      interpersonal dysfunction, as well as PTSD-related fear and anxiety, and (ii) evaluate neural
      mediators of clinical improvements associated with TMT.

      This work will provide insights into the mechanisms by which treatments may lead to
      improvements in social functioning, informing both the biological basis of psychotherapy and
      the development and refinement of alternative therapeutic interventions targeting social
      impairments.

      Treatment seeking Veterans with PTSD will be randomized to one of two treatments: (i) Trauma
      Management Therapy, consisting of 12 sessions of individualized exposure therapy followed by
      24 sessions of group-based social and emotional rehabilitation, or (ii) Exposure + Comparison
      Treatment Group consisting of 12 sessions of individualized exposure therapy followed by 24
      sessions of group-based psychotherapy. Veterans enrolled in both the TMT and EXP+GRP arms
      will undergo functional neuroimaging as they engage in an emotional image viewing task, as
      well as two social interaction tasks. Neurobehavioral assessments will be made prior to and
      following completion of treatment.
