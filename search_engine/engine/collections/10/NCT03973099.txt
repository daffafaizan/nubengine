    
      Nelumbinis Semen, has been widely used as treatment of post-menopause symptoms in women for
      hundreds of years in many Asian countries. This study examines whether PM011, standardized
      herbal medicine made from Nelumbinis Semen, treats stress in above 5 of BDI score of human
      subjects and discusses its potential as treatment for depressed patients. Subjects were
      divided into three groups, the placebo-treated group (n = 10), the PM011-2.4 g treated group
      (n = 11) and PM011-4.8 g treated group (n = 11) per day. Alpha/Beta ratio of
      electroencephalogram (EGG), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Stress Response Inventory
      (SRI) were conducted in order to measure changes in stress before and after 2 weeks of PM011
      treatment.
