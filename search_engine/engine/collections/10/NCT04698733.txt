    
      The primary objective of this study is to document the possible short- and long-term decrease
      in pain as scored by participants on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) after use of Avazzia
      PRO-Sport UltraÂ® device with pulsed microcurrent in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Patients with a clinical diagnosis of Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee for a minimum of 6
      months will be recruited for this study. Their OA has not responded/is not responding to
      treatment and continuing symptoms interfere with normal function. Additionally, patients will
      have a pain score of 3 or greater on the NRS even with pain medication.

      Secondary objectives include changes in:

        -  Mobility via a Timed Up & Go assessment (TUG). Participants are timed getting up from
           sitting in a standard armchair, walking approximately 3 meters, turning, walking back to
           the chair, and sitting down.

        -  Patient-relevant outcomes via the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
           The KOOS is self-administered and assesses five outcomes: pain, symptoms, activities of
           daily living, sport and recreation function, and knee-related quality of life.

        -  Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form

        -  Use of pain medication.
