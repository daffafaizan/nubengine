        -  Determine the effect of sargramostim (GM-CSF) on the progression-free 1-year survival of
           patients with myelodysplastic syndrome who have undergone T-cell-depleted CD34+
           augmented allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive elutriated, CD34+ stem cell augmented donor bone marrow
      according to another protocol on day 0.

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 5-60.

      Patients are followed on days 120, 180, 360 and periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.
