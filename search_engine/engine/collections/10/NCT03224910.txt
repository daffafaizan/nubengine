    
      This is a retrospective study in which the investigators will analyze the quality of the
      smears and the touch imprints, the cellularity, the cytomorphologic features of the specimens
      and the presence of adequate material for ancillary studies. The specimens will be searched
      through the University of Mississippi Medical Center's Pathology Laboratory information
      system (Copath), from January 2011 to December 2017. The retrospective cases (January 2011 up
      to now) will be retrieved using natural language search of fine needle aspiration and touch
      imprints. The slides of those cases will be reviewed and the cytomorphologic features will be
      described.
