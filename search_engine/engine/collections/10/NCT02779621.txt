      available to women who have declined smear testing (defaulters), through the NHS to prevent
      cervical cancer. We plan to identify all defaulters living in Coventry between 30 and 40
      years (nâ‰ˆ6000) from the cervical screening call-recall system. They will be randomized 1:1 to
      intervention and control arms. Women in the control arm will be sent a routine screening
      letter reminding them to have a smear test. Women in the intervention arm will be given the
      option of self-sampling for HPV testing, if they do not wish to have a smear test. They could
      order a self-HPV test by returning a slip in the pre-paid envelope. We then send the woman a
      vaginal self-collection kit. Self-collected sample will be returned to the laboratory for HPV
      testing. Whilst HPV positives (10-15%) will be advised to have a smear test, HPV negatives
      will be advised to accept their next smear test invitation.
