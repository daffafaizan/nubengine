      broadly and deeply across different age groups and with different vaccine modalities and to
      probe the influence of genetics on these responses using monozygotic and dizygotic twins. On
      an investigational basis, the investigators plan to compare various immunological responses,
      identify age-specific biomarkers or clusters of markers, quantify the frequency of
      influenza-specific T-cells pre- and post-vaccination, and determine the effective breadth of
      T-cell repertoire to an influenza vaccine within an individual as a function of age and to
      what degree this is genetically determined.

      Twin group B will will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of inactivated vaccine,
      either the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or intranasal live, attenuated
      influenza vaccine (LAIV). Twin Groups C-E will receive a single administration of TIV. Group
      F, elderly participants, will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of inactivated
      vaccine, either the standard dose or the high-dose TIV. Blood samples to conduct the assays
      described will be taken at pre-immunization, Days 7-10 and 28 post-immunization.

      Groups A, C and E were not enrolled for this year of the five year annual study.
