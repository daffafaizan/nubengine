      substantial negative impact on quality of life and employment status; one third of patients
      describe fatigue as their most burdensome symptom. The enormous personal and socioeconomic
      burden of this symptom is in striking contrast to the limited therapeutic options.

      In a previous polysomnographic study, we found a strong association between sleep disorders
      and fatigue in MS, measured with the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the
      Fatigue-Severity-Scale (FSS). Thus, it is conceivable that a consequent treatment of sleep
      disorders may improve fatigue, at least in a subset of patients which would yield a great
      benefit as pharmacological treatment options for fatigue are insufficient.

      All consecutive MS patients of our outpatient clinic will be screened for fatigue. In case of
      fatigue (MFIS values > 34) or signs of sleep disorders (Pittsburgh sleep quality index > 5)
      the MS patients were invited to participate in the study. All MS patients will be interviewed
      by a sleep specialist, and will fill out questionnaires. Afterwards, they will be
      investigated by two consecutive polysomnographies in the sleep laboratory, followed (if
      necessary) by multiple sleep latencies tests. Subsequently, a sleep medical diagnosis will be
      established (no sleep disorder or sleep apnea or insomnia or restless legs syndrome or any
      other sleep disorders according to the International Classification of Sleep disorders 3th
      ed.). The primary endpoint will be the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) value six months
      after sleep medical treatment.
