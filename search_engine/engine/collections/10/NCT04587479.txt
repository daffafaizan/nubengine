    
      JAB-8263 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the highly conserved bromodomain pockets of the
      bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins.

      The objectives of this study are:

      To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      JAB-8263 as a single agent to adult subjects with advanced solid tumors To assess the safety
      and tolerability of JAB-8263 To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and
      pharmacodynamics (PDc) To evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of JAB-8263
