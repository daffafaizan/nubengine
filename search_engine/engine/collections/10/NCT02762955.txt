      by joint-stock company (JSC) BIOCAD, Russia.The aim of this study is to establish that
      BCD-057 is equivalent to Humira速 in terms of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics when used
      by the standard regimen in patients with plaque psoriasis.

      The study will enroll 344 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, who will be
      randomized into 2 groups (1:1 ratio): patients from the first group will receive BCD-057
      subcutaneously (SC) at a dose 80 mg on week 0, then at a dose 40 mg on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
      11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23. Then participants of this group will be invited for
      randomization at week 25 (in order to keep the double-blind design of the study), but it will
      have a formal character (assignment of a new randomization number and lot). Patients will
      continue to receive 40 mg of BCD-057 on weeks 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47,
      49 and 51.

      Patients from the second group will receive Humira速 subcutaneously (SC) at a dose 80 mg on
      week 0, then at a dose 40 mg on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23. At week
      25 participants will re-randomized (1:1) to treatment with Humira速 or will transitioned to
      BCD-057.They will receive Humira速 or BCD-057 at a dose 40 mg on weeks 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35,
      37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 and 51.
