      enrolled in this study. All participants were current users of a standard 21/7 oral
      contraceptive regimen (21 days of combination progestin/estrogen followed by 7 days placebo)
      and had completed at least one 28-day cycle prior to beginning the Cycle 1 baseline cycle.
      After completing screening, all enrolled participants continued to receive the same regimen
      of 150 μg DSG /20 μg EE combination pills once daily for 21 days followed by placebo once
      daily for 7 days during Cycle 1 (the Run-In phase). Following completion of Cycle 1,
      participants were randomly assigned to receive either DR-1021 or Mircette during Cycle 2. All
      participants who completed Cycle 2 were to receive Kariva during Cycle 3; however,
      participants were only followed for the first 21 days of this 28-day regimen, after which
      they were considered study completers.
