      safety of acetaminophen extended release caplets and ibuprofen in relieving the muscle
      soreness that occurs in subjects who complete a marathon. Subjects are randomized to receive
      acetaminophen extended release caplets, 3900 mg/day (two 650 mg caplets taken three times a
      day, for five days) or ibuprofen caplets, 1200 mg/day (two 200 mg caplets taken three times a
      day, for five days). The primary measurement of efficacy is the average change in muscle
      soreness from baseline for both the morning and evening assessments. Safety assessments
      consist of monitoring adverse events, and a physical examination including vital signs,
      weight, a review of concomitant medications, and a urine pregnancy test for female subjects.
      Two hypotheses are examined in a step-down approach. The first hypothesis is that
      acetaminophen extended release is not inferior to ibuprofen in relieving the muscle soreness
      that occurs after a marathon. If acetaminophen extended release is not inferior to ibuprofen
      in relieving the muscle soreness that occurs after a marathon, the second hypothesis is that
      acetaminophen extended release (3900 mg/day) is superior to ibuprofen (1200 mg/day) in
      relieving the muscle soreness that occurs after a marathon. Two acetaminophen 650 mg extended
      release caplets, taken by mouth, three times a day for five days or two ibuprofen 200 mg
      caplets, taken by mouth, three times a day for five days.
