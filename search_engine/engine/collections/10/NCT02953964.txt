      performance. It has been identified that encoding is less effective in people with dementia.
      Rehabilitating at the encoding stage is, therefore, essential. A recent systematic review
      found that effective interventions needed to include training in individually selected memory
      encoding strategies. These strategies are classified as either perceptual (visual) or
      semantic (association) memory encoding strategies.

      Based on the above literature, the chief investigator (Associate Professor Karen Liu) ran a
      pilot study on an integrated home and community centre cognitive training programme for 20
      elderly people with memory problem using a pre-test and post-test comparison design.

      Extending on the positive results, the aim of this project was to investigate the
      effectiveness of perceptual and semantic encoding strategies (and compare with a control
      intervention). It also aims to promote the understanding of memory loss and dementia and the
      need for early intervention for family members of the participants.
