      I. To assess the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of brigatinib with local consolidative
      therapy (LCT) in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive ALK-rearranged advanced (non-small cell lung
      cancer) NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in advanced ALK+ NSCLC patients treated with local consolidative
      therapy (LCT) after achieving stable disease or partial response with first-line brigatinib
      treatment.

      II. To determine overall survival (OS). III. To assess time to progression (TTP) of non-LCT
      lesions.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time to appearance of new metastatic lesion(s). II. To determine the utility of
      pre-treatment, pre-LCT, and post-LCT circulating free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      (cfDNA) as a potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

      II. To evaluate potential impact of LCT on mechanisms of ALK resistance with molecular
      analysis of post-progression biopsies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then undergo LCT for up to 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 7 days after completion of LCT, patients receive brigatinib PO
      QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 3 months
      for up to 2 years.
