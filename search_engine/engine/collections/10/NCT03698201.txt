      patients with glioma would be a new, less invasive approach, which could help in the
      diagnosis of a glioma, and potentially help guide therapeutic decisions.

      The investigators will investigate the existence of biomarker profiles, which can

        -  distinguish between low and high grade gliomas

        -  correlate with patient outcomes including response to treatment and survival

        -  indicate progression from a low to a high grade glioma.

      In this study the investigators collect and analyse blood samples taken from patients with
      suspected newly diagnosed grade II/III glioma or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Blood samples
      will be collected before any surgical intervention (resection or biopsy) and at various
      follow-up time points until progression or death. Based on the known natural history of
      gliomas (described above), it is planned to follow patients with grade III/IV tumours, who
      receive treatment, for up to 3 years and those with grade II-III tumours, (irrespective of
      treatment) for up to 5 years. Ultimately, the investigators envisage the translation of our
      observations into the hospital setting to aid the distinction between glioma grade II and
      grade III/IV.
