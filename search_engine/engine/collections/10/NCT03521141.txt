      strategies are needed. Biologically-informed precision treatment could benefit smokers but is
      understudied.

      Tennessee and Mississippi Smokers that responded to a previous survey indicating willingness
      to be contacted for a smoking cessation clinical trial will be assessed for eligibility via
      phone and, if eligible, provide verbal consent and administer a baseline survey. These
      participants will then mail in written consent, upon receipt of which their SCCS stored blood
      samples will be analyzed. During lab processing, a study tobacco counselor will call enrolled
      participants to assist with their quit plan and inform them of randomization status.
      Participants will complete telephone surveys at 1, 3, and 6 months. During the 6 month
      follow-up call, participants will also be given their previously-unreported lab results
      (i.e., information on nicotine metabolism or lung cancer risk). After receiving lab results,
      participants will complete a final brief questionnaire.
