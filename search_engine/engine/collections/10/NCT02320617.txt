      and chemotherapeutic approaches have been made, but the long-term survival rate remains low.
      Although effective mass screening of high-risk groups could potentially be of benefit,
      randomized trials of screening with the use of chest radiography with or without cytological
      analysis of sputum specimens have shown no reduction in lung-cancer mortality. Currently,
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) by CT is the most commonly used to
      evaluate chemotherapy of lung cancer patient, but patients have to be exposed to radiation.
      For this reason, the investigators aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, a specific parameter of radiation-free diffusion weighted
      MRI, in comparison of RECIST, and its correlation with histologic type and grade of lung
      cancer as well. Furthermore, the investigators investigate its correlation with Progression
      Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in patients.
