      days, subjects will attend the clinic in a fasting state. They will have inserted a Dexcom
      and Freestyle Libre and a microdialysis catheter. At time = 0, subjects will be administered
      a glucose rich drink and every 6. minut measurements will be performed. These include a
      measurement on the IMD, microdialysate, FreeStyle Libre and Dexcom readings. Every 18. minut
      a venous blood sample will be included and every 36. minut a capillary blood sample will be
      collected. This continues until time = 180 minutes.
