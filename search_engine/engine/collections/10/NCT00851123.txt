      Constrained-Induced Movement Therapy seems to be an efficacious treatment approach for a
      certain subgroup of patients with moderate to mild hemiparesis after stroke. Still it remains
      unclear whether the training intensity or restriction of the better arm plays the bigger
      role. CIMT or mCIMT is usually compared to standard care of lower intensity with no
      constraint of the better arm, or other treatments that do not focus on functional
      (task-specific) training for the hemiplegic arm. Bimanual training, implying training of
      activities requiring use of both arms, may however, be even more effective than mCIMT,
      provided that the training is of similar intensity. The purposes of this study are:

        1. To compare the functional effect of mCIMT to bimanual training of equal intensity in
           order to examine if one of the treatment approaches is superior to the other regarding
           the regaining of motor abilities.

        2. Based on fMRI scans of a subgroup of patients, to examine whether cortical
           reorganization after stroke differs depending on the type of treatment received (mCIMT
           vs bimanual training).

        3. To examine the rationale for implementing new treatment approaches in primary- and
           secondary health care, and thereby contribute to improved coordination between
           specialist and municipal health care systems.

      Patients in both groups will participate in a 4 week training program, either mCIMT or
      bimanual. In both groups cognitive techniques will be used to increase adherence. The
      patients will be examined when screening, before and after the intervention, and 3 months
      after completed intervention.
