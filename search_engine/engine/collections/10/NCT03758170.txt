      after Knee Arthroplasty in a Fast-Track setting.

      The investigators compare the already used dose(medium dose) with a new high dose(HD) steroid
      given as an intravenous bolus after the spinal anaesthesia has been given, but before the
      surgery starts.

      The hypothesis is that by attenuating the inflammatory response to the surgery itself by the
      steroid Dexamethasone, the investigators expect a reduction in postoperative pain upon
      ambulation 24 hours after unilateral Knee Arthroplasty.

      Patients referred to Unilateral Total KneeArthroplasty because of knee-osteoarthritis on
      Hvidovre Hospital, Capital Region of Denmark or Vejle Hospital, South Region of Denmark are
      screened and offered inclusion in the study.

      The two groups will be randomized and doubleblinded. One group will be treated, as the
      current guideline in the investigator's Orthopedic fast-track Arthroplasty center, with the
      medium dose of steroid (0,3 mg dexamethasone/kg bodyweight).

      The other group wil be treated with a high dose of steroid (1,0 mg dexamethasone/kg
      bodyweight).

      The patients will be monitored the first 7 days after surgery, during the admission to the
      hospital, and by a Pain-diary in the patients own home.

      Blood tests will be taken preoperatively and postoperatively to determine the effect of the
      highdose steroid on the inflammatory response. Also a series of blood tests determining the
      glucose-metabolism after the steroid-admission.
