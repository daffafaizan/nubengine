      treatment regimens has resulted in an increase in survival. Unfortunately, this improvement
      has come with a marked increase in acute and late-effects. Acute HNC treatment-related
      toxicities have been clearly and extensively documented; however, data pertaining to adverse
      late-effects, those most likely to impact the survivor's long term symptom burden,
      functionality, and overall quality of life (QOL), are limited. This pilot study will be
      conducted to examine the feasibility of tailored Hatha Yoga as a therapeutic modality to
      address MSI in patients who have survived HNC.
