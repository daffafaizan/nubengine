      patients may be difficult, with a reported failure rate of nearly 50% on the first attempt,
      with the head in neutral position there are many different maneuvers to facilitate the
      insertion of nasogastric tube published.

      Our hypothesis is that contralateral cricothyroid pressure to the selected nostril for
      nasogastric tube insertion will be able to avoid the difficulty.

      Therefore we are going to compare this technique with the conventional technique (head in
      neutral position) with lateral head turning group and contralateral cricothyroid pressure
      group We hope that the contralateral cricothyroid pressure will increase the success rate, as
      this will be helpful in intubated patients with neck pathology.
