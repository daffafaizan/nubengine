      body) from tree nuts is less than predicted by the Atwater factors (the standard approach to
      determining calorie value of a food). The Atwater approach is over 100 years old and is
      inaccurate for some foods. This study will be conducted to determine the metabolizable energy
      from two pulses, lentils and chickpeas. The study will be a human nutrition intervention
      involving consumption of a controlled diet followed by collection of urine and feces.
