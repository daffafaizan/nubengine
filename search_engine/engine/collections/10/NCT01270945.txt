      percutaneous revascularization of atherosclerotic disease in the femoropopliteal arterial
      system. Rates of restenosis are as high as 60% after a year. Treatment options include
      medical therapy, angioplasty, arthrectomy and stent placement. The heterogeneity of disease
      between patients, variable length of target lesions and presence of unpredictable physical
      forces requires individualized treatment plans.

      Vascular response to injury appears to play an important role in the development of
      restenosis. IL-1α is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in vascular
      inflammation and vascular smooth muscle proliferation--both in acute and chronic injury.
      CV-18C3 antagonizes the biologic activity of IL-1α and is theorized to prevent the early
      IL-1α mediated inflammation that leads to vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy and restenosis,
      as well as the late IL-1α mediated atherosclerotic plaque formation.
