      cardiac morbidity and mortality. They are likely to experience depressive symptoms after
      menopause, and the comorbidity of depression are related to altered autonomic function. We
      expect that postmenopausal women with depressive symptoms who receive breathing training will
      demonstrate decreased depressive symptoms and increased heart rate variability immediately
      upon and later after completion of training, and optimally contributing to improve autonomic
      nervous regulation in their later life to prevent undesired cardiac outcomes.
