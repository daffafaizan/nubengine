      PEI. Zenpep is a combination of three enzymes (proteins). These enzymes are normally produced
      by the pancreas and are important in the digestion of fats, proteins, and sugars. Zenpep is
      used to replace these enzymes when the body does not have enough of its own as a result of
      surgery and/or pancreatic cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying whether Zenpep will improve the
      ability of patients to complete adjuvant treatment for their pancreatic cancer after surgery
      to remove their tumor. The investigators are also studying if Zenpep will have an effect on
      nutrition status and quality of life for pancreatic cancer patients after they have had
      surgery to remove their tumor.
