      anterior perirectal fat is infection. Prophylactic antibiotics will be given, resulting in a
      <5% risk. Another possible risk (<5%) is an allergic reaction such as itching. Patients who
      are allergic to avian products will be excluded from the study. Tenderness and pain at the
      injection site are possible. Bleeding, bruising, redness, or discoloration or the formation
      of a bump (granuloma) or scar (keloid) at the injection site is also possible. Embolization
      of cross-linked hyaluronan gel through the blood is a potential, rare complication if the gel
      is injected into a blood vessel rather than into fat. Prada et al. did not see any side
      effects related to the injection or the material itself in 27 patients based on a mean
      follow-up of 13 months (range: 9-22 months). Patients did not complain of pain, tenesmus,
      rectal pressure, or a sensation of rectal filling. Risks beyond 22 months are not well
      defined. Potential benefits of cross-linked hyaluronan gel include fewer rectal complications
      due to radiotherapy for early-stage prostate cancer.
