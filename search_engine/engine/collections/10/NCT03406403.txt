      cases.(1)Although, Systemic and cerebral hemodynamic changes caused by extubation and
      emergence from anesthesia may endanger neurosurgical patients and increase the risk of
      postoperative intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral edema and may even result in the
      requirement of reoperation.(2) During this phase, heart rate and arterial blood pressure
      increase leading to increases in cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure.(3) Some
      studies have reported such hemodynamic effects in up to 50% of patients after supratentorial
      craniotomy.(4,5) Replacing the endotracheal tube (ETT) with laryngeal mask airway (LMA) prior
      to emergence from anesthesia is safe and effectively reduces the cardiovascular response.(6)
      The potential protective benefit of this approach has not yet been demonstrated for awakening
      neurosurgery patients, however.

      Magnesium is the forth most abundant cation in the body and the second most abundant
      intracellular cation. It activates many of the enzyme systems.(7) Magnesium sulphate inhibits
      catecholamines release from adrenergic nerve terminals and from adrenal medulla, through
      blocking N-type of Ca-channel at peripheral sympathetic nerve ending so it is used to
      decrease the adverse cardiovascular effects during larygeoscopy and endotracheal
      intubation.(8) But its role in attenuating stress response during extubation is not well
      studied and need more research.
