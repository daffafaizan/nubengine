    
      This is a prospective, randomized study designed to evaluate the effects of different
      communication modalities between surgeons and patients (subjects) in the immediate
      postoperative period. Given the nature of the study, it is not possible for either the
      surgeons or the subjects to be blinded. To reduce bias that may occur due to each surgeon's
      personal preference for postoperative communication modality, the surgeons (rather than
      individual subjects) will be randomized to one of the three communication modality groups (no
      communication on the day of surgery, voice call, or videoconferencing).
