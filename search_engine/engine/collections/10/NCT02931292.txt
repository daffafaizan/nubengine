      all age (1). The only treatment that proven effective option for a significant substantial
      long-term weight loss and that cures or durably improves comorbidities is still bariatric
      surgery (2, 3). Because obesity is a chronic disease, it is widely accepted that to
      accurately assess the efficacy and durability of any type of bariatric surgery requires
      lifetime follow-up to assess for weight loss, co-morbidity changes, and nutritional
      deficiencies.

      Despite initially performed as a first part of the staged procedures, the laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy (LSG) has since introduced as a stand-alone bariatric operation associated with
      good, short and mid-term weight loss and satisfactory complication rates when conducted in
      experienced hands. Although simplicity and the overall efficacy of the procedure supported by
      meta-analysis and systematic review (4, 5), there are still limited long-term outcome data
      (6). Due to publication bias or multiple controversies regarding the technique of LSG, some
      of the available data may have underreported which has also been resulted in questioning the
      long-term weight loss efficacy of the procedure.

      Although addressed by a recent consensus document,12 there are multiple controversies
      regarding the technique of LSG, and this may in part be what has led to the variable
      published results.

      The study objective was to assess the long-term (≥ 5 years) as well as short (1 to ≤ 3 years)
      and mid-term (> 3 to < 5 years) results in regard to the BMI change, resolution of
      co-morbidities and complications in 562 consecutive morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG as
      a primary procedure.
