      diastolic and mean arterial pressure to a reference pressure, it is the specific aim to
      collect all available data (waveforms, beat to beat data, status data) generated by the blood
      pressure monitor.

      After data analysis and comparison to patient's actual intra-arterial waveform, the outcome
      will be evaluated by Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)
      standards to see if the non invasive bloodpressure monitor can be validated for
      intraoperative use.

      The study is targeted at patients already monitored with a system that accurately measures
      and stores the intra-arterial waveform, such as the FloTrac system in the EV1000 monitor.

      This study is a substudy of a feasability protocol evaluating a new algorithm for the
      Clearsight system.
