      (natural cycle IVF) results in low pregnancy rates. One way to improve natural cycle IVF is
      to combine this procedure with the removal of immature eggs from the ovary and mature these
      eggs in the laboratory ( in vitro maturation-IVM). The in vitro mature eggs are fertilized
      and the resultant embryos are cultured using conventional IVF techniques.
