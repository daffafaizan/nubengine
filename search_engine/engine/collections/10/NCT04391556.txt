      disease in patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma (PA) remains an outstanding problem due to
      the lack of sensitivity of standard imaging techniques. The efficacy of empirical radiation
      therapy of the prostate + pelvis zone in only half of patients with increased PSA suggests an
      underestimation of lesions.

      PET-68Ga-PSMA or PET-PSMA technique showed a clear gain in sensitivity for the detection of
      lesions in this context compared to PET-Choline which was already more sensitive than
      standard imaging. It is about 50% for a PSA <0.5 ng / ml vs 20% for a PSA <1 ng / ml for
      TEP-Choline technique. However, the indication of empirical radiotherapy is raised when the
      PSA exceeds 0.2 ng / ml. It is therefore still necessary to increase the sensitivity of
      PET-PSMA.

      A flare-up-related effect was observed in a small animal experiment and in a patient after
      androgen blocking treatment, inducing a sharp increase in the intensity of previously
      visualized lesions and the appearance of 13 new lesions.

      It would therefore be possible to increase the expression of PSMA by the lesions at the
      origin of the biological recurrence of AP and thus to improve their detection by PET-PSMA
      after potentiation by short-term androgen blocking by an antagonist of LH-RH.
