      hormones, the sleep-wake cycle, the core body temperature, the tone of the autonomic nervous
      system and the activity rhythm are important both in health and disease processes. The
      investigators are interested in investigating the heart rate variability (HRV) during an
      acute surgical non-inflammatory condition, and to exam whether there are correlations
      between: HRV and sleep stages, HRV and cytokine levels in blood and HRV and subjective
      fatigue.
