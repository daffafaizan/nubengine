      causing reduced quality of life, private and socio-economic consequences in terms of medical
      consumption and work-related absenteeism. The clinical experience shows that physical
      activity, like cycling and brisk walking, can prevent migraine attacks, but the evidence of
      the efficacy is sparse.

      The primary aim of the study is to investigate the acute and the long term effect of exercise
      on patients suffering from migraine and co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain.

      The project will be the first of its kind that explores the effect of an exercise program on
      patients who both suffer from migraine, tension-type headache and neck pain. We expect that
      the participants from the exercise program will achieve a reduced pain impact on everyday
      life, an improved fitness and quality of life, and a decrease of absence days and medication
      use.
