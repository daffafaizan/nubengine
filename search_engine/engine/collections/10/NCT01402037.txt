      markers provide us with the unique opportunity to identify sufficiently large groups of
      high-risk first-degree relatives (> 50% risk of diabetes) of a proband with type 1 diabetes
      and of recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients with the overall aim to investigate the
      correlation between functional beta cell mass and glycemic variability in relation to
      metabolic outcome in order to determine thresholds of residual function below which:

        1. glucose tolerance starts to decline sharply in relatives

        2. the risk of deteriorating metabolic control and (severe) hypoglycemic events strongly
           increases in patients

      To this effect we will:

        1. measure and follow over a two-year period

             1. the functional beta cell mass of participants as determined by AUC C-peptide
                release - the preferred outcome measure in type 1 diabetes trials during
                hyperglycemic clamp test

             2. the participants' within- and between-day glycemic variability as determined by
                seven point selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose
                monitoring (CGM) during 5 days preceding each clamp procedure

        2. perform oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs; only in relatives), determine HbA1c levels
           centrally (relatives and patients) and record insulin requirements and hypoglycemic
           episodes (in patients) Our previous experiments have documented that the selected
           patients and relatives (see workplan) display large inter-individual differences in
           functional beta cell mass (ranging anywhere between control values and < 10% of
           controls) allowing to study glycemic variability as a function of residual cell function
           over a large range of values. They also illustrate that the recruitment capacity of the
           clinical network and the acceptance rate and compliance of the patients and relatives
           for the clamp procedure is high and sufficient to carry out the planned experiments.
