    
      Patients with painful bone metastases who meet the eligibility criteria and who have been
      determined to be an appropriate candidate for cryoablation therapy will be offered enrollment
      into the study. Cryoablation is the process of destroying tissue by the application of
      extremely cold temperatures. Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems are used as a surgical tool
      in the fields of general surgery, dermatology (skin), neurology (nerves), chest surgery
      (including lung), Ears-Nose-Throat (ENT), gynecology, oncology (cancer), proctology
      (colon/rectal) and urology (kidney).

      Patients agreeing to participate will read and sign an informed consent form and thus become
      subjects in the study. Treatment will be performed using a Galil Medical cryoablation system
      and Galil Medical cryoablation needles. Subjects will be followed for up to 24 weeks (6
      months) for palliation of pain, quality of life and analgesic usage. Baseline and follow-up
      data will be collected for each subject via a web-based electronic data collection tool.
