      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. The
      antidepressant effect is probably due to a stimulation of the serotonergic neurotransmission
      caused by the inhibition of the presynaptic serotonin reuptake. This inhibition may also be
      responsible for the increased pupil diameter seen in volunteers treated with racemic
      citalopram. Based on escitaloprams pharmacodynamic properties it is expected to have the same
      affect on pupil diameter. A dose/response relationship has not yet been established but
      theoretically the pupillary changes might serve as a biomarker for the serotonergic effect of
      escitalopram.

      Escitalopram is demethylated in part by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme 2C19
      (CYP2C19); but the impact of CYP2C19 polymorphism on the total metabolism of escitalopram is
      still to be investigated.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) and to investigate
      whether change in pupil size reaction to a light stimulus can act as a biomarker for the
      serotonergic effect of escitalopram.

      The study will be conducted as a randomized, double blinded; placebo controlled two phases
      cross-over trial with single and repeated doses of 20 mg escitalopram and equivalent placebo.
      Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 EMs and 8 PMs) will participate in the trial. Prior to the
      trial, approximately 400 volunteers will be phenotyped by omeprazole metabolic ratio in order
      to identify the CYP2C19 EMs and PMs.

      During the two phases blood samples will be drawn and pupil sizes will be measured at fixed
      time points after drug administration.
