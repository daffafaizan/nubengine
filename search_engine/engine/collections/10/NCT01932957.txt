      has become the standard of care in many institutions around the world. Laparotomy is still
      the standard of care at Kalafong Hospital. There is very little high quality evidence with
      regard to the optimal surgical management approach for women with ruptured ectopic
      pregnancies.

      The study aims to compare laparotomy with laparoscopy in this group of women with regards to
      outcomes such as length of hospital stay, number of days off work and pain.

      This randomised study will be conducted at Kalafong hospital, on 140 patients diagnosed with
      ruptured ectopic pregnancy who are haemodynamically stable and are able and willing to
      provide informed consent.
