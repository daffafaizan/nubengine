    
      The incidence of pain after laparoscopy may be as high as 36 to 63 percent and is attributed
      to the carbon dioxide gas (CO2) used to induce pneumo-peritoneum1.

      The residual part of CO2 remains in the peritoneal cavity for several days after the
      operation and causes stretching of the phrenic nerve endings, local hypothermia, and
      diaphragmatic irritation by carbonic acid formation
