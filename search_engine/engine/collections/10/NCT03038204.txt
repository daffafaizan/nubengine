      Among several surgical procedures, mitral ring annuloplasty has been the method of choice for
      a considerable period. However, mitral regurgitation recurrence after surgery has a reported
      occurrence that ranges from 5% to 58%. Careful consideration of the mechanisms underlying
      recurrence of mitral regurgitation after annuloplasty might explain the unsatisfactory
      outcomes. The pathophysiology of IMR is complex and results from the imbalance between
      closing and tethering forces acting on the mitral valve. Enlargement of the left ventricular
      chamber, and displacement of papillary muscles in apical and lateral direction increase the
      tethering forces. Left ventricular and papillary muscle dyssynchrony, reduced myocardial
      contractility decrease closing forces, which lead to impaired leaflet coaptation and
      appearance of mitral regurgitation. Thus, treatment of mitral insufficiency requires an
      integrated approach affecting all units of the pathogenesis of MR recurrence.

      Recent publications show that an adjunctive subvalvular repair during mitral annuloplasty for
      secondary mitral regurgitation effective in preventing recurrent regurgitation. One of these
      procedures is the papillary muscles approximation. However, the safety and the positive
      impact of this method are still in doubt. This study is conducted to identify the positive
      qualities and safety of this technique.
