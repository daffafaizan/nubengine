      bioavailability of two formulations of 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride tablets under fasting
      conditions. The study was conducted with 32 (30 completing) healthy adults in accordance with
      Protocol No. 10640302 (Revision 0). In each study period, a single dose (1 x 1000 mg tablet)
      was administered to all subjects following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The test
      formulation was Ohm Laboratories, Inc's (A Group of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc.) Metformin
      Hydrochloride 1000 mg Tablets and the reference formulation was GLUCOPHAGEÂ® (metformin
      hydrochloride) 1000 mg Tablets (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company). The subjects received the test
      product in one study period and the reference product in the other period; the order of
      administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. There was a 7-day interval
      between treatments.

      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 24 hours after each dose. The
      plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to Helen
      Fassoulas, Director of Operations, Warnex Bioanalytical Services Inc., 3885 boul Industriel,
      Laval, Quebec, H7L4S3 Canada, Telephone: 450-663-6724, Fax: 450-975-8111 for determination of
