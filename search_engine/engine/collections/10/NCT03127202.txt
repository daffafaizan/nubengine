      polarities in the Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy-Defibrillator could bypass phrenic nerve
      stimulation at least in 90% of implants.

      Success was defined as an absence of phrenic nerve stimulation (threshold > 7V) or in case of
      phrenic nerve stimulation occurrence (threshold < 7V), as the resolution of the phrenic nerve
      stimulation by reprogramming one of the 3 left ventricular pacing polarities available in the
      device : left ventricular tip- left ventricular ring (bipolar), left ventricular tip- right
      ventricular ring (pseudo-bipolar) and left ventricular ring-right ventricular coil.

      Any occurrence of phrenic nerve stimulation without resolution by reprogramming was
      considered as a failure.
