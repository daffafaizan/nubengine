      mortality and healthcare utilization. This viral disease is caused by the Coronaviruses (CoV)
      which belong to the genus'coronavirus' of the Coronaviridae family.

      Coronaviruses are enveloped positive strand RNA viruses with the largest known RNA
      genomes-30-32 kb-with a 50 -cap structure and 30 -poly-A tail (Lei et al.2018). The
      transcription works through the replication-transcription complex (RCT) organized in
      double-membrane vesicles and via the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) sequences. Of
      note, transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences, located between
      the so-called open reading frames (ORFs). In the atypical CoV genome, at least six ORF scan
      could be present (Woo et al., 2020) .

      Health workers are at the front line of the COVID-19 outbreak response and as such are
      exposed to hazards that put them at risk of infection (Li e al.,2020). thus keeping the
      implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) and its knowledge and practice are
      of great importance in healthcare settings to protect them from infections (Wang et al.,
      2020).
