      clinical benefits the Avenir Completeâ„¢ femoral stem and its instrumentation when used in
      primary total, hemi, and revision hip arthroplasty:

      The primary endpoint is defined by the survival of the implant system at 10 years, which is
      based on the removal or intended removal of the "study device and determined using Kaplan
      Meier method. The safety of the system will be assessed by monitoring the frequency and
      incidence of adverse events. Relation of the events to implant, instrumentation and/or
      procedure should be specified.

      The secondary endpoints are the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording
      patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs) as well as radiographic outcomes (if
      available).
