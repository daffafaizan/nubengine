        -  To characterize Stat3 signaling pathway activity in primary tissue samples from
           pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia to determine the percentage of samples
           with increased activity and to better understand the mechanisms leading to increased
           activity.

        -  To evaluate the presence of constitutive Stat3 activation and the sensitivity of Stat3
           activation to low and high doses of cytokines.

        -  To evaluate the expression levels of Stat3 protein as well as upstream and downstream
           regulators of Stat3 activation.

        -  To classify tissue samples according to a Stat3-activation pattern, and to correlate
           this result with event-free survival and overall survival in order to determine whether
           increased Stat3 phosphorylation at diagnosis predicts poor outcome.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved cell samples are collected for laboratory analysis, including
      immunoblotting, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and protein analysis.
