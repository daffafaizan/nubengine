      particularly in Southeast Asia. However, given a lack of diagnostics available in
      resource-poor countries, many vector-borne diseases are never diagnosed and therefore their
      impact is underappreciated. Cross-sectional retrospective surveys have revealed higher than
      expected antibody prevalence to a number of diseases including mosquito-borne viruses and
      ectoparasite-borne rickettsial diseases.

      Here, we aim to collect specimens from febrile individuals to better describe the febrile
      disease landscape of Cambodia using novel genomics technologies (unbiased next-generation
      sequencing) to investigate possible infectious etiologies of illnesses of unexplained
      etiology in Cambodian children and adults. With the current rise of vector-borne diseases
      around the world, we hope the results of this study contribute to better understanding the
      epidemiology and burden for vector-borne diseases in this region.
