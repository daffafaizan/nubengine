    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, multi-center, randomized controlled study of
      80 Parkinson's disease patients with gait and balance disorders in which 40 patients will be
      treated with serious games, in addition to their usual care, for 12 months and 40 patients
      will be treated with their usual care during this period. This study will be conducted in 4
      centers, all of which are expert in the management of these patients.

      After randomization, each patient in the "Intervention-Rehabilitation through Toap Run" group
      will have to complete 2 to 3 sessions per week at home with the serious game "TOAP RUN" using
      the KinectÂ® system for 1 year.

      The primary endpoint is a medical-economic endpoint: the difference in incremental
      cost-utility ratio at 12 months between the 2 groups of patients. Costs will be assessed at
      inclusion, at the end of 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints include clinical and
      neurophysiological assessments, focusing on gait and balance disorders, as well as cognition
      and emotional state. An imaging study for patients included in the Paris-ICM center is also
      planned to study the effects of serious game rehabilitation on brain function.

      Patients in both groups will be free to use SG at the end of the intervention.
