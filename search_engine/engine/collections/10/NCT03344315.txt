      primary response variable the sample size was estimated in 20 patients. In addition, taking
      into account possible drop-outs, the investigators would increase the number of patients by
      20%, finally recruiting 24 patients per group.

      Randomization was performed by computer generated random codes Study locations will include
      two private centers in Spain. A single calibrated examiner, blind with respect to the
      treatment assignment, will perform all measurements at all center.

      A biostatistician blind with respect to treatment assignment will perform the analysis.

      Interventions and Duration The two intervention groups will consist of surgery with
      connective tissue graft (standard of care control) and surgery with the application of
      Mucograft Collagen Matrix (MCM, Test group). Experienced clinicians will deliver treatment
      consisting of root coverage surgery using coronally advanced flaps, the most utilized
      procedure for coverage of recessions. Surgery will be standardized and the same
      procedures/materials will be employed to ensure consistency.

      Follow-up of individual patients will be 12 months.
