      pathology remain underdiagnosed. The investigators will screen all new patients with
      bilateral severe to profound HL, looking for DFNB9. They will analyse their electrophysiology
      (auditory potential, and otoacoustic emission), and their audio-vestibular profile, at an
      early stage and one year after inclusion. All patients will be seen in the genetic clinic.
      Also, the investigators will analyse all patients with ANAD profile and patients known with
      ANAD.

      All informations will provide precise data base to allow a better understanding of the
      pathology. It might also lead to select the best candidates for future gene therapy
