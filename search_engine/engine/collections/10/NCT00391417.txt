      reproductive development in women. Estrogens serve many functions in the body. They stimulate
      oocyte maturation and endometrial growth, decrease bone resorption, initiate the development
      of secondary sex characteristics, maintain reproductive organs and glands, and affect the
      activity of the central nervous system. At menopause, the decrease in estrogen concentrations
      is often accompanied by vascular instability (hot flushes and night sweats), a rise in the
      incidence of heart disease, and an increasing rate of bone loss. Estrogen is available as an
      oral drug, a transdermal patch, or as a gel or lotion. Transdermal estrogen is preferable as
      compared to oral, since it avoids the first-pass metabolism in the liver. Since release of
      the WHI findings, current treatment recommendations are for the lowest effective dose for the
      shortest period of time to treat postmenopausal symptoms.

      Comparison: Three doses of a transdermal estradiol gel as compared to placebo for the
      treatment of vasomotor and vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms in postmenopausal women.
