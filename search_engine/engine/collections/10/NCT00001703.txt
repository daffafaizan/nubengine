      States. 11,000 of these cases will die from the disease. More than half of patients present
      with advanced or metastatic disease for which chemotherapy plays a very limited role.
      Therefore, development of another therapeutic approach is needed. Cancers in humans are
      commonly associated with mutations in dominant and recessive oncogenes. These genes produce
      mutated proteins that are unique to cancer cells. Von Hipple-Lindau gene, which is associated
      with the development of the VHL disease, has been recently mapped and cloned; it is found to
      be mutated in 57% of sporadic renal cell carcinomas.

      Data in mice have shown the generation of MHC restricted CTL that are capable of detecting
      endogenous cytoplasmic peptide derived from mutated oncogenes. In addition, we have recently
      demonstrated, by conducting different phase I clinical trials in which we vaccinate cancer
      patients with mutated Ras or p53 peptides corresponding to the abnormality patients harbor in
      their tumors, that in some patients we can generate immunological responses represented by
      the generation of lymphocytes (CD4+ and/or CD8+). In the current study, we would like to
      extend our observations to test whether VHL tumor suppressor protein can be immunologically
      targeted by vaccination. We have identified specific epitopes along the amino acid sequence
      of the VHL protein which represent known specific HLA class-I binding motifs. These amino
      acids stretches in the VHL protein correspond to the area of the point mutation hot spots.
      Therefore, this protocol treats patients with sporadic RCC who carry VHL mutations in their
      tumors with corresponding mutant VHL peptide vaccination.
