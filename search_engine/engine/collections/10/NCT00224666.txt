      localization. The pharmacological therapeutic arsenal answers only partially the
      symptomatology often very invalidating which these chronic painful patients present. Electric
      stimulations of the central nervous system currently validated, in particular of the
      posterior cords of marrow made a significant improvement in a certain number of indications.
      Nevertheless, considerable patients are not relieved significantly, in particular those
      presenting of the pains neurogeneses of central origin (syndromes thalamic for example). It
      is within this framework that recently the stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex developed.
