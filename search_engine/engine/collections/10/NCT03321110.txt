      muscle impairment, inflammation and exercise fatigue to athletes easily. Such above
      conditions will affect the exercise performances and health of athletes. The aims of the
      study are 1) to compare the differences in plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant
      capacity, muscle impairment, fatigue recovery, and inflammation and exercise performances in
      athletes (i.e., soccer, and taekwondo players) and healthy non-athletes; 2) to investigate
      the relationship between plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, muscle
      impairment, fatigue recovery, and inflammation and exercise performances; 3) to explore the
      influence on plasma coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, muscle impairment,
      fatigue recovery, and inflammation and exercise performances after 12 weeks of coenzyme Q10
      intervention (150 mg/day and 300 mg/day). Eventually, these results of this study can provide
      the information for the known to improve the oxidative stress, anti-oxidation and
      inflammation internal to the bodies of athletes for various competitions. As a consequence,
      the athletic performances can be further enhanced.
