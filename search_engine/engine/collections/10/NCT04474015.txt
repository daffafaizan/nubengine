      waveform utilized (DC 0.75 Hz, modified AC 0.75 Hz, AC sinusoidal 3.0 Hz or pulsed
      stimulation of up to 500 ms duration). These waveforms were chosen based on the physiology of
      slow-wave sleep (SWS). Ultimately, the goal is to use TES during sleep to enhance the
      slow-wave activity (SWA) of sleep. Slow-wave sleep is characterized by two main frequency
      bands with differing underlying physiologies: (1) slow oscillation activity with a peak of
      0.75 Hz, and (2) delta activity with a peak of approximately 3.0 Hz. Therefore, in future
      studies, the plan is to stimulate at one or both of these frequencies. The endogenous slow
      activity of the brain consists of electrical fields of "alternating current" with periods of
      relative cellular depolarization and periods of relative cellular hyperpolarization. The goal
      is to enhance this endogenous behavior with transcranial electrical stimulation at the two
      major slow- wave frequencies (0.75 Hz, 3.0 Hz), or using a pulsed stimulation paradigm to
      induce slow wave activity.
