    
      This study is a 6-month double-blind randomized trial comparing intra-detrusor botulinum
      toxin A (Botox A®) and anticholinergic therapy in women without neurologic disease with urge
      incontinence. Subjects will be followed up to an additional six months off study drug to
      determine duration of treatment effect.

      The primary aim is to compare the change in urge incontinence episodes over 6 months between
      women receiving a single intra-detrusor injection of 100 unit of botulinum toxin A (Botox A®)
      plus daily oral placebo tablets versus women receiving a single intra-detrusor injection of
      saline plus daily anticholinergic therapy.
