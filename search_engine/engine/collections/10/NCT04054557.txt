      I. To evaluate if the utilization of automated patient reported outcomes and follow up
      Telehealth can improve patient adherence with adjuvant endocrine therapy during the first 12
      months of study participation.

      II. To evaluate if the utilization of Smart Pill Bottles and follow-up Telehealth encounters
      can improve patient adherence with adjuvant endocrine therapy during the first 12 months of
      study participation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the utilization of automated patient reported outcome and follow-up
      Telehealth encounters can improve quality of life and decrease side effects while taking
      adjuvant endocrine therapy.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care office visits approximately every 3 months for one
      year.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care as in Arm I and 4 automated electronic surveys
      every 3 weeks (+/- 1 weeks) for a total of 18 electronic surveys over one year. Patients who
      report severe or very severe side effects, or stopping or are thinking about stopping their
      endocrine therapy (ET) will have a follow up encounter with a research coordinator.

      ARM III: Patients receive a wireless smart pill bottle that performs daily time-specific
      reminders to open the pill bottle and take the medication. Additional messages are triggered
      by the pill bottle when non-adherence is indicated (lack of bottle opening or no change in
      remaining pills), as well as when medication is skipped.
