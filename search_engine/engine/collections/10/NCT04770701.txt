      glutinosum, and ascorbic acid are used to elevate T and B lymphocytes level, protect their
      cells membrane, decrease the damage of HIV on CD4+ T.

      In detail, Diosgenin presented in dioscorea cirrhosa is a precursor of cortisol. Dioscorea
      cirrhosa when combined with ascorbic acid helps to balance cortisol levels which reduces cell
      inflammation. Flavonoids of dioscorea cirrhosa also help to increase CD4+ T levels.

      impatiens balsamina can be used as an antitoxin alternative against bacteria or viruses.
      Flavonoids in impatiens balsamina, such as kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, astragalin, have the
      ability to reduce the virus's impact on T lymphocyte, protect their cell membrane, produce
      antihistamine, protect the cell from inflammation.

      Targeted flavonoids in eclipta prostrata, phyllanthus urinaria, adenosma glutinosum are used
      to cell repair, protect and increase CD4+ T production.

      Ascorbic acid in combination with herbal extracts creates a favorable environment for body
      metabolism, improves the medication's effectiveness.
