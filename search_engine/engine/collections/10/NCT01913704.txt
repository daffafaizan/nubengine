      "non-healing", defined as a reduction in wound surface of < 25% after two weeks of standard
      best practice wound care . On enrolment and randomisation to active or placebo treatment the
      patient will be treated for six weeks or until 100% epithelialisation, whichever is the
      sooner, and then treatment will revert to standard best practice, defined as moist wound
      healing plus compression where appropriate. The reference ulcer will be followed up at two
      weeks and then at six weeks after the end of the active treatment period.
