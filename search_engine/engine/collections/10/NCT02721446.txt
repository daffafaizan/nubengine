      for behavioral economics as a guide to activation interventions. Specifically, the
      investigators will use the MINDSPACE framework that was created by some of the founders of
      behavioral economics. That framework details nine approaches to behavioral activation that
      have particularly solid evidence bases. Two of these, salience and incentives, the
      investigative team identified as most promising and practical for stroke activation.

      Aims:

        1. Use electronic health record data to construct Framingham stroke risk scores in both
           Richard L. Roudebush Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Eskenazi Health System.

        2. Conduct iterative testing with high risk stroke patients from both health systems to
           refine two different stroke risk messages based on the behavioral strategies of salience
           and incentives.

        3. Conduct a randomized trial of four mailed stroke risk messages, comparing the impact on
           patient activation of: 1) a standard stroke risk message, 2) a salience-focused stroke
           risk message, 3) an incentive-focused stroke risk message, and 4) a salience plus
           incentive message.

        4. Compare the proportion in each messaging group that completes a stroke risk factor
           relevant healthcare system visit within two months of receiving the stroke risk message.
