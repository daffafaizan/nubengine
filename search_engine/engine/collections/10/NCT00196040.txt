      stroke, transient ischemic attack, and right to left gas embolism in severe decompression
      illness. An association between patent foramen ovale and severe migraine headaches has also
      been reported. Several implantable devices are being used for percutaneous closure of patent
      foramen ovale; we propose to use a non-implantable system to safely effect closure.
