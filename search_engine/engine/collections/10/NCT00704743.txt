    
      Primary: To determine the effectiveness of three immobilization methods (circumferential cast
      [CC], volar dorsal splint [VDS], modified sugar-tong [MST] splint) in maintaining the
      position of displaced distal radius fractures after successful closed reduction.

      Secondary to assess long term functional outcomes associated with fiberglass splint
      immobilization versus standard cylindrical casting in patients maintaining initial
      non-operative reductions.

      Design: Randomized prospective single blind controlled trial Patients/Participants: Patients
      over 18 years of age who presented to the emergency department with a displaced fracture of
      the distal radius, requiring closed reduction.

      Outcome Measurements: Loss of reduction (radiological slippage or the need for surgical
      fixation during the 3-4 week primary immobilization period after initial successful
      reduction). Secondary outcomes were DASH score, return to work, activities of daily living
      (ADL), wrist pain, range of motion (ROM) and grip strength.
