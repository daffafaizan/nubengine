      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with advanced and/or inoperable
           cholangiocarcinoma or carcinoma of the gallbladder treated with gemcitabine and
           capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine time to disease progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12.

      Patients are followed monthly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-17 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
