    
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders among older
      adults. Anxiety in older adults is associated with decreased physical activity, poorer
      self-perceptions of health, decreased life satisfaction, and increased loneliness. Because
      many older adults with anxiety seek assistance in a medical setting, treatment has been
      primarily pharmacological. There is, however, limited evidence of the effectiveness of
      psychotropic medications. Given the potential difficulties in prescribing psychotropic
      medications in later life (e.g., increased adverse effects, potential drug interactions),
      psychosocial treatments may be important alternative or adjuncts.

      The treatment phase of this study lasts 10 weeks, during which patients will be randomly
      assigned to either cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or usual care. Follow-up will last 12
      months after treatment completion, during which time patients will complete telephone
      assessments.
