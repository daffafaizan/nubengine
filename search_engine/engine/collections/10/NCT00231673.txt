      topiramate on clinical and electrophysiological parameters in patients with diabetic
      peripheral polyneuropathy. Patients will undergo the Baseline Phase when they are tapered off
      other pain medications, have diabetes controlled and eligibility reassessed. Patients will
      then be randomized to receive either topiramate or placebo and enter the Double-Blind Phase,
      which consists of Titration Period (topiramate dose will be titrated from 25mg/day to
      200mg/day over 42 days) and Maintenance Period (study medication will be continued for 12
      weeks). After the Double-Blind Phase, study medication will be tapered off during the Taper
      Phase, whose duration will vary depending on each patient. The evaluations include
      electrophysiological assessment, quantitative sensory assessment, and clinical assessment
      such as subjective pain scales. Safety evaluations (vital signs, clinical laboratory
      evaluations, physical and neurological examination, and evaluations of adverse events) will
      be conducted during the trial. During the first 42 days, doses of topiramate gradually
      increase to achieve the target dose (200mg daily by mouth), and then the dose is maintained
      for 12 weeks, after which the dose is slowly reduced and stopped over 12 weeks.
