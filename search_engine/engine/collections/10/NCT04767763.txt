      Poland, the study was carried out between February 2019 and February 2020 among 32 patients
      admitted to ICU. There was no need to obtain written consent from the patients since the
      study was observational with no therapeutic intervention and decisional incapacity caused
      either by sedative drugs or severe condition of the patient.

      Patients with acute kidney injury and indications for initiation of continuous renal
      replacement therapy (CRRT) were included to this study irrespective of their gender, race and
      age. Exclusion criteria were patients with previous end-stage chronic kidney disease treated
      with dialysis.

      After decision to implement CRRT the serial blood samples were collected into two red-top
      tube (no anticoagulant or preservative) before initiation of CRRT and at
      1,2,3,6,9,12,15,18-day following. Last samples were collected 3 days after the end of CRRT.
      Level of TSH, fT3 and fT4 were checked from the first tube after collecting the blood. Second
      tube was kept frozen until levels of TRH, TT3, TT4, rT3 could be measured. In all the
      patients high-dose continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) with citrate
      anticoagulation was performed. Blood flow and dialysis dosage were the same for every patient
      depending on their weight. The weight was rounded up or down and patients were assigned to
      the nearest group.
