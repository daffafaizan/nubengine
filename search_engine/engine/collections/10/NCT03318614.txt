      bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) during the peak flood period. One major reason is poor sanitation,
      water and hygiene practice by flood victims during the flood because of poor access to clean
      water. The mechanism how poor hygiene causes non-specific abdominal complaints is unknown.
      The investigators speculated that small intestinal overgrowth (SIBO) is the fundamental basis
      for the increase in reported cases of acute gastroenteritis and abdominal complaints among
      flood victims. The investigators further speculated that administration of antibiotics or
      probiotics could reduce the abdominal symptoms after three months.

      Therefore, the intervention study was conducted for three months. Compliance of participants
      was checked by a diary given to participants in the M-63 group to document their daily intake
      of probiotics. This study will for the first time demonstrate the fundamental mechanism
      behind the poor WaSH practices and gastrointestinal disturbances after flood. Also this study
      would support a role for probiotic intervention to reduce abdominal complications when the
      next flood occurs.
