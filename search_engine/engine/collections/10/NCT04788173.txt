      is the result of the fibrogenesis that occurs with chronic liver injury.

      Lipoproteins are complexes of lipid and proteins that are essential for transport of soluble
      vitamins Liver cells play a serious task in the regulation of lipid metabolism. The principal
      location for lipoprotein and cholesterol synthesis is in the liver.

      In healthy individuals, a compound equilibrium is preserved between utilization,
      biosynthesis, and transfer of lipid fractions.

      Many diseases that affect the parenchyma can lead to changes in the structure of lipoproteins
      and transport throughout the blood.

      Nevertheless, in cirrhotic patients, the metabolism of lipid is changed such that glycogen
      stores are significantly diminished, contributing to malnutrition and biolysis.

      The preceding studies have reported that cirrhotic patients have abnormal metabolism of
      lipids, especially reduction in cholesterol level and hypobetalipoproteinemia.

      These alterations develop together with the progression of liver disease and may be
      considered as a prognostic markers for liver decompensation.

      The maneuvers concerned with the decline of lipid particles in patients with cirrhosis are
      compound and need multiple researches for complete understanding.

      Protein microsomal triglyceride (TG) transfer protein -+ MTP], enzymatic (acylCoA:
      cholesterol acyltransferase), and apoprotein (Apo AI) reduction are considered to be linked
      to these changes.

      Owing to the wide occurrence of liver disease in Egypt, we made this study to assess lipid
      profile in cirrhotic patients and to evaluate its relation to the degree of cirrhosis.
