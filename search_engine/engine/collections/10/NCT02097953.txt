      providing informed consent, participants meeting inclusion criteria will be administered
      daptomycin 6 mg/kg over 2 minutes and blood and urine samples will be collected over a 24
      hour period after infusion. Following this, participants will be given a 13 day supply of
      rifampin 600 mg/day to be taken at home. After completion of the rifampin course, a second
      pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed (day 15 overall). Participants will be
      administered a dose of rifampin 600 mg then once again be administered daptomycin 6 mg/kg
      over 2 minutes and blood and urine samples will be collected over a second 24 hour period. A
      blood sample will be obtained at the first study visit for determination of each
      participant's P-glycoprotein genotype.
