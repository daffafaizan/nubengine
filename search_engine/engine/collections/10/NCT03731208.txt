    
      Aim The objectives of this project are to assess the feasibility of using a
      telerehabilitation program for patients after a knee operation and investigate the acceptance
      of the provided solution by the patients and healthcare professionals.

      Hypothesis It is hypothesized that the acceptance and satisfaction of patients and healthcare
      professionals by using the telerehabilitation program will be high and correlated with
      patients' exercise adherence and health recovery.

      Telerehabilitation Group (Target Group) The subjects will be recruited before the operation
      and will be followed during an 8-week rehabilitation period.

      In addition to the telerehabilitation program, the subjects will receive the regular
      treatment offered by Fars√∏ Hospital in connection with total knee replacement surgery and are
      to follow the same rehabilitation procedure as regular patients (see below).

      Before the operation, the project physiotherapist will hand over the telerehabilitation
      system equipment and instruct the subject how to use the system. In addition, the
      physiotherapist will also ask the subject to follow the instruction process and try the
      available services a few times. The physiotherapist makes sure that the subject can operate
      the system easily and without any challenges.
