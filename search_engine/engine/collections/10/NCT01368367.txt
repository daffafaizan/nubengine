      twenty years, considerable physical and psychosocial morbidity still persists. While exercise
      is strongly recommended to assist recovery and overall outcome, there is limited evidence in
      adults to indicate whether it is effective and/or safe.

      This study will investigate the effect of a high intensity aerobic and resisted exercise
      program exercise program on safety, physical, functional and quality of life measures in
      adults post burn injury.
