      Nigeria and two in Ethiopia) and samples will be processed in a single reference laboratory.
      This diagnostic evaluation trial will comprise two experimental diagnostic schemes which will
      be compared against the standard of care:

        -  One experimental arm (scheme 1) will screen all patients for HIV using two rapid tests
           routinely used by the clinics and a rapid CRP. Selected patients will be further tested
           using ULTRA. Individuals with HIV will undergo an HIV VL using Xpert.

        -  A second experimental arm (scheme 2): will screen individuals for HIV and CRP (as in
           scheme 1) and selected patients will be tested using Molbio Truenat MTB. Individuals
           with HIV will undergo an HIV VL using Molbio Truenat HIV-VL and Truenat RIF.

        -  In addition, all patients will be tested using the standard of care consistent of
           confirmatory HIV and CRP tests, Xpert MTB/RIF and culture.

             -  Randomisation All patients will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 into schemes 1 and
                2. Random numbers will be generated in LSTM by a statistician independent to the
                study. The scheme allocations will be included in study envelopes assigned to
                individual study numbers. Equal number of participants will be included in Nigeria
                and Ethiopia.

             -  Proposed methods for protecting against source bias

      As this is an open trial, the classification of patients will be based on objective
      quantitative results of laboratory tests. It is expected the test performances will vary
      according to HIV status. Participants will be classified according to their experimental test
      results
