    
      Two mL of blood will be obtained for pharmacogenomic screening for CYP3A5 and ABCB1
      genotypes. Patients with the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype will be consented for the pharmacokinetic
      portion of the study. Volunteers from this patient cohort will participate in 2 overnight
      visits to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC).

      Patients will report to the GCRC on the evening before each study visit. They will be
      required to fast from midnight the night before until 1 hour after tacrolimus administration,
      which will be in the morning approximately at 8 am.

      Pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus will be assessed on 2 occasions with and without ketoconazole
      coadministration separated by 1 week. The order of study occasions will be randomized in a
      crossover design. Each patient will take their take their usual oral dose of tacrolimus and
      have whole blood levels obtained immediately before (C0) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 hours
      after the tacrolimus dose. They will then receive tacrolimus by intravenous infusion, a
      therapeutic dose over four hours. The IV dose will take the place of the patients' usual
      evening dose of tacrolimus. Additional blood will be drawn for tacrolimus at 0.25, 0.5, 1,
      1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 hours after the intravenous dose. During the ketoconazole visit,
      tacrolimus doses will be decreased by one-half to account for the drug interaction and avoid
      potential tacrolimus-induced toxicities. Ketoconazole 200 mg will be administered orally
      every 12 hours for a total of 3 doses; the first ketoconazole dose will be given 13 hours
      before tacrolimus administration.
