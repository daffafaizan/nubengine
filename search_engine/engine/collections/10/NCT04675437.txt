      in decreased reserves of intrinsic capacity, which confers extreme vulnerability to
      stressors. Based on previous research, there are indications that frailty is highly prevalent
      in HF, CABG and mini-AVR patients. As a consequence, these patients (both men and women of 65
      years or older) will be included in this research project. The 12-week aerobic exercise
      program (3 sessions per week) will consist of ergometer, treadmill and arm-ergometer
      exercises. The intensity will be based on the maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) of
      the patient and will correspond with a heart rate between the first and second ventilatory
      threshold (with a gradual progression over time).

      Secondary, correlations will be examined between markers of the CPET and frailty markers.
