      multi-center (study conducted in more than 1 center) study to identify the risk factors, then
      develop and validate the predictive Nomogram of metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC) that will effectively predict the early onset mCRPC in patients receiving
      androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). The entire duration of study will be approximately 3
      year. Participants will primarily be evaluated for achieving biochemical or radiological
      progression after receiving ADT based on EAU 2017 practice guideline criteria. Serum
      testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and blood routine
      will be monitored throughout the study.
