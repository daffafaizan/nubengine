        -  Determine if polymorphisms resulting in greater activation of cyclophosphamide (CYP2B6,
           CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) are associated with disease-free survival and treatment toxicities
           in women with breast cancer.

        -  Determine if polymorphisms resulting in less production of quinone-related oxidative
           damage of doxorubicin hydrochloride (NQO1, NQO2, NOS2, NOS3, CBR3) are associated with
           disease-free survival and treatment toxicities in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue samples archived on clinical trial SWOG-8897 are genotyped for polymorphisms in the
      CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, NQO1, NQO2, NOS2, NOS3, and CBR3 genes by matrix-assisted laser
      desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Variant alleles are correlated with
      patient outcome.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,577 patients will be accrued for this study.
