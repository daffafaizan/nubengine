    
      The following are the specific study aims and hypotheses:

      Aim 1: To create an appropriate and usable adaptation of the GLB program for people with
      mobility impairment.

      Hypothesis 1.1: Advisory board participants will identify key adaptations to make the GLB
      materials appropriate and usable for individuals with impaired mobility.

      Aim 2: To establish whether the adapted GLB program for people with mobility impairment is a
      feasible intervention.

      Hypothesis 2.1: Intervention participants will rate the program satisfactorily and attend at
      least 2/3rd of the weekly group-based meetings and monthly individualized phone calls.
      Lifestyle coaches will also rate the adapted program satisfactorily.

      Aim 3: To determine if the GLB intervention adapted for those with mobility impairment is
      effective as determined by significant improvement in the primary and secondary outcomes in
      the intervention group compared to the wait-list control group at 3 and 6 months from
      baseline.

      Hypothesis 3.1: The intervention group will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in
      our primary outcomes (weight and PA) than the wait list control group at 3 and at 6 months
      and will show significant improvements in secondary outcomes at 6 months. Hypothesis 3.2:
      Both groups combined will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in the primary
      outcomes (weight and PA) after 3, 6 and 12 months of intervention and secondary outcomes
      after 6 and 12 months of intervention.
