    
      This is a randomized, assessor-blinded clinical trial to determine whether a novel
      plaque-based dosimetry strategy can improve the speed of response to excimer laser treatment
      in patients with plaque psoriasis. Each patient will receive plaque-based dosing on one side
      of the body and conventional dosing on the contralateral side. This design is based on the
      assumption that psoriasis usually affects patients in a symmetric distribution (e.g., knees
      and elbows) and the effect of excimer laser phototherapy is limited to the treated plaque.
      The side of the body treated with plaque-based dosimetry will be assigned using a table of
      random numbers. The assessor will be blinded to the treatment group. Each patient will be
      treated 1-2 times per week at the discretion of the investigator for a maximum of 10
      treatments.
