      and/or cryosurgery.

      The Modulated Imaging can measure tissue optical properties that effect the Photodynamic
      therapy treatment process can show spectral absorption and scattering coefficients, oxy- and
      deoxy-hemoglobin, water, melanin and use that information to provide customized laser light
      treatment.

      The researchers can use an imaging system that can characterize the tissue and
      photosensitizer optical properties and use that information to drive a treatment light
      projection system that can spatially optimize the light irradiance for personalized
      treatment, thus improving outcomes.
