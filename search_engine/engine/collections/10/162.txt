effects of ruminal insufflation on cerebral circulation and metabolismin the goat .the effects of nitrogen insufflation of the cannulated rumen werestudied in 10 goats . parameters which were measured included cerebralblood flow, mean carotid arterial pressure, pressure in the confluenceof sinuses, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, blood oxygen and carbondioxide contents, packed cell volume (pcv), and hemoglobin concentrationvalues for cerebrovascular resistance and cerebral o utilization werecalculated .increased ruminal pressure had little effect on cerebral blood flowand cerebrovascular resistance . cerebral o utilization was decreasedwhen the intraruminal pressure was increased . this decrease was causedby a reduction in arterial o content and a consequent decrease incerebral arteriovenous o difference . mean arterial, venous sinus, andcerebrospinal fluid pressures were increased as the intraruminalpressure was increased . increases in pcv and hemoglobin concentrationwere not related to the elevated intraruminal pressure .central nervous system signs in goats with acute ruminal tympany maybe caused by cerebral hypoxia . the nature of the hypertensive changesassociated with increased ruminal pressure were demonstrated, but due tothe influence of multiple factors on fluid compartments, no conclusionscould be made about the mechanism of these pressure responses .mechanical factors, however, may be involved .
