      sequestration of iron from bone marrow sites of erythropoiesis into storage within the
      reticuloendothelial system as ferritin. Also the majority of critically ill patients are
      hypoferremia, the efficacy of iron supplementation remains unknown. Furthermore, several
      retrospective studies have found an association between iron overload and infection. However,
      the relative risk/benefit profile of enteral iron supplementation with respect to infection
      has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of enteral iron
      supplementation in critically ill patients. The hypothesis is that enteral iron
      supplementation will result in both an improved hematocrit and a decreased need for blood
      transfusion, without increasing the risk of infection.
