    
      Primary Objective(s): Obtain Overall Response Rate (ORR) to taxane therapy by adding the
      fatty acid synthase inhibitor, omeprazole to the current "failing" taxane regimen in 15% of
      subjects using Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria, defined by
      partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)

      Secondary Objectives (only at patients treated at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer
      Center main campus):

        -  Pharmacodynamics-demonstrate omeprazole in vivo fatty acid synthase inhibition by
           11C-Acetate PET/CT (3-6) Non-invasive approach to demonstrate the fatty acid synthase
           inhibitor (omeprazole) is hitting its target

        -  Obtain a prostate specific antigen response rate by adding the fatty acid synthase
           inhibitor omeprazole to the current "failing" taxane regimen. (16)

        -  Measure pain using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
           at Baseline, Cycle 5, Cycle 12, and every cycle thereafter.
