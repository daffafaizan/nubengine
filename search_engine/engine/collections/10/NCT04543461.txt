      factors (lifetime environmental exposures, fitness and physical activity, biomarkers, nasal
      respiratory epithelial transcriptome) and ideal versus impaired peak lung health (reserve and
      markers of susceptibility in investigators' model) in young adulthood. In addition to the
      initial baseline assessment, remote contacts (e.g., via text message, email, mail, or phone)
      at regular intervals will allow for both the retention of the participants as well as the
      collection of additional short-term follow-up information, i.e., within 4.5 years of
      enrollment. If additional funding becomes available, investigators will extend the study for
      an additional period of time to study factors related to long-term changes in lung health
      over time, i.e., at 5 years and beyond.
