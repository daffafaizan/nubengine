    
      the purpose of this study:(1) to investigate the incidence of preoperative cerebral
      oxygenation abnormity (SjvO2 <55%) and its relationship with intraoperative cerebral
      desaturation and POCD. (2) To investigate the change of intraoperative cerebral oxygen supply
      and demand balance and the incidence of cerebral desaturation in patients with abnormal
      preoperative cerebral oxygenation during sevoflurane anesthesia. (3)To investigate the
      incidence of early POCD in patients with abnormal preoperative cerebral oxygenation during
      sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia.
