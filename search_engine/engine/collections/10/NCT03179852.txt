      epidemic proportions, making it a recognized public health priority. Overweight and obese
      children are more likely to remain overweight and obese as adults, which increases their risk
      for developing obesity-related diseases and psychological disorders. Research shows that
      regular consumption of fruit and vegetables (F/V) may reduce the risk of obesity and
      obesity-related diseases yet most American school children fail to meet recommended intakes .

      Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if a F/V-targeted nutrition education
      intervention would increase F/V preference, knowledge, and consumption among
      elementary-school students.

      Methods: Eight 20-minute nutrition lessons, focusing on F/V consumption, were administered
      over an eight-week period to 3rd and 5th grade students (N=150) at a local Ellensburg School
      District elementary school . Pre/post surveys were used to examine F/V knowledge and
      preference. Researchers observed and photographed students' lunches for 5-consecutive days
      pre- and post- intervention to assess possible change in consumption patterns.

      Results: Data is currently under analysis. Conclusions: To be determined June 2017.
