      I. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of bioimpedance technology as
      compared to clinically derived measurements to include circumferential volumetric
      measurements to detect lower-extremity lymphedema in patients who are undergoing an inguinal
      lymphadenectomy during the concurrent surgical management of a vulvar cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo preoperative and postoperative lower-extremity lymphedema assessment
      comprising serial circumferential measurements, bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements, and
      clinical evaluation using the Stemmer sign. Patients undergo radical vulvectomy or radical
      local excision as prescribed by GOG-0244, and unilateral or bilateral inguinal or
      inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year,
      and then every 6 months for 1 year.
