      nursing and allied health education. OSCEs are rarely used in the workplace as learning
      activities with nursing and allied health clinicians. This is the reason why this education
      initiative was innovative. OSCEs are simulated 'real life' clinical scenarios presented to
      clinicians who are required to demonstrate to an assessor the clinical tasks which form an
      OSCE scenario.
