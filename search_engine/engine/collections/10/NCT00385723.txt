      triglycerides, blood pressure, and heart rate, as well as increases in HDL cholesterol, the
      "good" type of cholesterol. In addition, certain aspects of immune function also appear to
      show favorable responses to fish oil supplementation, and some studies suggest that fish oil
      helps to improve mood and decrease depression.

      This study is designed to examine how supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (key fish oil components) affects aspects of your immune response, and your mood;
      because some research suggests that people who eat more fish may do better during stressful
      times, the study will also examine how fish oil affects your immune response to stress,
      certain stress hormone responses, and your psychological response to stress.
