      a stem cell transplant to have information about the effects of the treatment on their
      fertility (their ability to have children) and on the risk of early menopause. Researchers
      know that some women who had transplants think that the information that they received may
      have been lacking or was not appropriate for their needs. Therefore, researchers would like
      to ask women who have had stem cell transplants at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center to report
      what kind of information they got and would like to have gotten before or during their
      treatment.
