radioautographic studies of bone marrow lymphocytes in vivo and indiffusion chamber cultures .radioautography with tritiated thymidine has been utilized to examinethe turnover rate and origin of small lymphocytes in the bone marrow ofthe guinea-pig .very few marrow lymphocytes were initially labeled by a singleinjection of tritiated thymidine, but thereafter the number of labeledlym phocytes rapidly increased to high maximum levels at 3 days .analysis of the labeling curves and grain counts indicates that thepopulation of marrow lymphocytes is maintained in a dynamic steady statewith an average turnover time of 3 days or less .suspensions of bone marrow cells were isolated from the circulationwithin intraperitoneal diffusion chambers after short-term labeling withtritiated thymidine in vivo . although very few small lymphocytes werelabeled when introduced into the diffusion chambers, a considerablepercentage became labeled during the subsequent culture period .tritiated thymidine was also administered intravenously whilstexcluded from one hind limb by the application of an occlusivecompression bandage for 20 minutes . very few labeled small lymphocyteswere found after 72 hours in the tibial marrow of the initially occludedlimb, whereas the normal high percentage was labeled in the controltibial marrow .these experiments do not demonstrate any large-scale influx of smalllymphocytes from the blood stream into the marrow parenchyma . theysuggest that newly formed small lymphocytes appear in the marrow as aresult of the division of locally situated precursor cells, but themechanism of intramedullary lymphocytopoiesis is uncertain ./transitional/ cells, intermediate in morphology between blast cells andsmall lymphocytes, synthesize dna and are actively proliferative, butthey do not appear to account fully for the rate of lymphocyteproduction .certain large, undifferentiated labeled cells appeared in the bonemarrow as a result of hematogenous migration . some implications ofthese findings are discussed .
