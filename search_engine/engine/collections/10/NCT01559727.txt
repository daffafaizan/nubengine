      patients with acute symptomatic heart failure are admitted with fluid overload. Intravenous
      loop diuretics are an essential component of current treatment in such patients. Newly
      emerging evidence showed that glucocorticoids could potentiate natriuretic peptides' action
      by upregulating the expression natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) in the kidney, and
      produce a potent diuresis. Therefore, the investigators designed this nonblinded, randomized
      dose comparison study to compare the efficacy of prednisone at 15, 30 and 60 mg/day in
      patients with in symptomatic heart failure.
