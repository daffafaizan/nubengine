    
      Background:

      Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common malignant liver tumor in children, with an incidence
      of 0.7 to 1 per million children <15 years of age. Till 1970s, surgery was the primary
      modality of treatment of HB. Unfortunately, up to 60% of the patients present in an
      unresectable stage. Later, the chemo- responsiveness of the tumor was demonstrated which led
      to the incorporation of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatinum and doxorubicin in the
      treatment of HB. International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) pioneered the concept of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the management of HB.

      Patients & Methods:

      In the period from 2002 January till 2016 January, retrieval & analysis of the medical
      records of pediatric patients with hepatoblastoma will be made at the pediatric oncology
      department, South Egypt Cancer Institute which represents the largest referral center in
      Upper Egypt. After pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis, these data will be categorized
      according to patients' demographics, presenting features, laboratory studies, including tumor
      markers & histologic subtype, radiographic evaluation, disease staging, treatment course
      given, and subsequent treatment outcomes.
