    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study on the prevalence of germline
      pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation (Blood) and somatic pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation (Tissue,
      optional) in patients with HER2-negative unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer.

        1. For the assessment of germline mutational status of BRCA1 and BRCA2, (1)Collect
           peripheral blood from each subject. (2) Extract DNA from the collected blood. (3)From
           the extracted DNA, germline BRCA1/2 mutational status will be assessed by next
           generation sequencing(NGS) using NGeneBioBRCAaccuTest®

        2. For the assessment of somatic mutational status of BRCA1 and BRCA2, (1)Collect FFPE from
           about 100 subjects. (2) Extract DNA from the FFPE. (3)From the extracted DNA, somatic
           BRCA1/2 mutational status will be assessed by next generation sequencing(NGS) using
           NGeneBioBRCAaccuTest®

        3. Collect variables on the patients and compare clinical outcomes (Overall survival,
           Invasive Disease-free survival, Distant Disease-free survival, Progression free
           survival) that can be affected by clinicopathologic characteristics and type of
           treatment.
