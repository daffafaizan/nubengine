    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, national, randomized, open label study, comparing the
      efficacy of cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m² plus prednisone (Arm A) over docetaxel at 75mg/m2 plus
      prednisone (Arm B) after enzalutamide at 160 mg once daily or abiraterone acetate at 1000 mg
      once daily plus prednisone in chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC who have progressed on
      abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.

      Each patient will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's
      refusal of further study treatment.

      All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either arm A or B in a 1:1 proportion.
