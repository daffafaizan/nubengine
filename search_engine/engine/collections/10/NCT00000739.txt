    
      Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) is recommended for all HIV-infected
      children considered to be at high risk. Approximately 15 percent of children are intolerant
      to trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole, the first choice drug for PCP prophylaxis. Since many
      children are also unable to take or tolerate aerosolized pentamidine, dapsone is a second
      choice for PCP prophylaxis. The most favorable dose regimen for dapsone has not been
      established.

      Ninety-six HIV-infected infants and children who are intolerant to trimethoprim /
      sulfamethoxazole ( TMP / SMX ) are randomized to receive oral dapsone in a lower dose once
      daily or at a higher dose once weekly. Treatment continues until the last patient enrolled
      has received at least 3 months of therapy. Blood samples are drawn between weeks 4 and 8, at
      weeks 12 and 24, and every 3 months thereafter during dapsone administration.
