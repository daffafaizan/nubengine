    
      This is a post-market surveillance study that is prospective, controlled, multi-center, to
      evaluate if Imagio OA can downgrade BI-RADS ( Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System)
      classification following CDU (Conventional Diagnostic Ultrasound) for the visualization and
      characterization of suspicious masses prior to core needle biopsy (CNB) or excision.
      Investigators will perform CDU to reach a diagnosis and decision to biopsy. Imagio OA will
      not be used as the reason to perform or to defer a CNB (Core Needle Biopsy) or excision.
