      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial
           cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cavity cancer treated with docetaxel and
           capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life during treatment of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral
      capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for â‰¥ 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and then at completion of
      study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2-3 months.
