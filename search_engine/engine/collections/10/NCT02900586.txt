      project about the inter-professional collaboration (attending physician with dispensary
      pharmacist) developed therapeutic patient education (TPE) plans and created follow-up
      booklets which were dealt to the patients who have to transmit it to their two medical
      professionals twice a year during three years one after one. The results after 18 months are
      encouraging about the improvement of adherence to treatment and about the lifestyle changes.
