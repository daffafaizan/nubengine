      All the subjects were randomly allocated into either LB (treatment) group or placebo
      (control) group.

      All the eligible subjects had the eye examination, including VA using the Early Treatment of
      Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, refractions, tonometry, external and internal
      ocular health assessments, and fundus photo-documentation. Three additional tests were
      conducted to investigate the functional and structural changes in the RP patients, including
      Ganzfeld Electroretinogram, Humphrey Visual Field Analyser (Zeiss, Dublin, USA) and
      Spectral-domain Optical Coherent Tomography (SD-OCT) (Heidelberg Engineering, USA).
