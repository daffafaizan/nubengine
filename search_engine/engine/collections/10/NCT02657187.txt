      of the affected skeletal muscles. There have been several studies reported positive
      relationship between muscle mass and amount of neuromuscular junction. Until now, dose of
      rocuronium has been judged by patient's weight and height. When the rocuronium was developed,
      50% effective dose and 95% effective dose of rocuronium was calculated by patient corrected
      body weight which used weight and height. However, height and weight do not represent exact
      muscle mass. The purpose of this study is to find 50% effective dose and 95% effective dose
      of rocuronium according to muscle mass. Measurement of muscle mass will be obtained using
      bioelectrical impedence analysis.
