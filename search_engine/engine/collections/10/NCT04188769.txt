      one single test occasion, during which 6 test trials will be performed in random order. Deep
      pressure will be applied by means of a Johnstone air splint, that will be (1) not inflated,
      (2) inflated constantly, or (3) inflated intermittently. Each of these 3 inflation conditions
      will be performed twice, i.e. with and without a non-hemiplegic arm movement (triggering
      hypertonia at hemiplegic side).
