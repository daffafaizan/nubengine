      The two arms (3 weeks each) will comprise practice of the grooved pegboard test and practice
      of steady contractions while lifting and lowering light loads with a hand muscle.
      Randomization into practice order will be accomplished with a block approach (block size = 4)
      for each of the two groups. The outcome assessors will be blinded to practice order. The
      outcomes will comprise three tests of manual dexterity and the measurement of force control
      during submaximal contractions. The outcomes will be obtained before and after the six
      sessions in each practice arm.
