      I. To estimate the proportion of patients identified as developing intraprocedural
      atelectasis detected by radial-probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS) during peripheral
      bronchoscopy under general anesthesia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the most common locations for developing intraprocedural atelectasis detected
      by RP-EBUS.

      II. To describe the proportion of evaluated bronchial segments per patient that are
      identified as developing intraprocedural atelectasis by RP-EBUS.

      III. To identify patient and procedural characteristics that may predispose to the
      development of atelectasis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bronchoscopy per standard of care, RP-EBUS of the left and right lungs
      during bronchoscopy procedure, and RP-imaging over 3-5 minutes at the end of the bronchoscopy
      procedure.
