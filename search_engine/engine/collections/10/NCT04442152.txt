      affecting low-income Rwandan couples' relationships and family dynamics. It will contribute
      to documenting whether and how this disruptive moment might be changing or influencing
      relationship dynamics, conflict, and the distribution of care-work. We will build on an
      existing randomized controlled trial of the Bandebereho fathers/couples intervention, which
      will allow us to assess not only the current conditions in households, but also whether or
      how the significant impacts of the intervention are sustained under extreme stress. The
      Bandebereho fathers/couples intervention was implemented by the Rwanda Men's Resource Center
      (RWAMREC) and Promundo-US, in collaboration with the Rwanda Ministry of Health and local
      authorities in Karongi, Musanze, Nyaruguru and Rwamagana districts from 2013-2015. Results
      from a randomized controlled study of Bandebereho, a gender transformative intervention for
      expectant couples originally implemented in 4 districts in 2015, showed positive results
      across multiple outcomes after 21 months.
