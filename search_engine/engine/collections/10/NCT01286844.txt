      than 12 years of age and cohort 2 with children from 1 year of age to less than 4 years of
      age. Cohort 1 is further subdivided, dependent on a subject's weight, which enables different
      dosing regimens and pharmacokinetic sampling within the cohort. There are 3 scheduled
      Pharmacokinetic and Safety Review meetings, which enable dose adjustment and dosing in the
      younger subjects through the study.

      Blood and urine are collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. Safety will
      be assessed by measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, safety laboratory data and
      review of adverse events. Subjects will also perform PEF and Spirometry if assessed as
      capable by the study investigator.
