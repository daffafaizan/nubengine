      with decreased long-term survival. The mechanism for inducing acute kidney injury is unknown
      but ischaemia-reperfusion injury is indicated to be a part of the cause.

      Animal studies have showed cytoprotective, preconditioning and anti-apoptotic effects of
      ciclosporin in ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the kidney. The major mechanism is thought to
      be inhibition of the reperfusion triggered opening of the mitochondrial permeability
      transition pore (mPTP), responsible for reperfusion-induced necrosis. During cardiac surgery,
      the period of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) changes the perfusion through the kidney.
      Return to normal perfusion with a beating heart has similarities with reperfusion following
      ischemia.

      Administration of ciclosporin in conjunction with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),
      heart surgery and traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans has shown to be safe with no direct
      side-effects.

      The investigators therefore hypothesize that a preconditioning effect of ciclosporin before
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can reduce the level of renal dysfunction after this
      type of cardiac surgery.
