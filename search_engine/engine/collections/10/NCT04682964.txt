      treatment was performed. On the first day of diagnosis, patients were prescribed complex
      antibacterial therapy on the basis of possible causative agents. Subsequently, antibiotic
      therapy was adjusted based on the results of the bacteriological examinations. A total of 67
      patients received bacteriophage therapy using a liquid complex of pyobacteriophages
      (pyobacteriophage complex liquid - PСL). PСL was administered via nebulizer inhalation to
      irrigate the mucous membranes of the tonsils. In total, 5 ml of PCL was inhaled for up to 10
      minutes once every 5 days.

      The drug causes lysis of specific bacteria including Staphylococcus, Enterococcus,
      Streptococcus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca. The drug is
      recommended for use for diseases of the ear, throat, nose, respiratory tract and lungs;
      inflammation of the sinuses and middle ear; tonsillitis; pharyngitis; laryngitis; tracheitis;
      bronchitis; pneumonia, pleurisy; and other inflammatory diseases. The choice of this drug was
      based on bacteriological studies.
