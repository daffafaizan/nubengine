      the commercially available ROSA Total Knee robotic instrumentation and conventional
      instrumentation.The assessments will include:Planned vs actual component positioning,
      workflow efficiency, patient safety based on incidence and frequency of adverse events, and
      clinical performance measured by overall pain and function, quality of life data, and
      radiographic parameters.
