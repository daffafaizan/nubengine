    
      The purpose of this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase Ib/IIa
      study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of eASCs (Cx611) administered
      intravenously as adjunctive therapy, therefore in addition to standard of care (SoC) therapy,
      to patients with severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (sCABP).

      The key objectives of this study are to:

      Primary objective:

      Investigate the safety profile of two allogeneic Cx611 80 mL infusions administered through a
      central line within 3 days (on days 1 and 3) at a dose of 160 million cells each (320 million
      cells total) and to monitor any adverse event and potential immunological host responses
      against the administered cells during 90 days of follow-up after the first infusion.

      Secondary objective:

      Explore the clinical efficacy of Cx611 in terms of a reduction of the duration of mechanical
      ventilation and/or need for vasopressors and/or improved survival, and/or clinical cure of
      the sCABP, and other efficacy-related endpoints.
