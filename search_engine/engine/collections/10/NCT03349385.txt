      following an index coronary revascularization procedure, and represents a wide proportion of
      patients received in catheterization laboratories. These patients have an increased
      complexity and worse outcomes than patients without previous revascularization. Clinical
      investigation has focused in lesion-specific treatments when a single previous
      revascularization fails, but there is paucity of patient-level information including complex
      patients with multiple revascularizations. Other gaps in evidence addressed by this study are
      the absence of a a prognosis-oriented classification of previously revascularized patients
      and a clinical meaningful definition of revascularization failure. The registry as well
      intends to provide insights on how secondary revascularization decisions are taken and long
      term prognosis after secondary revascularization.

      The registry of secondary revascularization (in Spanish: Registro multicéntrico de
      reVAscularización SECundaria, REVASEC) is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort
      study that incudes consecutive patients with at least one previous coronary revascularization
      undergoing a clinically indicated diagnostic coronary angiography, in different Spanish
      hospitals. The aims are describing the incidence, clinical profile, therapeutic management
      and prognosis of these patients.
