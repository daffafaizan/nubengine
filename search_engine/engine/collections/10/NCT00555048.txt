    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Identify the lowest dose of alemtuzumab that is associated with day 180
           transplant-related mortality â‰¤ 45%.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of life-threatening infection in patients receiving this
           treatment.

        -  Determine the incidence of grades III-IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients
           receiving this treatment.

        -  Determine the survival at 1 year in patients receiving this treatment.

        -  Determine the incidence of disease relapse at 1 year in patients receiving this
           treatment.

        -  Determine the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD at 1 year in patients receiving this
           treatment.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft failure at day 100 in patients receiving this
           treatment.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours on days -10 to -6, busulfan
           IV over 3 hours on days -7 to -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2.

        -  Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic
           filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSC transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally
           twice daily on days -1 to 50 and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
