      drive. This data will be password protected by the research team. The data will consist of
      two different databases, 1) identifiers with health screen results, 2) identifiers with
      demographics (age, gender, household member in class). The researchers need data from both
      databases for this study. Each participant has been assigned a unique participant number by
      CHIP.

      The databases will be combined by the research team, allowing the demographics to be matched
      to the biomarkers. The unique CHIP identifier will be maintained as a participant ID, while
      all other identifying data will then be deleted from the database.

      The data will then be analyzed for relationships by a statistician.
