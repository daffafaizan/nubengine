      results of the first eight weeks of life were analyzed for this study.

      aEEG-tracings were analyzed with regard to background activity (percentages of continuous and
      discontinuous patterns), the presence/absence of sleep-wake-cycles and the occurrence of
      seizure activity. These items where summed up in a score including three grades (normal,
      moderately and severely abnormal).

      The aEEG was recorded as a single channel EEG from biparietal surface disk electrodes using a
      CFM (CFM 5330, Lectromed Devices Ltd., UK) or the CFM 6000 (Olympic Medical, USA). Assessment
      of neurodevelopmental outcome was done at three years of age by assessment of the Bayley
      Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II) During the study period from January 1st 2000, and
      December 31st 2002 a total of 284 preterm infants less than 30 weeksÂ´ gestational age were
      admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the Medical University of Vienna.
      Neurodevelopmental outcome could be obtained in 148/284 infants at the age of three years and
      these infants therefore fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this study
