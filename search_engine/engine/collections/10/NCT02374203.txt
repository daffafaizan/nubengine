      critically ill elderly patients are few, and indirect calorimetry (IC) is not available in
      every intensive care unit (ICU). The aim of this study was to compare IC and Harris-Benedict
      (HB) predictive equation in different BMI (body mass index) groups. And to investigate
      whether the nutrition intake from EN (enteral nutrition) and PN (parenteral nutrition)
      created a better clinical outcome than EN alone in HNR (high nutritional risk) mechanically
      ventilated critically ill elderly patients.Inclusion criteria were: age ≧65 years old, APACHE
      Π score ≧15, mechanical ventilation ≧48 hours and on NG tube feeding. Nutritional risk was
      screened by mNUTRIC and GNRI. Indirect calorimetry and HB equation were used to assess energy
      requirements. Patients were randomized 1:1 to two tube feeding regimens: general formula and
      high protein formula (1.5~2.0 gm/kg BW). Nutritional intake from EN, the type and amount of
      intravenous nutrition within 7 days, tolerance to feeding, MVD (Mechanical Ventilation Day),
      newly diagnosed VAP (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia), ICU and hospital LOS (Length of Stay)
      and date of death were recorded. We used SAS version 9.4 for statistical analysis.
      Statistically significance was set at α=0.05.
