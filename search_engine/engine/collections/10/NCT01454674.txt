      servings/day of vegetables for 3 week periods, with feeding periods separated by 4 week
      washout periods, during which time a limited number of low biological value fruits and
      vegetables were eaten.

      This research will provide important and relevant information to fill several gaps in our
      current knowledge including a more thorough description of the oxidant stress and
      inflammatory status of overweight, postmenopausal women, assessment of the relevant daily
      "dose" of vegetables necessary to modulate biomarkers of oxidant stress and inflammation in
      overweight postmenopausal women and evaluation of the association between plasma nutrient and
      carotenoid levels in relation to changes in oxidant stress and inflammation in this
      population. Our long-term goal is to reduce chronic disease risk among "at-risk"
      post-menopausal females.
