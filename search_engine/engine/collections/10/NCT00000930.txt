      disease progression in cohorts suitable for HIV vaccine trials. The detection of changes in
      HIV phenotype and genotype, clinical progression rates, and antiretroviral resistance within
      study populations over time are important for planning future HIV vaccine trials.

      This study consists of two parts. Part A includes HIV-infected patients who enrolled in
      HIVNET D01.1 (infected-participants cohort of HIVNET D01) and whose HIV disease has been
      closely monitored and characterized. This study continues to monitor these patients with
      follow-up evaluations every 3 months for the first 18 months and then every 6 months
      thereafter. Part B includes newly HIV-infected patients. These patients are monitored with
      clinical and laboratory evaluations at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months, and then every 6
      months through Year 5.
