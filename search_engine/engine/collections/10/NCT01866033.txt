      crossover design, pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) study to assess the
      absolute bioavailability of oral (by mouth) PCI-32765 and the effect of grapefruit juice on
      the absorption of PCI-32765 in approximately 8 healthy adult participants. The duration of
      the study is approximately 45 days (screening, treatment, and follow-up). All patients will
      receive PCI-32765 560 mg (Treatment A) administered by mouth in the first period and
      Treatment B (560 mg administered by mouth without grapefruit juice) and Treatment C (140 mg
      administered by mouth with grapefruit juice) according to a randomization schedule in Periods
      2 and 3. Participants will fast overnight for at least 10 hours prior to study drug dosing.
      Participants will stay in the study center for pharmacokinetic sampling. Serial
      pharmacokinetic samples will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after dosing and
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
