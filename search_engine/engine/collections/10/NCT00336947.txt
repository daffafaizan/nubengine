        -  Compare the disease-free survival rate in patients with definitively treated stage III
           or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
           comprising S-1 vs tegafur-uracil (UFT).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to primary site, disease stage, type of prior definitive treatment, and
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral S-1 once daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days
           for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II:Patients receive oral tegafur-uracil (UFT) once daily on days 1-21. Courses
           repeat every 21 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.
