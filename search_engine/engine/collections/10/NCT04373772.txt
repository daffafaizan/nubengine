      patients who underwent CS. The patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the AM and control
      groups. The constipation risk of all the patients following CS was assessed with Constipation
      Risk Assessment Scale (CRAS). Those patients in the AM group received a total of 30 minutes
      of massage, 15 minutes every morning and evening, until the first defecation. The bowel
      sounds of all the patients in the AM and control groups were assessed on a daily basis. The
      days when bowel sounds were heard and the first defecation took place were recorded in a
      Bowel Evacuation Form.
