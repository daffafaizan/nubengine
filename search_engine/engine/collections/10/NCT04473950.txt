    
      This is an outpatient Phase 1 clinical trial investigating the effect of naloxone
      precipitated withdrawal on delay discounting. Eligible participants will undergo two
      experimental sessions presented in random order. One session will involve the measurement of
      delay discounting 30 minutes after double-blind intramuscular (IM) administration of placebo
      (normal saline) and the other will have the exact same procedures performed after
      double-blind IM administration of naloxone (0.1 mg). Injections will occur 2 hours after
      methadone dosing (peak levels). Study sessions will last 2 hours and involve pain and opioid
      withdrawal measures assessed at baseline and 15 minute intervals after injections. The
      participant should be back to baseline and free of withdrawal by the end of the study
      session. Sessions will occur at least 48 hours apart.
