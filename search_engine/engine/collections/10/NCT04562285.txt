    
      The design strategy for this study is to validate the detection of COVID-19 antibodies in
      subjects at HFHS who test positive with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 using fully automated test
      systems already in the core automated laboratory at HFH. This is a study of the immune
      response and kidney health of subjects who have recovered from COVID-19 infection.

      There are 4 aims:

      Aim 1. Assess detection of COVID-19 antibodies in subjects before discharge from HFHS who
      tested positive with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 using fully automated immunoassays.

      Aim 2. Evaluate emergence of immunity over a one-year period in subjects who tested positive
      with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 using a fully-automated immunoassays.

      Aim 3. Monitor renal function and kidney health at 6 and 12- months post diagnosis with
      COVID-19.

      Aim 4. Determine if SAR-COV-2 can be detected in the saliva of patients over a one year
      period after a positive PCR test.
