      three-type screen method .For the first screen cerebral infarction patients of MCA area who
      has the stroke or TIA history In 6 months are determined by the clinic stroke measure
      table,transstadial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) carotid ultrasonography and skull CT. For
      the second the MAC area infarction and vessel narrow are determined by the skull magnetic
      resonance (MRI) and magnetic resonance vessel imaging (MRA) and the MCA trend bloodstream
      dynamics feature and narrow extent Are observed by the strengthened ultrasonography (CEVS)
      For the third, The MCA narrow extent is measured by the DSA test which is currently regarded
      as a gold standard and /or by the CTA .The atorvastatin 20mg Treatment is given to the
      patients who all use the antiplatelet medicine The clinic symptom improvement MCA narrow
      extent and bloodstream velocity are dynamically observed visited and analysed respectively at
      the basic line 3 and 6 months after treatment
