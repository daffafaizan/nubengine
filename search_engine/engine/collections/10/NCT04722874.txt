      Moreover, its dose-related association with irreversible blindness complications such as
      myopic macular degeneration have been demonstrated. It is crucial to look for effective ways
      to control myopia in children to reduce risk of myopic pathologies in later life.

      Orthokeratology (ortho-k) is the first-line optical method in myopia control, resulting in
      slowing axial elongation by 43-63%. However, results after ortho-k treatment vary among
      individuals. Methods with more accurate efficacy and wider application to slowing down myopia
      progression, especially for myopia with limited ortho-k response, are still urgently
      required.

      Repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy is an innovative and non-invasive therapeutic
      treatment for a variety of eye diseases. Our previous clinical study suggested RLRL could
      effectively retard myopia progression without clinically observable side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adjunctive effect of RLRL and ortho-k on myopia
      control in ortho-k non-responders using a multicenter randomized controlled trial design.
      Ortho-k non-responders are defined as who have continuously undergone ortho-k treatment but
      were still experiencing fast myopia progression. The subjects will be randomly assigned to
      either experimental group (RLRL and ortho-k) or control group (ortho-k). Their axial length
      will be monitored over one year. Changes in axial length in the two groups will be compared.
