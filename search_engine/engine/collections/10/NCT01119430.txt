      serotonin at the synaptic cleft averting its reuptake. The increment of serotonin activates
      5-HT1A presynaptic autoreceptors, resulting in a modulation in the release of serotonin by
      the presynaptic neuron. It is proposed that 5-HT1A receptor antagonism could accelerate the
      clinical effect of antidepressants by preventing this negative feedback.Preclinical data
      obtained with selective 5-HT1A antagonists, such as pindolol, and with mice lacking 5-HT1a
      receptors supports this hypothesis. Results on partial antagonists (pindolol) are conclusive
      in accelerating SSRI. It is reasonable to call into question whether a total antagonism of
      5-HT1a receptors could imply a more rapid antidepressant response. To test this hypothesis we
      conducted a double blind, randomised, controlled trial with DU 123550 added to fluoxetine 20
      mg/day
