    
      Design: CCTG 593 is a project to evaluate the uptake and effectiveness of an ALERT specialist
      serving to

        1. link newly diagnosed, HIV infected persons from HIV testing sites to HIV specialist
           providers, and

        2. link confirmed HIV antibody negative persons with continued high risk behaviors to PrEP
           centers

      Duration: Each subject who agrees to linkage will receive ALERT follow-up until successful
      linkage or 60 days following enrollment for linkage to care or 90 days following enrollment
      for linkage to PrEP, whichever comes first. The duration of the 593 project will be for 3.5
      years or until all subjects have been enrolled and successfully linked, or 60 days pass for
      linkage to care or 90 days for linkage to PrEP.

      Sample Size: Up to 600 subjects will be tested and offered linkage across all CCTG sites: LA
      County-USC Medical Center, Harbor-UCLA/City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human
      Services, UCSD/San Diego Health and Human Services Agency.

      Study Population: Eligible subjects will include any persons 18 years of age or older who
      have been tested for HIV at one of the CCTG testing sites (LA County + USC, Long Beach
      Department of Health and Human Services, and San Diego Health and Human Services Agency).
