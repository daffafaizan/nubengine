      effects on nutrient absorption, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism. Elucidation of the
      metabolic impact of specific dietary components may well result in improved efficacy of
      lifestyle approaches to reduce obesity and metabolic diseases. Despite similar fructose
      consumption, the phenotype of co-morbidities is different between African Americans and
      Latinos. Latino and Caucasian children manifest worsened dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD), while African American children manifest worsened insulin resistance
      and hypertension. We have also documented in adults that a reduction in de novo lipogenesis
      (DNL; production of new lipids) in the liver and liver fat content, and improvement in
      hepatic insulin sensitivity were achieved by substitution of complex carbohydrate for
      fructose; but these changes appeared less dramatic in African American compared to Latino or
      Caucasian subjects. These divergent findings suggest ethnic and race-specific differences of
      fructose metabolism and disposition.

      To determine whether fructose is a contributor to metabolic co-morbidity in children, we will
      conduct a convenience cohort within-subject intervention with repeated measures, stratified
      by racial/ethnic group (Latinos vs. African Americans vs. Caucasians). The intervention will
      consist of restricting fructose ingestion only to naturally-occurring fructose in fruits and
      vegetables (approximately 15 gm/day for 10 days), by substituting complex carbohydrate for
      excess dietary fructose, while maintaining neutral energy balance. We anticipate fructose
      restriction to differentially improve co-morbidities in different racial/ethnic groups.
