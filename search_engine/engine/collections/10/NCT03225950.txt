      interaction between microorganisms organized in biofilms on tooth surfaces and host immune
      cells, leading to an inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting tissues and - if left
      untreated - eventually tooth loss. Periodontitis affects up to 50% of the population in the
      United States of America, and is classified in an aggressive and a chronic form depending on
      genetic factors, age of onset, speed and severity of attachment loss.

      The onset of periodontitis is caused by an immunologic imbalance between host immune cells
      and residing microorganisms in subgingival pockets. The host immune cells are capable of
      enhancing both a protective and a destructive inflammatory response towards the
      microorganisms through the release of inflammatory mediators e.i. proinflammatory and
      antiinflammatory cytokines.

      The role of antibodies in periodontitis is also unclear. Some studies show an excessive
      antibody level against bacteria associated with periodontitis e.g. Porphyromonas gingivalis
      (P.g.).

      In general, this study contributes to a profound understanding of the host immune cells role
      in the onset and pathogenesis of periodontitis by comparing healthy versus diseased donors
      immunologic responses toward pathogene and apathogene microorganisms and their genetic
      background.
