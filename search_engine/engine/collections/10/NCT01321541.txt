      gemcitabine plus rituximab in up to six 28-day cycles. At the time patients experience
      progressive disease during study treatment, early follow- up, or intermediate follow-up, they
      enter the survival follow up period. Patients who complete study treatment or discontinue
      study treatment for any other reason will participate in the follow-up periods.

      Early Follow-Up: After treatment completion or discontinuation, patient will enter a 24-week
      follow-up period.

      enter an additional 72-week follow-up period.
