      dark chocolate and cocoa) and mortality from coronary heart disease. However, the basis for
      this protective association is uncertain. Food polyphenols such as in cocoa reportedly have
      antioxidant properties and decrease platelet function in vitro. The goal of the present study
      was to investigate whether the beneficial antioxidant effect of polyphenol-rich cocoa can
      induce an improvement of endothelial and platelet function in patients with stable coronary
      artery disease with known platelet hyperreactivity.
