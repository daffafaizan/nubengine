      scheduled to start adjuvant hormonal therapy. Patients would have completed all their primary
      treatments (surgeryÂ± radiation therapy) and are scheduled to start their adjuvant hormonal
      therapy. They get baseline blood drawn for oxylipins and sheer wave elastrography (SWE)
      ultrasound of their hands including wrists. They start adjuvant anastrozole and have blood
      drawn at 3mths and 6mths for measurement of oxylipins. SWE ultrasound is repeated at 6mths.
      This is a pilot trial to evaluate for blood and imaging biomarkers. Once pilot data is
      analyzed, goal is to apply for funding for a larger trial to further evaluate and validate
      these biomarkers
