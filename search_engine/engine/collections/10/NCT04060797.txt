      causes intermittent claudication of lower limbs, reduced skin temperature, pain, and chronic
      progressive disease that still produces ulcer or necrosis. Some clinical studies have shown
      Sympathetic overactivity in the lower arterial ischemic disease. The multi-electrode
      radiofrequency ablation system can significantly reduce the excitability of sympathetic
      nerve, restore the normal response of sympathetic nerve, relieve the pain and discomfort of
      patients, effectively improve the symptoms of lower limb ischemia, and improve the quality of
      life of patients.
