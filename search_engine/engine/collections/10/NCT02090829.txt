      adolescents with ASD. Diagnosis will be confirmed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
      (DSM) criteria, supported by the Autism Diagnostic Interview and the Autism Diagnostic
      Observation Schedule. Subjects will be randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo for
      a 5 day period with concomitant game play of the FaceStation computer games, developed at
      CHOP. Measures of social function and cognition will be administered before and after the
      game play period. Two measures of social functioning will serve as our primary endpoints; all
      other measures will be treated as exploratory variables, with significance testing corrected
      for multiple comparisons.

      Recognizing faces is critical to social functioning, and can be improved for individuals with
      ASD by using intervention software in the form of appropriately designed computer games. The
      effects of this type of social intervention may be amplified with the concurrent use of
      oxytocin. Furthermore, these learning effects may impact social skills in general and
      translate to the level of the individual's everyday social behavior. Thus, the objective of
      this study is to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin in
      children and adolescents with ASD when paired with a computer game intervention that is
      designed to enhance face perception skills.
