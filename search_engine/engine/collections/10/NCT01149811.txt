      treatment with dopaminergic agents like levodopa, the mainstay of treatment, is effective in
      the early phases of the disease, their benefits decrease with disease progression, and
      problems such as dyskinesia and on-off phenomenon begin to manifest. This study investigates
      the safety and tolerability of fipamezole at two dose levels in patients with Parkinson's
      Disease.

      The sampling method used was simple random sampling.
