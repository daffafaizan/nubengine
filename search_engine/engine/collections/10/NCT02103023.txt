      influenza are constant global threats. The WHO estimates that seasonal influenza causes
      250,000-500,000 deaths worldwide each year, with an even higher mortality during the pandemic
      periods. Moreover zoonotic influenza such as the avian-origin H5N1 and more recently the H7N9
      influenza are associated with a much higher mortality than seasonal influenza. Vaccine
      immunogenicity among elderly individuals is also suboptimal due to immunosenescence. Various
      strategies including intradermal vaccination and new vaccine adjuvants have been shown to
      improve immunogenicity.

      Recently, imiquimod, a synthetic Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist useful for the treatment
      of DNA virus infection, have been shown to improve vaccine immunogenicity against influenza
      virus in both mouse model. The objective of this prospective double-blind randomized
      controlled trial is to evaluate the effect and safety of topical treatment with imiquimod
      immediately before intradermal influenza vaccination. Our a priori hypothesis is that
      imiquimod pretreatment would expedite and augment the immunogenicity of influenza
      vaccination.
