    
      A total of 15 patients suffering from end stage IV and V Rutherford /CLI in whom all previous
      therapeutic strategies failed (e.g. surgical revascularization) will be selected and undergo
      local transplantation of autologous BMMNCs. Conventional treatments include angioplasty and
      /or bypass to remove blood vessel blockage for restoring blood supply, along with prescribed
      medicines that aid in ulcer recovery and wound healing and debridement of damaged/infected
      tissue. Amputation is inevitable in many cases because some blood capillaries cannot be
      corrected and restenosis of vessels is very common. Cell therapies with mononuclear cells
      from patients own bone marrow is promising because these stem cells are capable of
      stimulating and regenerating capillaries and blood vessels (neovascularization).

      This is a Phase Ib (feasibility study), prospective, non randomized and open labeled study
      aimed to find out the safety and efficacy of intramuscular autologous bone marrow mononuclear
      cells implantation in patients with chronic critical limb ischemia.

      The efficacy/safety of this therapy will be assessed by using several endpoints such as (a)
      prevention of amputation, (b) wound healing and (c) degree of angiogenesis. In order to
      assess the limb ischemia, the measurements will be performed at pre- and post transplantation
      at a variety of time intervals. The measurements include: ABI-ankle brachial index,
      Transcutaneous partial pressure of Oxygen (TcPO2), 6 min walk test, Rest pain and
      intermittent Claudication assessment, Healing of ulcers/ wounds and angiography of the
      affected limb.
