    
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to show that infants taking (from birth)
      either a formula with a low protein content (LoF) or breast milk will have an IGF-1 level, at
      4 months, 25% lower to the IGF-1 measured in infants that received a high protein content
      formula (HiF).

      The secondary objectives are: The hormonal profile; the Fat mass (FM) gain and the Lean mass
      (LM); the metabolomics and aminogramm during the first year of life.

      Subjects are included in the study for a duration of 5 years. From birth to 4 months they are
      exclusively fed BF or FF. From 4 months of age they can start diversification, but they
      maintain the starter formulas until 12 months (the BF group will receive LoF). Subjects are
      then followed up until 5 years of age.
