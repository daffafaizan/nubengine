      hyperactivity. Baseline periaqueductal gray hyperactivity and microRNA levels will be
      measured as potential biomarkers of response to treatment. These preliminary findings will be
      used to design larger clinical trials to establish efficacy of brivarecetum to treat
      neuropathic pain in SCI.
