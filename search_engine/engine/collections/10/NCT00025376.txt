        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer
           treated with bortezomib.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression and 1-year survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly on weeks 1 and 2.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo core biopsy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo core biopsy. Patients then receive bortezomib IV as in arm I.

      Patients undergo radiologic re-evaluation of measurable lesions. Patients with stable disease
      or a partial or complete response continue to receive bortezomib in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-14
      months.
