    
      This pilot study is meant to be translational (i.e., we expect that positive study results
      could easily translate to the actual practices of the NYS Smokers' Quitline) - as much as
      possible, we will follow the standard practices of the Quitline. In this context, a
      randomized pilot clinical trial comparing exclusively "Yale coaching" counseling + "Yale"
      print materials (YC condition) to standard care Quitline counseling + standard print
      materials (SC condition) will be conducted with individuals calling the NYS Smokers' Quitline
      for assistance in quitting smoking. Following assessment of eligibility and informed consent,
      2,500 smokers will be assisted by Specialists in either the YC or SC experimental conditions.

      Consistent with the current practices of the Quitline, following the counseling intervention,
      participants will be mailed a package containing print materials encouraging smoking
      cessation, and participants eligible for NRT will receive a 2-week supply of nicotine
      replacement medication. Consistent with Quitline practices, all callers will be required to
      set a "quit date" within 2 weeks of their initial call. A Quitline Specialist will initiate a
      follow-up call approximately 10 to 14 days after the print materials and NRT has been mailed.
      For callers receiving NRT, the manufacturer's suggested course of therapy (e.g., 8 weeks of
      NRT) will be recited to callers, and Quitline Specialists will suggest that callers use the
      money they save from not smoking to purchase additional NRT and/or that they check with their
      insurance carrier to see if additional NRT would be covered.

      Participants will be assessed before receiving the "Yale coaching" counseling or standard
      care counseling, immediately after receiving counseling, approximately 1 week after their
      quit date for those who receive NRT, and at a 3-month follow-up to see if the YC counseling
      and YC print materials, as predicted, are more likely to promote smoking cessation. We will
      also administer several brief measures that assess potential mediators of treatment.
