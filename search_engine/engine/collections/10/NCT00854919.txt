      and DA function, such as risperidone (RIS), olanzapine (OLZ) and quetiapine (QET), have been
      found effective in the augmentation of SSRIs for treatment-resistant OCD.

      Nevertheless, the AAPDs have been associated with common and serious adverse effects, such as
      body weight (BW) gain and metabolic dysregulation. Metabolic dysregulation includes
      glucoregulatory dysfunction and dyslipidemia. Indeed, studies of some AAPD in SSRI-refractory
      OCD patients have similarly reported significant BW gain. AAPD-induced BW gain may influence
      patients' adherence to medication and places them at risk for a broad range of medical
      problems.

      Most work on AAPDs in treatment-refractory OCD has been conducted in the form of short-term
      efficacy studies. There have been fewer studies of the effectiveness, safety, and
      tolerability of these agents in the context of a clinic where CBT is also provided, and where
      treatment is continued for a significant period of time. In the current effectiveness study,
      we sought to examine the response of SSRI-refractory patients to augmentation with AAPDs,
      comparing adverse events in such compared to a control group of SSRI responders.
