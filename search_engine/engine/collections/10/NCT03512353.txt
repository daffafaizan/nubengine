      centers. Adults with 1-3 prior lines of therapy at study entry are eligible to be screened
      for participation. Patients refractory to their last line of treatment are eligible to
      participate as long as their last line of treatment did not include a proteasome inhibitor
      (PI). The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days for bone marrow
      assessments and up to 21 days for all other assessments, up to 12 cycles of treatment, and a
      30-day safety follow-up period following the last dose of study drug.
