    
      This intervention will last two months.

      Participants will attend a 2-hour session with the researchers in order to provide signed
      consent and undergo the baseline assessment of healthy-ageing related outcome measures.
      Participants will attend a second 2-hour session after two months to repeat the assessment.

      The assessments will take place at the participant's place of work. Participants who have
      retired will be asked to attend assessments at their previous place of work, at a local
      privately hired venue (e.g. community hall), or in their own homes.

      Semi-structured interviews (n=28) will be conducted with a sample of participants from the
      intervention and control groups and two 'reduced participation' groups.

      The reduced participation groups will include people who decline to participate in the trial
      but consent to a brief qualitative interview about their decision not to participate (after
      initially expressing interest) (n= up to 2), and people who withdraw from the trial but
      consent to a follow-up interview (n= up to 2).

      The interviews will address three overlapping domains of enquiry: 1) questions relating to
      participation in the pilot study; 2) questions relating to use of the intervention website;
      and 3) questions relating to the use of the HAP set of measurement tools.
