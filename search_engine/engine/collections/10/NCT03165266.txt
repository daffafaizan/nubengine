      Right ventricular infarction is underestimated, possible explanation for this difference
      could be explained that electrocardiographic sign of Right ventricular infarction disappear
      early or patients presented late

      The role of Right ventricular systolic function in inferior myocardial infarction patients
      with or without Right ventricular infarction Had been studied. In our study we will Assess
      Right Ventricular infarction in patients of acute inferior myocardial infarction undergoing
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention by correlating electrocardiogram, Right
      ventricular systolic function by echocardiography with the angiographic finding.
