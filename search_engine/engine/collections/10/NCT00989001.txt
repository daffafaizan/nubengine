    
      Participants received a 10-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of vernakalant (3 mg/kg) or an
      equivalent amount of normal saline (placebo), followed by a 15-minute observation period. If
      the participant was still in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, a second 10-minute IV
      infusion of vernakalant (2 mg/kg) or an equivalent amount of placebo was administered unless
      the participant experienced any dose-stopping criteria after the start of the first infusion.
      If a participant converted to sinus rhythm during the first or second infusion, that infusion
      was completed.
