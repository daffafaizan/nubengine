      combination with Chemotherapy (Carboplatin plus Etoposide) compared with treatment with
      Chemotherapy (Carboplatin plus Etoposide) alone in previously untreated Limited-Stage Small
      Cell Lung Cancer patients. Participants will be divided in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      Atezolizumab + Carboplatin + Etoposide or Carboplatin + Etoposide followed by radical
      surgery.
