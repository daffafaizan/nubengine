      cases severe complications, sometimes causing extracorporeal life support. The investigators
      have observed over several years 5 cases of instantaneous postoperative severe pulmonary
      edema. After having studied the available literature on this particular topic the
      investigators have decided to prepare a retrospective analysis of over 200 minimal-invasive
      mitral valve surgery procedure focusing on radiological and clinical signs of unilateral
      pulmonary edema.
