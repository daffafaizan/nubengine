      evaluable subjects. The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence crossover with a washout period of one to two weeks. During each study session,
      the subjects will be administered a single dose of 20mg lisinopril (one BF-Lisinopril tablets
      20mg or one Zestril Tab 20mg) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours. Venous blood
      samples will be collected at pre-dose (0h) and at 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,24 and 48 hours
      post-dose (13 time points). The plasma concentrations of lisinopril will be determined by a
      validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze the plasma
      concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax,
      AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. ANOVA will be calculated on logarithmically transformed Cmax,
      AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. The two one sided tests will be used to calculate the 90% confidence
      intervals for the mean difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax and to assess the
      bioequivalence of the two products.
