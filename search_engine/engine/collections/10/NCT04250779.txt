      usage and to monitor asthma control. CapMedic fits on top of the MDI inhaler and provides
      live audio-visual-haptic cues to guide the patient for correctly using their inhaler.
      CapMedic includes a built-in forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1, a measure of airflow)
      and PEF meter. It will utilize the same audio-visual-haptic hardware to implement live cues
      that encourage patient's effort in performing accurate at-home FEV1/PEF test. Cap will also
      be able to log medication usage and Medic application will allow patients to keep an asthma
      symptom diary.
