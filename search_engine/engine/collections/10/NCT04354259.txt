    
      The study uses an adaptive design with initial enrolment in the Ambulatory cohort (Cohort A)
      followed by a safety assessment before initiation of enrolment in the Hospitalized cohort
      (Cohort B).

      Ambulatory patients (Cohort A) with confirmed COVID-19 deemed well enough for home isolation
      will be randomized to receive a single subcutaneous injection of Peginterferon lambda 180µg
      or saline placebo prior to discharge. Patients will be followed remotely with visits for a
      repeat swab at Day 3 and 7 with the primary endpoint being the proportion positive for
      SARS-CoV-2 on Day 7.

      Safety data will be reviewed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee after 50% of the
      Ambulatory cohort (n=60) has been enrolled. If the committee approves study continuation,
      enrolment will continue in the Ambulatory cohort (Cohort A) and will begin in the
      Hospitalized cohort (Cohort B).

      Hospitalized patients (Cohort B) with moderate but not severe COVID-19 will be enrolled and
      randomized to Peginterferon lambda 180µg or saline placebo on Day 0 and 7. The primary
      endpoint will be the time to negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasopharyngeal swab . In addition to
      the primary endpoints on which the study is powered, numerous secondary endpoints will be
      evaluated. Samples will also be collected for ancillary studies to better understand
      predictors of disease severity and response to treatment.
