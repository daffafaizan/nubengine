      results and/or high risk HPV (Human Papillomavirus) infection scheduled for a colposcopy
      exam. These women are asked to collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device,
      prior to their colposcopy exam at the clinic. The collected urine samples will be used for
      the development and optimisation of robust analytical protocols for first-void urine sample
      preparation and biomarker assays.

      During colposcopy, the cervix will be visually inspected, whether or not combined with a
      biopsy for histological confirmation. Colposcopy is a procedure to identify abnormalities by
      using a colposcope that gives an illuminated, magnified view of the cervical region. It often
      includes rinsing the cervicovaginal region with 50 ml acetic acid (5%). Here, this fluid will
      be collected and serve as the intermediate step between biomarkers in cervicovaginal
      secretions and urine.
