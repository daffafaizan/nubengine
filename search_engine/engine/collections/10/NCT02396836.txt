      Organization but the 3 step technique is easy to perform and has been shown by some studies
      to be effective. Compliance with the 6 step technique is not optimum. If the 3 step was more
      as or more effective than the 6 step compliance with it could be compared with that for the 6
      step. No randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of these two techniques
      using alcohol based hand rub has been conducted.
