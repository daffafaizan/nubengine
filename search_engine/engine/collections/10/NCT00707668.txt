      group constructed a cohort in Chung-ju city, a rural area in Korea, to observe the prevalence
      of metabolic diseases and its risk factors since 2003. About 12,000 subjects participated in
      this cohort study till 2006. Now, we are planning to follow-up these subjects and provide
      health examinations from May, 2007 to Feb, 2011. The prevalence and incidence of metabolic
      diseases including diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, dislipidemia and osteoporosis
      will be observed.
