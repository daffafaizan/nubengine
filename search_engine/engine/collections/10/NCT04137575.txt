    
      A randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of ConquerFear-Group (CF-G) on breast
      cancer survivors with clinical levels of Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR), compared with a
      control condition (CC), will be conducted.

      The aims are to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of CF-G on FCR,

        2. Explore the effects on the secondary outcomes of emotion regulation, general distress,
           health-related QoL, survivors' unmet needs, mindfulness, metacognitions, intervention
           satisfaction, negative effects of intervention, and sleep.

        3. Explore emotion regulation, metacognitions, working alliance, patient adherence, and
           group cohesion will be explored as possible mediators.

        4. Explore treatment expectancy, participation in other treatments after completion of the
           CF-G or the CC and demographic and clinical variables as possible moderators.

      Primary hypothesis:

      CF-G will yield larger reductions in FCR than CC at post treatment, and the effect will be
      maintained through the follow-up period.

      Secondary hypotheses:

      CF-G will demonstrate a larger improvement in measures of emotion regulation than CC
      following the intervention period.

      Changes in emotion regulation during treatment will mediate the effect of CF-G on FCR.

      Changes in metacognitions during treatment will mediate the effect of CF-G on FCR.

      CF-G will yield larger reductions in general distress, health-related QoL, survivors' unmet
      needs than CC, and CF-G will yield larger improvements in metacognitions, mindfulness, and
      sleep than CC following the intervention period.
