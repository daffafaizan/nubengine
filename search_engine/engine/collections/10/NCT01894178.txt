    
      This is a randomized, double-blinded study. Neither the patient nor the anesthesia
      practitioner advancing the ETT will know the group to which the patient has been assigned. On
      the day of surgery, participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of two groups. Both groups
      will be electively intubated with a fiberoptic scope. One group will be intubated using a
      Parker-Flex endotracheal tube and the second group of will be intubated with a standard
      endotracheal tube. There will be an equal probability of being assigned to either group. No
      placebo or control group will be used. Randomization will be computer-generated and
      assignments will be enclosed in sealed envelopes to provide allocation concealment. The
      anesthesiology technician involved in the case will open the envelope at the start of the
      case and will not be blinded to the study, due to the fact that the technician must prepare
      the endotracheal tube for the fiberoptic intubation.
