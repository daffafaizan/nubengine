      community-based individuals. An experimental, randomised trial will be implemented, with
      participants randomly assigned to either five daily, 20-minute mindfulness meditation
      sessions or clinical hypnosis sessions. Repeated measures and experimental pain manipulation
      will be implemented. Aim 1 is to examine the effects of these two treatments on experimental
      pain outcomes. Aim 2 is to examine the moderators of these effects. Aim 3 is to determine the
      mediators underlying improved experimental pain outcomes. Results will refine theory and will
      inform the future streamlining of treatments to target those mechanisms shown to be of most
      critical importance.
