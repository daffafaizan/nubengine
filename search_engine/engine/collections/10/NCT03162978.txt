      positive outcome expectations of a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention
      produces greater improvements in psychological and physiological study outcomes. This project
      will yield empirical evidence that will inform how to help Americans meet physical activity
      guidelines; how to develop exercise programs that are more likely to promote exercise as a
      habit; and maintenance of health and a healthy body weight.
