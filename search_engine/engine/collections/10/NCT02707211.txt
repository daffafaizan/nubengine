      diseases related to lipid metabolism. Moreover, oxLDL has been shown to be involved in
      pathological processes such as an inappropriate inflammatory response, disturbance of
      cholesterol metabolism and dysfunction of the lysosomal apparatus. Relevantly, it has been
      shown that immunizing mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae results in higher serum titers of
      anti-oxLDL IgM antibodies due to molecular mimicry.
