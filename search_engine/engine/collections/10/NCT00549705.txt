      or prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Concern
      with the administration of heparins and risk for adverse sequelae has led to the development
      of newer, longer-acting agents. Fondaparinux offers once daily administration with only an
      extremely small risk of developing heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

      Recent data have further demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Fondaparinux in VTE and ACS,
      expanding its use in clinical practice. We aim to: 1) determine how Fondaparinux is being
      used in a "real life" clinical setting, a tertiary-care academic medical center (BWH), and 2)
      assess the associated clinical outcomes at 90 days after initiation of Fondaparinux.
