      altered by mutations in genes encoding muscle ion channels.

      Patients suffer from myotonic stiffness, pain, fatigue and sometimes paralysis.
      Non-dystrophic myotonia is distinct from myotonic dystrophies with the absence of muscle
      degeneration.

      Paramyotonica congenita is characterzied by paradoxial myotonia, which, in contrast to the
      more common myotonia congenita, is myotonic stiffness that worsens with activity. Typically,
      the first few contractions seem normal, whereas repetition leads to severe stiffness. Our
      hypophysis is that these patient might also suffer from muscle degeneration.
