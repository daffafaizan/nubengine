      fractures repaired with open reduction and internal fixation. Patients are consented and
      enrolled pre-operatively, and randomized to either control or liposomal bupivacaine with
      bupivacaine administered intra-operatively. Patients are to remain blinded to the treatment
      arm. The surgeon is non-blinded and administers the bupivacaine solution locally,
      intra-operatively.

      Patients pain scores and pain medication usage is documented. A trained research coordinator
      contacts each patient at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-operatively to assess pain levels on a
      visual analog scale (VAS) and pain medications taken. Patients return for followup at
      standard intervals of 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-operatively to
      assess healing and functional outcomes. Patients are queried as to satisfaction with pain
      control at 2 weeks post-operatively. The study will compare outcomes including pain levels,
      pain medications taken, operating room (OR) and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) times,
      length of stay (LOS), satisfaction with pain control, clinical outcomes, and complication
      rates.
