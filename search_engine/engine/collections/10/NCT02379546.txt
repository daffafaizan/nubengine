      the extra-ocular muscle and may lead to serious bradycardia or arrhythmia in the patients
      during strabismus surgery. It is presumed that the depth of anesthesia is one of the
      influencing factor on the OCR. But the clinical trials which are evaluating the relationship
      between the anesthesia depth and OCR are scarce. The main objective of this study is to
      determine the impact of the depth of anaesthesia that is adjusted with the bispectral index
      (BIS) monitor on the incidence of OCR in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery.
