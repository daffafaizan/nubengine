    
      Randomized controlled trial among women at higher risk to have a growth restricted fetus
      (30%) according to Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (RCOG) Guidelines. These
      high-risk women will be randomized in order to evaluate an improvement in several outcomes
      thanks to different strategies applied to the mothers: a stress reduction program based on
      mindfulness techniques or a nutrition interventional program based on Mediterranean diet.

      Main hypothesis: specific interventions improving maternal lifestyle and well being have a
      positive impact on pregnancy outcomes as well as on fetal growth and development.

      Secondary hypothesis is that interventions to improve maternal lifestyle well being have a
      positive impact on offspring's outcome later in life, in terms of neurodevelopment and
      cardiovascular profile, mediated by epigenetic changes in offspring.
