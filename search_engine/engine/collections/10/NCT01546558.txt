      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To examine the safety and tolerability of metformin when co administered with ranolazine
           500 mg bid at steady-state in subjects with T2DM.

        -  To determine the steady-state PK of ranolazine 500 mg bid in subjects with T2DM
           receiving metformin.
