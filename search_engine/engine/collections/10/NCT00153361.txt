      prevalent cases of HIV and AIDS in the U.S. Studies of MSM have established an association
      between alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and risky sexual behaviors. Although studies have
      assessed and confirmed the association of AOD use and unsafe sex, few have focused
      specifically on reducing sexual risk of SUMSM.

      Sexual risk reduction interventions for MSM identified in the published scientific literature
      have demonstrated that they are generally effective at reducing sexual risk behaviors among
      MSM. However, none of these interventions specifically targeted non-injecting SUMSM. Thus, a
      gap exists in prevention efforts to reduce HIV transmission among SUMSM.

      The primary aim of the Project Mix overall is to develop and evaluate a practical
      intervention strategy that is specifically tailored to the needs of non-injecting SUMSM. The
      intent of the intervention is to decrease the number of unprotected anal sex partners (and
      acts) while under the influence of AOD and in general.
