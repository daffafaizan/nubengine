    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (acetylcysteine) in improving saliva
      viscosity (as measured by the Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia [GRIX]) in patients
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can improve other GRIX subscale for patients
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      II. To determine whether NAC can improve patient reported quality of life as measured by the
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (QLQ) Head & Neck (H&N)35.

      III. To assess the adverse event profile of NAC as measured by the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) every week during radiation.

      IV. To determine patient adherence to N-acetylcysteine mucoadherent rinse using patient
      reported surveys.

      V. To determine the long-term benefits of N-acetylcysteine as measured by the GRIX
      questionnaire at 45 days and 90 days post treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive acetylcysteine oral rinse and gargle or swish for 60 seconds then
      spit 5 times per day, beginning within 3 days of the initiation of radiotherapy to 14 days
      following completion of radiotherapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive a placebo oral rinse and gargle or swish for 60 seconds and then
      spit 5 times per day beginning within 3 days of the initiation of radiotherapy to 14 days
      following completion of radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 45 and 90 days.
