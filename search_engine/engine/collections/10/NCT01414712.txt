      patients with cancer, and knowledge about the effects of different therapies, including SBRT,
      on CTC levels will be of general interest to the oncology community. Patients will undergo
      blood draws at defined times as indicated below.

        1. Prior to CT-simulation, but more than 2 days after digital rectal examination

        2. Within 24 hours following CT simulation (an endorectal balloon is used at the time of
           simulation)

        3. Within 24 hours following the first treatment

        4. Within 24 hours following the third treatment

        5. Within 1 week following the fifth treatment
