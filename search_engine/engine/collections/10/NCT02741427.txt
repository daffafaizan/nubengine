      035541412.7.0000.5188, and each volunteer signed an informed consent form prior to enrollment
      in the study.

      The sample size calculation was carried out based on a previous study. To detect the
      bleaching effect with a power of 80% and a one-tailed alpha error of 5%, a sample size of 20
      subjects in each treatment group was necessary to detect a 20% difference between groups in
      shade change. A 20% addiction in subjects' number, taking into consideration potential loss
      or refusal, gave a total sample size of 75 subjects (25 in each group). The individuals were
      invited to participate in this clinical trial through advertisement exposed at the Federal
      University of Para√≠ba, Brazil.

      Basing on eligibility criteria, 75 volunteers were selected to the trial and randomized to
      one of the three groups of treatment: G1- brushing teeth with a conventional toothpaste; G2-
      brushing teeth with a silica whitening dentifrice containing blue pigment; and G3 - at-home
      tooth bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide. The treatments will be detailed in another
      section. It was used a simple randomization to allocate the subjects, and a randomization
      table was prepared in the Excel Program by a member, not directly involved with the clinical
      part of the study.

      To mask the products used in the treatment groups, each toothpaste type was enveloped with an
      adhesive tape of a different color and the seal of the bleaching gel syringe was removed. The
      same examiner responsible for subject allocation did this procedure. Thus, testing with the
      toothpastes was double-blinded, where both evaluator and subject did not know which
      toothpaste was being used.

      The outcomes evaluated were: tooth shade, subjects' perception about tooth color appearance,
      and safety and acceptability of products tested, which were measured at baseline, 2-weeks,
      3-weeks and 4-weeks of the beginning of treatments.

      For statistical analysis, data were checked for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov
      Smirnov test, and then it was applied the appropriated parametric or non-parametric tests.
      Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.
