      Inclusion visit :

        -  Clinical examination/ Interview on health and medical history

        -  Complete UPDRS

        -  Body composition measured by DEXA

        -  Biologic check up

        -  MMS

      Protocol :

      All subjects were studied in the postabsorptive state after a 10-h overnight fast.

      On the day of the experiment, patients do not receive their treatment (MED OFF). One catheter
      was retrogradely inserted into a dorsal vain and was used for blood sample. A second catheter
      was inserted into the controlateral arm for the tracer infusion. A continuous infusion of
      D-6,6 2H2 glucose (0,05mg/kg/h) was performed during 6 hours (after a primed dose of 0,05
      mg/kg of this tracer).

      The first 3 hours, patients were studied without stimulation (STIM OFF); the last 3 hours the
      stimulator was actuated (STIM ON). Blood samples were regularly collected for the 2H2 glucose
      enrichment determination, and for the insulin, glucose and glucagon plasma concentration
      analyses.
