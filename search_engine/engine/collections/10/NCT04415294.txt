    
      SA 1. Determine whether cirrhotic patients (n=75) can self-administer the Flicker-App in
      clinic supervised by a research assistant and calculate the level of agreement between the
      CFF determined by the Flicker-App, the CFF determined by the "gold-standard" FFS device, and
      the test scores on the EncephalApp Stroop test.

      SA 2. Determine whether cirrhotic patients (n=75) can self-administer the Flicker-App at
      home, including daily measurements over 1 week and weekly measurements over 6 weeks, and
      calculate the adherence to this protocol and the variability of these CFF measurements.

      SA3. Make any necessary software or hardware adjustments to the Flicker-App to facilitate and
      simplify its self-administration by patients based on structured interview-questionnaires
      with the study participants and with clinical Gastroenterologists/Hepatologists
