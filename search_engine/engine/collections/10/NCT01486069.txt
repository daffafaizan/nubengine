      surgical procedures in which orthodontics intends to align the teeth according to their
      respective alveolar bone and the surgical procedure - orthognathic surgery - realign the jaws
      in an adequate position among themselves and related to the rest of the craniofacial
      skeleton. Orthognathic surgery has developed throughout the years technically as well as
      regarding fixation devices for the operated segments, providing prediction of results with a
      low complication incidence. A debate point is related to the possible instability of the
      mandibular position as a reference for surgical planning due to its articulation with the
      temporal fossa, the temporomandibular joint. However, studies have shown that not always the
      mandible position obtained for the articulator reflects the position observed in subjects
      after induction of general anesthesia. Since there is no evidence that indicates that any
      alteration of the position of the mandible could influence the outcomes of a orthognathic
      surgery nor any relationship of a certain type of dentofacial deformity that would be
      beneficiated by an specific order of surgery or skeletal reference (maxilla or mandible), the
      present study intends to clarify some of these questions.
