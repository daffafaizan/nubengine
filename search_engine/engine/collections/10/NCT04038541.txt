      produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which are the main source of nutrition for the cells
      in the gut. It has been reported that the fermentable fiber inulin and SCFAs may exert some
      beneficial effects including anti-inflammatory effect on the immune system. To date, the
      effect of supplementation with fermentable dietary fiber, such as prebiotics in patients with
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has not been investigated.
