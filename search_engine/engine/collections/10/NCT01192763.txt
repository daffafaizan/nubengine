      I. To evaluate the effects of neoadjuvant gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 on Notch
      inhibition via interrogation of Hes-1 expression in patients with pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of this regimen on pancreatic cancer stem cell self-renewal and
      tumorigenesis as compared to pancreatic stem cells from controls (patients who do not receive
      treatment).

      II. To evaluate the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 on days 1-3 and 8-10 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 7 days after completion of
      gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097, patients undergo complete resection comprising
      pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, or total pancreatectomy based on the anatomic
      location of the cancer. Tumor tissue from biopsy and surgery and blood samples are collected
      periodically for pharmacodynamic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for 1 year.
