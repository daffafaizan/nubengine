      world. Several risk factors for critical illness and death from the disease have been
      proposed. However, it is still unclear if the observed associations between different
      comorbidities and chronic medications and severe COVID-19 disease and mortality is different
      from associations between the same factors and other severe diseases requiring ICU-care. This
      is important since some of the observed risk factors are very common in the aged who, by age
      alone, are more prone to a more severe course of any disease. By combining several
      registries, this study will compare, on several comorbidities such as hypertension and
      diabetes , the first 2000 cases of COVID-19 patients receiving critical care in Sweden to a
      Swedish sepsis-cohort and a Swedish ARDS-cohort.
