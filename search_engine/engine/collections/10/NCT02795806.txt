    
      This study is about the quality assessment, improvement, and monitoring of an automatic
      clinical text de-identification software application called NLM Scrubber, which has been
      developed at the National Library of Medicine (NLM). The application has been developed so
      that clinical reports can be used in secondary scientific studies (i.e., for secondary use)
      without breaching patient privacy. Research on methods for protecting patient privacy and on
      the development of NLM Scrubber have been conducted by following the guidelines of and in
      compliance with HIPAA and the Privacy Act.

      In order to further develop and improve NLM Scrubber and assess its de-identification
      performance effectively, the investigators require the original / unredacted samples from all
      potential clinical report types and sources. To this end, NLM investigators have been

      collaborating with entities within NIH, namely, NIH Clinical Center, BTRIS, and NCI as well
      as outside entities, Kentucky State Registry administered by University of Kentucky and
      researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, who stated their interest in integrating NLM

      Scrubber to their application called Text Information Extraction System. These entities
      collect samples of various types of clinical reports for assessing and improving NLM Scrubber
      performance. However we also need access to the original data in order to assess

      potential problems and improve the accuracy of NLM Scrubber.
