      maternal-infant interaction, infant neuroendocrinology and infant cognitive and social
      development. The primary hypothesis predicts that home-based peer support will improve
      maternal-infant interactions. Secondary hypotheses predict that home-based peer support will:
      improve infants' cognitive development; improve infants' social development; decrease average
      daily salivary cortisol levels in infants; reduce maternal depressive symptomatology; and
      improve maternal perceptions of social support.
