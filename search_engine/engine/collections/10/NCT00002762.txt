        -  Document menstrual phase (follicular vs luteal) by circulating hormones and menstrual
           history at the time of primary surgery in premenopausal women with stage I or II breast
           cancer.

        -  Correlate menstrual phase at primary surgery with 5-year disease-free survival in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the menstrual cycle data obtained by hormone levels and study-specific menstrual
           cycle history with information recorded in the general written record.

        -  Compare the menstrual cycle data (e.g., hormone levels and cycle history) for these
           women with the data for the general population.

        -  Estimate the disease-free survival of women who undergo a 2-stage surgical procedure
           with cancer found at both stages when the surgery is not confined to the same menstrual
           cycle phase.

      Premenopausal women age 18 to 55 years, who were interviewed for menstrual history and who
      were surgically treated for stages I to II breast cancer, had serum drawn within 1 day of
      surgery for estradiol, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone levels. Menstrual history and
      hormone levels were used to determine menstrual phase: luteal, follicular, and other.
      Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were determined by Kaplan-Meier
      method and were compared by using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard modeling.
