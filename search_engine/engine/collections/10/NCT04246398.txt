      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.The GI symptoms vary from constipation (~20%), diarrhea
      (~14%), Abdominal pain/discomfort (14%), bloating (12%), incontinence (12%), reflux (7.4%),
      nausia (6%) and difficult with bowel movements (6%).

      The severity of ASD is associated with the observed GI symptoms, although no cause-effect
      relationship between GI symptoms and ASD was proven so far. ASD with GI symptoms patients
      might display significant behavioral manifestations, such as anxiety, self-injury and
      aggression and these may be attributed to the GI symptoms themselves. Therefore alleviation
      of the GI symptoms could be important also for improvement of ASD.

      In addition to the possibility that the nervous system influences the gut and the GI
      symptoms, there is also the possibility that the gut and the microbiome within the gut may
      influence the central nervous system.

      Considering the findings that children with ASD have a history of using significantly more
      antibiotics and that gut permeability increases in ASD it is reasonable to assume that ASD
      patients have distinct microbiomes and gut metabolites.

      Nevertheless, perhaps changing the gut microbiome could lead to improvement in some of the
      symptoms. So far, studies on influencing ASD (behavior and GI symptoms) by addressing the gut
      microbiome are optimistic but mostly open-labeled and still inconclusive.
