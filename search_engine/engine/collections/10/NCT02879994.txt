      I. Determine efficacy (objective response rate [ORR]) of front-line pembrolizumab for
      metastatic EGFR mutation positive programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)+ (> 1% by
      immunohistochemistry [IHC]) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety (adverse event tabulation and grading) of front-line pembrolizumab for
      metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ (> 1% by IHC) NSCLC.

      II. Determine efficacy (progression free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS]) of front-line
      pembrolizumab for metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ (>1% by IHC) NSCLC.

      III. Determine ORR, PFS and OS of subsequent EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in
      patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutation after pembrolizumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Analyze tumor tissue biomarkers for potential correlation with response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up at 3 and 6 months, and
      then every 9 weeks thereafter.
