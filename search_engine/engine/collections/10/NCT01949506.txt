      College of Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospital. Patients will be followed for three years.

      The usual treatment for sarcomas that spread to the lungs is to remove the cancer with
      surgery. Patients who cannot have surgery or prefer not to have surgery, can receive
      radiation therapy. Standard radiation therapy involves several weeks of daily treatment
      sessions, although it is not as effective as surgery and may seriously damage normal
      surrounding lung tissue. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a radiation treatment
      that gives fewer but higher doses of radiation than standard radiation. SBRT is used to treat
      metastases to the lung from many types of cancer but has not been used very often with
      patients who have metastatic disease to their lungs from sarcomas.

      The purpose of this study is to test the possibility of SBRT to the lung for metastatic
      disease to the lung. This information will be used to find out if there are factors that can
      predict recovery or outcome of patients with metastatic disease to the lung from sarcoma.
      SBRT will consist of 1 to 3 treatments per week for a total of 3 to 5 treatments to each
      tumor until therapy is complete. After SBRT is completed, follow-up exams will occur 4-6
      weeks from the completion of radiation treatment, every 3 months in year 1 and every 6 months
      for 2 years.
