      and nutritious aspects) for 12 weeks. In cooperation with the Copenhagen house of food and
      sensory staff, 19 main meals and 12 between-meals have been optimized based on nursing home
      residents' evaluations of sensory aspects. On a daily basis the menu will consist of 1
      optimized main meal and 1 optimized between-meal, served for dinner. There will be no
      selective choice for the elderly. If a participant does not want the daily meal, he will
      receive another meal from the ordinary menu from the kitchen.

      Control In comparison, the control group (n=50) will receive the same menu as the
      intervention group, however, the meals are not optimized on sensory and nutritious aspects.
      On a daily basis this menu also includes 1 main meal and 1 between-meal in 12 weeks. If a
      participant does not want the daily meal, he will receive another meal from the ordinary menu
      from the kitchen.
