      dysfunctional breathing in children and adolescents with or without asthma.

      All children and adolescents aged 10-17 years, followed in our outpatient clinic with the
      diagnose of asthma are invited to fulfill the Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ) and the Asthma
      Control Questionnaire (ACQ5)

      Children and adolescents where asthma was investigated and ruled out are invited to fulfill
      the NQ.

      Data from the electronic patient journal are used as descriptives.

      Participants with dysfunctional breathing (NQ >= 23) are invited to participate in the
      intervention study. Participants are stratified by asthma diagnose status and randomized to
      physiotherapy or standard care. Participants are followed a year after the intervention, to
      compare the development in asthma control measured by ACQ5 (if asthma) and quality of life
      measured by PedsQL.

      The effect of physiotherapy is analyzed separately for participants with and without asthma.
      In addition, primary outcomes are analyzed in a regression model with asthma status, age and
      sex as explanatory variables.
