           common dermatological conditions, such as atopic dermatitis/AD (eczema).

        -  Since culture-dependent methods are often biased assessments of microbial diversity,
           genomic methods can expand our understanding of the human microbiome and skin diseases.

        -  Chronic dermatitis is typical among rare primary immunodeficiencies: Wiskott-Aldrich
           syndrome; hyper-IgE syndrome; and combined immunodeficiency associated with DOCK8
           mutation syndrome. The skin disease in these monogenic disorders resembles AD, is
           associated with microbial infections, and may provide additional insight into
           microbial-host disease interactions.
