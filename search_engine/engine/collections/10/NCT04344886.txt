      parathyroid surgery can still be very challenging, especially in the case of small adenoma in
      ectopic localization. Radioguided technique offers both help with in-vivo identification and
      ex-vivo confirmation of adenoma. Excellent ex-vivo radio guidance results are referred. But,
      in-vivo accuracy is most important but its results are not satisfactory. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate if there is a beneficial effect of individualized timing of surgery
      using preoperative multi-phase 99mTc-MIBI single-photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT)/CT on in-vivo characteristics of minimally invasive radio-guided parathyroidectomy.
