      A single, therapeutic dose of acetaminophen (APAP, 1.0 g)) or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA,
      75 mg) is taken orally (with 375 ml of water) either alone or simultaneously with a single,
      oral, therapeutic dose of mefenamic acid (MEF, 0.75 g). In total, 5 experiments will be
      performed: 1, APAP alone; 2, DHEA alone; 3, MEF alone; 4, APAP + MEF; and 5, DHEA + MEF. Each
      experiment will be performed in duplicate. Compounds will be taken prior to eating breakfast.
      One hour later, the patient has a light breakfast (Cheerios and milk, and a cup of coffee)
      and eats normally thereafter. Urine samples are collected at 15', 30', 1 h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5 h,
      6h, 7h, 8h, 9h, 10h, 11h, and 12h intervals following dosing. The study subject will attempt
      to completely empty their bladder at each urine-collection time point. The samples are
      weighed. A 10 ml aliquot is taken from each time point and the aliquots are stored at -20 Â°C.
      Samples (0.5 ml) are then transferred to NMR tubes and NMR spectra are taken to assess drug
      metabolites in urine. Proton NMR will be performed using the 600 MHz instrument in the
      Einstein facility.
