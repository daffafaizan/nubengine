      outcomes:

      Objective 1: Determine the 12 week change in bioactive lipid mediators, and their
      relationship to vascular function and platelet reactivity in overweight or obese
      postmenopausal women with walnut incorporation into their habitual diet.

      Objective 2: Assess the contribution of metabolic phenotype on the variance in biomarker
      response that includes both primary metabolism and urolithin metabotype.

      Expected Outcomes: Forty g of daily walnut intake for six- and 12- weeks is predicted to
      positively impact the production of bioactive lipid mediators known to favorably regulate
      cardiovascular and inflammatory signaling. AA derived oxylipins produced from COX, LOX, and
      CYP epoxygenases are known as regulators of inflammation, platelet activation and vascular
      function. Therefore, understanding how certain foods such as walnuts can change the relative
      ratio of PUFA substrates (i.e., AA, ALA, LA, EPA and DHA), and their subsequent bioactive
      species produced through these enzyme pathways is necessary for the refinement of dietary
      recommendations with regard to specific foods and dietary patterns aimed at reducing the risk
      of chronic disease. Although a positive outcome is predicted, there may be substantial
      variability in response. To explore potential genetic and dietary factors that may contribute
      to the variability in response to the above functional markers, primary metabolism and
      urolithin metabotype will be assessed.

      Objective 3: Assess the influence of 12 weeks of walnut intake on facial wrinkles in
      postmenopausal women.

      Expected Outcome: Tweleve weeks of 40 g of walnut intake will improve facial wrinkles and
      erythema in the study population, and the improvements will be related to changes in
      metabotype.
