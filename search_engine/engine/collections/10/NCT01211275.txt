    
      To determine the effects of the addition of axitinib to standard chemotherapy on tissue
      samples with respect to micro-vessel density (MVD): expression of VEGF-Receptor; PDGF
      receptor expression; extent of necrosis and apoptosis.

      To determine the safety of the addition of axitinib (to a maximum of the recommended dose of
      maximally 2 x 10 mg per day) to the standard treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed.

      To determine the feasibility of performing a (second) thoracoscopy after 10 weeks of the
      combination treatment with cisplatin, pemetrexed and axitinib.

      Serum samples will be collected and tested for inhibiting effects in a tube formation and
      spheroid sprouting assay.
