    
      This study is a single center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial for patients
      eligible for statin therapy by current guidelines, but not on statin therapy due to a history
      of statin intolerance. Patients will be provided a "DESIFOR" kit which includes 5 randomly
      allocated 4-week blister packs of capsules containing either 20mg of rosuvastatin or placebo.
      While blinded to treatment, patients will document the severity of musculoskeletal symptoms
      every week using a numerical scale. The primary endpoint will be the difference between the
      mean musculoskeletal symptom score while randomized to statin therapy compared to the mean
      score while on placebo. After completion of the study, the results will be unblinded and
      reviewed at a 6 month follow-up visit with the patient and, for patients with symptoms found
      to not correlate with statin therapy, a trial of non-blinded statin therapy over the next 3
      months will be recommended. This study will serve as a pilot study to determine the
      feasibility and potential benefits of a larger multicenter trial with similar aims.
