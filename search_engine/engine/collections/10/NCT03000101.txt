      juice consumption on reducing fecal calprotectin (FC) levels in volunteers suffering from IBD
      with a high risk of clinical relapse. In detail, the objectives of this intervention are as
      follows: (i) assessing the changes in FC levels in the two groups (active treatment, control)
      from baseline to 12 weeks later (primary outcome); (ii) investigating the systemic and
      mucosal modifications of selected biochemical and molecular inflammatory response markers in
      the two groups after 12 weeks of the intervention compared with baseline (secondary
      outcomes); (iii) evaluating circulating and urinary ellagitannin-derived metabolites from
      regular pomegranate juice consumption in the two groups before and after the intervention.

      The detailed study protocol is published in the Trials journal.
