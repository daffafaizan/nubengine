    
      Fifty consenting participants with long-standing fibromyalgia (> 3 mo duration) will be
      randomized to one of two treatment groups (n=25 per group) according to a computer generated
      randomization table. Group 1 will be the 'sham' control group and Group 2 will be the
      'active' laser treatment group. The study will be conducted in a double-blind fashion using a
      standard 42 watt Class IV laser which has a switch at the back of the device which allows the
      laser to operate in the 'inactive' mode despite giving the operator and patients the
      appearance of being active (e.g., generates skin warmth and a red beam of light). Treatment
      will be administered three times/week for three weeks. Data will be collected across the
      3-week intervention and one week after completion of the intervention. Data will be analyzed
      with appropriate statistical methods.

      The following outcome measures will be collected at baseline: (1)Standardized SF-36
      questionnaire; (2) Symptom Impact Questionnaire; (3) current analgesic medication usage; (4)
      pressure-pain threshold testing over tender points; and (5) spinal range of motion with an
      inclinometer and accelerometer. Outcome measures (2) and (3) will be re-assessed during the
      treatment phase at the end of weeks 1, 2 and 3. At 1 week and 1 month after the last
      laser/sham treatment session, all baseline assessments will be repeated, in addition to a
      global rating of change scale. Any patient who reports any harm from the laser/sham
      treatments on the helpfulness scale will be queried for specific harm details.
