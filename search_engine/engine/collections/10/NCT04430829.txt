    
      Study Objectives: The goal of this study is to assess the clinical value and inter-rater
      reliability of WBCTa in evaluating meniscal and cartilage lesions and compare with detection
      of these lesions on contemporaneous MRI.

      Study Type and Design: This cross-sectional, observational study will compare WBCTa with MRI
      to evaluate rate of detection of meniscal and cartilage lesions. The inter-rater reliability
      of WBCTa readings also will be assessed.
