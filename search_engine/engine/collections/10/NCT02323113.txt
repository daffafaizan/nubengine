      people who have relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This study will be
      conducted in 2 phases. The first phase will determine a safe and well-tolerated dose of
      TAK-659 to be used in the second phase, and the second phase will look at response to
      treatment in people who take TAK-659.

      The study will enroll approximately 106 participants (up to 40 in the first phase and 66 in
      the second phase). There will be two separate cohorts during Phase 2 portion of the study,
      one for participants with FLT-3 ITD mutations and the other for FLT-3 wild-type participants.

      Phase 1b:

      • TAK-659 60 milligram (mg) tablet starting dose escalated in 20 mg or higher increments to a
      maximum tolerated dose or RP2D

      Phase 2:

      • TAK-659 tablet at the maximum tolerated dose or RP2D determined in Phase 1b.

      All participants will be asked to take their prescribed tablets at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is up to 24 months (12 months of treatment and 12 months of
      follow up) unless the treating physician believes the participant would continue to derive
      benefit from the study drug.
