      clinics in the Southern Province in Zambia will be randomly selected to have a peer referral
      incentive program or not. In approximately 10 randomly selected intervention clinics, all men
      who reside in the catchment area of the clinic and come for male circumcision services will
      be eligible to receive 5 referral vouchers that will entitle them to receive monetary
      compensation for each voucher that is subsequently presented by a man who comes to the clinic
      and undergoes male circumcision. In 10 remaining clinics (control group), VMMC services will
      proceed as per the current standard of care, without peer referral incentives. All clinics
      including those allocated to the control group will have the standard mobilization and
      promotion activities that are used by CIDRZ.

      In intervention clinics:

        -  All eligible men seeking VMMC in intervention clinics will be asked if they want to
           participate in the study. This can happen on the day of the circumcision or within 7
           days after the circumcision.

        -  If yes, a file is open for them as "referring person". They receive 5 vouchers. They
           also receive MC brochures to distribute to friends.

        -  As his friends or relatives come in as referrals, they are written in his file He can
           then claim reimbursement any time between the time a referred friend comes for VMMC and
           the expiration of the voucher. The referring person needs to bring the voucher in order
           to receive reimbursement.

        -  Friends who come as referrals are given the possibility to become referring persons too,
           if within the intervention period. In that case, a new file is open for them as
           "referring persons".
