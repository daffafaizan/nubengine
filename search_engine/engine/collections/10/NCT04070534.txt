      knowledge and follow up among underserved women with abnormal pap smears. The researchers
      will use a unique web-based platform, the Patient Activated Learning System (PALS), which
      provides engaging and informative video and text designed to improve patient knowledge
      specifically among underserved populations. Twenty diverse patients with abnormal pap smears
      will be recruited from the Women's Health colposcopy clinic for initial qualitative
      interviews. Forty patients from the same population will then be engaged in a pre-post pilot
      to examine feasibility, acceptability, and impact of modules on improving knowledge.
