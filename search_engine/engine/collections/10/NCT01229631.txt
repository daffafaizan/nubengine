    
      The objective of this study is to determine whether enhanced micronutrient intake in the form
      of fruit, vegetable and berry juice powder (FVB) concentrate, improves clinical outcomes in
      chronic periodontitis patients prior to non-surgical treatment. In addition, the effects of
      supplementation prior to and following standard non-surgical management will be assessed,
      relative to a placebo supplemented group.

      The investigators hypothesize that 3-months of nutritional support using this FVB will result
      in additional reductions in marginal gingival inflammation (bleeding) and additional
      reductions in probing pocket depth (mean & cumulative), over and above any placebo-related or
      behavioral effect. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that 3-months of nutritional
      support prior to a standard non-surgical therapy in conjunction with a continuation of the
      nutritional support for 3 months will result in further additional reductions in marginal
      gingival inflammation and probing pocket depth, over and above any placebo-related or
      behavioral effect following standard non-surgical therapy.
