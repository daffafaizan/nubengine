      offering direct mailings of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products. Sending free
      NRT such as patches to quitline callers, however, often requires a large budget because
      quitlines have a large number of smokers calling for help each year. A strong rationale is
      needed for state funding agencies to pay for the patches, which are generally considered the
      responsibility of health plans. This study will contrast the condition of sending nicotine
      patches directly from the quitline with a condition where the quitline assists smokers to
      obtain patches by other means, primarily through their health plans. The study aims to
      demonstrate that sending patches immediately after smokers call the quitline has a
      motivational effect that will lead to a higher quit rate than if smokers have to obtain the
      patches themselves, even if they are able to obtain them for free. To tease apart how much of
      the effect of sending patches directly from the quitline is due to the active ingredient in
      the patches and how much is due to motivational effects, this study adds a placebo condition.
      We hypothesize that the active patches condition will outperform the placebo condition, and
      the sending of placebo patches will outperform the condition in which the smokers obtain the
      nicotine patches themselves. We also hypothesize that counseling has its own effect on
      quitting above and beyond that of the nicotine patches. This study will supply data that can
      be used to decide what role nicotine replacement therapy should play in publicly funded
      tobacco cessation programs. Results will also add to the theoretical understanding of
      behavior change from which new, effective interventions can spring.
