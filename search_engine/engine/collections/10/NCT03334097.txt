      to measure the fear of childbirth in terms of the woman's cognitive appraisal of childbirth,
      which is now the most commonly used measure of fear of childbirth. The version A, measures
      the fear before a delivery (WDEQ-A). It consists of 33 items on a 6-point Likert scale (0 =
      do not agree; 5 = totally agree). The total score ranges from 0 to 165; the higher the score,
      the greater the fear the pregnant women experience. A higher score (over 85) indicates a more
      intense fear of childbirth, and a score of over 100 is considered as a phobia; thus, the
      scale can measure individual degrees of fear among women before and after their deliveries In
      Spain, there is no specific instrument to test the effectiveness of different practices that
      are commonly used to reduce the fear of childbirth as the maternal education. Hence, after
      cross-cultural adaptation into Spanish of the questionnaire (WDEQ-A-Sp), the responsiveness
      after and educational intervention will be analysed.

      Descriptive analyses will be applied to calculate means and standard deviations of the
      demographic variables. Distribution and normality will be determined by the one-sample
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (significance >0.05). Responsiveness will calculated following
      COSMIN requirements.
