      (DCs) loaded with tumor-associated antigen(s) have been shown to induce tumor-specific
      immunity against melanoma antigens measured by in vitro assays and, in some cases, tumor
      regression. At the present time, the numbers of recorded patients with metastatic melanoma
      who have been treated with DC vaccinations are too small to predict with certainty the future
      of overall therapeutic value of DC vaccinations in the management of patients with metastatic
      melanoma. The purpose of this study is to gather data on feasibility and efficacy of novel
      combination therapy of CPA and a DC vaccine outlined in this protocol to treat metastatic
      melanoma.
