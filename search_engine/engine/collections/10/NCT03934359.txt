    
      Study Population is adult patients (≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically
      confirmed, unresectable advanced solid tumors that have progressed despite standard therapy
      or for which no standard therapy exists.The selected starting dose, 0.01 mg/m2 of
      DN1508052-01, SC, on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of each cycle.The starting dose will proceed
      with one patient. The next dose 0.1 mg/m2 will be explored if safety data permit in that
      there is no instance of a ≥ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE v5.0) Grade
      2 AE that is at least possibly related to the study intervention.then Dose escalation will
      then proceed following the 3+3 cohorts design.Dose escalation will continue until MTD or RP2D
      is reached, or the dose escalation will be terminated at the discretion of Investigators and
      Sponsor (or its designee) based on the analyses of emerging PK, PD, safety and efficacy
      data.The Primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      phase Ⅱ dose (RP2D) and assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of DN1508052-01 as a single agent
      when administered subcutaneously to adult patients with advanced solid tumors.
