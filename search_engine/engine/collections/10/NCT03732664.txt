      nivolumab in patients with high-risk resectable NSCLC, and will facilitate a comprehensive
      exploratory characterization of the tumor immune milieu and circulating immune cells and
      soluble factors in these patients. Data obtained in this study will provide valuable
      information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other
      immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting.
      Ultimately, it is highly desirable to discover prospective biomarkers of response and
      toxicity to allow patients with NSCLC who are most likely to derive benefit to receive
      anti-PD-1 treatment, and conversely to minimize the risk of toxicity and ineffective
      treatment for patients who are unlikely to benefit.
