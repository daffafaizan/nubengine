      rhinovirus (HRV) is a major risk factor for subsequent exacerbation. Additionally, the
      investigators have shown that the nucleotide receptor, P2X7, is an important host factor in
      the prevention of exacerbations, and have data to suggest that this may occur at the level of
      the alveolar macrophage. Alveolar macrophages facilitate the resolution of inflammation in
      part by generating eicosanoid metabolites of arachidonic acid including prostaglandin E2
      (PGE2) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4). Patients with severe asthma have a reduced capacity to generate
      PGE2 and LXA4 when compared to those with non-severe asthma, despite alveolar macrophage
      expression of two of the key enzymes involved in their production. These and other data
      suggest that pro-resolving eicosanoid metabolism is most efficient when airway epithelial
      cells are in communication with alveolar macrophages, and that these pathways may be
      defective in patients with severe asthma. Moreover, inoculation experiments with human
      rhinovirus (HRV) demonstrate that alveolar macrophages express cox-2 during resolution. These
      and other data have led to the central hypothesis that transcellular generation of PGE2 and
      lipoxins is regulated by P2X7-induced cox-2 expression in alveolar macrophages, and that this
      process facilitates resolution of an HRV-triggered exacerbation.
