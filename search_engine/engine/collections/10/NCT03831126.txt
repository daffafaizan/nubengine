      an adverse effect on the physiological, metabolic and neuronal development of the fetus
      during gestation with possible long-lasting effects. Several studies showed that maternal
      stress also affects fetal endocrine processes during pregnancy and increases the risk for
      childhood and adult obesity. Thus, the aim of the study is to investigate the effect of acute
      stress related to the action of the artificial glucocorticoid betamethasone on fetal heart
      and brain activity. The fetal activity will be measured with biomagnetic sensors.
