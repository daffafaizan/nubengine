    
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a highly vexing problem manifested by sensory and motor
      symptoms that disrupt sleep onset or sleep maintenance. RLS is the second most common sleep
      disorder and occurs with an estimated prevalence of 10% in the general population. The sleep
      disruption results in daytime symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and mood
      changes. There are no consistently reliable treatment alternatives. There is an urgent need
      for new, innovative treatment strategies because available pharmacological treatments often
      stop working over time or are associated with unacceptable side effects. An effective
      nonpharmacological treatment would be a highly attractive alternative.

      Anecdotally, patients have reported that use of sequential compression devices (SCD)
      prescribed for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis can have a positive effect on RLS
      symptoms. Because this nonpharmacological alternative is available, safe, and affordable,
      further investigation is warranted.

      Simply stated, the null hypothesis is that SCD therapy does not have an impact on RLS
      symptoms.

      Patients will be randomized to wearing SCDs or sham SCDs for an hour each day prior to the
      usual onset of the RLS symptoms. At baseline and at monthly follow-ups for 3 to 4 months,
      participants will complete questionnaires to assess the severity of the RLS symptoms, their
      daytime sleepiness, and the impact of the RLS on quality of life.
