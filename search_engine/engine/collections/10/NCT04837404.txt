    
      ULTRACOLOR is a prospective, multicentre, randomized investigator-initiated trial designed to
      enroll 542 subjects with an indication for PCI for complex coronary lesions.

      This study will investigate if ultrasound guided femoral access is associated with less
      clinically relevant access site related bleeding and/or vascular complications requiring
      intervention as compared to the fluoroscopy guided method for complex PCI with large-bore
      access.
