      were enrolled in this randomized, prospective and placebo-controlled study. The indications
      for tonsillectomy were recurrent infections and tonsillar hypertrophy leading to obstructive
      symptoms.

      The patients included to the study were randomly assigned to one of the 3 groups to receive
      different concentrations of levobupivacaine or saline.

      The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rates (HR) of all patients were recorded during
      the whole anesthesia and surgical procedures. The duration of anesthesia and surgery were
      also recorded. Additional remifentanil 1 Âµgr kg-1 IV was administered to the patients if HR
      was increased by 25 % of the basal value.

      During postoperative period, symptoms such as pain, fever and dysphagia, adverse affects such
      as nausea and vomiting and hemorrhage were evaluated. Pain was evaluated by FLACC (Faces,
      leg, activity, cry, consolability), FPRS (Faces pain rating scale) ve Wong-Baker facies
      scales at postoperative 0, 30 and 60 minutes and 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours. Total analgesic
      consumption during the postoperative period were recorded. If the patients had no
      complication, they were discharged at the postoperative 24th hour.
