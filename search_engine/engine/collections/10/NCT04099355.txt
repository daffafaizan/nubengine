      joint. Recovery from this procedure takes weeks and requires opioids to manage post-surgical
      pain. The goal of this study is to investigate whether dronabinol (synthetic THC) can reduce
      pain and the need for opioid medication following this particular surgery.

      Subjects will be recruited from the Department of Orthopedic Surgery. All subjects will
      undergo total knee replacement as part of their clinical care (the surgery itself is not part
      of this study). The study begins following discharge from the hospital. They will be asked to
      take dronabinol or placebo as they recover from surgery. During this time they will be given
      their usual pain medications at discharge which includes opioids for pain. The opioids are to
      be taken if the subject is experiencing pain. The investigator's hypothesis is that subjects
      taking dronabinol will need fewer doses of opioids to control pain.
