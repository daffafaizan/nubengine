    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, repeat dose, ascending dose study assessing the PK, safety,
      tolerability, PD, and dose- or exposure-response of Topical Oxymetazoline for intra-anal
      application.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the plasma concentrations and PK
      parameters, as data allows, of oxymetazoline following single and repeated intra-anal
      application of oxymetazoline gel 1 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg in healthy male and female subjects.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated
      intra-anal application of oxymetazoline gel 1 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg in healthy male and female
      subjects.

      A total of 32 healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled (16 subjects in the first
      cohort and 8 subjects in the remaining cohorts) and will be exposed to Topical Oxymetazoline
      1 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg applied intra-anally QD for 11 consecutive days.
