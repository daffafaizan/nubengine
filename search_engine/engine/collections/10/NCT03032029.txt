      regular clinical practice, a first control visit (i.e. Follow-up number one) should occur
      during the first 6 months. Further follow-up visits are only indicated when the patient is
      reporting problems during the course of therapy. We recommend FU visit at least once year
      (after the first routine FU visit). Each patient will be included for 6 months, the total
      duration of phase 1 of the registry. Phase 2: The pilot phase 1 enrolled over 200 patients.
      After completion of the pilot phase the registry expands to 1 additional country in Europe
      with the goal of enrolling up to 800 patients over a period of 4 years. The collection of
      data will be performed during the course of clinical routine. In regular clinical practice, a
      first control visit (i.e. Follow-up number one) should occur after the first 12 months of
      therapy use. Further follow-up visits are only indicated when the patient is reporting
      problems during the course of therapy. Each patient will be included for a maximum of 15
      months, whereas serious events will be tracked throughout the total duration of phase I and
      II of the registry.
