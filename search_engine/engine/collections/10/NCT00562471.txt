      surgeries, and are frequently associated with chronic or recurrent pelvic pain, intestinal
      obstruction and infertility. This randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical study was
      designed to evaluate the safety and performance of Adhibitâ„¢ Adhesion Prevention Gel versus
      the standard of care for the reduction of postoperative adhesions in subjects undergoing
      myomectomy via laparotomy or laparoscopy. Subjects were scheduled to return within 6-8 weeks
      after the initial surgical procedure. At that time, a second-look laparoscopy was performed
      for postoperative adhesion assessment. Adhesions were graded using a modified American
      Fertility Society (mAFS) scoring method.
