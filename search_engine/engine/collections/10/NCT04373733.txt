    
      A prospective, randomised, open label study of the combined use of favipiravir and standard
      clinical care verses standard clinical care alone.

      A computer-based software will randomise participants 1:1 to either receive favipiravir and
      standard medical care or standard medical care alone. The allocated medical regime will
      commence for 10 days.

      Research blood, sputum nose swab and urine samples will be collected at baseline, as well as
      between day 5 and 10, and between day 14 and 28 to enable comparative analyses.

      A COVID-19 antibody test will also be performed 14-28 days after randomisation. In the event
      of clinically indicated bronchoscopy taking place within 28 days of consent then additional
      bronchoscopy washing and brushing samples and paired blood sample will be taken for research
      purposes If a participant is discharged before one of the latter time points, they will be
      required to return to hospital (provided they are well enough) for the collection of repeat
      samples.

      Participants will be closely monitored whilst taking the study medications. Participants will
      study exit at subject death or 28 days post-randomisation.
