      realism is established, create a synthetic form of blood resembling real blood by its
      viscosity and color for the simulation and elaborate the dynamic interface of the simulation
      of hemoptysis. The quantity and way of administration of the blood through the trachea will
      be tested to obtain a realistic hemoptysis as seen in supraglottic.

      For the simulation, we will compare the efficiency of intubation, judged by the failure rate
      of intubation on first try, for (a) the direct laryngoscopy with MacIntosh blade, (b) the
      videolaryngoscopy with McGrath XBlade and (c) the videolaryngoscopy with McGrath XBlade with
      the suction advanced before the camera. We will also measure the time to intubation, the
      failure rate of intubation, the suction use and the difficulty of intubation as reported by
      the participants.
