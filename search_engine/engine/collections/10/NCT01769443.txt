      Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood. Plasma cells and
      antibodies produced by plasma cells can be involved in organ rejection after transplantation.

      This trial will evaluate if decreasing plasma cells and antibodies with bortezomib and
      plasmapheresis can reduce complications while participants are waiting for their heart
      transplant. The evaluation of efficacy is defined by a lower complication rate while on the
      heart transplant waitlist.
