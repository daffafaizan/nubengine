      saturated fat, and poor in food such as fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains. This type
      of diet is associated with higher risk to develop obesity and other health problems such as
      high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Western diet can
      also cause changes in the gut that allow bacteria that are typically only present in the gut
      to leak out into the bloodstream. It is thought that having gut bacteria in the bloodstream
      may play a role in the development of diseases like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

      Curcumin is a dietary supplement that comes from the root of the turmeric plant, and it may
      have an effect on the function of the gut and the leakage of gut bacteria into the
      bloodstream. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of daily curcumin
      dietary supplements on the function of the gut in subjects who are at risk for cardiovascular
      and metabolic diseases, for example they have increased blood pressure, increase waist
      circumference and high triglycerides (fat in the blood).
