      cephalosporin that was FDA approved in 2010 for community acquired pneumonia and skin and
      skin structure infections. Ceftaroline is FDA approved for both Gram-positive and
      Gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive organisms covered are Staphylococcus aureus
      (methicillin resistant and methicillin sensitive strains), Streptococcus agalactiae,
      Streptococcus pneumonia, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Gram-negative coverage includes
      Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenza, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Klebsiella oxytoca. In
      order for ceftaroline to exhibit effective bacterial killing, it requires that a certain
      percentage of the dosing interval is spent above the MIC.

      Dosing of ceftaroline in patients with chronic kidney disease is defined, but there is no
      data on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug in patients receiving continuous
      renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The purpose of this study is to determine pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline in a critically ill patient population receiving CRRT, in
      order to define a dosing recommendation in this population. CRRT modes that patients may be
      receiving in this trial include: continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), continuous
      veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF).
