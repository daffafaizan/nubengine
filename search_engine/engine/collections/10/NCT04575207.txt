    
      Flash FFR â…¡ is a prospective, multicenter, blinded, randomized, non-inferiority trial.
      Eligible patients with moderate coronary artery stenosis will be included in the study and
      randomly assigned to either caFFR-guided group or FFR-guided group. Participant caFFR or FFR
      will be used to guide percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy.

      The rate of major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE) and the cost data will be collected
      during the long-term follow-up (2 years). MACE is defined as a composite of all-cause death,
      myocardial infarction (MI), unplanned revascularization. Clinical outcomes and
      cost-effectiveness will be compared between the two groups.

      A subgroup analysis is pre-set and included in the protocol, including age, sex, body mass
      index, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, mean aortic pressure (resting state), acute
      coronary syndrome, left ventricular ejection fraction, lesion site, lesion stenosis severity,
      target vessel reference diameter, small vessel lesion, blood flow velocity, PCI mode, and so
      on.

      The trial is equipped with a core laboratory. Some interesting sub-studies will be carried
      out, such as a comparison of laboratory and operator analysis results.

      If the trial results show non-inferiority, it should be noted that caFFR can bring new
      benefits to both operators and patients as a new index of physiological assessment of
      coronary artery stenosis severity with the advantages of lower cost, less risk, faster time,
      and less use of resources.
