      intended to assist patients with breast cancer understand their diagnosis and treatment
      options (both as part of standard of care practice and clinical trials) and manage their
      care, through treatment and symptom tracking. Patients will also be able to share information
      and get news via the app relevant to their cancer subtype. Results from this intervention
      will inform future clinical integration efforts, improve patient-centeredness of such an
      app-based health content and data platform, and inform the design of a larger, randomized
      study to demonstrate an improvement in patients' outcomes as well as enhanced Real-World
      Evidence (RWE) data collection.
