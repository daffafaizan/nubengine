      beetroot juice has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure at rest and to improve
      exercise performance during cycle time trials. Furthermore, a positive exercise performance
      effect of nitrate ingestion has been observed in recreational athletes during intermittent
      exercise. However, this was achieved after acute supplementation with a substantial dose of
      dietary nitrate. Whether similar ergogenic effects of nitrate supplementation can be achieved
      with a more conventional 6-day nitrate supplementation protocol with a lower daily dose
      remains to be established. Based on the gaps in current literature, our main goal will be to
      gain further insight into the effects of a 6-day nitrate supplementation protocol on high
      intensity intermittent exercise performance in recreational athletes.
