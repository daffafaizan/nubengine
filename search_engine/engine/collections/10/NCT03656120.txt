      Relapse prevention is important for opioid dependence treatment. Thienorphine hydrochloride,
      derivatives of buprenorphine, is one of the receptor partial agonists. Previous research
      indicated that, it may be a safe and effective treatment for the prevention of opioid
      dependent patients after detoxification. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, phase â…¡b clinical trial, we are aimed to evaluate the efficacy of
      thienorphine hydrochloride tablets for anti-relapse therapy after opioid dependence
      detoxification treatment, determining the optimal dose of thienorphine hydrochloride tablets,
      and further evaluate the safety of thienorphine hydrochloride for patients with opioid
      dependence. 180 eligible patients are going to be recruited and randomly assigned to
      0.2mg/day group, 0.5mg/day group and placebo control group after they provided their consent
      forms. Subjects in each group would receive assigned treatment for 12 weeks. Primary outcome
      measure was retention time of each participants during these 12 weeks. Urine test for
      opioids, changing of withdrawal score and craving, self-reported euphoria after using heroin,
      subjects and researchers' overall evaluation of treatment efficacy are secondary outcome
      measures.
