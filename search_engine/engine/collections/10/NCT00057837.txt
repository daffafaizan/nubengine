      Primary

        -  Evaluate the response frequency of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer
           treated with topotecan, cisplatin, and etoposide and with irinotecan, cisplatin, and
           etoposide.

        -  Evaluate the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the duration of response and survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  To investigate the occurrence of various breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) alleles
           in patients receiving topoisomerase 1 inhibitors and their impact on clinical response
           and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I (PET): Patients receive topotecan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-3;
           etoposide IV over 60 minutes immediately followed by cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on
           days 8-10; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 11 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Arm II (PIE): Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and cisplatin IV over 60
           minutes on days 1 and 8 and oral etoposide twice daily on days 3 and 10.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients were accrued for this study.
