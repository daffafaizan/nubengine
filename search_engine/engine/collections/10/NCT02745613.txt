      precedes T2D) and T2D (Ryder et al., 2003). Exercise training on the other hand has been
      shown to improve insulin sensitivity and is highly effective to prevent/manage T2D. However
      it is not known if early signs of insulin resistance appear before being clinically diagnosed
      and if the benefits of exercise which prevent/cure T2D, are limited to the offspring of
      Hispanic T2D parents. Therefore, the proposed study will determine 1) if normoglycemic
      (normal blood glucose) offspring of T2D parents are insulin resistant, using the gold
      standard method to measure insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility (ability to switch
      between carbohydrate and fat oxidation) 2) if 8 weeks of exercise training improves insulin
      sensitivity and metabolic flexibility to the same extent in FH+ compared to normoglycemic
      offspring of parents without any history of T2D (FH-) and 3) if 8 weeks of exercise training
      will change the blood, lipid and molecular profiles relevant to insulin sensitivity to same
      extent in FH+ compared to offspring of parents without family history of T2D (FH-).
