      rFVIIIFc. PK analysis of pre-study factor VIII (FVIII) and rFVIIIFc will be performed in a
      sub-group of the study participants prior to commencement of prophylactic treatment. After
      these PK results are available, remaining participants have the option of proceeding directly
      to prophylactic treatment. After completing the end of study assessments, eligible
      participants would be able to continue treatment in Study 8HA01EXT.
