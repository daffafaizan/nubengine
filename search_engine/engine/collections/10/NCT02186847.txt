      I. To determine whether metformin hydrochloride (MET) added to chemoradiotherapy can improve
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effects of MET on overall survival (OS), time to local-regional progression
      (LRP), and time to distant metastasis (DM).

      II. Evaluate the effect of MET on chemoradiotherapy toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events, version 4 [CTCAE, v. 4]) within 1 year of completion of all treatment.

      III. Collect biospecimens to develop biomarkers of MET activity.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months
      for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
