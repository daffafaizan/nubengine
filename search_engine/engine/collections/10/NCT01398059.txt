      behavior (e.g. sitting). Research in adults and animal models suggests that even short bouts
      of uninterrupted siting may result in acute changes increases in cardiometabolic risk,
      although to date no studies have investigated this relationship in children and youth. The
      purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a protocol which will expose
      participants aged 10-14 years to a full day of uninterrupted sitting, and to determine the
      impact of this protocol on markers of cardiometabolic risk (insulin, glucose, triglyceride,
      HDL-C and LDL-C) as well as subsequent food intake and physical activity. The impact of
      uninterrupted sitting will be compared to the impact of interrupted sitting, with and without
      the inclusion of moderate physical activity.
