    
      Experimental study, prospective, single-center, POP feasibility pilot in the treatment of
      refractory gastroparesis.

      Patients with gastroparesis (significant prolongation of gastric emptying) unimproved by
      prokinetic treatment and meet all the eligibility criteria will be included after a period of
      reflection of two weeks minimum.

      20 patients will be prospectively included 10 patients with diabetic gastroparesis, 10
      patients with non-diabetic gastroparesis (post-surgical, post-Sjogren, idiopathic).

      POP will be performed under general anesthesia in intubated-ventilated patients using a
      carbon dioxide (CO2) inflator. The published standard technique and learned by our team on
      the pig model will be conducted: submucosal tunnel at the anterior surface of the gastric
      antrum starting 3-5 cm proximal to the pylorus front section to the fiber by fiber to the
      muscular pyloric, then closing the inlet tunnel by hemostatic clips.

      An evaluation of symptoms by the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (ISCC) of the quality
      of life of the patient Assessment of upper gastrointestinal disorders-Quality Of Life
      (PAGI-QoL), SF-36 and gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI ) and gastric emptying by
      a scintigraphic gastric emptying will be carried out at 3 months.
