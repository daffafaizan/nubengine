      progenitor phenotype (CD45+Col-1+). Fibrocytes have previously been described in murine
      cancer, implicated as mediators of tumor immune escape. In this study, the investigators will
      collect fibrocytes including CD45+Col-1+ expression. The cells express indoleamine oxidase,
      which is primarily responsible for their immunosuppressive properties. The investigators
      hypothesize that patients with non-small cell lung cancer experience expansion of
      immunosuppressive fibrocytes, which are predicted to augment tumor growth by mediating immune
      escape in non-small cell lung cancer patients.
