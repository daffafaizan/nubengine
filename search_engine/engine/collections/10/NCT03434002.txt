      implementation, assessment, and evaluation of medical education. The goals of Competency
      Based Medical Education are to improve patient safety, patient health outcomes, and enhance
      the competence and performance of individuals, groups and teams. Simulation-based training is
      a proven effective method to improve the skills and competency of the student by permit-ting
      repetitive practice before an actual procedure is performed on real patients.

      e Virtual reality simulation has been used successfully to teach technical skills such as
      laparoscopic surgery, carotid stenting, gall bladder surgery, and knee arthroscopy.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. Build a multi-user, multi-site virtual reality simulator for anesthesia management and
           team training

        2. Evaluate the simulation as a tool for competency based medical education

        3. Compare the effectiveness of the simulator with mannequin based simulator for competency
           based medical education.
