      peginterferon alpha 2a(PEG-IFN a-2a) for 96 week and followed 24 weeks after treatment. Serum
      HBV DNA load, HBsAg/anti-HBs level, HBeAg/anti-HBe will be tested at enrollment and every 3
      months during treatment and follow period. Parameters of liver and kidney function, and liver
      ultrasound examination will be tested with intervals 1-3 months. The efficacies were
      evaluated by the rate of HBsAg loss during treatment and the rate of sustained viral response
      after treatment and follow up.
