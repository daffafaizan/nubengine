    
      This study is designed to evaluate the clinical impact of pharmacogenetic (PGx)-directed
      treatment, as guided by interpretive, algorithmic report in the Pine Rest outpatient
      behavioral health clinics. The PGx algorithm utilized in this study is the foundation of a
      novel method of interpreting genetic testing results and reports them in a rapidly delivered
      format that provides enhanced guidance to psychiatrists in their selection of antidepressant
      medications
