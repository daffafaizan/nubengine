      effectiveness of two models of support for reproductive health clinicians to provide care for
      pregnant and postpartum women with an OUD: 1) a collaborative care (CC) approach based upon
      the Massachusetts Office-Based-Opioid Treatment (OBOT) Model that would provide onsite
      training, and support to providers and participants through the use of care managers (CMs) vs
      2) a telesupport approach modeled on the Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes
      (ECHO), a remote education model that provides mentorship and guided practice and
      participation in a learning community, via video conferencing.
