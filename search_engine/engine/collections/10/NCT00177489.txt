      Institute on Aging (NIA) and the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) to implement a
      multi-site caregiver intervention trial. The overall objective of this research program is to
      refine and test a multicomponent psychosocial intervention to reduce burden and depression
      among family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease or a related disorder. This
      competing renewal will build upon results obtained from its parent multi-site feasibility
      study, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH) funded by the NIA/NINR as
      a cooperative agreement (UO1-AG13305). In the study proposed here, five intervention sites
      (Birmingham, Memphis, Miami, Palo Alto, and Philadelphia) will recruit 600 (120 per site)
      caregiver-care recipient dyads consisting of equal numbers of African Americans/Blacks,
      Hispanics/Latinos, and Caucasians/Whites. Caregivers will be randomized to either an in-home
      multicomponent intervention condition or a standardized information-only control condition.

      The Coordinating Center at the University of Pittsburgh will work with the intervention site
      investigators and the NIA/NINR to support the implementation of the intervention study at
      each site and to collect and analyze a common database across sites.
