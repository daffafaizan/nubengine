      measure sleep parameters of prostate cancer patients who are beginning ADT. Although some
      evidence links ADT to poor quality of sleep, no research has assessed the impact of ADT on
      most sleep parameters. We chose the ARESTM device for this study because the device can
      comprehensively measure sleep parameters. Furthermore, unlike polysomnography, the ARESTM
      device is easy to use and the measurements can be done at participants' home, without
      requiring them to adapt to a new sleeping location (e.g., sleep lab). ARESTM is a wireless
      device that is worn on the forehead during sleep to record physiological parameters. In
      addition, the feasibility of obtaining serial questionnaires from patients will be assessed.
      In this pilot study, the study investigators will attempt to make some preliminary
      correlations between sleep quality (as measured by ARESTM) with subjective sleep quality,
      morphometric measures, urinary symptoms, and hot flashes. Data collected from this study will
      help to determine the acceptability of and compliance with using the ARESTM device by this
      patient population.
