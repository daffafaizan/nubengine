      hospital with an indication for splenectomy. We will offer enrollment to several institutions
      provided they reach institutional approval.

      This will be a definitive trial design. Based on our operative times with SILS compared with
      our recent experience in standard laparoscopy, a sample size of 30 patients will give us a
      power of 0.8 with an Î± of 0.05. Thus operative time is the primary outcome variable by
      definition. This is recorded and reported in MINUTES.

      After the procedure, both groups will be managed in the same manner per routine care. They
      will be discharged when tolerating a regular diet and their pain is well-controlled on oral
      pain medication.

      Secondary outcome measures include days in the hospital (measured in days), doses of
      analgesics (measured in doses) and perception of cosmesis as recorded by a scar assessment
      form which will be filled out by the patient and/or parents at 6 weeks and 6 months. This is
      a validated quality of life survey with 39 questions and each has 4 categories from best to
      worst.
