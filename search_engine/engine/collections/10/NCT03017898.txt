      (fistulotomy) involves very high rates of anal incontinence if performed on the majority of
      patients, and a vast number of alternative, sphincter-preserving treatments have been
      developed and evaluated in the past decades. The treatment of anal fistula with laser
      coagulation causes the fistula to collapse and subsequently heal, without having to add any
      external materials. The available published studies show that the treatment is safe regarding
      infection and incontinence, and that a majority of the patients treated show complete
      healing. There is however a need for more prospective studies to ascertain these preliminary
      facts.
