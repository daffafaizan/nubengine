      Depressive Disorder, defined as a failure of at least 1 antidepressants in the current
      depressive episode and 2 lifetime medication failures. The study will last approximately 6 to
      8 weeks, involving randomization into one of two treatment groups receiving 3 one hour long
      inhalation treatments over a week. Post-treatment assessments follow each inhalation
      treatment and are conducted 1 week and 2 weeks following the final inhalation treatment.
      Patients are then randomized again into the Second Stage of the study, involving the same
      treatment and post-treatment schedule as the First Stage detailed above.
