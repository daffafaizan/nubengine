      screening and HPV vaccine health needs; It will then send custom text messages based their
      concerns and will remind them to schedule and attend their doctor's appointment. The
      researchers will conduct a single armed proof of concept where the participants will be
      actively using WoW. The in-person BNI will empower participants to have positive behavioral
      changes in regards to their health by giving them appropriate health information as well as
      answering their questions and concerns about cervical cancer prevention and screening.
