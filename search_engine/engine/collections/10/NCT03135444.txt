        1. To pilot test a decision making tool, the PSA TOOL, for prostate cancer screening for
           usefulness and ease of use in primary care practices.

        2. To revise the PSA TOOL based upon provider and patient feedback.

        3. To assess patient knowledge about the option to be screened for prostate cancer and
           factors to consider in the prostate cancer screening decision before and after use of
           the tool.

      Study Design:

      This protocol is for field testing of a brief tool to improve prostate cancer screening
      discussions that occur at previously scheduled primary care outpatient visits.
