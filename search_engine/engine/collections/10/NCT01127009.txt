      I. To determine the DLT, MTD, and the recommended Phase 2 dose of bortezomib in combination
      with MEC in patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the non-dose limiting toxicities associated with bortezomib in combination
      with MEC in patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

      II. To describe any preliminary evidence of clinical activity of this combination (CR rate)
      in relapsed/refractory AML.

      III. To determine the median CD74 antigen expression in patients achieving a response versus
      those patients not achieving a response.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8 and 11; and mitoxantrone IV,
      etoposide IV over 1 hour, and intermediate-dose cytarabine IV over 6 hours on days 1-6.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-5 weeks.
