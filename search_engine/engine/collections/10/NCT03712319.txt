      population. It compromises not only their mental health, but also the quality of care
      provided. Aptitudes such as empathy and self-compassion are essential to improve this deficit
      and overcome the well-known burnout syndrome.

      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program has proven to be an effective intervention
      for lowering stress in numerous studies. However, this intervention asks for a significant
      degree of personal involvement, thus the number of dropouts is often reported as a problem.
      New technologies might allow users to adapt training to their personal schedules.

      The present randomized trial aims to compare the efficacy of a mindfulness-based training
      delivered through a mobile application ('REM Volver a Casa'), a presence-based program
      (MBSR), and a control group in healthcare grade students.
