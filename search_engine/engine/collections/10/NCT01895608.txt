      impairments of the motor and/or sensory systems. As a result, therapy has focused on motor
      and sensory impairments. However, evidence suggests that an impaired ability to allocate
      attentional resources to balance during dual-task situations is a powerful predictor of
      falls. Despite this fact, few studies have examined whether interventions can improve older
      adults' dual-task ability. The goal of this study is to develop effective interventions to
      improve ability to allocate attention to balance and gait under dual-task conditions.

      Older adults (n = 44) who have been referred to physical therapy (PT) for gait or balance
      impairments who have dual-task impairment will be randomized to receive either standard
      balance rehabilitation or balance rehabilitation with dual-task practice. Following PT,
      subjects will receive cognitive training (CT), either speed of processing or generalized
      cognitive training. Primary outcomes are ability to walk while performing four different
      cognitive tasks of varying difficulty. Assessment will occur at baseline, post-PT, post-CT.
