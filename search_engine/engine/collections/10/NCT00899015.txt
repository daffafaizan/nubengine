        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of arsenic trioxide in
           pediatric patients treated on protocol NCI-00-C-0070J.

      OUTLINE: Bone marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected during treatment on
      NCI-00-C-0070J are assessed for pharmacodynamics studies. Plasma cells collected during
      treatment are assessed for pharmacokinetics studies. Total arsenic (As), inorganic As forms
      (AsIII and AsV), and methylated metabolites of As are assessed.
