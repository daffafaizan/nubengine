      consecutive series of 186 participants aged 16 to 29 referred by the CAMH ED to CAMH's EPI
      program for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a 2-way SMS intervention involving
      reminders, psychoeducation, and check-ins. The primary outcome will be rate of attendance at
      the first consultation appointment assessed through chart reviews. Secondary outcomes will
      include indicators of long-term service engagement as well as symptoms and functioning 6
      months following study enrollment and health service utilization for up to 2 years using
      administrative data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES).
      Administrative data will be used for an economic analysis. Participants who receive the
      active intervention will be asked to complete a web-based survey evaluating their experience
      and a subgroup will be asked to participate in in-depth in-person qualitative interviews.
      Patients and family members with lived experience will be engaged in all aspects of the
      project, including shaping the intervention and study design.

      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will result in increased rate of
      attendance at the first EPI consultation appointment, as well as improved longer-term
      engagement in outpatient EPI services compared to the sham comparator. Demonstrating evidence
      that this low-cost, low-complexity, youth-friendly intervention improves engagement in
      outpatient EPI services has the potential to improve long-term outcomes for young people with
      psychosis.
