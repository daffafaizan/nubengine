      considered to promote QTc lengthening while progesterone and testosterone shorten QTc. New
      findings suggest more complex regulation of QTc by sex steroid hormones involving also
      follicle-stimulating hormone, which is associated to prolongation of QTc. Another important
      aim of this study is to study the influence of sex hormones on QTc duration.
