      Express™ Vascular LD stent, particularly with regard to the long-term patency in iliac
      arteries. The study would provide data on angiographic endpoints and clinical outcomes at 30
      days, 6 months, and at 12 and 24 months post implantation in atherosclerotic lesions in iliac
      arteries. The data obtained in this study with the use of the Express™ Vascular LD stent was
      compared with historical data obtained from the use of the Palmaz balloon-expandable stent.
      The Palmaz balloon expandable stent has been chosen as the control device because it is
      currently the only FDA-approved balloon-expandable stent for use in the percutaneous
      treatment of atherosclerotic disease in iliac arteries.

      The Palmaz balloon-expandable stent is no longer commercialized in Europe. Therefore a
      randomized study with the Palmaz balloon-expandable stent was not feasible. In addition,
      there are no ongoing or published randomized trials describing performance of a newer version
      of the Palmaz stent in iliac atherosclerotic lesions. In order to adequately compare the
      efficacy data of the ExpressTM Vascular LD stent with the efficacy data of the Palmaz
      balloon-expandable stent, the same efficacy parameter as in the publication on the Palmaz
      balloon-expandable stent was measured in this study: % mean loss of the luminal diameter at 6
      months post-procedure.

      The findings of the longer-term Follow-Up assessments at 12 and 24 months will be presented
      as the results from these assessments become available.
