      setting. Recent studies have looked at norepinephrine's use in the obstetric setting, and
      have shown that it can be used safely and also has favourable hemodynamic properties when
      compared to phenylephrine, with less bradycardia and less depression of cardiac output. These
      studies have been limited to using norepinephrine as an infusion and there is limited data
      with it being used as a bolus to prevent hypotension. A recent study was undertaken at Mount
      Sinai hospital to determine the ED90 of norepinephrine to treat post spinal hypotension.
      Secondary outcome data from this trial showed that the incidence of bradycardia associated
      with this treatment is approximately 7.5%, several times less when compared to the reported
      30% with phenylephrine. It would therefore be prudent at this stage to undertake a randomized
      trial comparing the hemodynamic profile of phenylephrine (our standard practice) and
      norepinephrine used as intermittent boluses to prevent hypotension and avoid decrease in
      heart rate during cesarean delivery.
