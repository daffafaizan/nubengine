    
      Background:The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic hepatectomy(LH)
      with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      Methods:A total of 110 patients with early HCC with nodular diameters of less than 3 cm and
      up to three nodules were randomly divided into LH (n=55) and RFA groups (n=55). Outcomes were
      carefully monitored and evaluated during the 3-year follow-up period.

      Results:

      operation time, intraoperative blood loss, rate of blood transfusion, complications and
      mortality, postoperative liver function, resection margin, number of micrometastases
      ,long-term curative effect and survival time were collected and analysed.

      groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed linear
      regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival analysis，Log-rank survival curves
      were used.
