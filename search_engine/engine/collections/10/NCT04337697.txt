      risk of neurodevelopmental disability in infancy. Although prognosis in early childhood is a
      critical question for parents and providers, outcomes beyond infancy are largely unknown.
      Further, parents of infants with neonatal seizures are at risk for mental health disorders,
      which can undermine their ability to care for a child with medical complexity and may
      contribute to impaired child development.

      The NSR-DEV study is a longitudinal cohort study of around 280 Neonatal Seizure Registry
      participants enrolled at one of nine sites across the USA. Participants will be evaluated
      using developmental questionnaires and in-person neurodevelopmental testing. Parent
      well-being will be assessed at each time point.
