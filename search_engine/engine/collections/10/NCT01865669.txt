      obesity in the obstetric population, scientific evidence on pregnancy outcomes in these
      patients is timely and important. The investigators' previously validated in-vitro model
      provides a solid foundation for the study of myometrial contractility under controlled
      conditions, without any confounders that could be encountered in clinical settings. It is
      also likely to provide in-depth understanding of the parameters that the investigators feel
      are responsible for higher incidence of PPH in these patients. The investigators' study will
      form a basis for future modifications in oxytocin augmentation regimens and pharmacotherapy
      for control of PPH in these patient populations.
