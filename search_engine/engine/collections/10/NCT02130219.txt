      compared to simultaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurements during lumbar
      puncture. Measures of pressure in mmHg will be compared. These measurements will be compared
      in chronic daily headache, normal pressure hydrocephalus and multiple sclerosis patients
      groups. For stroke patients noninvasive measurements will be compared with cerebral lesion in
      brain MRI/CT.
