      test subjects' postural reactions pre and post-intervention. Intervention will include four
      sessions of weighted ball tosses/weighted tether ball stops to improve muscle activation
      patterns and efficiency. EMG sensors, 3D motion analysis, and force plates will be used to
      collect the necessary data.
