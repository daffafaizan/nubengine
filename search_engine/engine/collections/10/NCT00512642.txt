      to detect early lung cancer. The majority of newly diagnosed patients have higher stage,
      often disseminated, non-resectable disease. A better understanding of the natural biology and
      molecular abnormalities in early lung lesions may aid in the development of more effective
      screening tools. The Lung Imaging Fluorescence Endoscopy (LIFE) is FDA approved as an adjunct
      to WL bronchoscopy for the screening of lung cancer.

      Using the LIFE unit, this study will set the stage for the collection of a unique set of
      biopsy specimens that will be used to learn more about the natural biology and molecular
      changes in early lung lesions. We will study abnormalities in p53 by immunohistochemistry and
      by molecular analyses. The p53 results will be compared with histological grade and with
      genomic instability. Measures for genomic instability will be the loss of chromosomal
      information and cellular aneuploidy. Recent advances in molecular pathology, such as the
      development of Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), have made the molecular profiling of
      these extremely small lesions feasible. The information obtained by these techniques will be
      used for comparison with clinical and exposure information. Future plans include the
      culturing of bronchial epithelial cells to study genomic instability in the multistep process
      of cancer progression. It is our hope that the application of these new technologies will
      improve the early detection of human lung cancer and provide insight into the natural biology
      and molecular changes of early lung lesions which may progress towards overt cancers.
