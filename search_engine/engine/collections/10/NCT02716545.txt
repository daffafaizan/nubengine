      to the recurrent small intestinal hemorrhage due to GIVM. Patients with recurrent bleeding
      (>2 times for one year) will undergo balloon assisted enteroscopy and be treated with
      endoscopic therapy if necessary. The hierarchical primary endpoints were the difference in
      yearly Bleeding times, followed (if significant) by the difference in Blood Transfusions,
      Total Transfused Red Cell Requirements, yearly bleeding Episodes, Bleeding Duration, yearly
      average Hemoglobin (Hb) level, hospitalization and iron requirement. The study will be done
      at 10 centers in China.
