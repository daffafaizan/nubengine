      patient's perspective. The tolerability assessment of the different pharmacological
      strategies for Rheumatoid Arthritis, from the patient's perspective, would provide additional
      information, improve doctor-patient communication and improve both adherence to and efficacy
      of treatment. For these reasons, the development and validation of a new tool is necessary
      not only for future researches, but for use in standard clinical practice.

      The first phase of the development of the questionnaire has already been completed. The
      second phase of the development of the questionnaire has been designed at to validate the
      tool in the Spanish population.

      This study aims to assess the measurement properties of a new tool which assesses the impact
      of daily life in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
