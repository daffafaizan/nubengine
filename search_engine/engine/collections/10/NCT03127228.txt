      to the conventional standard mechanical debridement to ablate the infected tissue around the
      dental implant and detoxify the contaminated implant surface for resolving peri-implant
      infection and enhance bone regeneration of peri-implant defects.

      This study involves one center and a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial is
      planned. Twenty-four adult patients in the need of surgical treatment due to peri-implantitis
      will be included. Six visits are needed for each patient including a 24 week follow-up visit.

      Specific Aim 1: To compare the clinical benefit of Er:YAG laser-assisted peri-implant defect
      debridement and surface detoxification with conventional mechanical debridement for
      regenerative therapy

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate whether Er:YAG laser-assisted regenerative surgical therapy can
      decrease bacterial load and alter microbial profile

      Specific Aim 3: To analyze whether Er:YAG laser-assisted regenerative surgical therapy can
      impact the molecular profile of the peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) and the stability of
      the treatment
