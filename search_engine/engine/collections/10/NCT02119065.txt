      I. To estimate the absolute difference in post-therapy Yttrium-90 microsphere hepatopulmonary
      shunt fraction and the pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin hepatopulmonary
      shunt fraction in patients with unresectable primary hepatic malignancy and hepatic
      metastatic disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify and compare the pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin particle
      sizes and post-therapy Yttrium-90 microsphere sizes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive routine pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin. Patients then
      undergo routine radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres. Within 36 hours after
      radioembolization, patients undergo PET/CT imaging.

      Available imaging, clinical, interventional and surgical follow-up data for 2 years after
      completion of enrollment in the study will be obtained.
