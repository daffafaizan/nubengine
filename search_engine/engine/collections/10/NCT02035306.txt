      include paediatric, trauma, adult medical and adult surgical patients. Informed consent will
      be obtained. Baseline demographic data, vital signs, Massey pigmentation score, and severity
      of illness scores will be calculated, as well as finger deformity, if present, nail polish or
      acrylics, smoking habits, finger diameter of finger measured, comorbidities and medications.
      Patients will be admitted in the usual way, and admission bloods will be sent to the
      laboratory as per usual protocol. Enrolled patients will in addition have their Haemaglobin
      and Plethysmography Index (measure of perfusion) measured non-invasively using the Masimo
      Pronto-7 handheld device. Note of concurrent medications, blood products and vital signs will
      be recorded at each measurement. Each patient will have measurements done 8 hourly (between
      1-5 measurements per patient). Concurrent arterial blood gas samples will be taken in a
      heparinised syringe and performed on ABL radiometer blood gas analyser.. An additional EDTA
      blood sample shall be taken at each Pronto measuring point which will be measured at the
      laboratory on a Sysmex cell counter. Analysis of data will assess precision and accuracy,
      trend accuracy, and effect of pigmentation, vasopressors and other medication on the results
      of the non-invasive co-oximetry estimation of haemaglobin.
