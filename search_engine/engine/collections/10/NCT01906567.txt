      human health from heavy metals are associated with exposure to lead, cadmium, mercury and
      arsenic. They may be toxic at the levels previously thought to have no adverse effect on
      human.In utero environmental exposures can have long term consequences to health and
      development.Ä°n spite of what is known about the neurotoxicity from exposure to heavy metals,
      the health effects from co-exposure to these chemicals and the biologically effective doses
      are not known exactly.

      Preeclampsia is associated with increased maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. The
      exact etiology is not clear. Several evidences indicate that various environmental factors
      and elements may play a role in pre-eclampsia.

      significant increase in Pb, cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu) and magnesium (Mg) and decrease in zinc
      (Zn) in amniotic fluid are associated with preeclampsia. Pb as this metal has well known
      adverse effects on renal system and blood pressures Effects of Pb on reproductive system have
      been studied intensively, e.g. other pregnancy outcome and pregnancy hypertension.

      However, the relationship between the severity of pre-eclampsia and heavy metal levels have
      not been investigated.

      The purpose of this study, to investigate whether severity of preeclampsia is associated with
      altered levels of heavy metals (Cd, Hg, arsenic and Pb) in maternal blood, fetal blood, and
      maternal hair.
