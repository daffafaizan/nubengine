      to monitor EGFR-activating mutational status and identify EGFR-TKIs benefit NSCLC patients.
      the investigators want to evaluated the use of 18F-MPG in lung cancer imaging in adult NSCLC
      patients with different EGFR mutational status of primary and metastatic cancers. And the
      investigators want to evaluated the use of 18F-MPG in adult NSCLC patients with EGFR
      mutational status received non-treatment, EGFR-TKIs and chemotherapy.
