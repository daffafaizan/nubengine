      carried in the aqueous environment of the blood. The lipoprotein particles that comprise this
      system are polydisperse and contain triglycerides, free and esterified cholesterol,
      phospholipids and proteins. Inborn errors in the lipoprotein transport system lead to
      alterations in both the steady state concentrations of the various lipoproteins and in the
      metabolism of these particles. These inborn errors lead to both hyperlipoproteinemia and
      hypolipoproteinemia. Profound changes in the ambient lipoprotein concentrations have a
      variety of clinical manifestations. The present study protocol is designed to permit a full
      evaluation of the lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins, in patients with potential
      genetic defects in these processes. We will use a variety of diagnostic procedures and assays
      that represent standard of care in tertiary referral hospitals but which are not standardized
      or CLIA-Certified and, in some cases, require isolation of tissue and blood cell samples.
      These specialized assays are necessary to correctly diagnose and treat patients that present
      with the more unusual disorders of lipid metabolism; these patients cannot be diagnosed by
      standard, CLIA-Certified assays and may require tissue or blood cells for diagnosis and
      adequate treatment. The study population will include patients which are referred to the
      Molecular Disease Branch from private care providers, academic institutions or the NHLBI-MDB
      website, with any of the following potential lipid abnormalities or clinical stigmata
      associated with dyslipoproteinemias: a) increased plasma levels of cholesterol,
      triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol; b) decreased plasma concentrations of
      cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol; c) postprandial hyperlipidemia or d) eruptive xanthomas,
      xanthelasma, tuberous or tendinous xanthomas, or corneal opacities.
