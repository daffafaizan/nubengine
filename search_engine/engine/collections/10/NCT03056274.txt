    
      Intrahepatic cholestasis is a condition that affects pregnant women. It is characterised by
      itching, usually in the third trimester of pregnancy and is associated with an increase in
      the liver enzymes and bile salts. This can be associated with maternal and neonatal
      morbidity, and rarely perinatal mortality.

      The investigators propose to assess and compare the effect of Metformin versus
      Ursodeoxycholic acid on lowering liver enzymes and bile salts, improving maternal morbidity
      and improving neonatal outcomes.

      This study is a pilot study that will be conducted at 3 NHS hospital sites where patients
      will randomly assigned to receive either Metformin or Ursodeoxycholic acid. There will be 20
      patient in each arm. Recruitment will commence in February 2017 and will run for an 18 month
      period.
