    
      The trial is designed as a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, first-in-man phase I/II
      study investigating an off-the-shelf, multi-peptide-based HCC vaccine (IMA970A) plus CV8102
      adjuvant (RNAdjuvantÂ®) following a single pre-vaccination infusion of low-dose
      cyclophosphamide (CY) acting as an immunomodulator, in patients with very early, early and
      intermediate stage HCC.

      The study treatment is applied without any concomitant anti-tumor therapy, with the intention
      to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence/progression in patients who have received all
      indicated standard treatments.

      Overall, it is planned to treat about 40 patients with IMA970A (off-the-shelf vaccine) plus
      CV8102 (adjuvant) plus a single low-dose of pre-vaccination CY acting as an immunomodulator
      in the HepaVac-101 study.

      Patients are requested to sign the 1st informed consent (IC 1) for screening 1 procedures
      (blood drawings for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing and for cellular immunomonitoring,
      capture of demographics and staging of disease [routinely performed, older images may be used
      if requirements are met]), which takes up to 4 weeks. Thereafter, patients receive indicated
      standard treatment followed by recovery, which lasts for at least 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks.
      The main-phase with full safety surveillance starts with the patient's signature of the 2nd
      informed consent (IC 2) and lasts until the end of the EoV (End-of-Visit, Visit 10) Visit
      (4-6 weeks after last vaccination). For each patient this main-phase lasts up to approx. 6.5
      months consisting of up to 4 weeks screening 2, about 4.5 months vaccination period and about
      4 weeks follow up (until EOV Visit [Visit 10]).
