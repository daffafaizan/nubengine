      non-mucinous, mucinous non- malignant and malignant pancreatic cysts in vivo and has
      increased sensitivity compared to endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)
      tissue sampling. In this pilot study the investigators will primarily evaluate technical
      feasibility and interobserver agreement.

        1. In patients undergoing EUS for suspected pancreatic cysts, the investigators will
           evaluate the key nCLE image features of non mucinous, mucinous, and malignant pancreatic
           cystic neoplasms (PCN).

        2. The investigators will estimate the initial image quality, feasibility, and
           interobserver agreement of nCLE

        3. The investigators will establish the preliminary accuracy of nCLE to be used for
           planning a larger comparative trial
