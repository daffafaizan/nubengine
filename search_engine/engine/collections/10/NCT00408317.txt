    
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, two-period cross-over,
      placebo-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Ultrase® MT20 to
      placebo in participants with CF and pancreatic insufficiency. The study consists of a
      screening period (up to 11 days) and two treatment periods (6-7 days). During screening
      period participants will be treated with open-label Ultrase® MT18 or MT20. Each treatment
      period will be preceded by a stabilization period (4 days) and the two treatment periods are
      separated by a break period (3-6 days). A safety follow-up visit will be performed 7-10 days
      after discharge from the last treatment period.
