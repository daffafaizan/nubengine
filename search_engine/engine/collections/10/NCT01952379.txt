      etiology is not completely elucidated; however, there is evidence of a melanogenic paracrine
      cytokine network between the melanocyte and other skin cells, including keratinocytes,
      fibroblasts, vascular and inflammatory cells, which regulate melanocyte function.

      Previous reports in lesional skin have described increased mast cell infiltration in
      elastotic areas, presence of a moderate lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, increased vascularity,
      and up-regulation of proangiogenic factors. This histological evidence of skin inflammation
      is also supported clinically by colorimetry and thermography, and by the improvement of
      pigmentation with topical anti-inflammatories.

      Photoinduced dermal inflammation might be related to epidermal hyperpigmentation through the
      production of melanogenic cytokines, and growth factors, and through the secretion of COX-2
      induced prostaglandins by keratinocytes, a mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of
      postinflammatory hyperpigmentation which has not been evaluated in melasma.

      The aim of this study is to describe the ongoing characteristics of inflammation in this
      condition by measuring the cellular infiltrate, the expression of acute and chronic immune
      inflammatory mediators, and non-immune inflammation mechanism such as COX-2, as well as to
      explore its relationship with severity of disease, elastosis, and melanin staining.

      Twenty healthy female patients with malar melasma without specific solar exposure or
      photoprotection measures within the previous 3 weeks were enrolled. Disease severity was
      estimated using the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI). Histological, histochemical,
      immunohistochemistry, and quantitative real-time PCR were used to evaluate the presence of
      these markers in melasma lesions and compare them to nonlesional skin.
