    
      A total of 52 individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) (68% female, mean age = 35.67)
      were allocated to a CBT group or to a control group. The intervention group was given one
      session of therapy per week over a duration of 8 weeks, while the control group did not
      receive any intervention and was placed on a waiting list. Self-reported social anxiety,
      perfectionism, and rumination were measured before the CBT intervention, after the
      intervention, and two months after the intervention for both groups.
