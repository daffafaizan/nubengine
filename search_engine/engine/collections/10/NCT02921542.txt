    
      Purpose: To evaluate vessel lumen quality (gain) and patient outcomes based on treatment with
      a predetermined laser treatment protocol in patients presenting with varying lesion types or
      morphologies: homogenous (plaques with a uniform texture-smooth and regular), heterogeneous
      (plaques with non-uniform texture-smooth and irregular surface), calcific (consisting of
      calcium) and restenotic (reoccurring narrowing of the vessel following prior treatment)
      associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

      Participants: 60 patients with PAD undergoing a revascularization procedure (treatment of a
      narrowed blood vessel) involving above the knee (ATK) lesion(s) eligible for treatment with
      laser atherectomy (a option for treatment of blocked blood vessels.)

      Procedures (methods): Patients' qualifying lesions will be assessed with angiography (a test
      that uses a special dye and camera to take pictures of the blood flow in an artery) and
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and categorized (homogenous, heterogeneous, calcific or
      restenotic) and determined to be treatable with laser atherectomy per standard of care.
      Qualified patients will undergo standard of care treatment with the Spectranetics Turbo-Power
      laser catheter for three passes with increasing settings 'low' (40/60), 'medium' (50/40) and
      'high'(60/60), respectively. After each pass, assessments of lumen quality and residual
      stenosis (narrowing still present after treatment) will be determined by angiogram and IVUS.
      The operator may finish the procedure per standard of care/investigator discretion after the
      protocol defined laser passes are completed.
