    
      This is a clinical trial, a type of research study, involving treatment with an
      investigational (experimental) drug called PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib), a "kinase inhibitor".
      "Kinases" are proteins that are inside of cells and help them to live and grow. The specific
      kinase inhibited or blocked by this study drug is believed to help blood cancer cells grow
      and live. By inhibiting or "blocking" the activity of this kinase, it is possible that the
      study drug may be able to kill the cancer cells or stop them from growing. This study will
      involve treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma
      (SLL), or B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) that has not responded to or has relapsed
      after standard treatment. This trial is studying how effective PCI-32765 is at treating CLL,
      SLL, or B-PLL and all the effects, good and/or bad, treatment with this drug has on patients
      and their cancers.
