      I. To evaluate the safety/toxicity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel
      followed by maintenance therapy with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor
      erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) undergoing definitive treatment with surgery and/or radiation.

      II. To estimate the agreement in baseline to post-treatment changes of EGFR expression (i.e.,
      EGFR modulation) between buccal smears and bronchial tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the disease free survival of this therapeutic combination. II. To assess
      overall quality of life. III. To evaluate predictive biomarkers in early-stage NSCLC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour followed by cisplatin IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning within 90 days following definitive surgical
      resection, patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) daily for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.
