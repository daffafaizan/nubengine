      fractionated stereotactic boost radiotherapy on survival in patients with high grade glioma.
      II. Compare the quality of life of these patients after these therapies.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to WHO disease grade
      (III vs IV), center, and age (under 40 vs 40 and over). Patients are randomized to undergo
      stereotactic radiotherapy or no further treatment after conventional radiotherapy. Patients
      undergo conventional radiotherapy once or twice a day for up to 6 weeks. Patients randomized
      to receive additional treatment receive stereotactically guided conformal boost radiotherapy
      for 4 days, within 4 weeks after completion of conventional radiotherapy. Quality of life is
      assessed before radiotherapy, then at follow up visits. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 605 patients will be accrued for this study.
