        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin when
           given in combination with continuous-infusion fluorouracil and radiotherapy in patients
           with primary cancer of the thoracic esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Assess somatic p53 mutations in cancer of the esophagus and determine their relation to
           therapeutic response induced by this regimen.

        -  Assess, in a preliminary manner, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15, and 29 and fluorouracil IV
      continuously on days 8-42. Patients also undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for
      6 weeks beginning on day 8.

      Patients without evidence of distant disease or unresectable local regional invasion undergo
      esophageal resection between days 63-70 (within 3-4 weeks after completion of
      chemoradiotherapy). Patients then receive oxaliplatin as above on days 105, 119, and 133 and
      fluorouracil as above on days 105-147.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      3 years.
