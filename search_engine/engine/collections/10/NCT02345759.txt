      impact not only on morbidity, mortality, social activities and patients' quality of life, but
      also on health budget.

      Although protein-restricted diets are used for more than a century in patients with advanced
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), their efficacy and safety is still debatable. Enough evidence
      has being accumulated on their role in postponing dialysis initiation in compliant patients.
      Consequently, the long-term compliance to the diet is discussed. Psychological aspects of
      compliant patients are certainly involved. Identification of certain psychological predictors
      of dietary compliance could help to select the patients who are more likely to be compliant
      and therefore to benefit from such an intervention. Moreover, short-term or long-term
      psychological intervention addressing these factors could increase patient long-term
      compliance.

      Accordingly, we are aiming to evaluate psychological characteristics of Chronic Kidney
      Disease patients in relation with their compliance to protein-restricted regimens.
