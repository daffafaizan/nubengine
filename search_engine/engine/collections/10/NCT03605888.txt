    
      This study will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to test a newly developed
      obesity reduction program, Koa Family, among overweight or obese mothers. An exploratory,
      uncontrolled study will assess its acceptance among normal-weight mothers.

      Koa Family consists of a 6-month whole-person lifestyle program (WPLP) combined with text
      messaging and social media support and the opportunity to take part in a neighborhood tree
      planting campaign. This multi-pronged program is intended to reduce weight in the short-term
      while building self-empowerment and connections to community resources so that participants
      can sustain long-term weight loss.

      Koa Family will be implemented in select communities in Yolo and Sacramento counties,
      California. Overweight or obese study participants will be randomized to either an
      intervention or control group; all normal-weight participants will be assigned to the
      intervention. All participants will complete a survey and have their height and weight
      measured at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-up. Intervention participants will
      also take part in a focus group at the 3-month midpoint of the intervention.
