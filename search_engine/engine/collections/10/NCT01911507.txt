    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of INC280 (c-Met inhibitor INCB028060) plus
      erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with met proto-oncogene (MET) expressing
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicity profile of INC280 plus erlotinib. II. To determine the
      preliminary efficacy of INC280 plus erlotinib. III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic
      behavior of this combination.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect blood and tumor samples for exploratory analysis of the MET and epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive c-Met inhibitor INCB028060 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and erlotinib
      hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
