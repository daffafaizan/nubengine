      follicles. People with acne can have pustules (zits or pimples), papules, whiteheads or
      blackheads, nodules, and redness of the skin. Acne usually involves the face and shoulders,
      but can also involve the chest, arms, and legs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of an investigational gel containing active medication compared to
      the same gel without any active medication (placebo or vehicle) in subjects with mild to
      moderate facial acne.
