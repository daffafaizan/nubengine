      MR imaging and spectroscopy in normal subjects without cardiovascular disease or hypertension
      show that age-related cardiac dysfunction is characterized initially by diastolic dysfunction
      (40 - 60 years), and then at > 60 years altered systolic strains and impaired myocardial
      energetics. The investigators propose to study the mechanism of these findings in subjects
      with normal aging without any cardiovascular disease, hypothesizing that increased vascular
      stiffening contributes to impaired energetics and left ventricular function. For the first
      time, the investigators will test whether the functional and energetic effects of normal
      aging can be reversed by acutely reducing afterload using an ACE inhibitor. This will be
      tested at 2 ages (40-60 and > 60 years), so that the intervention tests the hypothesis soon
      after the abnormalities develop (40-60 years - diastolic dysfunction; > 60 years energetics
      and altered strains). This will potentially have important insights into how normal aging
      affects the heart, and how potential treatments could be used to attenuate this process.
