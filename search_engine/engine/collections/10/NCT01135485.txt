      first two groups (study groups) will consist of (1) subjects with HLHS and other related
      lesions who have undergone stage I palliation using an allograft patch during infancy and (2)
      subjects with "single ventricle" lesions who have undergone stage II palliation using
      allograft without antecedent stage I palliation. The third group (control group) will consist
      of subjects who have undergone corrective or palliative surgery for CHD during infancy in
      which an allograft patch was not used, and in which there have been no further exposures to
      allograft. We have chosen to study both (1) subjects who have undergone stage I and II
      palliation and (2)subjects who have undergone stage II palliation only in an attempt to
      distinguish between sensitization that may occur from allograft exposure during stage I
      palliation and that which may occur during stage II palliation.
