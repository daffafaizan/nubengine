      underlying mechanism is unclear. One explanatory hypothesis is that the concurrence of
      elevated circulating melatonin and high glucose concentrations (characterizing late-eating)
      leads to impaired glucose-tolerance. However, to date, no study has tested the influence of
      physiological melatonin concentrations on glucose tolerance. The discovery of melatonin
      receptor MTNR1B as a diabetes risk gene provides evidence for a role of physiological levels
      of melatonin in glucose control.

      The aim of the current study is to test the hypothesis that the concurrence of meal timing
      with elevated endogenous melatonin concentrations results in impaired glucose control and
      that this effect is stronger in homozygous MTNR1B risk carriers than in non-carriers. To do
      so we will test glucose tolerance using identical mixed meals under two dinner conditions: a)
      delayed dinner or Late Eating (LE): starting1 hour before usual bed time, b) advanced dinner
      or Early Eating (EE): starting 4 hours before habitual bed time, in a randomized, cross-over
      study design.

      These findings could support a clinical application for the screening of this single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the possibility of implementing tailored and cost-effective
      behavioral interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes in vulnerable populations.

      These goals will be achieved through a specific approach:

      â€¢ Interventional (randomized, cross-over controlled trials) (Aim 1): To study the potential
      interaction between meal timing (dinner) and genetic variants MTNR1B for glucose tolerance.
