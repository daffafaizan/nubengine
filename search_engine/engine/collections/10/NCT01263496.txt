      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2
      peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of alogliptin, this extension study was
      administered for 40 consecutive weeks (52 weeks from the start of treatment in the phase 2
      dose-ranging study) to participants who had completed the phase 2 dose-ranging study
      SYR-322/CCT-001 (NCT01263470).
