      caregivers as smallholder poultry producers by improving their access to livestock production
      resources and agricultural extension services, providing tools for improved decision making,
      and enhancing nutrition based knowledge. Smallholder production is important in eliminating
      food insecurities and building resilience to improve nutrition in children under 5. Based on
      the results of the Ethiopian egg project, through messaging and education, this study will
      foster favorable attitudes and consequent behavioral changes, including increased egg
      consumption.
