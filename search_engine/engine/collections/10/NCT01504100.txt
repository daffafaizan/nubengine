      Before treatment, an independent physiotherapist evaluates whether femoral internal rotation
      or not via physical therapy, and another studying nurse records the visual analog scale and
      measures Q angle. After evaluation, McConnell taping is applied to these patients. Two weeks
      later, outcomes are recorded including visual analog scale, satisfactory, and complication.
      The outcomes are compared between those with and without femoral internal rotation.
