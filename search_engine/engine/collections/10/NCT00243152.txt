      efficacy of antibiotics for bacterial infection. All current neuropathic pain drugs have
      approximately the same efficacy of less than 30% in controlled trials, and many of these
      drugs do not have known mechanisms of action. fMRI studies may provide insight into how brain
      circuitry is altered by chronic pain, and how these drugs act on altered circuitry. The
      trigeminal system in particular offers unique advantages for studying such alterations,
      including a large central representation and high degree of somatotopy. The administration of
      lamotrigine to neuropathic pain patients in conjunction with fMRI will allow us to compare
      subjective ratings of pain with objective measures of neural activity during increased
      conditions of allodynia/hyperalgesia.
