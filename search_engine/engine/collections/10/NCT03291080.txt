    
      All patients requiring at least two cycles of 13-CRA therapy will be eligible for recruitment
      into the trial.

      13-CRA will be prescribed to patients according to local treatment protocols at each clinical
      site. The dose administered will be 200mg/m2/day for both test and reference product.
      Patients with a body weight of â‰¤12kg will receive a dose of 160 mg/m2.

      The pharmacokinetics of 13-CRA liquid (test product) and 200mg/m2/day extracted from capsule
      (reference product) will be evaluated over two months. Prior to the initiation of 13-CRA
      treatment as part of the trial, patients will be randomised to receive either liquid or
      capsule formulation in "My-CRA month 1". The patients will then cross-over to the alternative
      formulation in "My-CRA month 2". The patients on the trial who require further treatment will
      revert to standard therapy i.e. 13-CRA extracted from capsules according to local practice.
