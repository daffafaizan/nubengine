      After several years of drug therapy, however, a large proportion of patients experience
      worsening of their parkinsonism and develop incapacitating motor fluctuations and
      dyskinesias. To deal with this, attention has been directed to surgical procedures, such as
      deep brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, stimulating the areas of the brain that control
      movement, the globus pallidus (Gpi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), has been proposed as a
      therapy for treating many of the disabling symptoms associated with PD and drug-induced side
      effects.

      The major aim of this 5-year study is to carry out a prospective, double blinded, randomized,
      clinical trial of DBS for medically intractable PD. The study will evaluate the effect of DBS
      in the Gpi and STN on motor, neuropsychological and psychiatric function, and quality of life
      in patients with PD. The study also will address two key issues: 1) whether there are
      differences between unilateral Gpi-DBS and STN-DBS and 2) which patients are the best
      candidates for bilateral DBS.
