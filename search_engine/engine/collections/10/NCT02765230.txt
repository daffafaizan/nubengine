      decades; these advances have contributed to a decrease in the incidence of postoperative
      complications and improvement in visual outcomes.Early cataract removal and replacement with
      an intraocular lens (IOL) represent the most appropriate treatments to avoid irreversible
      amblyopia.Although screening and timely surgical intervention play a key role in improved
      best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) among pediatric patients with cataracts, determining the
      prognosis for an individual remains difficult, particularly for unilateral cataract.

      Few studies have focused on the interocular differences in ocular anatomic parameters other
      than axial length in unilateral pediatric cataract after surgery, the significance of which
      for the possible interocular visual functional difference remains unclear. Therefore, the
      investigators conducted this cross-sectional study to compare bilateral anterior segment
      parameters, macular thickness, and BCVA at 3 months after uncomplicated unilateral pediatric
      cataract extraction with primary IOL implantation to explore any possible interocular
      differences and their possible relationships.
