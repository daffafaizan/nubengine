      This is a phase I/II dose-escalation study of CD20-specific CAR T cell therapy.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis and may receive treatment after if needed for disease control.
      Patients then receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV). Patients may also receive
      fludarabine IV. After 36-96 hours, patients receive CD20-specific CAR T cell infusion IV over
      20-30 minutes.

      Patients will be actively participating in the study for approximately 15 months. The total
      time includes the time for the T cells to be made, the T cell infusion, and for approximately
      12 months after the T cell infusion is given. After completion of study treatment, patients
      are followed up for a minimum of 15 years.
