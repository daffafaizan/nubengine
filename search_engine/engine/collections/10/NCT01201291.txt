      inspired oxygen of 0.7 (high oxygen group) or a fraction of inspired oxygen 0.4 (control
      group). The intervention continues until withdrawal of mechanical ventilation, ICU discharge
      or until 14 days from ICU randomisation.

      Primary outcome is worse than expected outcome in the corresponding treatment arms based on
      outcome meas-ured by the probability of bad outcome using the CRASHÂ® risk calculator
      (prognostic model for predicting outcome after traumatic brain injury).

      Secondary outcome is occurence of lung injury during mechanical ventilation.
