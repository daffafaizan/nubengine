    
      Aims of first: The team will evaluate the associations among the mR-29a, miR-29b, miR-29c
      expression in subacromial bursa and subacromial fluid, incidence of shoulder stiffness,
      Constant scores, and VAS.

      Aims of second: The team will isolate primary myofibroblast from subacromial bursa tissue as
      in vitro models and investigate the molecular events in the IL-1Î² modulation of miR-29a
      expression and the molecular mechanism underlying miR-29a inhibition of fibrotic matrix
      accumulation and apoptotic reactions in myofibroblast cultures.
