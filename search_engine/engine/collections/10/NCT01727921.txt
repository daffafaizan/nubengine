    
      Patient and methods:

      Patients who have pancreatic or peripancreatic mass in imaging studies which need pathologic
      confirm. These patients were randomly assigned to 22 gauge or 25 gauge group.

      Procedure:

      They underwent EUS-guided FNA, 3 times with 10 times of to-and pro movement each.

      The number of patients required:

      We used confidence intervals (CIs) with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10% for the
      non-inferiority analysis. We concluded non-inferiority of PC25 to PC22 if the lower limit of
      the 95% CI for the difference (PC25-PC22) was not lower than -10%. It was assumed that the
      diagnostic accuracy of one pass was 75% and that of three cumulative passes was estimated to
      be 98.4% in PC22. Based on these assumptions, the calculated sample size was 216 samples with
      power of 80% and significance level of 5%.
