      are not well understood. This is a multicenter study to measure serum levels of inflammatory
      cytokines and trophic factors associated with perinatal brain injury and repair in term
      gestation newborns with neonatal encephalopathy (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy). This study
      proceeds along with the study "Autologous cord blood cell therapy for neonatal encephalopathy
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02256618)". Blood samples are obtained before the first
      cell infusion, and subsequently 2h, 24h, 48h, and 7 days after the first cell infusion. Blood
      samples are obtained in the same manner from newborns with neonatal encephalopathy who are
      not receiving the cell therapy.
