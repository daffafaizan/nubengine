    
      This healthy volunteer motivation study is a sub-study of Phase I drug development studies
      conducted by Pfizer International. The substudy is designed to evaluate the primary and
      secondary motivations of healthy participants in research studies, as well as the process by
      which participants decide to participate, including their consideration of any risks,
      benefits, compensation and other factors, and the relationship of these factors to cultural
      and sociodemographic variables. Data will be collected via self-administered surveys at 2
      possible time points, 1) after going through the consent process at the beginning of
      participation in the primary study, and 2) towards the end of the study participation.
