      of each treatment group will be assessed by evaluating study drug exposure, adverse events,
      serious adverse events, all deaths, changes in laboratory determinations, and vital sign
      parameters. The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) and Objective Response Rate (ORR) as well as
      Progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      1.1 will be assessed. Study visits will be conducted according to the protocol schedule and
      randomization group. Study visits will include physical examination, laboratory blood sample
      collection, and assessment of vital signs, medical history and urinalysis. 12-lead
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at protocol specified visits.
