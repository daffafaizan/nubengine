      in Belgium for this prospective randomised comparative pilot studyon bladder lavage.

      The potential benefit for the patient is a reduction in number of clinical urinary tract
      infections and a reduction of antibiotic use.

      According to the type of bacteria that is cultured from the urine, patients will be allocated
      to one of 4 subgroups:

        -  30 patients will recieve bladder lavage with a Isobetadine Dermicum Solution

        -  20 patients will revieve bladder lavage with acetic acid solutions

        -  10 patients will recieve bladder lavage with saline

        -  10 patients will receive bladder lavage with Urotainer Suby G

      The effect will be measured by two repeat urine cultures after the bladder lavage( 2days and
      5 days).

      From a safety perspective and to assess the irritation caused by the lavage, white blood cell
      counts in the urine will be done.

      Adverse events will be monitored according to GCP regulations.
