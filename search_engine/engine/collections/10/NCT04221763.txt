    
      This is a single centre acute electrical/haemodynamic and observational study of a subgroup
      of patients with heart failure. A total of 60 will be recruited. The acute study involves
      within patient comparison of biventricular and conduction system pacing using detailed
      electrical mapping and high precision haemodynamic measurement protocol.

      Participants will have permanent conduction system pacing if;

        -  Baseline left bundle branch block and QRS > 140ms or QRS >150ms and any QRS morphology
           AND

        -  Conduction system pacing is successful at reducing QRS duration by 20ms or more with
           satisfactory pacing parameters.

      Participants who receive permanent conduction system pacing will have follow up at 6 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months and 12 months. Non-invasive markers including mechanical activation pattern
      (echocardiography and cardiac MRI) and electrical activation pattern (ultra-high frequency
      electrocardiography) will be used to identify the characteristics of patients who benefit
      from conduction system pacing.
