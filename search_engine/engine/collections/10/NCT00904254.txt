      of plaque burden are used. This method has advantages for investigation of carotid arteries
      since this region is easy accessible for this investigation. However, it does not allow
      evaluation of the vessels which are remote from the body surface, as, for instance, coronary
      arteries. A method for non-invasive reliable evaluation of such arteries is needed. Also the
      distinction between vulnerable and stable plaque has a great clinical relevance. A
      quantifiable method for the determination of the effects of new therapeutic approaches would
      be highly appreciated.

      It is expected, that the new antibody fragment with its radioactive linkage will allow
      displaying an image of the activity distribution of the disease. Due to the fact that only
      patients with atherosclerotic changes in carotid arteries allow comparing the activity and
      the clinical signs of disease, this proof of concept study (phase II study) will be performed
      in patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
