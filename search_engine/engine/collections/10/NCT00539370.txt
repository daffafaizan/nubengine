      and data collected under other branch protocols.

      Study population: Participants that were followed in terminated branch protocols under which
      data or samples were collected.

      Design: Samples and data will be brought under this protocol, analyzed and stored for uses
      specified in the original protocols and as additionally approved by the IRB.

      Outcome: The outcome of this protocol will be the storage, tracking, and utilization of
      samples and data obtained under terminated protocols.

      Purpose: The purpose of this protocol is to enable prospective IRB review of research using
      human samples and data collected under other branch protocols.

      Participants: Participants who previously participated in NIH protocols whose wishes
      regarding use of their samples or data for research other than that specified in the initial
      protocol is not known may be enrolled in this protocol. At this time, there are no additional
