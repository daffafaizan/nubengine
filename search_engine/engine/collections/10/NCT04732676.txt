      University of Bordeaux, Sanpsy Lab, CNRS USR3413 - on individual predictors of substance use.
      This project will test the efficacy of a smartphone application to help subjects concerned
      about reducing or stopping their substance use / behavioral addiction. This new therapeutic
      tool, designed by University of Bordeaux, Sanpsy Lab, CNRS USR3413 - to manage craving and
      individual predictors of use, will offer the possibility of an easy to-use and personalized
      intervention accessible to the greatest number of subjects. Based on our previous results
      that supports that, for all types of addiction, craving and individual cues are a significant
      drive for use in people with addiction, the application tested in this study was designed to
      be used among people presenting various types of addiction (substance and behavioral
      addictions). The application will also evaluate all concurrent substance uses and addictive
      behaviors to identify and prevent risk of addiction transfers.
