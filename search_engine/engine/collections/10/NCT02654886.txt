    
      Eligibility: Subjects that are age 16 years or older, have been diagnosed with Pompe disease
      by genetic testing, and are showing symptoms such as muscle weakness

      Time Commitment:

      The study will last for 8 months. This study consists of a baseline visit of and return
      visits at week 9, week 16, week 24, and week 32. At the week 9 visit the subject will be
      given an individualized exercise plan which will be carried out over the next 24 weeks. The
      subject will be asked to return for three more visits at week16, week 24 and week 32. The 24
      week training period will involve 3 workouts a week approximately 15-30 minutes each. It will
      also involve a breathing exercise that the subject can do at home twice daily for 10-15
      minutes per session. The study visits will include the exercise plan, physical exam, blood
      draw and questionnaires.

      Anticipated Benefits:

      The possible benefits include a delay in progression of muscle weakness. The knowledge gained
      from this study will help researchers understand the effect of exercise on the disease. This
      may eventually lead to new forms of prevention of symptom onset in the future.
