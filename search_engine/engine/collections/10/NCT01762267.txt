      diet on the metabolic side effects of corticosteroids medications use.

      Design: A randomized clinical trial was undertaken in 60 patients on corticosteroid therapy
      for 10 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to a DASH or control diet. Fasting blood sample
      were measured to determine blood glucose and lipid profile. Blood pressure and anthropometric
      measurements were measured based on the standard guidelines.
