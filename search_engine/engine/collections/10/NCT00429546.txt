      management. Studies have shown that it can be very difficult for infected mothers to decide
      whether and/or when to disclose their HIV serostatus to their uninfected children.
      HIV-infected parents struggle with the fear that their children will be forced to grow up too
      quickly, become worried or depressed, or be angry with their parents once they learn that
      their parents have HIV. Family-based intervention programs have been successful in helping
      facilitate the disclosure process. This study will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of
      an intervention designed to assist HIV-infected mothers of young children in determining
      whether and how to appropriately disclose their HIV serostatus to their children.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or a standard
      of care condition. The intervention will consist of three 75-minute sessions that will focus
      on exploring mothers' concerns, determining children's readiness to receive the news,
      planning for disclosure, and practicing disclosure. Participants will also receive one
      follow-up phone call from the therapist about 3 weeks after the last session. Sessions will
      be scheduled at times that are convenient for the participants and therapists. Follow-up
      visits will include both mothers and their children, and will be held at Months 3, 6, and 9
      following the end of the intervention. Assessments will include readiness to disclose HIV
      serostatus, mental health indicators, and family functioning.
