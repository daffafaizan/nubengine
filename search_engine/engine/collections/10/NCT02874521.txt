      training i.e. cycling, performed between dialysis sessions or during dialysis
      (intra-dialytic) can be effective in improving functional capacity and quality of life.
      However, many patients are unable to engage in intra-dialytic cycling due to limiting
      comorbidities. Other exercise modalities should be considered. Low-frequency electrical
      muscle stimulation of the quadriceps is well tolerated and may improve functional capacity in
      clinical populations.

      The trial is a longitudinal, randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomly
      allocated to 10 weeks of 1) intra-dialytic low-frequency electrical muscle stimulation, 2)
      intra-dialytic cycling, or 3) usual care haemodialysis without exercise training. Outcomes
      will be assessed at baseline and 10 weeks by assessors blinded to group allocation.
