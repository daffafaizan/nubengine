      high blood pressure than the general public. The purpose of this study is to determine how
      substances produced in the fat (inflammatory markers) relate to the risk of heart disease in
      people with the metabolic syndrome and psoriasis. People with metabolic syndrome have insulin
      resistance, increased waist size, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Insulin
      resistance means that the body does not respond well to the insulin in your blood. Therefore,
      both blood levels of insulin and glucose (sugar) are high.

      This causes inflammation (irritation) in the body. Inflammation can cause an unhealthy
      response in your body and blood vessels, and can lead to blockages in the heart and other
      vessels.

      TNF-alpha is a substance made by fat and inflammatory cells that helps cause inflammatory
      reactions. TNF-alpha is thought to be important in causing psoriasis. The drug Etanercept
      blocks TNF-alpha's actions, and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for the treatment of psoriasis. We think that Etanercept may also reduce the inflammation
      associated with metabolic syndrome and decrease the risk of heart disease. All subjects in
      this study will receive etanercept.
