    
      This is a phase I, single center, open label, non-randomized, dose-escalation phase I study
      performed in the ambulatory setting in patients receiving first line chemotherapy for
      unresectable pancreas cancer with gemcitabine weekly and the investigational agent IMP321.
      IMP321 will be given at D2 and D16 of a 4-week cycle, for a period of 6 months. The
      hypothesis of this study is that IMP321 is safe for human administration. Additionally we
      hypothesize that IMP321 elicits an immunomodulatory effect that is therapeutic in the
      treatment of pancreas cancer.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated IMP321 subcutaneous injections in
           patients being treated with gemcitabine for advanced pancreas cancer.

        -  To determine any dose limiting toxicities of IMP321 in patients being treated with
           gemcitabine for advanced pancreas cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe the pharmacokinetics of the last IMP321 subcutaneous injection compared to
           the first one, in a limited number of patients.

        -  To determine the pharmacodynamics of IMP321 therapy by:

        -  Quantify peripheral blood Treg (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells) in pancreatic cancer patients
           before and during treatment with IMP321 by flow cytometry.

        -  Evaluate the B- and T-cell responses to the pancreatic cancer-expressed antigen,
           mesothelin, by testing for antibodies and T-cell response by ELISpot.

        -  To evaluate the clinical response and time to disease progression with computed
           tomography examinations at two month intervals (current standard of care in
           gemcitabine-treated patients).
