      injury to stop the progression from manageable hypoxia to frank respiratory failure and ARDS
      in patients with COVID-19 infection. Preventing progression from early acute hypoxia and
      cytokine release syndrome to frank hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS could have a huge
      impact on the foreseeable overflow of the ICU units. In ventilated patients, preventing the
      onset of ARDS, or shortening ICU stay could also be crucial in this regard.

      The clinical status after 15 days treatment is evaluated to measure the effectiveness of
      tocilizumab, tocilizumab and anakinra, siltuximab, siltuximab and anakinra and anakinra on
      restoring lung homeostasis,using single IV injection (siltuximab or tocilizumab) combined or
      not with daily subcutaneous injections of anakinra until 28 days or hospital discharge,
      whichever is first. During the treatment period, daily clinical assesments of severity, daily
      laboratory check-up, measurements of oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) in relation to FiO2,
      regular arterial blood gas measurements, regular chest X-rays, chest CT scans on indication
      will be performed.
