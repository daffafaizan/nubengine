      burning sensation along the thoracotomy scar at 3 months after surgery. The pain is very
      significant, given that 3 to 5% of postthoractomy patients report it as being severe, and
      approximately 50% of patients report limitations in their activities of daily living. Little
      is known about the origin of this pain, but it seems that the intensity of acute
      postoperative pain is the best predictor of it. Lidocaine infusion could be a possible
      approach to reducing the prevalence of PPS. Recently, a meta-analysis concluded a modest but
      statistically significant reduction of pain severity in the first four postoperative hours
      measured by the visual analogue scale (mean difference, -0.84; 95% CI, -1.10 to -0.59).
      However, a more recent meta-analysis found that only limited clinical data and biological
      plausibility support lidocaine infusions for the prevention of postoperative persistent pain
      (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.48). This study was designed to investigate whether
      lidocaine infusion after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) would lower PPS at
      postoperative 3 and 6 month.
