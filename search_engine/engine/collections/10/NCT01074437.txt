      these tumors can lead to complications of vision and airway compromise, bleeding and
      disfigurement. Medical treatment of these lesions has traditionally been focused on stopping
      new blood vessel growth with corticosteroids. Recent reports and our own experience have
      demonstrated that significant reduction in IH size and vascularity can also occur through the
      use of propranolol. Our initial experience with propranolol has demonstrated significant
      efficacy with fewer side effects than corticosteroids. Despite this experience, the standard
      of care for initial IH medical therapy remains corticosteroids.

      This Trial is a direct comparison of traditional IH therapy with corticosteroids to newer
      therapy with propranolol and corticosteroids.
