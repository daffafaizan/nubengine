    
      This is a prospective, randomized multi center study comparing two catheter ablation
      strategies (pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) versus PVI plus low voltage areas (LVA) guided for
      ablation in patients with symptomatic persistent and long standing persistent atrial
      fibrillation (AF) who were unresponsive to at least one Class I or III antiarrhythmic agents,
      or it is the patientÂ´s decision to receive ablation as first line therapy. Patients with
      documented persistent AF who are eligible for participation in the study, and gave a written
      informed consent, will be randomized between two groups prior to the procedure: PVI and
      PVI+LVAs guided radiofrequency catheter ablation.

      All the patients will receive a high density voltage map in sinus rhythm (SR). All the
      patients will receive circumferential PVI. If LVAs are present, Patients randomized to the
      PVI+LVA group will get additional linear ablation lines to exclude these areas from normal
      voltage atrial myocardium. The patients will be followed for 12 months.
