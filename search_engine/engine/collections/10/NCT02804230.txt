    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial effectiveness
      of Exablate thermal ablation of a focal epileptic target area in the brain of patients
      suffering from medication-refractory epilepsy, using the Exablate transcranial system to
      produce multiple sonications targeted in the lesion of interest. The Investigators will
      establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.

      The hypotheses tested are that:

        1. MRgFUS treatment of focal epilepsy is feasible and safe, with a low risk of adverse
           effects as evaluated during the follow-up period.

        2. Exablate treatment of foci in patients with focal epilepsy reduces the seizure
           frequency.
