      Standard therapy is controversial and largely ineffective; care is mostly supportive although
      nebulized medications continue to be commonly used. These medications are typically mixed
      with normal saline to produce a sufficient volume for efficient nebulization.

      Inhaled hypertonic saline has been used to aid airway clearance in children with cystic
      fibrosis. It has also been used, in low dose, in two small studies in children with
      bronchiolitis. The current study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multi-center trial comparing frequent dosing with 3% hypertonic saline compared to normal
      saline in the treatment of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.
