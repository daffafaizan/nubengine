    
      PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS/OUTCOME MEASURES

      Primary end-point:

      The proportion of patients reaching CR defined as a reduction of proteinuria since baseline
      level to a value equal or lower than 0.5 g/24 h proteinuria plus stable renal function (eGFR
      ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73m2) or PR defined as a reduction of proteinuria since baseline level to a
      value less than 3.5 g/24 h and 50% lower than baseline proteinuria plus stable renal function
      (eGFR ≥ 45ml/min/1.73m2) at 24 months of study treatment.

      Secondary end-points

        -  The proportion of patients with Limited response (LR) defined as a reduction of
           proteinuria since baseline level > 50% but to a value > 3.5g/24 h. at 12, 18 and 24
           months of study treatment..

        -  The number of patients with an increase ≥ 50% of serum creatinine (SCr) from baseline at
           12, 18 and 24 months (end of the follow-up).

        -  The time of renal survival (status free of increase ≥ 50% of baseline SCr) in both arms
           overall after the study.

        -  The proportion of patients with preserved renal function (estimated GFR ≥ 60 ml/min) in
           both treatment arms after the treatment period.

        -  The proportion of patients with relapse (defines as the reappearance of proteinuria >
           3.5 gr/24h and at least 50% increase over the lowest baseline value in at least three
           consecutive visits in those patients who previously presented a PR or CR) and the time
           to relapse after the treatment period.

        -  Serum levels of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies (anti-PLA2R), before of
           treatment and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of study, in both treatment arms.

        -  The proportion of patient with drug-related adverse events and serious adverse events.

      STUDY POPULATION

      Patients with biopsy-proven idiopathic or primary membranous nephropathy with nephrotic
      proteinuria and normal or slight decrease of renal function will be enrolled.
