      hip-knee-ankle angle will be obtained from the standing whole-lower-extremity radiographs.
      According to the hip-knee-ankle angle, the knees will be labelled knee varus or knee
      nonvarus. The knee varus incidences of the two groups will be determined and compared. It is
      hypothesized that constitutional varus knee is a risk factor for patellofemoral pain.
