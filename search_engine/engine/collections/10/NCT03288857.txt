      pediatric emergency department (ED) at Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas
      (DCMC). An ED discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis will trigger patients to be randomized to
      receive a bulb aspirator or nasal oral aspirator for home secretion management use. Prior to
      dispensing the randomized aspirator, a pre-distribution questionnaire will be administered.
      Additionally, patients will receive a diary to complete for 3 days post ED discharge.
      Research personnel will call families on day 4 as a reminder to return the diary and again on
      day 14 to obtain a verbal post-study questionnaire. Research personnel will perform chart
      review on all patients looking for unscheduled patient return visits for bronchiolitis.
