      (ECP) therapy for maintaining remission of symptoms during withdrawal of corticosteroids from
      patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Potential subjects will be asymptomatic or
      have a low level of symptoms that respond to an increase in their steroid dose; furthermore
      potential subjects will be dependent on steroids to control their symptoms and have a history
      of failing other immunosuppressive drugs to control their symptoms.

      This is an unblinded, single-arm study of ECP in Crohn's disease. This trial will use ECP
      twice a week every two weeks over 24 weeks during which time the dose of corticosteroids will
      be tapered. If the corticosteroids are able to be withdrawn without an increase in symptoms,
      then subjects may be eligible for further ECP (twice a week every four weeks over 24 weeks)
      as a maintenance regimen.

      Outcome parameters include the rates of complete and partial steroid tapering while
      maintaining remission, the rates of adverse events, and secondary clinical outcomes such as
      duration of response, rate of and time to relapse, and changes in symptom index scores. In
      addition, the NIH will perform a substudy that includes serial colonoscopy to measure
      cytokine and cell population changes in mononuclear cells extracted from biopsies.

      The long-term goals of this study are to test the safety and efficacy of ECP as a
      steroid-sparing and remittive therapy in Crohn's disease, to determine the immune response it
      effects in the gut mucosa, and identify factors associated with responders versus
      non-responders to ECP.
