      They produce great disability and complications in our patients and they are recognized
      worldwide as a major public health problem.

      The treatment that presents the best results is surgical treatment, since it reduces the
      mortality of the patients and allows early loading . Thus, avoids secondary complications to
      the prostration state such as pneumonia, bedsores, pulmonary embolisms, among others.

      Currently, the treatment that has shown the best clinical and biomechanical results is
      osteosynthesis with a cephalomedullary nail, which despite having good results is not free
      from complications such as implant failure, loss of femoral offset.

      Changes are constantly made in the design and surgical techniques of these implants in order
      to decrease the rate of complications.

      This study will particularly assess whether there is any difference in the complication rate
      between dynamic versus static lag screw modes.

      Biomechanical studies that compare these two lag screw modes show that axial and lateral
      stiffness of the femur-nail construction is greater in static mode than in dynamic modes and
      the torsional stiffness is greater in dynamic mode than in static modes.

      There are no studies comparing the clinical results of these two variants.
