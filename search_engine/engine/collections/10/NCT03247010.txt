      prostate cancer and bone metastases. Therapy is administered intravenously every 4 weeks for
      up to 6 cycles. More than 20 % of patients treated at Rigshospitalet develop bone marrow
      suppression as a side effect to Radium therapy, which delays or excludes the patient from
      further oncological therapy. Especially thrombocytopenia is a frequent side-effect and can be
      long lasting.

      The aim of the study is to examine whether biomarkers of bone marrow recovery (immature
      platelets, platelet volume, reticulocytes, red cell distribution width) can predict
      development of hematological toxicity during Radium therapy. Furthermore, to investigate
      whether these biomarkers can predict recovery from toxicity in patients who develop bone
      marrow suppression during therapy.

      A secondary aim of the study is to evaluate whether dynamics in biomarkers of bone remodeling
      during Radium therapy is correlated to overall survival and time to symptomatic skeletal
      event. Optimally these biomarkers can aid in monitoring therapy.
