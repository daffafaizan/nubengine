      atiprimod alone and the MTD of atiprimod when given in combination with ursodiol. The
      atiprimod dose will be escalated in sequential cohorts. Ten dose levels of atiprimod are
      planned for the atiprimod alone dose escalation: 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420,
      and 480 mg/day to be given orally. Six dose levels of atiprimod are planned for the atiprimod
      in combination with ursodiol dose escalation: 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, and 480 mg/day to be
      given orally. The dose of ursodiol will remain constant for all cohorts (300 mg ursodiol
      orally three times a day everyday). Up to 105 patients will participate depending on the
      level at which toxicity is observed. Patients will be assigned to dose level in the order of
      study entry.
