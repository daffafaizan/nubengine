      can achieve sustained virological response (SVR) in only 60-90% of patients. Insulin
      resistance is an important factor of non-response to combination therapy. Metformin is a
      insulin sensitizer and can effectively reduce insulin resistance. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the treatment response of metformin, Peg-IFN and ribavirin combination therapy
      for chronic HCV.
