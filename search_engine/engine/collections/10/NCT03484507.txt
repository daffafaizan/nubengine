      therapy is a biguanide agent such as chlorhexidine, though recent studies have found povidone
      iodine to be effective for killing acanthamoeba organisms in vitro. Thus, we randomize
      participants to topical chlorhexidine 0.04% monotherapy (i.e., routine care) versus topical
      chlorhexidine 0.04% plus topical poviodine iodine 2.5%. The primary outcome is clearance of
      acanthamoeba from the ocular surface at 4 weeks.

      The role of topical corticosteroids in acanthamoeba keratitis is controversial. Topical
      corticosteroids can promote growth of acanthamoeba, but may also reduce inflammation and
      vision-threatening complications of infection. Here, we randomize participants who have
      completed a course of anti-amoebic therapy to one of three groups: early prednisolone sodium
      phosphate 1% (started at 4 weeks), late prednisolone sodium phosphate 1% (started at 6 weeks)
      or placebo (started at 4 weeks). The primary outcome will be visual acuity at 6 months.
