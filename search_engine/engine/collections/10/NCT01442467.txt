      studies validating non invasive (echocardiographic) measurements of left ventricular filling
      and diastolic function. The investigators hypothesize that echocardiographic estimates of
      diastolic function, left atrial pressure (LAP) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure
      (LVEDP) are likely to be fallacious in patients with moderate to severe mitral annular
      calcification due to the structural alterations and technical difficulties involved.
