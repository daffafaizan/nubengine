      concentrations, investigators propose a proof-of-concept study to test the hypothesis that
      the norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitor, atomoxetine, which increases synaptic
      norepinephrine concentrations, will improve post-bariatric OI. Understanding the changes in
      SNS activity and its contribution to orthostatic tolerance after bariatric surgery is of
      utmost importance to unravel the mechanisms of a novel and unrecognized syndrome,
      post-bariatric OI. In 2014, nearly 200,000 individuals in the US underwent bariatric surgery,
      and the number of bariatric surgery procedures is expected to increase by 22% each year. It
      is projected, therefore, an increase in the incidence of post-bariatric OI.

      Participants with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) will
      be studied.

      OI is a chronic and disabling condition; treatment is challenging because current therapies
      have debatable efficacy.

      The proposed application will not only provide central knowledge on the pathophysiology of
      this new syndrome but also will fill an unmet therapeutic need by repurposing NET inhibitors
      for the treatment of OI.
