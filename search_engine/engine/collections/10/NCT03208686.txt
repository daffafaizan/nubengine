      participant will serve their own control. Participants will serve as their own controls for a
      period of three months prior to the start of the four-month intervention. The study will
      conclude with an assessment 7-months from baseline. Single-subject designs are most often
      used in applied research. The design allows the participant to serve as the control, rather
      than using another individual/group. The design is sensitive to individual differences
      whereas group designs are sensitive to averages of groups. Year 1 is dedicated to the
      development of the text messages and the content for the 10 group meeting sessions. Year 2
      focuses on the Time-1 control period assessment (pre-baseline at 3 months before the
      intervention), the Time-2 assessment (baseline), implementation of the 10-week intervention,
      a post-intervention assessment (Time-3), and 3-month follow up at Time-4, and analysis.
      Specifically, in Year 2, the primary outcome of A1c will be assessed at Time-1, 3 months
      later at the start of the intervention, at the end of the intervention, and at 7-months. The
      investigators will also include secondary assessments of glucose readings, waist
      circumference, and blood pressure.
