        -  Determine the feasibility of performing minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE), in terms
           of 30-day mortality, in patients with high-grade dysplasia of the esophagus or stage
           I-III esophageal cancer.

        -  Determine the complications associated with this procedure in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate at which conversion to open operation is required in patients
           undergoing this procedure.

        -  Determine the length of the operation, duration of intensive care unit stay, and length
           of hospital stay in patients undergoing this procedure.

        -  Determine feasibility and conversion rate of MIE after neoadjuvant therapy.

        -  Assess the effectiveness of lymph node dissection by MIE by recording the total number
           of lymph nodes dissected.

        -  Assess outcomes at follow-up to three years.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo minimally invasive esophagectomy comprising video-assisted thoracoscopy to
      mobilize the thoracic esophagus in combination with laparoscopy to complete the esophagectomy
      and a neck incision to mobilize the cervical esophagus. Mortality at 30 days is assessed.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients were accrued for this study.
