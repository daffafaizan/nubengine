      kyphoplasty, but its use has been associated with complications. This study tests three
      hypotheses: 1) whether strontium hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA) is equivalent to PMMA for restoring
      thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures, 2) if incidence of PMMA leakage is similar to that of
      Sr-HA leakage, and 3) whether Sr-HAis resorbed and substituted by new vertebral bone.

      Materials and Methods Two age- and sex-matched groups received short percutaneous pedicle
      screw fixation plus PEEK implant (Kiva, VCF Treatment System, Benvenue Medical, Santa Clara,
      CA, USA) filled with either Sr-HA (Group A) or PMMA (Group B) after A2- and A3/AO-type
      thoracolumbar vertebral body fractures. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score and imaging
      parameters, which included segmental kyphosis angle (SKA), vertebral body height ratios
      (VBHr), spinal canal encroachment (SCE), bone cement leakage, and Sr-HA resorption, were
      compared between the two groups.
