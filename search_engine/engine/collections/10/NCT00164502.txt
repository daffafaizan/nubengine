      increasing due to increases in the prevalence of diabetes. Pain, emotional distress, reduced
      functional abilities are common conditions following limb loss and reduce quality of life.
      Self-management interventions have been found to be effective in reducing the secondary
      conditions associated with arthritis and diabetes. Self management uses the principles of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy including education, self monitoring, problem solving, and skill
      acquisition.

      The goal of the project is to develop and test the efficacy of a community based self
      management intervention for reducing pain, depression, and improving self efficacy and
      function in persons with limb loss using a randomized controlled design.

      50 groups of 8-10 persons will be randomized to either a control group or a treatment group.
