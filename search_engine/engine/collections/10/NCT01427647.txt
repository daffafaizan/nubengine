      general anesthesia (CON group, n=22) or general anesthesia with thoracic epidural anesthesia
      (EPI group, n=21). Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery (LAP group, n=20) composed the
      third arm of the study. Measurement of perioperative changes in several hormones and
      cytokines were blinded to group assignment.

      Primary outcome: Compare simultaneously two types of surgical and anesthesia techniques for
      colorectal cancer surgery and measure to what extent the stress response is lessened.
