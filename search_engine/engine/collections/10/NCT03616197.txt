      observation of changes in facial keratinized tissue width and thickness .It has been reported
      that gingival or periodontal diseases may develop more frequently in patients with thin
      gingival biotypes and that thick-flat biotype in implant restorations is important in
      achieving a successful aesthetic treatment outcome.

      Free gingival graft (FGG) is a mucogingival surgical procedure that is successfully used in
      the presence of inadequate keratinized gingival width and gingival recession. It is thought
      that factors that may adversely affect the continuity of graft nutrition may be effective in
      graft shrinkage. These reasons can be listed as follows; graft thickness, traumatic surgical
      procedure, graft dehydration, and suturing procedure.

      There was no study investigating the effect of periodontal biotypes on graft contraction in
      the region adjacent to the FGG operation.
