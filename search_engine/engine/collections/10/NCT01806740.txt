      parameters at baseline and:

        -  Overall Survival (OS)

        -  Progression-Free Survival (PFS)

        -  Time to Progression (TTP)

      Three DCE-MRI examinations were done during the study:

        -  at the enrolment and initiation of the sorafenib treatment

        -  one week after initiation of the sorafenib treatment

        -  two weeks after initiation of the sorafenib treatment

      DCE-MRI perfusion parameters were assessed by a centralized radiologist at baseline
      (corresponding to the day of enrolment and initiation of Sorafenib treatment), week 1 and
      week 2.

      According to mRECIST criteria, HCC lesions were evaluated on computed tomography images by
      two on-site radiologists at the time of enrolment and 8 weeks later (2 months). OS, PFS and
      TTP were calculated from survival and tumor progression data recorded one year after
      initiation of the sorafenib treatment.
