      angiogenesis, and VEGFR2-169 induces specific Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against VEGFR2
      expressed targets. VEGFR2-169 shows strong anti-tumor effects restricted to HLA-A*2402 in
      vitro, and this peptide induces CTL from cancer patients. 60% in Japanese population have
      HLA-A*2402. VEGFR2-169 is suitable for clinical trial, and gemcitabine has been approved
      against pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine is reported to improve immune-response, therefore
      synergistic effect between vaccine therapy and chemotherapy will be expected. In this
      clinical trial, we evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response of different doses
      of VEGFR2-169 emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 in combination with gemcitabine and to
      determine the recommended phase II dose of peptide.
