      I. To assess the efficacy of sunitinib malate in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas as
      measured by 6-month progression-free survival.

      II. To determine the lower of the dose of sunitinib malate in patients receiving
      enzyme-inducing anti-convulsants that would achieve similar serum drug and metabolite
      concentrations as that in patients not receiving enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants or the
      maximum tolerated dose in the same population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the toxicity and safety of sunitinib malate in patients with the above noted
      tumors.

      II. To evaluate tumor responses in the stated patients. III. To evaluate progression-free and
      overall survival in the stated patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to use of
      enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIAC) (yes vs no).

      STRATUM 1 (non-EIAC): Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 4 consecutive
      weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest.

      STRATUM 2 (EIAC & OSU patients only): Patients receive oral sunitinib malate as in stratum 1.
      Patients receive escalating doses of oral sunitinib malate until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. Samples
      are analyzed for plasma concentrations of sunitinib malate via LC/MS/MS method.

      In both strata, treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
