      with vertebrogenic algic syndrome. A typical symptom is intermittent radiation of pain in the
      back and legs. The cause of this pain is irritation of the medial branch of the dorsal nerve
      root, which innervates a facet joint. Confirmation of the source of pain involves using a
      local anaesthetic to block the medial branches of several vertebral areas. If, through this
      test, the facet joints are determined to be the source of pain the patient's condition is
      indicated for radiofrequency ablation of the nerve branches.

      EuroPainClinicsÂ® Study IV (EPCS IV) is a prospective observational comparative study that
      will use pain scales to analyse changes in the neurological status of nerves of patients who
      undergo the minimally invasive procedure: radiofrequency nerve ablation and cryoablation of
      the lumber facet joints.

      The study aims to investigate documented clinical results of the neurological conditions of
      patients, to compare pain scales and the use of analgesics over a number of time periods:
      prior to the procedure, 6 weeks post-procedure, as well as 6 and 12 months post-procedure.
      The data will be subsequently statistically analysed.
