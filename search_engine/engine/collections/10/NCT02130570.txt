        1. To develop, implement, and refine a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary transitions
           intervention with contributions from hospital and Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH)
           personnel.

           Hypothesis: a collaborative transitions intervention can be designed and implemented
           within an ACO that reliably provides the components of an ideal transition in care.

        2. To evaluate the effects of this intervention on post-discharge adverse events,
           functional status, patient engagement, and emergency department and hospital utilization
           within 30 days of discharge.

           Hypothesis: compared with usual care, a collaborative transitions intervention will
           decrease post discharge adverse events, improve post-discharge functional status,
           increase patient engagement, and reduce emergency department and hospital utilization in
           the post-discharge period.

        3. To understand barriers to and facilitators of successful implementation of this
           intervention across practices.

      Hypothesis: several barriers to and facilitators of implementation can be identified and used
      to create lessons learned for other health systems to successfully implement this type of
      intervention.
