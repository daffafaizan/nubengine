    
      This observer-blind multi-center, randomized, parallel-group study in adults is designed to
      demonstrate non-inferiority between two formulations of xylometazoline/dexpanthenol nasal
      sprays in terms of efficacy and safety, when the products are used according to labeled
      instructions in a home based setting.

      Subjects suffering from nasal congestion caused by acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infection
      (URTI) and seeking medical counselling, will after screening and baseline assessment of nasal
      congestion, be randomized, and perform additional baseline subjective assessments of nasal
      rhinorrhea (scores on categorical scales). The Investigator will perform subjective baseline
      assessments of crust formation and dryness, redness and edema of nasal mucosa (anterior
      rhinoscopy using nasal speculum or otoscope).

      After the baseline assessments, the subjects will receive xylometazoline/dexpanthenol nasal
      spray or marketed reference nasal spray according to randomization.The first dose will be
      taken at the site under supervision. The study nurse will schedule visits for 24 hours, 72
      hours and 120 hours after this first dose and the subjects will be released for home based
      treatment. At the 72-hour visit, the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be
      assessed by the subject and the Investigator, safety will be followed up and subjects will
      also evaluate the treatment in a global assessment. At the 24-hour visit and at the final
      visit, after a maximum of 5 full days (120 hours) of treatment, all secondary endpoints will
      be assessed and safety will be followed up.
