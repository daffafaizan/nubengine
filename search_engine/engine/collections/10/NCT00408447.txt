      hemoglobin results in abnormal blood hemoglobin, causing red blood cells to sickle under
      stress with resulting symptoms including severe pains and strokes. Beta thalassemia is
      another genetic disorder in which there are abnormal beta hemoglobin chains, causing anemia.
      In both disorders, frequent red blood cell transfusions may be required to sustain life, but
      these often result in complications including multiple hospitalizations, iron overload, or
      bacterial or viral infections such as hepatitis. Standard drugs and therapies used in the
      treatment of sickle cell disease and/or beta thalassemia provide only supportive care, and
      may result in long-term side effects, and inadequate control of the disease process. Bone
      marrow transplant has been increasingly used for the long-term treatment and cure of sickle
      cell disease and beta thalassemia. Although, not without acute and potential long term side
      effects, this alternative offers long term control and potential cure of the disease. Most of
      the side effects seen with bone marrow transplant are directly related to the high intensity
      of chemotherapy used (ablative).
