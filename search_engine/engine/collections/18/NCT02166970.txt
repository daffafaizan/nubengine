      months, metallic stent performance is superior to plastic stenting for palliation with
      respect to outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

      However, the optimal stent type and the extent of drainage are issues that remain to be
      definitively decided. The optimal endoscopic management strategy is contentious.

      The investigators conduct the present study to prospectively in multi-centers compare
      unilateral (single) with bilateral (multiple) deployment in inoperable malignant biliary
      obstructions to clarify the clinical outcomes of these two deployment methods using metallic
      stents.

      First as an unilateral or bilateral stent will be deployed according to criteria.

      In bilateral group, stent-in-stent or side-by-side deployment will be included.
