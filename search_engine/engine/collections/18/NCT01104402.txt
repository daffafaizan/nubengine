      which require intensive treatment with antibiotics. The most common and useful objective
      measure of CF lung disease is spirometry. Chronic treatment of CF lung disease requires
      airway clearance, mucolytics and antibiotics. These treatments have been quite successful and
      there is evidence that early, aggressive treatment of lung disease results in better
      outcomes. Unfortunately, most exacerbations are not treated until they cause pronounced
      deterioration in symptoms, which prompts patients to seek medical attention. Self-monitoring
      of clinical status has improved outcomes in many other disorders such as asthma, diabetes
      mellitus, and lung transplantation. This is an important, randomized trial of home lung
      function and symptom monitoring in CF. Subjects will be assigned to one of two groups: 1)
      Home monitoring, in which spirometry and symptoms are recorded daily; or 2) Standard Care.
      The home monitoring data will be transmitted electronically twice weekly to the study center,
      where the results will be reviewed. If spirometry or symptoms have deteriorated substantially
      below baseline, treatment for a CF pulmonary exacerbation will be initiated. It is
      anticipated that use of home monitoring will translate into better clinical outcomes. We will
      test the hypothesis that if pulmonary exacerbations are identified and treated earlier than
      the current standard of care, the progression of lung disease will be slowed.
