      more data are needed regarding the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and
      death associated with the long-term use of extended release/long acting (ER/LA) opioid
      analgesics. Thus, the FDA is requiring that ER/LA opioid analgesic drug sponsors conduct
      post-marketing studies to assess these risks. The present study, PMR Study #2065-2, focuses
      on addiction, and addresses the FDA requirement to conduct a validation study of the measure
      of addiction that will be used in PMR Study #2065-1.

      The primary objective for Study 2b is to validate PRISM-5-Op measures of DSM-5 prescription
      opioid SUD/addiction in patients who have, or have had, a prescription for opioids for at
      least 30 days to treat chronic pain"
