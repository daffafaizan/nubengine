      fat [palm mid fraction (PMF), shea butter (SB) and high oleic sunflower oil (HOSF)] will be
      compared which will be in a form of experimental meals (muffin).

      33 volunteers receives 3 experimental meals (muffins) in a random order, 2 week apart, over a
      6-week period. They will be randomized, blinded and will undergo a 3x3 arms crossover. The
      first 15-ml ("0" min) fasting venous blood samples is obtained. Immediately thereafter, the
      subject consumes the test meal plus a glass of water within 15 minutes. The time sequence is
      started mid-way of consuming the test meal.

      At 30 min, 60 min, 90, 120 min (2 hr), 150 min and 180 min (3 hr), 210 min, and 240 min (4
      hr), 15-ml each of blood is collected (via a vascular catheter inserted earlier in the
      subjects hand/arm).
