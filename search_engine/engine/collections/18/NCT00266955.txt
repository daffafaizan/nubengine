    
      Children with no previous cardiac history who have been on Adderall for ADHD, have developed
      acute cardiac symptoms after the addition of Straterra for the treatment of ADHD.

      We wish to do a study of the medication interactions of Straterra and other ADHD medications
      focusing on the cardiac manifestations.

      We will collect the following information on each patient: Medical Record Number, Account
      number, Dates of Admission, Discharge, Treatment or Death, Information Regarding Cardiac
      Signs and Symptoms, Medication Information, Age, Weight, Diagnoses
