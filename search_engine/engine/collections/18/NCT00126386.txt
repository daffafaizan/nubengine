      non-ambulatory patients, could provide significant advantages for patients and for the
      region. The Calgary Health Region has a unique resource in the home parenteral therapy
      program (HPTP). With the assistance of HPTP, patients requiring bisphosphonate treatment for
      the management of TIH or MBP could be treated in the community (ie at home). However, the
      resources required and the costs associated with community-based (homes, hospices, long-term
      care facilities) treatment of TIH and MBP need to be identified and evaluated so as to guide
      future regional decision making.
