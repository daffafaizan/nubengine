    
      This is first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1), dose escalation study of JNJ-74856665 alone or in
      combination with Azacitidine in participants with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). AML is a heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled
      clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells (myeloid blasts) in the peripheral blood,
      bone marrow, and other tissues and is the second most common form of leukemia. MDS are a
      heterogeneous group of malignant hematopoietic stem cell disorders that are characterized by
      cytopenias, myeloid dysplasia, and a risk of transformation to AML. JNJ-74856665 is an orally
      bioavailable, potent, and selective dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor that binds
      to the enzyme's ubiquinone binding site promoting AML/MDS differentiation as well as cell
      cycle arrest and apoptosis. Azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor
      that been US Food and Drug Administration-approved for several MDS subtypes. The study is
      divided into 3 periods: a Screening Phase (within 28 days before the first dose of study
      drug), a Treatment Phase (first dose of study drug until the completion of the
      end-of-treatment visit) and a Post-treatment Follow-up Phase (up to the end of study
      participation or end of study). The end of study is defined as the last study assessment for
      the last participant in the study. Total duration of study is up to 3.7 years. Efficacy,
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points
      during this study. Participants safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the
      study.
