      is classified as "edema", and is considered to be caused by qi (chi) deficiency and blood
      stagnation. Acupuncture, as an ancient therapy in TCM, is thought to have the efficacy to
      stimulate the transformation of qi and drainage of dampness, and is widely used for various
      diseases including edema in China. Early clinical trials as well as our own clinical
      observation have demonstrated that acupuncture can ameliorate limb swelling and decrease
      lymphedema. However, no randomized placebo-controlled trial has been performed to evaluate
      this efficacy of acupuncture. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the safety and
      potential efficacy of acupuncture to treat chronic upper-limb lymphedema.
