    
      Metastatic colorectal cancer is a major health concern in the United States, and the second
      leading cause of death due to cancer. The purpose of this trial is to see if the combination
      of the study vaccine and drugs in patients with this disease can prevent the growth of cancer
      and prevent new tumors from growing. The study drugs are a combination of celecoxib
      (Celebrex®), Interferon-α2b (IFN), and rintatolimod (Ampligen®), or CKM.
