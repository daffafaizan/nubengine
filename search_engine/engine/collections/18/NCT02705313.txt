      randomized, comparator-controlled, parallel-group Phase III study comparing treatment with
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to 60 mg Octreotide LAR in patients with inoperable, progressive,
      somatostatin receptor positive, midgut carcinoid tumors (NETTER-1 trial, EudraCT number
      2011-005049-11, IND number 77219).

      Clinical studies, including NETTER-1 for which the primary analysis has been conducted,
      showed clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness to support the expanded access use
      without any unreasonable potential risks for the patients in the context of the disease to be
      treated.

      In July 2016, the first patient was treated under an Expanded Access Program (EAP) for
      inoperable, progressive, somatostatin receptor positive, midgut carcinoid tumors.

      Compassionate use programs in Europe include pulmonary NETs. In the US, there were many
      centers with patients with NETs who did not meet the inclusion criteria for the original EAP.
      In May 2017, Advanced Accelerator Applications inquired with the FDA if amending the
      inclusion criteria of the original protocol to include all NETs would be permissible.

      In June 2017, Advanced Accelerator Applications was able to submit a revision to the original
      Expanded Access Program's protocol for 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to include neuroendocrine
      tumors arising from sites other than midgut.

      The locations listed below that are participating in the EAP may have received IRB approval
      for either the original protocol or the new protocol or both. Please, inquire with the
      Facility Contact as to which protocol is active at their site.
