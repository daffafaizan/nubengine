    
      The intervention will consist of the following components:

        1. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment: A complete geriatric assessment using an
           interdisciplinary team (geriatrician, psychologist, social worker, dietitian, and
           nurse). The investigators will increase the number of geriatrician and interdisciplinary
           team visits to every other month interspersed with their primary care visits.

        2. Care Planning: The investigators will review and discuss each participant during the
           interdisciplinary team meeting. The team will jointly generate a care plan for the
           implementation of the interventions. The care plan will be shared with the respective
           primary care provider.

        3. Care Coordination: Participant/caregiver will be regularly contacted to confirm that the
           care plan is being implemented and to allow the participant/caregiver to discuss issues
           related to the management.

        4. Co-management: Primary care provider and project Geriatricians will share responsibility
           and decision making for participants aiming to prevent and treat geriatric
           complications.
