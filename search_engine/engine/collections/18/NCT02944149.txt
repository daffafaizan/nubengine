      inferior to the safety of ML provided by trained AMOs, as measured by rates of major adverse
      events (AEs) among women undergoing ML. The primary outcome is safety, defined by the overall
      rate of major AEs following ML. The investigators will address the primary objective by
      comparing the rate of major AEs observed following MLs conducted by COs vs. AMOs during the
      ML procedure and through 42 days follow-up. This study will be conducted among 1,970 women 18
      years of age and older presenting at study sites for ML surgery. The duration of a woman's
      participation in the study is expected to be 6 weeks, unless additional follow-up beyond 42
      days is clinically indicated due to complications or for other reasons. The study will be
      conducted in Arusha Region in northern Tanzania. The following health facilities will serve
      as study sites: Daraja Health Centre, Karatu Hospital, Kaloleni Health Centre, Levolosi Urban
      Health Centre, Longido Health Centre, Monduli Hospital, and Mto wa Mbu Health Centre.
