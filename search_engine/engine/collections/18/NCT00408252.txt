      monotherapy (37.5 mg given continuously without interruption). Tumor check-up will be
      performed every 6-8 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities according to the patient or the investigator (the median for
      treatment in renal cell study was 8 months).

      Since, head and neck tumors are easily accessible for iterative biopsy, this study will offer
      the opportunity to get tumor biopsies before and after SU011248. Our study will allow
      translational research with biopsies at crucial timing: at baseline before any treatment, ,
      during the treatment with SU011248 (cycle 1, between week 4 and 6), for patients with stable
      disease or partial response, a new biopsy will be performed at the time of disease
      progression to try to understand the mechanisms of tumor or resistance.
