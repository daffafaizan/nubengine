    
      Overall Study Design: This study entails collecting fasting venous blood (20 ml) from, and
      administering the 'omega-3 questionnaire' to, subjects being recruited from ongoing National
      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-sponsored trials within the Department of Psychiatry,
      University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Specifically, blood will be collected from 20
      healthy controls (i.e., no personal or family history of any Axis I mood disorder according
      to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV [DSM-IV]) and 20 asymptomatic
      high-risk (i.e., have a biological parent with BD-I) adolescents (aged 10-18 years old)
      recruited for study MH077138 (UC-IRB #: 07-04-10-03, BITREC Project 3; PI: DelBello), 20
      ultra-high risk (i.e., have a biological parent with BD-I and a Major Depressive Disorder
      (MDD) diagnosis) recruited for study MH083924 (UC-IRB #: 04-09-15-03, CO-Principal
      Investigators DelBello/McNamara), and 20 adolescents who are admitted for their first
      hospitalization and who have a diagnosis of BD-I recruited for study MH080973 (UC-IRB #:
      08-10-30-01, Principal Investigator: DelBello). Blood will then be processed, and
      de-identified tubes sent to the Kennedy Krieger Institute, Peroxisomal Diseases Section, to
      determine the following measures of peroxisomal function: (1) plasma very long chain fatty
      acids (C24:0 & C26:0) concentrations, (2) plasma bile acid C27 intermediate
      (dehydrocrepenynic acid {DHCA},tetrahydrocannabinolic acid {THCA})concentrations, (3) plasma
      pipecolic acid concentrations, and (4) Red Blood Cell (RBC) plasmalogen concentrations.
      Additionally, RBC fatty acid composition will be determined by gas chromatography, and
      platelet function and plasma inflammatory markers assayed using commercially available kits
      according to manufacturer's instructions.
