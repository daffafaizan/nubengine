      I. Determine the antitumor activity of romidepsin (depsipeptide), in terms of the proportion
      of patients achieving a complete or partial response or disease stabilization, in patients
      with progressive recurrent and/or metastatic non-medullary thyroid carcinoma that is
      refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI).

      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Document changes in RAI uptake by comparing pre- and post-treatment RAI scans in patients
      treated with this drug.

      II. Evaluate changes in the expression of the Na+/I- symporter (NIS) in tumors, as measured
      by immunohistochemistry on pre- and post-treatment biopsy specimens; and real time reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for NIS mRNA on pre- and post-treatment
      changes biopsy specimens.

      III. Determine post-treatment changes in serum thyroglobulin in patients treated with this
      drug.

      IV. Correlate changes in post-treatment positron-emission tomography scans with whole-body
      RAI scans in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive romidepsin IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
