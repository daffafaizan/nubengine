      postoperative decreases in cardiac output. These hemodynamic changes can result in varying
      levels of organ dysfunction, ranging from the subclinical to the more overt. Although this
      low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) and accompanying multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is
      in large part transient, the rapidity and completeness of resolution can vary greatly.

      During postoperative care in the intensive care unit, knowledge of this phenomenon must be
      balanced against the desire to initiate enteral nutrition. Many studies have demonstrated
      that timely initiation of enteral feeds in the intensive care can reduce mortality, morbidity
      and costs. Practically speaking, the decision to initiate feeds is made based on the
      patient's postoperative hemodynamic status, a normal lactate, absence of vasopressor agents
      and presence of bowel sounds. Trophic enteral feeding can usually commence 24h
      postoperatively, even after complicated neonatal heart surgery,

      The vast majority of postoperative neonates suffer no apparent ill effects from this
      management strategy. However, recent data have demonstrated an exceedingly high incidence
      (3.3-6.8%) of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in CHD patients; a disease for which diminution
      in splanchnic blood flow and disruption of the mucosal barrier are felt to play an important
      role. These data suggest the combination of diminished cardiovascular reserve, cyanosis and
      increased myocardial oxygen demands may promote the development of NEC.

      Preliminary data from Sickkids (Chanthong and Sivarajan, 2008) demonstrates an NEC incidence
      of 8% in CHD patients. Patients with NEC also accounted for 25% of all cardiac arrests in
      Cardiac CCU.
