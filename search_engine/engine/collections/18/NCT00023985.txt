        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of immunization with autologous tumor lysate-pulsed
           dendritic cell vaccine in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the immunologic response in patients treated with this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgery to remove all or most of the gross evidence of tumor. Two
      months after surgery (or 4 months if chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are required), patients
      undergo leukapheresis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated and cultured with
      interleukin-4 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) to generate dendritic cells (DC). DC are then pulsed
      with tumor lysate prepared from previously removed tumor. Patients receive autologous tumor
      lysate-pulsed DC vaccine subcutaneously twice, 4 weeks apart.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
