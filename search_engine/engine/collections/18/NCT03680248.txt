      by health system worldwide. The hepatic fat comes from the major sources - non-esterified
      fatty acids (NEFA) released from adipose tissue, dietary fat and de novo lipogenesis. Fat
      accumulation in the liver then occurs when triglycerides (TG) that are formed are not rapidly
      enough oxidized or secreted from the liver in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). It can be
      hypothesized that the capacity of the liver to eliminate TG can be overcome after high load
      of dietary fat. High-fat load should induce an immediate accumulation of hepatic fat that
      could be detected using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). The accumulation of
      liver fat can be also affected by coadministration of simple carbohydrates - glucose and
      fructose. The administration of these carbohydrates can have a pronounced impact on the
      availability of particular sources of hepatic fat.
