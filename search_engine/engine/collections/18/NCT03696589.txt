      Yahr stage I & II). The investigators will conduct a single arm cohort. (pre and post
      intervention) pilot feasibility study over 4 months with embedded process analyses of
      Preactive-HD, a physical activity coaching intervention program. Previous studies conducted
      by the investigators will be utilized to adapt the Engage-HD physical activity coaching
      program to people with early stage PD. The intervention will include a participant/coach
      interaction and disease-specific workbook grounded within the framework of self-determination
      theory. The coaching sessions will be conducted by an occupational therapist and will entail
      six coaching sessions (either face-to-face or remote video sessions via secure Webex
      connection via computer or smart phone, or phone call if internet/smart phone is not
      available to participant). The first session (approximately 45 min) will lay the groundwork
      for the program, and the remaining sessions will serve to provide directed support in
      relation to regular physical activity and exercise. Participants will develop physical
      activity goals and will be supported with individual physical activity progression.
      Participants will be given Fitbit devices as a motivational tool and to track activity
      progression.
