      recommended dose of OPB-111077 administered orally 4-days on and 3-days off (3 weeks/cycle)
      to subjects with advanced solid tumor in the dose escalation part so that biomarkers,
      efficacy, and others can be evaluated at the recommended dose in an expeditious manner in the
      expansion part. The dose escalation part employs a 3+3 escalation design as a standard dose
      escalation design for a small sample size.
