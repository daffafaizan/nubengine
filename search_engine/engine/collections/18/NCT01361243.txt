      children in the U.S. between the ages of 5 and 11 has nearly tripled in the last 3 decades.
      African American children are particularly at risk. Pediatric overweight is associated with
      numerous physical and psychological health problems. Moreover, overweight children are at
      significant risk for obesity in adulthood. Thus, a focus on pediatric overweight is an
      important step in the prevention of adult obesity.

      Despite the urgent need for pediatric overweight interventions, outcomes of some of the most
      rigorous treatments are, at best, mixed. Although research has found that including parents
      in interventions for pediatric overweight has positive effects on outcomes, parental
      involvement is usually limited. Moreover, relatively few studies have included sufficient
      numbers of lower-SES, African American participants, a group at increased risk for pediatric
      overweight and associated complications. This study will evaluate the efficacy of an
      intensive intervention targeting ethnically diverse parents of overweight, children ages 5-11
