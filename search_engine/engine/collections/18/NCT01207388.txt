    
      The detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy and/or consolidation
      therapy is an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome of adult ALL. No standard
      treatments are available for patients with MRD-positive B-precursor ALL. Blinatumomab (MT103)
      is a bispecific single-chain antibody construct designed to link B cells and T cells
      resulting in T-cell activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response against cluster of
      differentiation (CD)19 expressing cells. The purpose of this study is to confirm whether the
      bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab (MT103) is effective, safe and tolerable in the
      treatment of ALL patients with minimal residual disease.

      Participants will receive up to four 4-week cycles of intravenous blinatumomab treatment
      followed by an infusion-free period of 14 days. A safety follow-up will be performed 30 days
      after the end of the last infusion and efficacy follow-ups will occur until 24 months after
      treatment start. Participants will be followed for up to 5 years after the start of treatment
      for survival.
