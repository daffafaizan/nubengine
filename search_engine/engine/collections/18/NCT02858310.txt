    
      Background:

        -  Metastatic or refractory/recurrent human papillomavirus (HPV)-16+ cancers (cervical,
           vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers) are incurable and poorly
           palliated by standard therapies.

        -  HPV-16+ cancers constitutively express the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, which is absent from
           healthy human tissues.

        -  Administration of T cell receptor (TCR) gene engineered T cells can induce objective
           tumor responses in certain malignancies including HPV-16+ cancers.

        -  T cells genetically engineered with a TCR targeting HPV-16 E7 (E7 TCR) display specific
           reactivity against HLA-A2+, HPV-16+ target cells.

      Objectives:

      Phase I Primary Objective

      - To determine a safe dose for E7 TCR cells plus aldesleukin for the treatment of metastatic
      HPV-16+ cancers.

      Phase II Primary Objective

      -To determine safety and efficacy of E7 TCR cells plus aldesleukin for the treatment of
      metastatic HPV-16+ cancers.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with metastatic or refractory/recurrent
           HPV-16+ cancer.

        -  Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the patient declines standard
           treatment.

        -  Patients must be HLA-A*02:01-positive.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase I/II clinical trial that will test the safety and efficacy of E7 TCR
           cells.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by a single infusion of E7 TCR cells. Cell
           infusion will be followed by high-dose aldesleukin.

        -  Re-enrollment will be allowed for a small number of subjects.
