    
      OBJECTIVE: a) to explore the usefulness of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) as a means of
      mapping brain activity, to see whether the results are similar to those of fMRI and b) to see
      whether spontaneous brain blood flow changes coincide with changes in behavior.

      STUDY POPULATION: 50 healthy volunteers.

      DESIGN: The study will look for correlations between NIRS and fMRI signal changes in the same
      subjects. It will also detect relationships between spontaneous blood flow shifts and shifts
      and changes in cognitive performance. Finally, NIRS will be combined with a frontal lobe
      activation task to see if blood flow changes can be detected over the hairless skin of the
      forehead in a simple, standardized manner that might yield a diagnostic test for frontal
      injury.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: Graded changes in blood flow and oxygen, measured with NIRS and fMRI and
      variations in response time on a word task.
