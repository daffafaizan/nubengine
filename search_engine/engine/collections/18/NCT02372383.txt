      pharmacodynamics (PD) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) to improve treatment of
      nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease.

      Aim 1: Determine the PK profile of oral antimycobacterial drugs (azithromycin, rifampin and
      ethambutol) under both fasting conditions and when taken with food plus supplemental
      pancreatic enzymes in subjects with pancreatic insufficient, compared to healthy controls.

      Aim 2: Begin to investigate the influence of inflammation, host characteristics, and drug
      metabolism on the PK of the antimycobacterial drugs.

      Aim 3: Estimate an optimized dosing regimen for the antimycobacterial drugs against
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) using historic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data
      and models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or MAC infection.

      The central goal of this study is to improve treatment of NTM infection in CF. Upon
      completion of this study the investigators will determine if and why PK of the
      antimycobacterial drugs are altered in CF. More importantly, the investigators will develop
      CF-specific guidelines to achieve therapeutic goals with recommendations for drug dosing
      (including dose, dose frequency and timing in relation to meals and supplemental pancreatic
      enzymes) and timing of therapeutic monitoring to be used for future treatment of NTM lung
      disease in CF.
