      Our primary aims are to:

        1. describe the current nutrition therapy practices and

        2. profile the barriers and enablers to successful feeding in patients requiring VV
           (veno-venous) or VA (veno-arterial) ECMO whilst ECMO is insitu and for 7 days post ECMO
           removal.

      Hypothesis We hypothesise that patients who receive VA or VV ECMO receive inadequate amounts
      of predicted nutrition requirements (including energy and protein) and are subject to
      frequent episodes of nutritional delivery interruption.

      Study design A 12 month prospective, observational study in approximately 10 sites across
      Australia and New Zealand. Data will be collected from the commencement of ECMO until 7 days
      after its removal. All patients who are eligible for the study will have data collected by
      the primary dietitian or research coordinator at each site. Data collection has been confined
      to variables available in routine practice and easily available to the dietitian.
