      program for bladder management. In Specific Aim 2, the efficacy of home TTNS will be compared
      to baseline Incontinence- Quality of Life questionnaire. A bladder diary will also capture
      important information such as frequency and volume of catheterization, incontinence episodes,
      and other related observations.
