      Lung parenchymal tissue ischemia resulted by pulmonary atelectasis and decreased bronchial
      circulation during CPB is one of the reasons. There were few studies reported that RIPC and
      RIPoCcan benefit lung function of children or infant after CPB, but studies about adults are
      still lacking.

      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effect of RIPC and RIPoC on the lung function after
      CPB.

      Methods:

      Patients will randomly allocated either in study group or control group. Study group will
      receive RIPC and RIPoC maneuver before and after CPB. Control group will have same automated
      cuff around their arm but it will not activated. Care givers will be blinded whether the
      automated cuff is on or not.

      We will compare pulmonary parameters (PaO2/FiO2, dynamic and static compliances,
      Intrapulmonary shunts, etc.) between study group and control group, and check levels of
      plasma cytokines(IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha) till 24hr after the operation.
