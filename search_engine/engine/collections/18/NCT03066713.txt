      glycemic response might be expected from certain types of potato products and that phenolic
      antioxidants may play a critical role in predicting the physiological response from potato
      products. Further, if consumed early in the day, such as at breakfast, a reduced glycemic
      response may serve to mitigate appetite and food consumption later in the day. Investigators
      aim to better understand how characteristics of commercial potato products (i.e. frozen
      potato products) with different phenolic profiles and content, may alter postprandial
      glycemic response and subsequent appetitive behavior. Specifically, investigators will assess
      the glycemic response from a serving of potato products in the morning using continuous
      glucose monitoring. Further, appetite and subsequent food consumption later in the day will
      be assessed through appetite logs and continuous glucose monitoring.
