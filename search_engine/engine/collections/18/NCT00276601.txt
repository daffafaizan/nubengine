        -  Determine, preliminarily, the safety of incorporating arsenic trioxide (ATO) into
           cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride-based consolidation therapy followed by
           tretinoin maintenance therapy in patients receiving induction tretinoin and daunorubicin
           hydrochloride with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) induced into remission with
           tretinoin and daunorubicin hydrochloride.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this strategy in inducing and maintaining
           molecular remissions in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive oral tretinoin twice daily on days 1-60 and
           daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 4, 6, and 8. Patients are evaluated between days
           60-67 and proceed to consolidation therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-3,
           daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, and arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours once
           daily, 5 days a week, beginning on day 8 and continuing for 6 weeks. Patients with
           clinical and/or cytogenic, but not molecular, remission receive additional arsenic
           trioxide once daily, 5 days a week, for 30 doses (6 weeks). Patients achieving clinical
           and molecular remission after completion of 6 or 12 weeks of arsenic trioxide proceed to
           maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral tretinoin once daily on days 1-15. Treatment
           repeats every 3 months for 8 courses (2 years).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
