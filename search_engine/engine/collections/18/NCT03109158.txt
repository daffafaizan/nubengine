      provides sustained release of the active moiety and utilizes the enhanced permeability and
      retention effect to target release of platinum to tumors. Currently available nonclinical
      data and enhanced pharmacokinetics suggest that NC-6004 has the potential to be more active
      than cisplatin, with increased tolerability.
