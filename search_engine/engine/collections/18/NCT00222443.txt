    
      Determine toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of escalating daily protracted irinotecan, with
      weekly vincristine, temozolomide and vantin; to evaluate the feasibility of repetitive cycles
      of this chemotherapy and to estimate the response rate to this combination in children and
      adolescents with recurrent solid tumors and lymphomas.

      Temozolomide is given by mouth one hour prior to each daily irinotecan dose days 1-5 of each
      cycle. 100 mg/m2/day. Irinotecan is given IV in dose escalation (minimum of 3 and up to 6
      patients per cohort) starting at 15 mg/m2/day daily for 5 days for 2 weeks. Vincristin is
      given IV 1.5 mg/m2/dose (max dose 2mg) days 1 and 8 of each cycle. Vantin is given 10
      mg/kg/day divided in 2 oral doses (max dose 400 mg/day) started 48 hours prior to the start
      of each treatment cycle and continued for 48 hours after last irinotecan dose. Cycle repeated
      every 28 days.

      Therapy will continue for a minimum of two cycles unless there is progression of disease or
      unacceptable toxicity and may be continued as long as patient tolerates therapy and there is
      continued disease control up to one year of therapy.
