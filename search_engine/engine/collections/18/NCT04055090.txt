      administered as intramuscular (IM) injections into bilateral calves on Days 0 and 14, and
      Days 90 and 104. Primary efficacy was evaluated 90 days following the first injection. The
      growth potential for HGF make long-term follow-up important both for safety and efficacy: in
      order for VM202 to be a candidate for chronic treatment of PDPN, it must be demonstrated not
      to induce unexpected adverse events with repeated dosing; and the potential for reversal or
      stabilization of diabetic neuropathy using only one or two treatments of VM202 may make it
      especially attractive compared to current treatments which must be taken daily for the
      duration of the disease. A safety extension to the VMDN-003 study is therefore warranted.
