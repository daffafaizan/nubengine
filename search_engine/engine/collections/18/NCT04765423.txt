      [F-18] NaF PET/CT as the reference standard. Each bone lesion identified on [F-18] NaF PET/CT
      will be compared with the level of [F-18] fluciclovine uptake

      The primary objective is to assess [F-18] fluciclovine efficacy in the evaluation of osseous
      metastatic disease in prostate cancer on a lesion-by-lesion comparison with [F-18] NaF as a
      the reference standard.
