    
      Up to 30 patients of any gender aged from 18 to 70 years old will be recruited for inclusion
      once candidacy has been established by screening criteria.

      Once recruited, patients will be randomly assigned to the TMS treatment group or the iTBS
      treatment group. Patients will be blinded to their group assignment, but will be informed of
      their assignment upon the final outcome measure collection timepoint (e.g., 1 month
      post-treatment). Patients who failed to respond by 1-month post iTBS or TMS treatment will be
      allowed to cross-over into the other treatment group and will be re-enrolled into the study.

      For patients assigned to the TMS treatment group, the treatment protocol will consist of 20
      sessions of TMS treatment. Each TMS session will deliver 5,000 pulses (120-140% MT,
      continuous temperature of 24C) over an 61 minute, 51 second time period. Patients will have
      one TMS session per day, five days a week, until their treatment is completed (approximately
      four weeks). Upon completion, the patient's depressive symptomatology and severity will be
      assessed using the same outcome measures used at baseline.

      For patients assigned to the iTBS treatment group, the treatment protocol will consist of 20
      sessions of iTBS treatment. Each iTBS session will deliver 1,800 pulses (120-140% MT,
      continuous temperature of 24C) over an 9-minute-40-second period. Patients will have up to
      four iTBS sessions per day, five days a week, until their treatment is completed
      (approximately 1 week). Upon completion, the patient's depressive symptomatology and severity
      will be assessed using the same outcome measures used at baseline.
