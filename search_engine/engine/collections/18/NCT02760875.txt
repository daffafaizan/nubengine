      nonoperative treatment with or without early weight bearing was invited for an additional
      follow up, where we examine the length of the Achilles tendon using ultrasound, as well as
      functional influence of the injury, using foot pressure mapping (FPM) during barefoot gait.
      Additionally the mobility of the ankle is measured with the Achilles Tendon Resting Angle
      (ATRA) as well as passive plantar- and dorsiflexion. Strength is measured using Heel Raise
      Work (height of lift, number of lifts and the total work), and supplemented with calf
      circumference.
