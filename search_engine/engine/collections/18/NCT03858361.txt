    
      Prospective, single-center, non-randomized, open label, single arm study. Consented subjects
      who are scheduled to undergo ablation due to atrial flutter will be enrolled in the study.
      Data will be collected from all subjects during the ablation procedure and post procedure for
      a period of 3 months.

      KODEX - EPDâ„¢ system will be used in all procedures during treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.

      Anonymized data will be stored in an EPD database and will be used to train and test
      predictors for personalized optimized therapy.

      Data will be collected on paper and/or electronic forms and saved in the EPD Database.

      Advanced data analysis will be used to map patient specific demographics, history, current
      ailment, intervention to patient outcome. The technology to be utilized will help develop a
      method to identify the personalized treatment for a given patient (defined by: patient's
      demographic, history, current ailment and intervention information to achieve optimal
      outcome).

      Data will be anonymized by removing patient protected health information, only initials will
      be used. The data will be integrated to an EPD data base and will be used to train and test
      predictors for personalized optimized therapy.
