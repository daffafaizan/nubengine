      electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. The analgesic effect is possibly mediated via both
      spinal and supra-spinal mechanisms.

      Traditional "tonic" SCS causes paresthesia during treatment, but the newer burst technique
      (five electrical pulses at 500Hz delivered in intermittent packets of 40 Hz) can be performed
      below detection level. Thus, it is possible to do double-blinded sham-controlled studies.

      In this study, we will study the effect of burst SCS compared with sham on pain intensity and
      function (Patient-Specific Functional Scale). In addition, we will use several questionnaires
      (psychometric data, health-related quality of life, sleep, global impression of change, use
      of analgesics, blinding).
