    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of oral
      TP-0184 administered once weekly for 4 weeks, over a range of doses in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To establish the pharmacokinetics of orally administered TP-0184

        -  To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of TP-0184 by objective
           radiographic assessment

        -  To study the pharmacodynamics of TP-0184 therapy

        -  To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with TP-0184
