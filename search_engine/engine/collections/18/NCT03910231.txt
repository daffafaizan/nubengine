      previous data support the concept that vasopressin's primary role is in mediating water
      homeostasis, recent data suggest that vasopressin, through its V2 receptor, may also modulate
      sodium homeostasis. This effect occurs via activation of the epithelial sodium channel
      (ENaC). These studies document that vasopressin via activation of the V2 receptor, not only
      reduces free water excretion but also sodium excretion. These data suggest that blocking this
      receptor under the right circumstances and in the right population may be effective in
      modulating hypertension in humans: specifically a V2 receptor antagonist may be effective in
      treating some individuals that have salt-sensitive hypertension. The current proposal will
      test in normal human subjects the proof of principle of the above stated hypothesis, and to
      assess the best markers to determine such an effect. It is important to perform studies with
      strict environmental control in a clinical research center because of the variability of
      environmental factors that can create confusion in interpreting data (dietary sodium,
      activity, body posture, diurnal variation, ambient temperature, sleep-wake cycle, etc.).

      The overall program objective is to determine if a vasopressin V2 antagonist will be an
      effective treatment for salt-sensitive hypertension and if so, what subtype. The object of
      this specific proposal is to determine the effect of a selective V2 antagonist on sodium
      handling in normal subjects.
