      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with unresectable metastatic or recurrent
           colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with capecitabine, cetuximab, oxaliplatin, and
           bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Exploratory

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on the angiogenesis biomarkers in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on wound angiogenesis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Patients will also receive
      cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
