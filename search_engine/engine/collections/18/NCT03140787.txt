      anesthetic agent. This approach carries several disadvantages. First is the child's fear of
      pain. Infection is also a risk for providers, through exposure to blood-borne pathogens via
      needle stick.

      Fear of a painful dental injection and subsequent avoidance behavior are significant barriers
      to regular visits to the dentist.

      Importantly, patients' fear of injections can delay needed dental care. Surveys indicate that
      30-40 million people in the US avoid going to the dentist because of fear of pain and
      anesthetic injections.

      Therefore an anesthetic procedure that would avoid the discomfort of a local anesthetic
      injection thus obviating fear and anxiety about receiving a "shot," would greatly benefit
      dental patients. Further, for procedures involving more than one maxillary tooth on the same
      side, a trans-nasally applied anesthetic agent that could anesthetize multiple maxillary
      teeth at once instead of use of repeated infiltration injections would be a major convenience
      for patients and dentists.
