    
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the benefits of a pharmacist
      integration in an oncology ambulatory center, to prevent drug related problems (in particular
      drug drug interactions) at antitumor treatment initiation.

      The hypothesis of this work is that a drug drug interaction will be observed in 30% of cancer
      patients and will have a major clinical impact in 1% of the cases.

      The primary endpoint is the prevalence of pharmacist interventions among cancer patients who
      are going to receive an oral targeted therapy (140 patients) or cancer chemotherapy or
      immunotherapy (300 patients).

      Pharmacist interventions will be classified according to the SFPC (société française de
      pharmacie Clinique) classification.

      The secondary endpoints are

        -  The detection of drug drug interactions with theriaque software, Micromedex software and
           DDI predictor tool.

        -  The clinical gradation by an independent expert comity of the clinical impact of avoided
           drug drug interaction. The expert comity will grade avoided clinical consequences in 3
           levels (minor, moderate or major),

        -  The Economic evaluation of pharmacist intervention: Cost of the project to evaluate drug
           drug interaction and benefits after evaluation of avoided clinical consequences

        -  The Adherence evaluation of patients treated with oral cancer targeted therapy
           (Therefore, only patients under oral targeted therapy will be evaluated at Day0, Day15
           ,Day 30 and Month 6 to determine adherence.)
