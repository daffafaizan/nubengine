      spine mobilization.

      The vertebral resonant oscillation using the POLD method is similar to spine mobilizations,
      but there are some differens; the oscillatory movement has a sinusoidal waveform, the
      frequency used between 1.2 and 2 Hz and the amplitude is similar to "neutral zone" to
      described by Panjabi 1992.

      The spinal mobilizations has a posterior-anterior vertebral movement for spinous process,
      described by Maitland 2000.
