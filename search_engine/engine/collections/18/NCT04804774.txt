      improve glycemic control in patients with Type II Diabetes clinic-based interventions are
      costly and have poor accessibility for the majority of patients. Commercial weight loss
      programs like WW (formerly Weight Watchers) are more affordable and accessible than
      clinic-based modalities, and have been shown to produce effective weight loss in adults with
      additional improvements in glycemic control. A randomized trial of a modified WW program for
      patients with Type II Diabetes showed significant reductions in weight and improved glycemic
      control (HbA1c) compared to standard of care diabetes nutrition counseling and education.
      Here, we extend prior work by leveraging the efficacy of the WW program for Type II Diabetes,
      virtually, to increase its reach and its impact on glycemic control. This study aims to test
      a novel, web-based weight loss intervention from one of the largest and most evidence-based
      proprietary weight loss programs in the world.

      Intervention will consist of the WW program modified for people with Type 2 diabetes
      including weekly Virtual Workshops and use of the WW App. Primary outcomes are any change in
      HbA1c% over the 6-month intervention. Secondary endpoints are any change in HbA1c% at 3
      months, as well as changes at 3 and 6 months in weight, Diabetes Distress Scale, Impact of
      Weight on Quality of Life, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, hypoglycemic events, WHO-5
      Well-being Index, and diabetes medication changes.
