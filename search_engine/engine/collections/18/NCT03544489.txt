      for feasibility in routine clinical practice. Based on results from our two completed
      randomized trials of exercise after an ICD, the investigators created a home based exercise
      program called (E-ICD) for use in routine practice that assists individuals to start and
      monitor exercise safely after an ICD. The study uses a randomized, two group parallel
      mixed-methods intervention trial, to determine the feasibility of the home-based E-ICD
      exercise program in routine clinical care. Ninety patients in 3 study sites (30/site) will
      participate in this 2 year study. The study sites are in the greater Seattle, WA area. This
      intervention study is guided by the Reach-Efficacy-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance
      (RE-AIM) model. The E-ICD intervention consists of 12 weeks of home walking exercise after an
      ICD using the E-ICD program, with an exercise prescription and protocols validated in our
      previous work. The primary outcome of the study is total physical activity (steps/day) at 3
      months. Measures will be taken at baseline, after the intervention at 3 months, and at 6
      months. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) determine the reach, adoption and
      implementation of E-ICD into the clinical setting, 2) compare intervention efficacy for
      patient total daily activity (primary outcome) for E-ICD vs. usual care from baseline to
      intervention completion at 3 months, and 3) describe exercise maintenance for patient
      outcomes in E-ICD vs. usual care at 6 months.
