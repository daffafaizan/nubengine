      erythropoiesis by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). However, this
      option is unavailable to many patients as a result of a lack of compatible
      donors.Haploidentical transplantation has been certified as a valuable alternative for
      hematological malignancy patients lacking a well-matched donor, with results comparable
      matched HLA-identical sibling donors or unrelated donors.The objective of this study is to
      test the feasibility of haploidentical HSCT for patients with thalassemia major.
