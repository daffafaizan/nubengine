      association with oral environment for renewal, recharging or enhancing of the constituents of
      the restoration to improve marginal integrity to decrease bacterial microleakage. Physical
      and chemical properties of dental restorations have been progressed such that individual
      components may exert a bioactive role in the prevention, remineralization, and restoration of
      active carious lesions.Fluoride containing restorative materials recently gained great
      attention. Fluoride decreases caries activity by being a bacteriostatic and by decreasing the
      solubility of enamel and dentin through its integration into tooth tissue to form
      fluoroapatite. Moreover, it aids to remineralize defected tooth structure after
      demineralization. conventional GICs and RMGICs are have high fluoride release and could be
      specified clinically to repair decayed non-biting areas in high caries risk patients.To
      enhance the mechanical properties of GIs, their constituents have been modified
      Comparatively, resin-modified GIs (RMGIs) with a longer working time, faster setting, higher
      early strength, and improved appearance and translucency. Unfortunately, the RMGI's
      mechanical properties of are different to resin composites. progressive development of
      material sciences has resulted in the introduction of bioactive restorative materials. These
      materials can activate a tissue repair mechanism for or synthesis and elicit a response from
      teeth and surrounding environment.
