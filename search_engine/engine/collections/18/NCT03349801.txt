    
      The purpose of the MACUSTAR clinical study is to develop novel clinical endpoints for
      clinical trials with a regulatory and patient access intention in patients with intermediate
      age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). Additional objectives are to characterize the visual
      impairment in iAMD and its progression, as well as identify risk factors for progression to
      late stage AMD.

      Moreover, MACUSTAR aims to optimize and standardize most relevant existing and/or rapidly
      available clinical endpoints in:

        -  visual functional outcomes measures

        -  structural outcomes measures

        -  patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs)

      The study will be composed by two parts:

        -  a cross-sectional part to technically evaluate the functional and structural outcome
           measures to support a biomarker qualification by regulatory authorities and payers; and

        -  a longitudinal part to assess the prognostic power of changes in retinal sensitivity (as
           measured by microperimetry) for progression from iAMD to late AMD (nAMD and GA).
