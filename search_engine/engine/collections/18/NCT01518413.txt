      and angiogenesis, has been well studied and shown promising clinical results in adult cancer
      patients and the Maximum Tolerated Dose or MTD has been determined in pediatric patients.
      Irinotecan is known to be effective and is widely used in pediatric malignancies. The
      combination of sorafenib with irinotecan is of interest as these agents have different
      mechanisms of action. In addition, the combination has been evaluated in adult patients and
      deemed tolerable without alterations in the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile at the MTD. The
      trial we are proposing also offers the advantage of being a completely oral regimen, adding
      convenience and cost effectiveness. Given these considerations, if the sorafenib/irinotecan
      combination proves tolerable in phase I studies and shows efficacy in phase II studies, it
      would be an attractive combination to incorporate into existing chemotherapy regimens for
      pediatric cancer.
