      Malaysians whereby functional constipation (FC) is the commonest functional gastrointestinal
      disorders (FGIDs) reported. Although numerous treatments are available, but over-the-counter
      drugs which have low product safety and possible toxicity were always given as the treatment
      option. Synbiotic have been well-studied to improve digestive health includes constipation.
      Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of FC and to evaluate the
      effects of synbiotic supplement on improving FC symptoms and contributing factors among
      constipated individuals in Serdang, Selangor. This study comprised of two parts which were
      screening and intervention part. The prevalence of functional constipation was relatively
      high in the study community. Synbiotic supplement was effective in the improvement of
      functional constipation symptoms, quality of life, and psychological factors. However, the
      positive improvement in placebo group indicated the existence of placebo effects which led to
      the improvement in quality of life and changes in psychological factors. Therefore, the
      current findings are useful information for future intervention in improving functional
      constipation symptoms.
