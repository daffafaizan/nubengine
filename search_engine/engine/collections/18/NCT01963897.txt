      local neuropediatrician. Patients who do not come to our region hospital will be seen at
      their local hospital.Each participant will be seen up to three times with one year between
      each visit. The visits include clinical examination, DXA scan, x-ray for bone age, and blood
      tests including several parameters related to bone health, growth and puberty. Standardized
      questionnaires regarding quality of life (patients and parents) will be used, and certain
      questions regarding the importance of achieving normal height and puberty will be added.
      Additional anamnestic data will be retrieved from the patients' medical records.
