      pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and a generalized stiffness and swollen feeling.
      Fibromyalgia affects 2-6% of the general population, affecting females more commonly than
      males. Symptoms usually start between 20 and 55 years of age.

      No medical treatment has been specifically approved for the management of fibromyalgia,
      however, there is strong evidence that some antidepressants, exercise, and patient education
      are effective in reducing the pain experienced by fibromyalgia patients. A recent study of
      four patients has suggested the possible benefit of Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, in the
      treatment of fibromyalgia, however more studies are needed.

      Marijuana is the common name for cannabis. Nabilone (brand name, CESAMETÂ®), is a synthetic
      cannabinoid (form of cannabis). Cannabinoid receptors exist naturally in the human body and
      respond to naturally occurring cannabinoids produced by the body, as well as marijuana and
      synthetic cannabinoids like Nabilone.

      In Canada, Nabilone is approved for the treatment and management of severe nausea and
      vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and may be prescribed by physicians.

      Research has shown that activating the cannabinoid receptors also has an effect on reducing
      acute and chronic pain.

      Our hypothesis is that the synthetic cannabinoid Nabilone will significantly reduce the pain
      experienced by patients with fibromyalgia and improve quality of life, compared to the
      placebo controlled group. This will be evident by finding significant differences in Visual
      Analogue Scale pain scores, number of tender points, average pain threshold, and scores on
      the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionaire.
