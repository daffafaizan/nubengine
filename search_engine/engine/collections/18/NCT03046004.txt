      the following 1-2 weeks they will receive a phone call to confirm that they have received the
      mailed letter and to assess the inclusion criteria. If they agree to participate in the
      study, they will be asked for informed consent. All the participants will receive a first
      questionnaire, the pre-intervention survey (10-15 minutes), via web or regular mail. Trained
      interviewers will collect the responses by phone for women who prefer this method. Once the
      pre-intervention survey is completed, women will receive the leaflet (intervention or
      control) via regular mail. Two weeks later, the participants will be contacted again to
      collect the post-intervention survey (15-20 minutes), via web or by phone. Participation in
      the mammographic exams of the EDBCP will be collected in the three-month period following the
      corresponding invitation letter.
