      participant in this trial from multiple clinic and university sites around the country. Each
      subject will be evaluated by a licensed physical therapist that specializes in orthopedic
      manual therapy (OMT). Each treating therapist will be blinded be the data collection and each
      data collection therapist will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Subjects data will be
      collected at the initial visit, second visit, and at discharge. The maximum number of weeks
      that a subject may be enrolled is 8 weeks (2 months). At that point, they are discharged from
      the study. The treating therapist will allocate the subject through the already completed
      randomization procedures. Once the subject is randomized, the treating therapist will perform
      the OMT based on their clinical reasoning and in a manner they feel would benefit the patient
      the most. In addition to the OMT, each subject will receive a home exercise program, advice,
      encouragement, and education. A number of outcome variables will be collected regarded pain
      and disability as well as one physical performance measure.
