      conducted based on the results of the pilot study to evaluate the comparative clinical
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Doin (conduction exercise) with acupuncture for
      chronic neck pain patients compared to acupuncture alone as assessed using pain, functional
      disability, health-related quality of life, economic evaluation, and safety measures.
