      healthy subjects. There will be 4 cohorts consisting of 4 subjects each. Eligible subjects
      will receive 1 or 2 doses of LB-102 on Day 1: subjects in the final cohort will be dosed for
      5 days BID (ie twice/day) on an inpatient basis. This will be an open label study. Blood
      samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety assessments will be collected at screening,
      immediately pre-dose, and during/before/after PET scan. Subjects enrolled in the inpatient
      cohort will be monitored daily. Follow-up after discharge will consist of a phone call the
      evening of discharge and the next day to check on subjects. This will be an adaptive study
      and doses in cohorts 2-4 will be determined after PET data from Cohort 1 are obtained.
