      treatment option for MDS patients and is therefore often considered the standard treatment
      for mainly higher-risk MDS patients up to the age of 75 years. One common approach to
      "bridge" higher-risk MDS from the time of diagnosis to transplantation is a treatment with
      hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine due to its anticipated low toxicity profile.
      Alternative strategies are intensive 7+3 chemotherapy with anthracycline and cytarabine or
      direct and immediate transplantation. By this strategy the time interval for donor search can
      be significantly prolonged leading to a higher proportion of success.Nevertheless, not every
      patient initially eligible for transplantation undergoes this procedure subsequently. A
      direct prospective comparison of different therapeutic approaches as outlined above versus
      CPX-351 prior to alloHCT has not been performed so far and is subject of the PALOMA trial. We
      hypothesize that CPX-351 will lead to higher and more durable response rates including a more
      favourable safety profile and long-term outcome compared to currently used conventional care
      regimens approaches prior to alloHCT.
