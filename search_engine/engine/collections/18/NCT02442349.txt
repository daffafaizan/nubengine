    
      This is a phase II, open label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of AZD9291
      (80 mg, orally, once daily) in Asia Pacific patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) sensitising mutation positive (ie, G719X, exon 19 deletion,
      L858R, L861Q) and T790M mutation positive (hereafter referred to as EGFRm+ and T790M+)
      un-resectable, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB-IV), who have progressed on
      an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor(EGFR-TKI), either as first line
      treatment or following one line of EGFR-TKI and one line of platinum containing doublet
      chemotherapy. Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M
      mutation status following confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen.
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of AZD9291 by assessment of
      Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
