      constraints; however, as this trial will yield valuable information about the preliminary
      impact of the program for planning a larger, more definitive trial in the future, we
      determined the maximum width of a two-sided 95% confidence interval around the differences
      between the arms at 12 months. For self-report measures, 18 patients per arm would yield a
      margin of error of 0.65 standard deviations (total width of confidence interval = 1.3 on the
      standard deviation unit scale), which is considered acceptable for the self-report measures.
      For number of visits over 3 months, we assumed a standard deviation of 3 (based on our
      preliminary data). Assuming approximate normality, our sample size of 18 patients per arm
      would yield a margin of error of 2 visits (total width of confidence interval = 4 visits)
      which is adequate to yield preliminary evidence of change. These are conservative estimates
      as our analyses will include repeated measures, and adjust for baseline measures of response
      in addition to other demographic and clinical covariates. To account for 20% attrition, we
      will plan to enrol 23 participants per arm (total number of participants =46).
