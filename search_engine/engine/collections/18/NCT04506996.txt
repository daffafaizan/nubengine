        1. Develop a targeted delivery system for mobile health messages which focused on improving
           physical activity and diet, and setting healthy resolutions each week.

        2. Deliver the M-TRIMM intervention, which encourages healthy behavior and the weekly
           renewal of health resolutions.

        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on individuals' weight loss,
           self-efficacy, and motivation to sustain changes in lifestyle behaviors.

        4. Assess the benefit of receiving the message content only (in a paper document), versus a
           scheduled weekly delivery via mobile messaging.
