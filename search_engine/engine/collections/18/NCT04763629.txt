    
      This is a prospective randomized two- arms open trial evaluating the effects of two different
      exercise training modalities on atrial function, assessed by speckle-tracking
      echocardiography, on hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease. First endpoint will
      be: between-groups comparison of exercise-induced changes on peak atrial longitudinal strain
      (PALS). Secondary endpoints will be: exercise-induced changes on diastolic function and left
      ventricular strain. We will include 50 patient with hypertension and underlying coronary
      artery disease, evaluated for entering a cardiac rehabilitation program. Patients that will
      be judged suitable for the study will be randomized, with a 1:1 ratio, to interval training
      or combined training the latter including both aerobic and resistance exercises. Each patient
      will undergo three visits. At visit 1 in which patients will perform a first echocardiography
      with evaluation of the acoustic window and an ergometric test (for excluding myocardial
      ischemia and for establishing the training intensity); visit 2- acute evaluation- :patients
      will undergo an echocardiographic assessment before and within 30 minutes after a single
      exercise session (alternatively interval or combined training according to the randomization
      code). Visit 3: at 12 weeks all patient will perform a final echocardiography evaluation and
      a second ergometric test. Patients of both groups will exercise three times/week for 12
      weeks. Each exercise session will last 45 minutes
