      function (using PAH clearance) in healthy subjects. The protocol will be approved by the
      University of Maryland IRB and the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) advisory committee
      (GAC). Following the informed consent process, each subject will be evaluated for past
      medical history, undergo a physical examination and routine laboratory tests (including
      urinary protein:creatinine ratio) conducted within 1 month prior to the study visit.

      Day 1: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) will be recorded hourly
      throughout each study visit. Subjects will have intravenous catheters inserted into forearm
      veins of each arm for blood collection and intravenous infusion iothalamate and PAH. From 30
      minutes before marker administration until the end of each evaluation period, subjects will
      remain in a semireclined position except during urine collections. A constant-rate infusion
      will then be initiated at 1 mL/min for a total of 3 hours, with the concentration in the
      infusate determined based on the patient's estimated renal clearance and target plasma
      concentration of 10 mg/L and 15 mg/L for iothalamate, and PAH, respectively. Day 2: Washout
      Day 3: Subject will begin taking probenecid. Day 4 (Study visit #2): Subject will be admitted
      to the GCRC at 8AM. The final dose of probenecid will be administered. The renal function
      test will then be conducted as described for study visit #1 above. Day 11: Subject will be
      contacted for monitoring of adverse events according to GCRC procedures.
