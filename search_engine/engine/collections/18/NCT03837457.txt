      Up to 60 subjects are expected to be enrolled after discontinuation from the SOLAR clinical
      study (MRG106-11-201). Cobomarsen will be administered in the clinic by 2-hr intravenous
      infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 and 8, and weekly thereafter. Treatment will continue until the
      subject becomes intolerant, develops clinically significant side effects, progresses, or the
      trial is terminated.
