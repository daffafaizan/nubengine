      computer detection system to board certified ophthalmologists performing dilated eye
      examination at identifying between no or mild NPDR without clinically significant diabetic
      macular edema from more than mild NPDR with or without CSDME. Approximately 400-600 persons
      with diabetes will be recruited through 5 clinical centers. The ophthalmologist who examines
      the patient will evaluate and record the status of the eye based on his/her clinical
      examination. The study subjects will then have two fundus photographs taken of each eye. The
      photographic images will be transferred to a central Reading Center at the University of
      Pennsylvania and interpreted by professional graders. The Reading Center will then transfer
      the images to IDx-DR, the computer detection system. IDx-LLC, the Sponsor of this study, will
      have no access to the images. Data from the Reading Center interpretation will be considered
      the "gold standard". The results of the clinical examination and IDX-DR will be compared
      against this gold standard as well as against each other.
