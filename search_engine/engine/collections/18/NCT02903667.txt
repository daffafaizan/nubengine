      healing than that occurring after removal of a single tooth with adjacent teeth present. In
      order to maintain the dimension of the ridge following tooth removal, bone grafts and bone
      substitutes have also been placed in the extraction socket. So far no data have been reported
      on the effect of removal of multiple adjacent teeth on bone loss at various aspects of the
      edentulous sites. Furthermore, the potential effect on ridge contraction of implant placement
      in multiple fresh extraction sites is not documented. Therefore, the objective of the study
      is to evaluate the possibility of counteracting un favourable ridge modeling after multiple
      tooth extractions by placing mineral bovine bone in the extraction sockets and covering the
      wound with a native collagen membrane. In addition, the possibility of placing implants in
      the grafted sites is evaluated after six month of healing. For these purpose 40 subjects with
      2 or more fresh adjacent extraction sites in need of two or more implants replacing teeth
      will be enrolled. Ridge dimensional changes will be measured after 6 months of healing;
      marginal bone loss will be measured after 3-years follow-up from the baseline (prosthetic
      delivery).
