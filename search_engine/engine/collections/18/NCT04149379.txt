      oxygen therapy. The objective is to establish knowledge of HBO for this group of patients in
      a Norwegian context, so that we can prepare for the main study afterwards, including about
      60-70 patients. We need to know how to optimize the administrative and technical systems for
      the larger study. We want to collect feedback from the patients undergoing the pilot study.
      We want more information about the treatment table, if 20 treatments are enough, if 2,4 bar
      pressure is adequate. The treatment table is based on existing research, and is considered
      safe.

      The patients are to be treated at table 14/90, at 2,4 Absolute atmospheres, and daly 90
      minutes of oxygen inhalation (medical oxygen).
