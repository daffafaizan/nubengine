      study. They will be randomly assigned to be shown an instructional video on how to perform an
      in-plane ultrasound guided needling technique on a realistic simulation target. The two
      videos are identical with the exception of the probe position. A blinded assessor will time
      the volunteers performance behind a screen and note the duration in which the needle is not
      visualized in the ultrasound screen.
