      The overall aim of this intervention study is to examine the effects of an high-fidelity
      simulation intervention developed to identify how recognizing and responding to patient
      deterioration improves the knowledge and self-confidence of undergraduate nursing students.

      Specific aims:

        1. To describe and estimate the change in undergraduate nursing students' knowledge and
           perceived self-confidence after an high-fidelity simulation intervention.

        2. To identify the barriers and enablers that may impact on a successful implementation of
           the high-fidelity simulation intervention.

      Half of the participants will receive an intervention with high-fidelity simulation, while
      the other half will not receive any instructional intervention. All participants will answer
      a questionnaire developed to measure perceived knowledge and levels of self-confidence pre-
      and post-intervention or before and after a meeting (control group). Five students and six
      faculty members will also be interviewed as a part of a process evaluation.

      The study is part of a PhD project.
