      multiple oral administration clinical trial. The planned dose increasing level was 6, 12 and
      18 mg daily dose (3 administration groups).

      After the completion of the test and safety evaluation of the initial dose 6mg daily dose
      group, the main researchers of the team leader and the sponsor jointly determine whether to
      enter the 12mg daily dose study.

      After the completion of the test and safety evaluation of the 12 mg daily dose group, the
      main researchers of the team leader and the sponsor jointly determine whether to enter the 18
      mg daily dose study.
