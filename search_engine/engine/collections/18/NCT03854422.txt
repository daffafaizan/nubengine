      incidence of colorectal cancer.In this process, the most important problem for the
      endoscopist and the patient is pain, loop formation, (the reason why the device is not able
      to progress in the bowel) and in some patients it takes a long time due to these reasons and
      the risk of complication development.The subject of what should be the most ideal position in
      colonoscopy has previously been studied in some specific subgroups.There is not enough study
      on what should be the ideal position in colonoscopy. In this study, the investigators tried
      to determine which colonoscopic position allows easy, fast and comfortable way.
