      I. To calculate recruitment, adherence, assessment completion, and retention rates.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Document the frequency of adverse events. II. Assess descriptive data on proposed outcomes
      (i.e., pain, sleep disturbances, psychological distress) for the next phase of study.) III.
      Qualitatively assess acceptability to guide future study planning.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (MINDFUL MOVEMENT AND BREATHING [eMMB]): Participants will receive instruction on
      awareness meditation, breathing and relaxation, and awareness meditation. This will include a
      call with the interventionist to invite participants to initiate additional guidance upon
      request prior to surgery and a meeting by videoconferencing the day following surgery.
      Participants will also be given a self-directed video to be used before surgery and daily for
      two weeks following surgery.

      GROUP II (ATTENTION CONTROL [AC]): Participants will receive caring attention. This will
      include a call with the interventionist to invite participants to initiate additional
      guidance upon request prior to surgery and a meeting by videoconferencing the day following
      surgery. Participants are also asked to write brief diary entries once before surgery and
      daily for two weeks following surgery.
