    
      This study was an 52 weeks open label extension starting at the lowest treatment dose used in
      CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 (i.e., 10 mg) with optional up-titrations, to evaluate the overall
      long-term safety and tolerability of LCQ908 in patients with Familial Chylomicronemia
      Syndrome, who either discontinued from the CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 study (due to
      tolerability issues) or completed the CLCQ908B2302/NCT01514461 study after 52 weeks. In
      addition, patients who had previously completed study CLCQ908A2212/NCT01146522 were eligible
      to participate.

      Following Protocol amendment 2, the original 52 week duration of this study (CLCQ908B2305)
      became Part A of LCQ908B2305 and a 78 week extension became Part B. However, following
      Protocol amendment 3, Part B was ended at the same time as the last patient of Part A
      completed 52 weeks. The reason for termination of Part B was the findings from the December
      2014 interim analysis which suggested that the size of benefit that was anticipated from
      continued participation of patients in the 18 month extension trial (Part B) no longer
      supported trial extension beyond Part A.
