      between 100 and 140 mmHg by adapting depth of anesthesia, by level of post expiratory
      pressure or by giving vasoconstriction.

      low perfusion group means that

        1. systolic blood pressure is kept below 100 mmHg from the first linear staple till the
           last by using a Clevidipine infusion to regulate the blood pressure accurate just below
           100 mmHg for a short time while needed.

        2. goal directed fluid therapy using 100 ml/h fluid intravenous and extra load of fluid if
           pulse pressure variation > 20 %

        3. increase intra abdominal pressure (IAP) up to 20 mmHg inly during stapling and return to
           minimum IAP needed to achieve 3 liter workspace.
