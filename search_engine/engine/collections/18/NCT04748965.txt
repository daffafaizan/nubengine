    
      This is a prospective, nonrandomized trial to investigate the adjunctive use of intravascular
      imaging in tibial vessel interventions. The evaluation of OCT is primarily to: (a) establish
      feasibility and reproducibility in below-the-knee vessels, (b) determine the optimal protocol
      imaging to produce the optimal clear image frame and clear image length, (c) provide detailed
      lesion characteristics of tibial disease, (d) assess for luminal gain post-intervention.
      Operator-determined sizing will be compared against University Hospitals Core Imaging
      Laboratory assessment of OCT, IVUS (when applicable), and quantitative vessel analysis (QVA).

      Subjects will follow up per routine care with corresponding ankle-brachial index and
      toe-brachial index at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months or as clinically indicated. Wound and amputation
      data will be collected at the pre-procedural visit and with each subsequent visit. Wound care
      will be managed by our wound care associates in podiatry, vascular medicine, vascular
      surgery, or plastic surgery.
