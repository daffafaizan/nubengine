    
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), open label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance),
      parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) study.
      Approximately, 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. This study will consist of a
      screening phase (maximum 14 days), an observation phase (92 days), and a follow-up phase (98
      days). Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment group A, B, or C. During the
      observation phase, participants will receive injections of paliperidone palmitate of
      concentration ranging from 75 to 150 milligram equivalents in the deltoid muscle or gluteal
      muscle as applicable on Days 1, 8, 36, and 64 alternating between sides (left/right). Safety
      evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examination, injection site reaction, drug-induced
      extrapyramidal symptoms scale, and visual analog scale which will be evaluated throughout the
      study. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 190 days.
