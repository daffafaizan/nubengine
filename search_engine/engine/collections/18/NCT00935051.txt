    
      This monocentric, prospective, non-randomized study assesses the amount of the main
      metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP9, MMP13) and their inhibitor TIMP-1 in wound fluid from
      diabetic foot ulcers.

      It aims at demonstrating whether a MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio equal to 0.24 at study entry can
      predict wound healing 12 weeks later. All patients will receive the same treatment according
      to our local protocol. The difference with standard care will be a sample of wound fluid at
      week 0 and week 4 and a numeric photograph for wound area measurement at week 0, week 4 and
      week 12.

      The main outcome measurement is the percent change of wound area between week 0 and week 12
      Secondary objectives include the evaluation of a MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio equal to 0.4 and the
      search for confounding factors. A correlation between MMP-9, MMP-13 and wound healing will
      also be investigated.
