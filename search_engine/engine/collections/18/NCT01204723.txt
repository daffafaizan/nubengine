      of the HPA axis, autonomic nervous system, and brain DA systems. Furthermore, alterations
      within several neuropeptide systems (CRF, Substance P, and others) also contribute to the
      role of stress in addiction. Central to this project is that anxiety and stress responses are
      modulated by substance P and its preferred target, the NK1 receptor. Therefore the aim of
      this pilot clinical trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of aprepitant (a neurokinin
      1 (NK1) receptor antagonist). We hypothesize that the NK1 receptor antagonist, aprepitant,
      will be safe, tolerable and efficacious at reducing the withdrawal symptoms, cue craving, and
      reinforcement value for both cannabis and tobacco resulting from the cessation of either or
      both drugs. We will assess this hypothesis in the context of a carefully controlled human
      laboratory study in which subjects (N=72) will be randomized in a 3 x 2 factorial design to
      one of 3 behavioral conditions; a) withdrawn from both substances, b) withdrawn from tobacco
      only, or c) withdrawn from cannabis only, and to receive one of 2 medication dose conditions:
      placebo or aprepitant (160 mg/day). Medication will be administered for 5 days, followed by a
      cue challenge, choice procedure, and then a consequence (i.e., oral cannabis or a cigarette
      or money) also on day 5.
