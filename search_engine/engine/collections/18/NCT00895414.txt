      doxorubicin metabolism. Women with breast cancer for whom at least two cycles every 14 day
      doxorubicin is planned will be considered for enrollment. Study participation will be for 2
      treatment cycles of doxorubicin or approximately 4 weeks. Patients will receive a 14 day
      course of daily enalapril in association with one cycle of doxorubicin and receive no study
      agent during the other cycle allowing patients to act as their own control. The sequence of
      enalapril dosing will be assigned by randomization at study enrollment. Blood samples for
      pharmacokinetics will be drawn before and at 7 time points after each of the two doses of
      doxorubicin. For each patient, serum doxorubicin and doxorubicinol concentrations both on and
      off of enalapril will be compared.
