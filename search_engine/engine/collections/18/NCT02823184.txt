      unexpected role of the endoplasmic reticulum biology in the pathophysiology in these
      diseases. Otherwise, the association of endoplasmic reticulum stress with solid cancers, in
      particular in resistance to chemotherapy, is well documented, contrary to hematological
      malignancies. The study aims to evaluate endoplasmic reticulum stress markers as predictors
      for the response to hydroxyurea in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia patients.
      The main objective is to correlate endoplasmic reticulum stress (defined as splicing of XBP1
      above 30%) to the rate of complete response after 6 months according to the 2009 ELN
      criteria. This is an observational retrospective study.
