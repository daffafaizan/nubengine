      balloon pump have significantly improved survival in patients with cardiogenic shock
      complicating acute myocardial infarction, mortality still remains excessively high, being
      actually about 30-50%. Future research should focus on new therapeutic strategies, aimed to
      further decrease mortality rate of these patients or improve possible hospitalization and
      prognosis.

      Heart pumping failure result in cardiogenic shock. Increased LA filling pressure result in
      acute pulmonary edema, hypoxemic respiratory failure, even congestive kidney and congestive
      liver. Decreased stroke volume result in hypoperfusion obviously direct induce acute renal
      failure, disturbance consciousness and lactate accumulation, even, shock liver. Multiple
      organ failure is the major mortality in the patients suffered from cardiogenic shock after
      acute myocardial infarction.

      Cardiogenic shock remains the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized for myocardial
      infarction . Systemic inflammation , especially endovascular Interleukin-6, triggered by
      Tumor necrosis factor-alfa and Interleukin-1 beta result in inappropriate vasodilatation is
      observed in many patients with cardiogenic shock and may contribute to an excess mortality
      rate. In recent study, interleukin-6 represented a reliable independent early prognostic
      marker of 30-day mortality.

      Therapeutic hypothermia (34â„ƒ) increase stroke volume, reduce muscle oxygen consumption and
      enhance anti-inflammatory action . The mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect for therapeutic
      hypothermia in cardiogenic shock is still unclear, need to further study in clinical trial.
      Furthermore, this study will provide new strategy to increase survival rate in cardiogenic
      shock.
