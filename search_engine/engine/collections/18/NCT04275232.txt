      occurs secondary to plasminogen deficiency. The condition is characterized by thick, fibrous
      pseudo membranes adherent to the conjunctival surface of the eye lid.The investigational
      product, allogenic plasma aliquots, is a source of plasminogen. It will be used as eye drops,
      to treat recurrences of these pseudo membranes by providing the plasminogen required for
      fibrinolysis. The allogenic plasma aliquots are prepared by Canadian Blood Services. An
      initial supply of 680 vials was made available through the Special Access program, upon
      approval by Health Canada. Through this Clinical Trial, additional allogenic plasma aliquots
      will be available when required to treat recurrences of the pseudo membranes. The study has
      been conditionally approved by local HREB, pending registration with clinicaltrials.gov
