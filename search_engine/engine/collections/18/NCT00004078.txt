      I. Determine the efficacy of irinotecan in children with refractory CNS or solid tumors.

      II. Assess the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in this
      patient population.

      III. Determine patient UGT1A1 genotype and correlate genotype with toxicity and
      pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of solid tumor (Ewings/PNET vs
      neuroblastoma vs osteosarcoma vs rhabdomyosarcoma vs other solid tumors excluding lymphomas
      and brain tumors) or brain tumor (medulloblastoma/PNET vs brain stem glioma vs ependymoma vs
      other CNS tumors).

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter until death or
      until patient enters another POG study.
