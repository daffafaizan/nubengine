      Several lines of evidence suggest that aldosterone antagonism may improve exercise tolerance
      in HFPEF. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that
      spironolactone will improve exercise tolerance and quality of life in elderly patients with
      isolated HFPEF. A total of 72 participants aged 60 or older will be randomized to receive
      either spironolactone 25mg daily or a placebo.
