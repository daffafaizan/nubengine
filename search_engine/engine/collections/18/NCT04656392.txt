      the last few decades and the still dismal prognosis has stimulated interest in screening for
      Barrett's esophagus (BE). Although BE is a known precursor of EAC, a minority of patients
      with EAC (<10%) are known with a previous diagnosis of BE, and hence, most cases of BE are
      undiagnosed. Screening programs to detect BE followed by endoscopic surveillance and
      treatment of dysplasia or early neoplasia seem able to reduce the incidence of EAC and
      improve survival. A non-invasive screening tool, such as breath testing, could select
      patients at risk for BE, after which unsedated transnasal endoscopy (uTNE) can confirm or
      exclude the diagnosis. uTNE offers the possibility of a more acceptable and accurate
      endoscopic assessment of the esophagus with almost neglectable risks and lower costs compared
      to conventional endoscopy. The objective is to determine the accuracy and acceptability of a
      non-invasive screening strategy i.e. breath testing followed by uTNE for BE and EAC.
