      disability; the biologic sequelae of a chronic tear are muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration,
      and intercellular fibrosis of the torn muscle-tendon unit. Recently, researchers have
      attempted to address the biologic sequelae of chronic rotator cuff tearing with animal
      studies examining the effects of anabolic steroids on rotator cuff healing, demonstrating
      that when administered as an adjuvant to rotator cuff repair, anabolic steroids can halt
      fatty infiltration, decrease muscle atrophy, and promote healing. The purpose of this study
      will be to conduct the first clinical trial using an oral anabolic agent (Oxandrolone, an
      oral synthetic derivative of testosterone that has been shown to aid in beneficial tissue
      healing in burn patients) to promote rotator cuff healing. Men and women aged 40 - 75
      scheduled for rotator cuff repair, who have failed nonoperative management of chronic, full
      thickness rotator cuff tears confirmed by MRI, will be randomized into one of two groups, a
      control group (receiving placebo medication) and an experimental group (receiving oral
      Oxandrolone), with dosing (males 12 mg BID, female 6 mg BID) beginning at time of surgery and
      continuing for 12 weeks postoperative. Allocation will be performed using computer software
      and will occur at the pharmacy to ensure that all investigators are blinded. All participants
      will undergo a standardized rehabilitation protocol for rotator cuff repair, supervised by a
      licensed physical therapist.
