      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients with stage IB-IV cutaneous T-cell
           lymphoma treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome followed by bexarotene.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the complete and partial response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 30-90 minutes once on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses. Beginning within 4 weeks after the last dose of
      doxorubicin HCl liposome, patients receive oral bexarotene once daily for at least 16 weeks.
      Patients who achieve a complete or partial response may continue to receive bexarotene in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
