      in children presenting :

        1. A congenitally deafness : it is a retrospective study in children aged 0 to 17 yrs with
           hearing thresholds over 40 dB in the best ear using adapted audiometric assessment,

        2. A suspicion of deafness in babies aged 0 to 6 months having an abnormal response after
           otoacoustic emissions and automated ABR assessment.

      The main outcomes studied will be the finding of a pathogenic mutation (or several
      mutations).
