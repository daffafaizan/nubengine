      2) to obtain systematic data regarding dosing, safety and tolerability of CPP-109 in adults
      with treatment refractory TD. We will obtain preliminary data on estimate of effect size for
      tics using Cohen's d, calculating the difference between the two means (baseline and endpoint
      scores on the YGTSS), divided by the standard deviation of the difference.
