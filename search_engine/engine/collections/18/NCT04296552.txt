    
      Data from deep phenotype characterization of 100 patients with IBS and 40 healthy age
      (between 18 and 65) and gender-matched controls will be collected between May 2019 and
      December 2021. Psychometric tests, questionnaires, biological samples (blood, faeces, saliva
      and GI biopsies from antrum, duodenum and sigmoid colon), assessment of gastric accommodation
      and emptying using transabdominal ultrasound, vagal activity, and functional and structural
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, will be carried out. A subgroup of 60 patients
      with IBS-D will be further included in a 12-week low Fermentable Oligo-, Di-,
      Mono-saccharides And Polyols (FODMAP) dietary intervention-study to determine short and
      long-term effects of diet on symptoms, microbiota composition, molecular GI signatures,
      cognition and behavioural traits, and structural and functional brain signatures. Deep
      machine learning, prediction tools and big data analysis will be used for multivariate
      analysis allowing disease stratification and diagnostic biomarker detection.
