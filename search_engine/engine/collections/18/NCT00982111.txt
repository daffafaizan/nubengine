    
      Multinational, randomized, multicenter, open-label Phase 3 study of 633 participants with
      advanced, nonsquamous (Stage IV) NSCLC. Participants will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to
      receive first-line necitumumab plus chemotherapy consisting of pemetrexed and cisplatin in
      study Arm A, or first-line pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy alone in Arm B.

      Baseline radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 21 days prior to
      randomization (first treatment will be administered within 7 days following randomization).

      Participants will undergo radiographic assessment (computed tomography or magnetic resonance
      imaging) of disease status every 6 weeks (± 3 days), until there is radiographic
      documentation of progressive disease (PD). Chemotherapy will continue for a maximum of six
      cycles in each arm (Or until there is radiographic documentation of PD, toxicity requiring
      cessation, protocol noncompliance or withdrawal of consent); participants in Arm A only will
      continue to receive necitumumab until there is radiographic documentation of PD, toxicity
      requiring cessation, protocol noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent.

      After the end-of-study-visit (following PD), follow-up information regarding further
      anticancer treatment and survival will be collected every 2 months (± 7 days). For
      participants who discontinue study for reasons other than PD (eg, symptomatic deterioration),
      information on disease progression will also be collected until PD is documented. Follow-up
      will continue as long as the participant is alive, or until the end of the trial.
