      antibiotic rotation is that intermittently changing antibiotic classes will reduce the
      ecological selective pressure that drives the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

      This study compares the effect of 2 types of antibiotic rotation on Gram-negative
      colonisation in the ICU and also compares both interventions with standard care.

      The two interventions apply to the empiric treatment and are: 1) "fast" rotation, i.e. every
      other patient another class and 2) "slow" rotation, i.e. every other 1.5month another
      preferred class for empiric Gram-negative antibiotic therapy.
