    
      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II trial. Eligible patients must have histological or
      clinical diagnosis of HCC, advanced tumors that are not amenable to loco-regional therapy,
      documented progression with or intolerance to sorafenib-based treatment or other
      anti-angiogenic therapy as first-line therapy for advanced HCC, ECOG performance status 0 or
      1, Child-Pugh class A liver function, and measurable tumors (by RECIST 1.1). All enrolled
      patients will receive lenalidomide, starting at 25 mg orally daily on days 1-21, every 4
      weeks. Lenalidomide treatment will continue until objective disease progression, development
      of unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary discontinuation. Dose titration will be done according
      to the severity of adverse events. Tumor assessment will be done after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of
      treatment and every 8 weeks thereafter until objective disease progression. All patients will
      receive DCE-MRI at baseline, on day 3 ± 1 day, and on day 14 ± 2 days. The primary endpoint
      is the percentage of patients who are tumor progression-free (according to RECIST 1.1) at 6
      months after lenalidomide treatment. It is estimated that in the 2nd-line setting, 20% or
      less patients will remain progression-free at 6 months with current treatment, i.e., no
      standard treatment. Lenalidomide will be considered effective if the percentage of patients
      who remain progression-free at 6 months can be increased to 40%. With type I and type II
      errors of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, 50 evaluable patients, i.e., patients who receive at
      least 4 weeks of study medication and receive the first scheduled assessment of tumor
      response, will be required and the planned sample size will be 55 patients, assuming a 10%
      dropout rate. The study is expected to complete in 2 years.
