    
      The clinical trial is designed as a prospective, multi-centre, double-blind, randomised,
      controlled, interventional trial to investigate whether a therapy with i.v. iron (iron
      carboxymaltose) compared to saline can improve functional status across a subset of
      cardiovascular disease -namely acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and heart
      failure with reduced ejection fraction.

      Iron administration will be carried out according to summary of product characteristics.
      Bolus administration (1000 mg) will be followed by an optional administration of 500-1000 mg
      within the first 4 weeks (up to a total of 2000 mg which is in-label) according to approved
      dosing rules, followed by administration of 500 mg iron carboxymaltose (over 15 minutes),
      except when haemoglobin is > 16.0 g/dL or ferritin is > 600 Âµg/L.
