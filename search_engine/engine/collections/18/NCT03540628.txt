      CHEST to determine mortality reduction in septic shock with thiamine (vitamin B1), vitamin C
      and hydrocortisone supplementation. The second aim is to determine whether supplementation
      with thiamine, vitamin C and hydrocortisone reduce time spent on vasopressor support.
      Thirdly, whether the trajectory of the SOFA score is affected by supplementation with
      thiamine, hydrocortisone and vitamin C. Fourthly, assess the trajectory of procalcitonin, a
      laboratory test, in patients treated with the protocol.

      This is a single center community based hospital in Southwest Michigan, investigator blinded,
      randomized placebo controlled trial, 24 month, parallel group, two arm, superiority study
      with a 1:1 allocation ratio to compare the efficacy of thiamine, vitamin C and hydrocortisone
      in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. Each arm of the research study will
      contain 30 patients in order to detect a 25% mortality reduction. Enrollment for this study
      will be initiated in patients with septic shock that require addition of a second pressor
      agent. The control arm of our randomized trial will receive a second pressor agent,
      hydrocortisone and standard of care. If the patient needs additional pressor support or
      therapy, that will be recorded in the results.

      The experimental arm will receive a second pressor agent and hydrocortisone, plus thiamine
      and vitamin C along with the standard of care. If the patient needs additional pressor
      support or therapy that will be recorded in the results.

      To clarify, both arms will utilize two vasopressor agents, hydrocortisone and supportive
      care, the experimental group will also receive vitamin C and thiamine.
