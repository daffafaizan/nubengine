      woman during the first trimester conducted among 12 medical centers in China. The medical
      history of each candidate was recorded , blood pressure was measured , blood sample was taken
      between 11 gestational weeks and 13+6 gestational weeks, to get the PlGF and PAPPA tested.
      Routine ultrasound was taken with measurement of the uterine artery pulsatility index. The
      results of the recruited patients were not released to the patients or the doctor. Pregnancy
      outcome was recorded as to whether the women develop preeclampsia , the SGA babies, or low
      birth Apgar score and other preeclampsia related adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The
      basic medical information, the mean artery pressure, the PlGF and PAPPA MOM, the UtA PI were
      used in combination to do the risk stratification, and to develop prediction model for
      Chinese people.
