      recommended by professional societies. However, there are no data investigating whether the
      addition and/or continuation of 5-aminosalicylic agents as combination therapy with systemic
      corticosteroids is superior to corticosteroids alone in patients with moderate-severe active
      UC. Thus, in practical terms, the decision regarding 5-aminosalicylic (to add or continue),
      on top of steroids treatment, is taken on an arbitrary basis. The aim of this study is to
      compare the efficacy of steroids alone Vs combination of steroids + 5-aminosalicylic in the
      treatment of moderate-severe UC exacerbation.
