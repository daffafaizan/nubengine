      methylphenidate (MPH). The clinical advantages offered by this novel compound go beyond ease
      of administration. By avoiding the peaks and valleys of serum levels associated with IR MPH,
      treatment with Concerta minimizes adverse effects at peaks and break through symptoms at
      valleys securing clinical coverage throughout the day, minimizing the risks of adverse
      effects from serum fluctuations that can occur with multiple dosing of the IR formulation of
      MPH. This unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Concerta is potentially
      particularly advantageous in the treatment of adults with ADHD because a) adults with ADHD
      tend to be forgetful; b) forgetfulness makes the self administration of treatment three times
      a day difficult; c) forgetfulness can lead to poor compliance and drop off of effects over
      time with its attendant detrimental effect on clinical control and quality of life. Subjects
      will be randomized by the pharmacy to CONCERTA or to continue MPH IR TID in a ratio of 4:1.

      This study includes: 1) a six-week design to document the response rate 2) assessment of the
      impact of either MPH IR or Concerta on functional capacities 3) careful assessment of safety
      and tolerability
