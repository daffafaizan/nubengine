      increase the capacity of general recreation providers, investigators developed a recreational
      swim program for children with ASD. The purpose of this program is to provide swimming and
      water safety instruction for children with ASD. A secondary purpose is to train general
      recreation providers and swim instructors to meet the unique needs of children. Research of
      this program includes investigating the effects of swimming on health outcomes (i.e.,
      fitness, BMI) of children with ASD. SSS lessons are provided in eight week sessions six times
      per year. Lessons are individualized according to the child's sensory preferences (as
      measured by the Sensory Profile). Instructors use evidence-based teaching methods (i.e.,
      visual supports, demonstration, peer and video modelling, sensory modifications) to teach
      swimming and water safety skills. Children may enroll for as many sessions as desired.
      Research includes retrospective review of program records.
