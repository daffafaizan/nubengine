      malignancy, immune deficiency, and other fatal illnesses. Circadian cycles, metabolism, and
      nutrition are intimately linked, and the timing of meals play an important role in
      synchronizing peripheral circadian rhythms; however, the standard of care for HSCT recipients
      is to deliver continuous feeds (either enterally or parenterally).

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of the timing of feeding on sleep
      and metabolism in HSCT subjects. The investigators hypothesize patients receiving feeds
      during daytime hours (0800-2000) in comparison to continuous (24 hours), will have improved
      sleep efficiency, decreased blood glucose, insulin, and triglycerides over patients who
      receive feeding overnight. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of the timing
      of feeds on sleep, metabolism, and outcomes in HSCT subjects.
