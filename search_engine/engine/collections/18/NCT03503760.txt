      true ELF therapy of 1 hour, following the antinflammatory, analgesic and biorhythm settings
      of the device "LIMFA TherapyÂ®". The sham-true group patients received 6 twice a week sessions
      of sham therapy (no therapy).

      During the second part of the protocol, the true-sham group received the sham therapy twice a
      week for 3 weeks and the sham-true group received the actual true therapy twice a week for 3
      weeks.

      For the assessment of pain, sleep quality and global quality of life, a set of questionnaires
      were administrated at specific stages of the protocol. Questionnaires were administrated
      every three weeks: before the first therapy, after the first course of therapy, after the
      washout period, after the second course of therapy, and 3 weeks after the end of treatment.
