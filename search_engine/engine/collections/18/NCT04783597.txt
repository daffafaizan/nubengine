      pressure, blood biomarkers, and uterine artery Doppler indices, have, at best, moderate
      predictive properties. While maternal symptoms often resolve with the delivery of the
      placenta, the burden of PE extends beyond pregnancy; afflicted women are at 3.1-fold
      increased odds of developing hypertension and 2.3-fold increased odds for cardiovascular
      disease later in life compared to women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Placental pathogenic
      changes associated with PE occur weeks to months before clinical manifestations develop,
      presenting a window of opportunity to identify early those women who will develop PE. The
      goal of the study investigators is to capitalize on this window and develop strategies for
      early prediction of PE.

      As a composite measure of vascular health, measurement of arterial stiffness and wave
      reflection could represent a promising non-invasive tool for PE prediction. This
      multi-national 5-year observational prospective study aims to recruit 2400 participants
      across 8 sites in Canada, the US, and the UK. Participants will undergo 2 assessments, one in
      the first trimester (10 - 13 weeks gestation) and one in the second trimester (18 - 21 weeks
      gestation), which involve vascular measurements (arterial stiffness, blood pressure), blood
      sample collection, psychosocial and demographic questionnaires, and Uterine Artery Doppler
      imaging (only at second visit). Post-natal outcome measurements will be collected via medical
      charts for each participant 6-8 weeks post-partum. The primary objective of the study is to
      determine if, and to what extent, arterial stiffness and wave reflection parameters improve
      early prediction of PE beyond that achieved by currently available predictors in high-risk
      pregnancies.
