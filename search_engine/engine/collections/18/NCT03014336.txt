      with current chemical CO2 absorbers in anesthesia.

      memsorb uses patented advanced medical membrane technology to filter CO2 from anesthetic
      circuits rather than absorbing via a chemical reaction.

      This game changing technology relies on a polymeric membrane core (similar to the ones used
      in oxygenators for cardiac surgery) that selectively allows CO2 to leave the rebreathing
      system, while maintaining the anesthetic vapor in the circuit.

      memsorb is a cartridge similar in size and shape to current solutions that simply clicks in
      place.
