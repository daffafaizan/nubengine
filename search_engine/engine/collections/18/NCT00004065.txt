        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
           (17-AAG) in patients with refractory or advanced solid tumors or hematologic
           malignancies.

        -  Evaluate the effects of this drug on the expression of signaling proteins present on an
           individual patient's cancer at the start of treatment and, if possible, post treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a two-phase, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease (chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] or Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]+
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] vs solid tumor).

      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 60-90 minutes
      twice weekly. Courses repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression (after at
      least 2 courses for CML or Ph+ ALL patients) or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Accelerated phase: Single patients receive escalating dose levels of 17-AAG until one
           patient experiences a first course grade 3 or greater toxicity or two different patients
           experience grade 2 toxicity during any course.

        -  Standard phase: Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of
           17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
           dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
           toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 51 patients will be accrued for this study.
