      echocardiographic exam: parasternal short-axis (PSAX), parasternal long-axis (PLAX), apical
      4/5-chambers views. PSAX, the traditional approach, along with the PLAX, and the apical
      4/5-chambers views.

      A hallmark of CAA was considered the absence of a proper visualization of the origin of the
      coronary arteries from the aortic root. In addition, the presence of the ring sign,
      visualized from the PLAX was considered as abnormal. This sign is of interest when an
      aberrant left or right CAA is suspected. A coronary artery originating from the contralateral
      aortic sinus, along its intramural course, crosses the mid-anterior line of the circular
      aorta to reach the sinus of Valsalva of its intended origin. Consequently, its cross-section
      should be visible in an orthogonal view traversing the mid-long axis of the aorta, namely the
      parasternal long-axis view.
