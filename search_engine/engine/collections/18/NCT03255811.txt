      chemotherapy regimen for advanced gastric cancer. Second-line therapy usually involves
      first-line treatment, without the use of drugs for combination or monotherapy, and no uniform
      treatment. Apatinib approved provides a good solution to this problem, but this study is in
      limit of validity standard after all into the row, not very good reaction in clinical
      practice for APA imatinib reality in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. Therefore, it
      is necessary to make a prospective product study to understand the gap between clinical
      practice and research results. This study can evaluate apatinib in treatment of advanced
      gastric or gastroesophageal junction safe and effective parts of adenocarcinoma in clinical
      practice, and the specific usage (such as dose and period). The results of this study can
      help the future clinical practice specification of apatinib parts for the treatment of
      adenocarcinoma with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal reflux, the advanced gastric or
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma patients with parts get treatment more safe and effective in
      the treatment of.

      At present, apatinib was approved for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer after
      second-line or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, is in the second one, experience of
      medication, clinical data, no chemotherapy so now intends to carry out 40 cases of small
      sample exploratory research, in the conventional chemotherapy after the onset, with APA for
      Nigeria maintenance treatment, with a preliminary understanding of apatinib in first-line
      advanced gastric cancer to maintain the efficacy and safety of the treatment, and explore the
      feasibility of anti generate small molecule targeted therapy in advanced gastric cancer
      vascular pattern.
