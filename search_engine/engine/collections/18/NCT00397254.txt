      burden of disease across attacks in the form of increased attack frequency, severity,
      duration, and/or treatability. If this perception is true, more effective treatment decreases
      the burden of disease across attacks. There are multiple barriers to effective treatment. The
      triptan class of migraine medications is frequently dispensed in the context of health
      benefit plan formulary limitations. Because of limited supply, medications must be used very
      cautiously. Patients may hoard medication in reaction to fear of running out. Overly cautious
      use and hoarding may lead to greater disease burden.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of two allocations of rizatriptan - a more
      limited allocation ("Formulary Limit") vs. a less limited allocation ("Clinical Limit") on
      disease burden.
