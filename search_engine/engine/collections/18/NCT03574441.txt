      catheter dressing systems in laboring patients.

      Secondary aims: To compare the effect of different degrees of obesity measured by BMI, on
      epidural catheter migration and quality and failure of epidural labor analgesia. To evaluate
      the effect of time an indwelling catheter remains in place, level of insertion and patient's
      height on epidural catheter migration.

      Hypothesis: The use of dressing with transparent TegadermTM plus catheter support pad
      dressing is superior to the dressing with TegadermTM plus Steri-StripTM bands, and to a
      dressing with TegadermTM only, for epidural catheter fixation in laboring obese and morbidly
      obese patients, in terms of catheter migration. epidural quality and failure and epidural
      catheter replacement in the labor analgesia setting.
