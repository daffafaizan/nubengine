      problems the anesthetist has to deal with. It seems sensible that individualized volume
      management and hydration therapy during the operation and during the stay at the intensive
      care unit could improve perfusion of the transplanted organ resulting in a better transplant
      function. Aim of this study is to investigate the impact of a goal directed hemodynamic
      management on incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) after renal transplant surgery.

      Therefore patients will be randomized in one of two groups, the PiCCO group with goal
      directed hemodynamic management during operation and during the ICU-stay and the control
      group with hemodynamic management performed according to heart rate, blood pressure and
      central venous pressure.
