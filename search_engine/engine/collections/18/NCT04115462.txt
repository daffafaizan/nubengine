      acute pain conditions. However, while opioids are effective analgesics for acute pain, they
      are well-known to frequently cause itch (pruritus) as a side effect according with the two
      hypotheses stated above. So far, these two hypotheses have never been tested in humans.The
      present study describes a proposed study design for the purpose of confirming these two
      hypotheses in parallel in human subjects.

      Primary endpoints of the study:

      To evaluate changes itch and pain perception, and superficial perfusion after each itch
      provocations.

      Secondary endpoints of the study:

      To evaluate the existence of a correlation between itch sensitization and analgesic efficacy.
