      cancer women patients in China are over 45 years old. Chemotherapy is one of the important
      treatments for breast cancer, but it brings a series of adverse effects, especially
      increasing the risk of hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis in
      postmenopausal women. It is a multicenter prospective observational study. The postmenopausal
      breast cancer women patients who are planning adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy are
      enrolled in the study after signing the informed consent form and passing the screening. We
      collect the basic information, medical history, chemotherapy-related adverse reactions, and
      the results of blood lipid and bone density test before, during and after chemotherapy. The
      purpose of the study is to investigate the risk factors for hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular
      disease, and osteoporosis in postmenopausal breast cancer patients before and after
      chemotherapy, and to assess the risk of future arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease and
      osteoporotic fractures in this population.In addition, the collected information of the
      subjects are analyzed to provide suggestions for the relevant prevention strategy.
