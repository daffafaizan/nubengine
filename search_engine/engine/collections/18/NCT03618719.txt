      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on clinical basis are included. Healthy controls without OSA
      are enrolled, too. 15 cc peripheral venous blood is drawn on the date of diagnosis of OSA and
      3-6 months after CPAP therapy (not given to controls). Granulocytes are harvested and tested
      for its function, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and
      bacteria-killing ability.
