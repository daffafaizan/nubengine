      impact of a guided online ACT intervention on improving quality of life and psychological
      health in distressed family caregivers of people with dementia. After the baseline
      evaluation, eligible caregivers will receive 10 weekly ACT sessions, individually delivered
      by a licensed professional counselor online. Each session lasts for one hour. Primary outcome
      measures will be psychological distress measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale
      (DASS)- 21 and care-related quality of life measured by the Care-related Quality of Life
      instrument (CarerQol). A one-time interview at the completion of the 10 weekly sessions will
      be conducted to explore caregivers' experiences in the intervention.
