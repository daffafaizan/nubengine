      collection of data on the clinical history and prospective health of those affected by XLHED.
      The proposed natural history study will enroll male and female patients, ages 36 months and
      younger, who have a diagnosis of XLHED based on genetic testing and who have not received an
      investigational study drug. The study protocol will include collection of all relevant
      medical history and documentation of clinical outcomes using age-appropriate, minimally
      invasive technologies. Data will be collected both retrospectively, back to pregnancy
      assessments that may be available, and prospectively through age 5 yrs. Genotype-phenotype
      correlations in XLHED, based on well-documented health records and prospective assessments on
      genetically-confirmed individuals, may now provide new and clinically-predictive information
      for the benefit of patients, families, health care providers and clinical investigators
      designing trials for therapeutic interventions.
