    
      Single-center, prospective, open-label, not randomized, diagnostic phase II trial in the
      management of patients with prostate cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      additional diagnostic role of 18F- PSMA PET /CT (sensitivity) in patients with prostate
      cancer with biochemical relapse compared to other diagnostic methods routinely used. The
      primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of 18F-PSMA PET/CT defined as the ratio
      between the number of 18F-PSMA PET/CT positive patients and the number of prostate cancer
      patients with biochemical relapse and negative standard imaging.Patients enrolled in the
      study would benefit from a more accurate but above all earlier diagnosis of disease
      recurrence sites, thus being able to undergo targeted therapies, with a clear impact on the
      clinical management of the disease.
