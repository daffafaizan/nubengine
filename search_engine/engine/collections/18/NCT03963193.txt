      surgically resected is poor. The median overall survival (OS) is only 6-10 months, and the
      3-year survival rate is less than 10%. Among the neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive
      system, only pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor has a standard treatment strategy, and there is
      a lack of prospective clinical research data on other gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors.
      According to the chemotherapy regimen of small cell lung cancer, etoposide plus cisplatin or
      irinotecan plus cisplatin is the choice of rescue therapy for advanced non-surgical or
      metastatic neuroendocrine tumor G3 type. However, prospective studies are needed to confirm
      whether there are differences in efficacy and safety between the two chemotherapy regimens.
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and survival benefit of
      etoposide plus cisplatin and irinotecan plus cisplatin in first-line therapy of non-primary
      pancreatic metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor G3 type. In
      addition, the investigators will explore the resistance mechanisms of gastrointestinal
      neuroendocrine tumor G3, and screen out biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of
      chemotherapy.
