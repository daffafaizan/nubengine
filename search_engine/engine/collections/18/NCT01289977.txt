      dubosqui or Lu. lutzomyia controlled sand fly repeated feedings. At baseline a pheresis was
      done to collect baseline cells. Subjects received sand fly bites on a q2 week schedule for 2
      months followed by a q2 months schedule for one year. They had an option to extend for a late
      recall feeding at 18 months, when a skin biopsy was performed 48 hours after sand fly bites.
      Currently the study is fully enrolled and all human subject contact is complete. We
      (laboratory at NIAID) are studying the humoral, cellular immune responses using blood
      samples, and cytokine expression in the skin biopsy samples.
