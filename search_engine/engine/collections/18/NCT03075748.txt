    
      This study is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, single-arm study to evaluate the
      therapeutic benefit of the TAAA Debranching Stent Graft System. A total of 15 patients will
      be enrolled in the study.

        -  10 subjects total will be treated in the primary study arm

        -  5 subjects total will be treated in the expanded selection arm

      The duration of the Investigation is anticipated as follows:

        -  Time to Complete Enrollment: 24 months

        -  Subject Follow-up Time: 5 years from last subject enrollment

        -  Total Duration Time: 7 years

      The primary objective of the clinical investigation "Visceral Manifold Study for the repair
      of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms" is to assess the use of the TAAA Debranching Stent
      Graft System to repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in patients having appropriate
      anatomy. The primary intent of the study is to assess safety acutely (i.e. freedom from major
      adverse events (MAE) at 30 days) and preliminary effectiveness (i.e., treatment success and
      technical success) of the device acutely (i.e., the proportion of treatment group subjects
      that achieve and maintain treatment success at one year).

      Additionally, the study will assess technical success and treatment success at each follow-up
      interval.
