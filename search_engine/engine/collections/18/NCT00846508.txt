      Primary Objectives:

      •To examine if low-risk, as defined by clinical and radiological parameters, stage IB-IIB
      cervical cancer patients treated by cisplatin-based CCRT have greater toxicities but similar
      survival rate as those treated by RT alone.

      Secondary Objectives:

      •To conduct a translational research to find out the molecular markers associated with
      radiosensitivity and distant metastasis in cervical cancer patients.

      104 cases for each arm.(total 208 cases)

      Radiotherapy will start within 3 weeks of randomization.

      Chemotherapy:

      Cisplatin 40mg/M2 IV infusion weekly concurrently with radiotherapy, up to 6 courses.

      Investigation during treatment (for patients on both arms)

        1. . Hematology: A complete blood count is required at weekly intervals.

        2. . Renal function: Serum creatinine is required before each course of CT.

        3. . Body weight and performance status: will be evaluated on the day of weekly visit on
           radiotherapy clinics. Performance status is graded by ECOG scale.

        4. . Quality of life assessment: assess by EORTC-C30 & CX28 scales at pre-RT, 3-4 weeks and
           6-7 weeks during RT.

      Investigation during follow-up:

      When radiotherapy (RT) treatment is completed, patients will be followed up as out-patients
      basis. The first visit will be within 2 months after last RT. For patients whose tumor does
      not regress completely at the end of RT, monthly follow-up for at least 3 months or to the
      time of complete regression is recommended. After first follow-up or time of compete
      regression of tumor, patients will be followed up at 3-monthly intervals for 2 years,
      4-monthly for one year, then 6-monthly.

      Quality of life assessment: assess by EORTC-C30 & CX28 scales at 2 months, 4-5 months after
      RT, then q 6 months x 2 and yearly for another 2 years.

      Dosage modification and toxicity Toxicity must be recorded at each attendance for
      chemotherapy and monthly during radiotherapy on the "on study form".

        1. . Hematological toxicity: ANC < 1500 /mm3 and/or platelet < 100,000 /mm3 prior to
           chemotherapy will require one week delay in treatment until these levels have been
           reached. If the parameters are still below requirements 1 week later, administration of
           chemotherapy could still be proceeded if 1000 <ANC < 1500 /mm3, platelet > 50,000 /mm3
           at reduced dose (25% off).

           Radiotherapy will not be delayed unless severe infection or a white count less than
           1000/mm3

        2. . Renal toxicity:

           a). Cisplatin: Serum creatinine < 1.5 mg% (creatinine clearance > 70 ml/min): full dose;
           1.6-1.9 mg% (or 0.6-0.8 mg% above base line, or Ccr 50-70 ml/min): 25% off; > 2.0 mg%
           (or > 1.2 mg% over baseline or 50% decrease of Ccr): no cisplatin

        3. . Neurotoxicity: Cisplatin discontinued on Grade 3 neuropathy. 30% dose decrease for
           Grade 2 neurotoxicity or ototoxicity

        4. . Ototoxicity: Ototoxicity is rare within 4 -6 courses or cisplatin, but if clinical
           significant deterioration of hearing loss (grade 3) was noted, cisplatin will be
           discontinued. The aged are more susceptible to ototoxicity.

        5. . Genitourinary complications Urinary tract infection or radiation cystitis may be noted
           during the course of treatment, CT or CT+RT will be withheld in case of grade 3 toxicity

        6. Gastroenterological toxicity:

      Acute radiation enteritis may prelude continuation or delay either CT or CT+RT
