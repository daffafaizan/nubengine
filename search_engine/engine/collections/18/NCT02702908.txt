      overall survival among mPC and mCRPC patients not treated with radium-223-dichloride. The
      source of data for this study will be the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database
      (GePaRD). A retrospective cohort study covering the time period from 2004 to 2013 will be
      conducted. The study population will comprise CRPC patients developing bone metastases. These
      patients will be followed up for the occurrence of second primary malignancies, end of study,
      or death due to any cause. As this study serves as a historical control group for a
      single-arm observational study, incidence rates of second primary malignancies obtained from
      these studies will be compared by the standardized incidence ratio using results from this
      study as a reference.
