      to research and develop a biofeedback embedded tank-top for AIS. As a result, this will
      reduce the future likelihood of brace wear or surgery.

      In this study, the eligible subjects will be given tailor-made biofeedback tank-top to wear
      it 8 hours daily. Monitor, observation and additional posture training sessions will be
      provided during the 6 months wearing period. The effectiveness of the biofeedback tank-top
      will be evaluated by pre-and post- treatment ultrasonic imaging device (for measuring the
      angle of the spine), electromyography muscle signal assessment and clinical photographs
      assessment.
