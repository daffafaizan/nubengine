    
      The secondary objectives are to compare between the 2 arms:

        -  exacerbation rates according to their severity (observed throughout the duration of the
           study);

        -  the evolution of the symptoms, the rheology of the sputum, and the pulmonary function
           (measurements repeated every three months);

        -  medication consumption and adverse events (monitored throughout the duration of the
           study);

        -  patient trajectories during follow-up;

        -  the overall clinical improvement at the end of the study and the evolution of the
           quality of life (measurements repeated every 3 months);

        -  the change in biomarkers of interest (baseline versus end of study).
