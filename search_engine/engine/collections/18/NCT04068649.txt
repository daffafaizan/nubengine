    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess patient-reported pain response and quality of life (QoL) in patients randomized
      to either single-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or non-SBRT palliative
      radiation therapy for metastatic disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare overall survival for patients undergoing single fraction SBRT versus non-SBRT
      palliative radiation therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess for changes in immune markers. II. Assess toxicity related to radiation treatment.
      III. Assess change in frailty index and cognitive function over time in patients undergoing
      treatment for metastatic cancer.

      IV. Evaluate the effect of circadian rhythm and radiation treatment time on outcomes.

      V. Assess the utility of the Pain Catastrophizing Index in patients undergoing radiation
      treatment for metastatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo 1, 3-5, 5-6, or 10 fractions of palliative radiation therapy (RT)
      deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

      ARM II: Patients undergo single fraction SBRT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients may be followed up at 5 and 12 weeks.
