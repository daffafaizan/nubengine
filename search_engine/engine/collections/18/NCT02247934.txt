      conducted. The aims of the concept elicitation interviews are to:

        1. Identify the most common symptoms, as well as the most important symptoms, for patients
           with PSC, and

        2. Assess whether these symptoms impact day-to-day functioning

      An instrument will be developed based on the symptoms reported and in Step II of the study,
      the performance of the instrument will be assessed with further interviews.
