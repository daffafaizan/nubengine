      sensor connected to a finger. Our results from 2 recent studies undertaken with this device
      concluded: 1) that it is not always accurate when the finger is cold such as during surgical
      blood loss, and 2) a local nerve block to the finger improved the finger temperature and the
      accuracy of the device.

      Our purpose is to investigate the duration of effect of two local nerve blocking drugs
      (lidocaine and bupivacaine - both FDA approved drugs in routine use) in a finger on each
      hand. Having a better understanding of how long the nerve block lasts could help determine
      when an additional block might be necessary to maintain the accuracy of the device during
      surgical blood loss.

      We previously listed the primary outcome for this study as the time until return to baseline
      finger temperature. However, in blinded looks at the data it became clear that defining time
      until return to baseline from the serial temperature measurements in an objective fashion
      would be extremely difficult and potentially controversial. We have modified the primary
      outcome to be the change in the average temperature from baseline to post-intervention.
