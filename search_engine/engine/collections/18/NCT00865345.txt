      commercialization as part of the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) on June 15, 1999
      (PMA 980022). The Sensor is composed of a microelectrode with a thin coating of glucose
      oxidase beneath several layers of biocompatible membrane. This same sensor is used as part of
      the Guardian REAL-Time System, the latest advance in continuous glucose monitoring, which is
      based on the CGMS. Similar to the CGMS, the Guardian REAL-Time System has been developed for
      use in conjunction with a standard home blood glucose meter. The Guardian REAL-Time received
      regulatory approval from the FDA in 2006.

      As currently used, the Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor is labeled for a maximum use duration of
      72 hours, using only the abdomen area as an insertion site. Recent studies have shown that
      the useful sensor life could extend beyond three days, and it is reasonable to expect a
      significant percentage of sensors to last six days. It is the goal of this study to confirm
      sensor performance accuracy data from one of these recent studies. The sensor is also
      commonly worn in body areas other than the abdomen (such as the buttock). This study will
      also demonstrate sensor accuracy when used in an alternate site.
