      21st century health emergencies.

      DM2 is the most frequent form of diabetes, accounting for 90% of all cases of this chronic
      condition. If this trend continues, by 2045 about 693 million people will have diabetes.

      People with chronic diseases have changing perspectives, in addition to suffering physical
      alterations, their psychological, emotional and social state is also compromised, presenting
      themselves as a need to modify lifestyle to improve prognosis, facing alterations in the
      ability to socialize and with death or a great loss. Few studies comprehensively address
      these dimensions.

      The literature reports that DM2 self-control has a direct effect in improving clinical
      results, reducing complications and quality of life. Therefore, the patient must make
      multiple decisions every day regarding diet, physical activity, glucose control, and
      medication compliance.

      However, intervention studies that seek to improve self-management behaviors in people with
      DM2 are characterized by emphasizing the transmission of knowledge and establishing
      compliance with prescribed treatments, but they do not address social and emotional elements
      such as social support. Additionally, most of these interventions do not show the use of
      theoretical models that provide explanations of human responses to disease and other
      phenomena important to practice.

      Studies using the Nursing Outcomes Classification to assess the effect of social support
      interventions are scarce.
