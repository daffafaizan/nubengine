      associated with lower risk of awareness of prolapse, repeat surgery for prolapse and
      dyspareunia than a variety of vaginal interventions. However, these trials weren't
      statistically significant and have focused on the effects in terms of anatomy and lacked the
      effect on functional outcomes, the quality of life, perioperative complications and the
      operative duration.

      In this study, We hypothesize that prolonged operative duration will be associated with a
      greater risk of developing complications and so may guide us to a minimally invasive approach
      with better functional outcomes.
