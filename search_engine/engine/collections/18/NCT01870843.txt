      prospective (a study in which the participants are identified and then followed forward in
      time for the outcome of the study), single-arm (all participants receiving one intervention)
      study. Approximately 260 participants will be enrolled in this study. This study consists of
      two phases: screening phase and treatment phase. In the treatment phase, participants will
      receive escitalopram for 8 weeks: escitalopram 10 mg per day for 1 week and then the dose of
      escitalopram will be flexibly adjusted up to maximum of 20 mg per day for the next 7 weeks,
      based on the investigator's clinical judgment. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical
      examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The total study duration will be
      approximately 2 years.
