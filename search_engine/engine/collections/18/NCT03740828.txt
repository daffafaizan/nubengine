      study was performed as a single arm, multicenter clinical study conducted at six sites in the
      United States. This was a non-interventional clinical study where the KIDScore D3 was not
      used during patient treatment. Briefly, the purpose of the study was to collect data to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the KIDScore D3's ability to predict which embryos
      are most likely to develop to blastocyst stage. This was evaluated by using the KIDScore D3
      as adjunct information to traditional morphological grading. Imaging data was collected on
      embryos cultured to day 5. Embryologists were masked to imaging data and evaluation was only
      based on morphology and KIDScore D3 scores.

      This study aims at analyzing the utilization of established morphology methods with adjunct
      outcome of an algorithm (KIDScore D3) that provides a score (1 - 5) from timings of
      morphokinetic events.

      A double-blinded, multi-center study, designed to evaluate the odds ratios and other measures
      for outcomes of methodologies used for embryo assessment: day 3 morphology alone and day 3
      morphology with KIDScore D3 results as adjunct information.
