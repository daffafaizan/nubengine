      disease occurred at a rate of 1.5-2 per 1,000 live births. Antibiotic treatment for GBS
      colonized women according to guideline recommended by the American College of Obstetricians
      and Gynecologists (ACOG) decreases the risk for early onset neonatal GBS infection 10 fold.
      Unfortunately, many eligible women don't receive the full treatment protocol. Although the
      rate of early onset infection is low, the newborns of group B strep positive women who do not
      receive the recommended preventative antibiotics must undergo testing and extended
      observation.

      This study will determine the level of antibiotics in the umbilical vein cord blood of
      newborn infants after the administration of penicillin orally while in labor and compare
      these levels to levels of penicillin in the umbilical vein cord blood of patients treated
      with intravenous penicillin in labor. Comparisons will be done through literature only; there
      will be no intravenous penicillin administration arm of the study.
