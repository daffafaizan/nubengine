      (mHealth) intervention to replace and break-up sedentary time with intermittent bouts of
      light physical activity. The intervention uses an electronic activity monitor ("Jawbone UP2";
      worn on the wrist) that pairs with a mobile app, which together promote awareness and enable
      self-monitoring of both physical activity (steps per day) and inactivity (wristband gently
      vibrates after a specified time of inactivity). Pre-post intervention change in objective,
      subjective, and biologic data will be compared between groups.
