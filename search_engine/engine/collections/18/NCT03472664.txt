      compared with an American Heart Association Diet (AHAD - a regimen that has been shown to
      reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease). We will investigate diet effects on AD
      biomarkers, on cognition, and on neuroimaging measures of blood flow. Our study will extend
      previous findings in several important ways by: 1) using a Modified Mediterranean-Ketogenic
      Diet rather than a traditional Ketogenic Diet, which has the potential for greater long-term
      compliance and health benefits; 2) increasing the sample size and duration of the diet
      intervention; 3) examining potential mechanisms of diet effects that may result in new
      biomarkers and therapeutic targets; and 4) examining key treatment response variables such as
      Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, amyloid positivity and metabolic status that could inform
      precision medicine approaches to dietary prescription.

      Adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will be randomized on a 1:1 schedule to
      receive either a 4-month Modified Mediterranean-Ketogenic Diet (MMKD) or American Heart
      Association Diet (AHAD) intervention. Diet interventions will be equicaloric with
      participants' normal diets. Personalized nutritional guidance and menus will be provided, and
      compliance will be assessed by a registered dietitian. The principal investigator will be
      responsible for the overall monitoring of the data and safety of study participants, with
      assistance by members of the study staff, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB),
      which will be responsible for monitoring the safety of research participants.
