      of the Restora Steroid Eluting spacer compared to a Silastic spacer.

      At the completion of their procedure, patients undergoing ESS will receive one steroid
      eluting spacer placed into the surgical site on one side, and one spacer without drug placed
      on the other side. Patients will return for standard post-op visits. Between post-op day 6
      and 8, both spacers will be removed. Patients will again be seen on post-op day 35 and 90 to
      evaluate the surgical sites with respect to healing, scarring, infection, degree of
      inflammation, polyp formation, and the need for secondary intervention. Data from the two
      sides will be compared to determine if there is a benefit derived from the spacer with
      steroid vs the one without.
