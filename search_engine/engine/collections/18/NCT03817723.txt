      examinations were performed at the Central Finland Central Hospital. In this study we
      included 353 cholangiographies, that were performed with our c-arm equipment not exceeding 10
      years of age in the beginning of 2016. The main measures of outcome were the recorded
      radiation dose data of c-arm systems from our manual database .

      Another 25 cases were excluded because it was not possible to cross-check the manually
      recorded radiation dose data from the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS ).
      Additional 4 patients who underwent intraoperative endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were removed from the radiation exposure analysis because IOC
      and ERCP were performed consequently with the same c-arm and the radiation exposure of IOC
      could not be separated from the registered total KAP and FT. Thus the final analysis
      consisted of 324 IOCs. KAP (Kerma area product) is the product of air Kerma in the center of
      the imaging area multiplied with size of the imaging area. For simplicity we have unified
      varying units received from different c-arms and will only use Gray multiplied by square
      centimeters (Gycm2 ). KAP values were measured using inbuilt ionization chambers in c-arms.
      For this study we collected the KAP values from exposure and pulsed fluoroscopy. We also
      recorded the fluoroscopy time (s).

      Laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed both by residents and specialist surgeons.

      Ethics: No ethical approval or written informed consent were needed because the study was
      retrospective in nature. The study was approved by the hospital administration.
