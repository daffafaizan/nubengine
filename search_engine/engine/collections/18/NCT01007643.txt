      adults. Symptoms can be chronic in nature and interfere with sporting activity and activities
      of daily living. Current treatment consists of home exercises to increase muscular strength
      and flexibility. Adolescents are known to have poor compliance with treatments for chronic
      illnesses.

      There is a paucity of published literature surrounding the Wii TM Interactive Video Game.
      There has been one published report of the use of Wii Fit TM in rehabilitation where
      participants used the Wii Fit TM to train proprioception after ankle injury. Individuals that
      participated in the Wii Fit TM group found improvement in their balance on objective measures
      as well as increased enjoyment with their treatment plan. One anecdotal report used the Wii
      TM video game in physiotherapy treatments of a college athlete and found a dramatic increase
      in attendance compliance after introduction of the video game.

      This randomized controlled study will determine if using the Wii Fit TM for home exercise
      completion will increase compliance and subsequently improve symptoms related to
      patellofemoral syndrome in adolescent females.
