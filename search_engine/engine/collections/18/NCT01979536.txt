    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability of brentuximab vedotin given in combination with standard
      chemotherapy (anaplastic large cell lymphoma [ALCL]99) and to determine the tolerability of
      crizotinib given in combination with chemotherapy (ALCL99).

      II. To estimate the event free survival (EFS) of Arm brentuximab vedotin (BV) and Arm
      crizotinib (CZ) and contrast these to historical control data.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the prognostic significance of minimal disseminated disease (MDD) at
      diagnosis and minimal residual disease (MRD) as measured by real-time (RT)-polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned or randomized into 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM BV:

      COURSE A (COURSES 1, 3, AND 5): Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over
      30 minutes on day 1, dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV on days 1-5,
      ifosfamide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5, methotrexate IV over 3 hours on day 1, cytarabine
      IV over 1-30 minutes every 12 hours for 4 doses on days 4 and 5, and etoposide IV over 2
      hours on days 4 and 5.

      COURSE B (COURSES 2, 4, AND 6): Patients receive brentuximab vedotin, dexamethasone, and
      methotrexate as in Arm BV, Course A. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 15-30
      minutes on days 1-5 and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 4 and 5.

      ARM CZ:

      COURSE A (COURSES 1, 3, AND 5): Patients receive crizotinib PO BID on days 1-21 and
      dexamethasone, ifosfamide, methotrexate, cytarabine, and etoposide as in Arm BV, Course A.

      COURSE B (COURSES 2, 4, AND 6): Patients receive crizotinib as in Arm CZ, Course A and
      dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and doxorubicin hydrochloride as in Arm BV,
      Course B.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48,
      and 60 months.
