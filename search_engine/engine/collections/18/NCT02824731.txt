      brain tumours using standard doses and standard combined chemotherapy protocols. Patients are
      assigned to the treatment groups by their own choice or availability of the treatment.
      Patients are stratified into 4 groups, (1) supratentorial grad III/ IV tumours without
      pre-irradiation; (2) supratentorial grade I/II tumours without pre-irradiation; (3)
      infratentorial tumours without pre-irradiation; (4) patients with pre-irradiation >40 Gy in
      the tumour area. Radiotherapy doses of 54-60 Gy(RBE) are applied in group 1-3 using normal
      fractionated schedules. In group 4, 30 Gy(RBE)/ 5 Gy(RBE) per fraction or 36 Gy(RBE) with 2
      Gy(RBE) per fraction are allowed. Primary endpoint is chronic toxicity and quality of life.
      The hypothesis of the trial is that the rate of chronic toxicity 1 year after the end of
      radiotherapy is 15% lower after proton compared to photon treatment. Events for chronic
      toxicity are toxicities observed later than 3 months after end of radiotherapy and scored
      CTC-AE4.0 >grade 2 or a decrease in Quality of life by >10% (EORTC-QLQ C30 and BN20) or a
      decrease in neuropsychological functioning by >10% (MoCa test). All statistical calculations
      apply to group (1), i.e. supratentorial grade II/IV tumours without pre-irradiation, all
      other arms are closed when group (1) is closed.
