    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Bavituximab as a treatment
      for any disease.

      The FDA has approved Temozolomide as a treatment option for this disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying how the combination of Bavituximab,
      Temozolomide, and radiation affects this cancer. The current standard care of treatment for
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma is the combination of Temozolomide and radiation. Temozolomide
      causes cell death and radiation shrinks and kills the cancer cells. Bavituximab may activate
      (cause) the immune system to attack the cancer cells as well as target tumor cells themselves
      to kill them.
