      between scrubs) and a conventional surgical gown for each of 4 surgeries. Sequence of
      treatments within the subjects will be randomized (ABBA, BAAB, AABB or BBAA), and determined
      using the PLAN procedure in SAS, such that each surgeon will wear vest and non-vest twice.
      The sequencing will not be shared with any study personnel. Allocation for each case will be
      concealed with a web-based system that will be accessed only shortly before surgery.

      The investigators will target an ambient temperature of 21°C ± 1°C, and try to maintain the
      same temperature of each of the four study cases for each surgeon. The CoolSource vest holds
      six reusable cooling packs located bilaterally on the shoulders, angled flank along the base
      of the rib cage, and along each side of the spine, mid-back. The vest will be donned over
      hospital-issued scrubs after all temperature sensing devices have been applied and before
      surgical hand scrubbing. The subjects will wear the vest throughout surgery, and for a few
      additional minutes while postoperative assessments are made (details below).

      The weight of the disposable cooling vest is 1 kg which is evenly distributed over both
      shoulders. The cooling packs have an insulated cover to reduce condensation or sweating while
      seated inside the vest pocket. The flexible frozen reusable cooling packs will be inserted
      into each of the six pockets and the vest belt will be tied to hold the cooling packs
      securely. The disposable cooling vests will be discarded after each case, and the cooling
      packs returned to a freezer.
