      fit into an in-patient rehabilitation schedule, and determine the effectiveness of the
      training protocol. This project consists of a randomized control trial (RCT) for manual
      wheelchair users (MWUs) that examines the number of manual wheelchair propulsion repetitions
      required to produce change. For the RCT, we will recruit twenty individuals who use manual
      wheelchairs as their primary means of mobility and who do not follow the recommended clinical
      guidelines for propulsion. Participants will be randomized into two independent groups: motor
      learning repetitions overground (Training Group; n =10), and general education on recommended
      propulsion techniques (Education Group; n =10). Demographics, cognition, shoulder strength,
      participation, and wheelchair seating may only be assessed at baseline. Participants then may
      be assessed from the kinematics of their wheelchair performance overground and on a motorized
      treadmill. Participants may be tested on their wheelchair propulsion techniques in and
      outside of the lab, upper extremity pain at baseline, post-intervention, and three-week
      follow-up; participants may also be asked qualitative questions regarding the intervention
      experience, the experience with the equipment and the laboratory research, the monitoring
      setting, and the general experience with the research study.

      The primary research question is that will repetition of proper propulsion technique
      practiced overground result in improved manual wheelchair propulsion biomechanics?
