    
      Patients are selected on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of diffuse esophageal spasm, based
      on endoscopy and manometry.

      This is a sham-controlled cross-over study of injection of botulinum toxin or saline, in
      randomized order, in the distal esophagus.

      All patients have undergone esophageal manometry which shows diffuse esophageal spasm, and a
      24h pH monitoring/manometry to quantify acid reflux. All drugs prescribed to affect
      esophageal motility (nitrates, calcium antagonists) are stopped during the study. After
      randomisation, the patient will undergo standard esophageal manometry to assess baseline
      esophageal motility. On the same day the patient will be asked to fill out a set of symptom
      questionnaires including a dysphagia questionnaire. At endoscopy, the active treatment group
      receives 8 x 12.5 units, each in 0.5 ml, of botulinum toxin A which will be injected in the
      four quadrants of the esophagus at 2 and 5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. In the
      Sham group 8 * 0.5 ml of physiologic serum will be injected. The randomisation will be
      performed at the endoscopy unit by a nurse otherwise not involved in the protocol.

      After 1 month a stationary manometry and a new esophageal pH/manometry monitoring will be
      performed, followed by a second endoscopy with injection of saline or botulinum toxin in a
      cross-over mode. At the time of the second endoscopy each patient will fill out a dysphagia
      questionnaire. One month later, the dysphagia questionnaire is repeated.

      Subsequently, follow-up will occur at the outpatient clinic after 6 and 12 months, with
      follow-up dysphagia questionnaires but no additional manometries or endoscopies, unless the
      clinical status deteriorates.
