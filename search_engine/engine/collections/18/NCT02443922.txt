    
      A three-year observational study to standardize the meal tolerance and maximal stimulation
      tests for measuring beta cell function in the clinical setting. It also aims to improve
      methods for the early prediction of the long-term response to an intervention and for
      identification of patients at risk for rapid beta cell function deterioration, thereby
      enabling future clinical studies that examine diabetes progression.

      The objective of this protocol is to establish the dynamic responsivity of the methods to
      treatment with glimerpiride or sitagliptin.
