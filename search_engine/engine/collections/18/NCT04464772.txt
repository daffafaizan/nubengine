    
      Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to six (6) clinical research sites in the United
      States. Subjects will wear two Sensors. Each Sensor will have a paired Reader that will be
      given to the subject. Subjects will be asked to perform at least 4 capillary Blood Glucose
      (BG) tests per day using the primary Reader.

      Interstitial glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained with the corresponding
      Readers immediately following each BG test. Subjects will be instructed to report any
      problems with the device. Subjects will make up to six (6) scheduled visits to the clinical
      study site, including the Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit 1). Based on the subjects' age
      and

      /or weight, subjects will have up to three (3) in- clinic visits during which intravenous
      blood draws and YSI reference testing will occur.
