      (6) subjects randomized to the active GIC-1001 and two (2) subjects randomized to a matching
      placebo.

      Part 1: Single Doses Cohort A: Single dose of 125 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; Cohort B: Single
      dose of 250 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; Cohort C: Single dose of 375 mg of GIC-1001 or
      placebo; Cohort D: Single dose of 500 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; and Cohort E: Single dose of
      1000 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo. Up to 21 blood samples will be obtained over a 36 hour
      period.

      Part 2: Multiple Doses, three times a day (TID) during 7 consecutive days; Cohort F: Multiple
      doses of 125 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; Cohort G: Multiple doses of 250 mg of GIC-1001 or
      placebo; Cohort H: Multiple doses of 375 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo; and Cohort I: Multiple
      doses of 500 mg of GIC-1001 or placebo. Up to 18 blood samples will be obtained over a 7 day
      period.

      Part 3: one single dose of GIC-1001 to be selected for the Food Effect cross-over evaluation.
      A total of 16 blood samples will be obtained over a 36 hour period.

      Physical exams, 24 hour cardiac monitoring, and a complete battery of biochemical and
      hematological lab tests will be done to assess the safety and tolerability of GIC-1001 in all
      dosing cohorts.
