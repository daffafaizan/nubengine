      hypofractionated proton radiotherapy for the treatment of intermediate and low risk prostate
      cancer. The treatment effectiveness is defined as freedom from biochemical failure. Treatment
      safety will be documented with acute and late morbidity assessments. Dose volume
      relationships for late side effects in organs at risk surrounding the prostate will be
      calculated from the dose volume histogram parameters assessed during treatment planning.
      Patient assessed Quality of life data including sexual function will be collected to increase
      our understanding how the reduction of normal tissue irradiation with proton therapy with
      subsequent decrease in functional impairments will overall affect the patient's life.
