        -  Determine the response rate in patients with mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome
           treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2).

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously for 4 consecutive days a week for 6 consecutive
      weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response or stable disease continue treatment for 2
      courses past best response. Patients who demonstrate a persistent partial response continue
      treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
