      5 and older. Subjects are enrolled upon obtaining consent and meeting entry criteria. Three
      wounds are selected per subject; two will receive bercolagene telserpavec and one will
      receive placebo. Administrations occur daily on Days 1 through 5, and again on Days 30, 60,
      and 90 if there is visible wound at the original administration site. Throughout the study
      wounds will imaged and biopsied for safety and efficacy analyses. Subjects will be on-trial
      for approximately 6 months: 3 months of on-site visits followed by a 3-month at-home imaging
      period.
