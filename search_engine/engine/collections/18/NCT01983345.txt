    
      Spina bifida (SB) represents one of the most severe congenital malformation of the central
      nervous system and amenable to prenatal diagnosis. In the past 20 years, prenatal repair of
      SB has become an established technique.

      The PRIUM study will include 10 cases of fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of SB and for whom
      the maternal willing will be to continue the pregnancy. A surgical prenatal repair of the
      defect will be planed at 19-25+6 weeks gestation following maternal laparotomy and
      hysterotomy under maternal general anesthesia. The delivery will be planed at 36 weeks'.
      Postnatal evaluation of the neonates will be scheduled at birth, 1 month, 12 months and 36
      months of age. Those data will be matched to controls who have underwent a conventional
      postnatal repair of the SB
