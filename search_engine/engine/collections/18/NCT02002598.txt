    
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder resulting in approximately 11,000
      deaths in the United States each year. It is estimated that between 60,000-80,000 people are
      currently under treatment for refractory or relapsed MM. Prognosis and survival have improved
      over the last 20 years, but the disease is still universally fatal despite efforts to develop
      new and more effective chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, new regimens need to be
      developed for patients prior to peripheral blood stem cell transplant and for those unable to
      tolerate the toxicity of transplant.
