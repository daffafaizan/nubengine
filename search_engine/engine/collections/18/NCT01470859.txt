      with Levodopa used as initiative treatment, but it still remains debatable that initiation of
      which medication will be better for those patients with De Novo PD.

      PDRP (Parkinson's disease-related spatial covariance pattern) is a biomarker which can
      represent the network activity of cortico-striato-pallido-thalamocortical pathways and highly
      reproducible with stable network activity in individual subjects. The study published in "J
      Neuroscience" in 2010 showed that the abnormal PDRP antecede the appearance of motor signs by
      about 2 years, indicating PDRP might be a very promising biomarker for identifying PD at its
      early stage. Moreover, PDRP is able to represent the progression and severity of PD as well.
      It was reported that Levodopa can reduce the PD-related network activity, and the degree of
      network suppression correlates with the clinical improvement. However, there is no study
      currently showing the impact of pramipexole on brain PDRP network compared with levodopa as
      initiative treatment.
