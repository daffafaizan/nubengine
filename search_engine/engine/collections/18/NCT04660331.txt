      AIM 1: Participants participate in a semi-structured interview in-person or via phone over 90
      minutes about barriers/facilitators of HPV vaccination in pharmacies. Pharmacies of which the
      pharmacy staff participants work undergo an environmental scan to characterize the pharmacy's
      environment, vaccination workflow, and team dynamics.

      AIM 2: Participants provide feedback on survey questions via cognitive testing. Pharmacy
      staff complete an online survey over 10-15 minutes to assess the acceptability,
      appropriateness, and feasibility of providing HPV vaccination to children aged 9-17 in their
      pharmacies. Pharmacy staff then attend communication training sessions, and then undergo a
      communication strategy intervention over no more than 120 minutes consisting of identifying
      vaccine-eligible children and recommending HPV and other vaccines. Pharmacy staff employ the
      new communication strategy in their pharmacy over 6 months, and then complete an online
      survey over 10-15 minutes.
