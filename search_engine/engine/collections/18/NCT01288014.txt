      cytokines (such as IL-10) an lower levels of immunity to Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) after
      vaccination, the investigators will obtain blood samples before and 3-5 times after
      immunization to determine the immunity to VZV and the levels of certain cytokines. The first
      blood samples will be obtained before the vaccine is given, as baseline values.

      The vaccine being used is the licensed vaccine, Zostavax, which is recommended by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to be
      administered to all relatively healthy individuals over the age of 50. This study does not
      concern vaccine safety or effectiveness. As a benefit to vaccines, the vaccine is
      administered at no charge to the subject.
