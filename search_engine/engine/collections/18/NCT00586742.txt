      some advocate biceps tenodesis,and others again questions whether these lesions should be
      repaired at all. There are no randomized studies comparing operative treatment and
      conservative treatment(i.e. physical rehabilitation), and likewise no randomized studies
      comparing labral repair and biceps tenodesis.

      In this study;all patients who have a patient history, clinical signs of a SLAP lesion,a MRI
      study revealing an isolated superior labral lesion and have agreed to participate in the
      study, will have a diagnostic arthroscopy performed.

      If a SLAP lesion is diagnosed, the patients are randomized to three different groups:1) SLAP
      repair with suture anchors 2) Biceps tenodesis 3) Physical therapy
