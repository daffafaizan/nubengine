      conducting a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, neuroimaging study to examine the
      effects of minocycline on neuroinflammation, alcohol cue reactivity, neurocognitive
      performance, and alcohol use. In the proposed study, non-treatment seeking individuals with a
      current DSM-5 AUD diagnosis (N = 32) will be randomized to receive either 200 mg of
      minocycline per day or placebo for 28 days and complete two laboratory sessions. The first
      laboratory session will be performed immediately before commencing the medication regimen
      (day 0) and the second will be completed after taking the medication daily for 28 days.
      Within each laboratory session, participants will complete a cue reactivity paradigm,
      neurocognitive performance tasks, and a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging session.
      Neuroinflammation will be assessed by using PET imaging with the radiotracer
      N-(2,5-dimethoxy-benzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl) acetamide, labeled with carbon-11
      ([11C]-DAA1106), which binds to the mitochondrial translocator protein, a marker of activated
      microglia in brain. Additionally, blood samples will be drawn on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to
      measure circulating levels of proinflammatory markers and alcohol use over the four weeks of
      treatment will also be measured.
