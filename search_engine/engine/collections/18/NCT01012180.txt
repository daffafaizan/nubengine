      reproductive fitness approaching population rates, we know very little about the perceptions
      and coping of parents with bipolar disorder related to their at-risk children. Bipolar
      disorder is an etiologically-complex psychiatric disorder that is caused by a combination of
      genetic and environmental risk factors. This study proposes to assess perceptions of parents
      with bipolar disorder about their illness, response to illness threat, and concerns about
      their children s risks. We then propose to assess whether those appraisals are associated
      with the outcomes of coping strategies and adaption. As informed by the Transactional Theory
      of Stress and Coping, we propose to use a web-based survey to examine disease perceptions,
      coping strategies, and adaptation to the disorder. Respondents will be recruited through the
      National Alliance of the Mentally Ill (NAMI). The study is cross-sectional and the survey is
      composed of several valid and reliable scales to measure the constructs predicted to be
      involved in adaptation. Open-ended questions are included to help interpret results from the
      measures. Knowledge about parents perceptions and coping with their own illness and with risk
      to children may lead to studies of potential coping interventions. Ultimately, downstream
      studies may help to improve parents adaptation to their own condition and how successfully
      they are able to manage concerns about perceived risks to their child.
