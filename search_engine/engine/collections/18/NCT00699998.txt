      and their high risk for future cardiovascular events, further exploration of novel treatment
      strategies for this population, who are under-represented in large clinical trials, is
      warranted. Potential subjects will be those with a recent UA/NSTEMI event who are to be
      medically managed. Eligibility for this study will be determined by both the timing of the
      medical management decision and by prior commercial clopidogrel treatment at the time of
      randomization. The TaRgeted platelet Inhibition to cLarify the Optimal strateGy to medicallY
      manage Acute Coronary Syndromes (TRILOGY ACS) Study will assess the efficacy and safety of
      prasugrel and aspirin compared to the current standard of care, clopidogrel and aspirin, for
      long-term treatment of medically managed UA/NSTEMI ACS subjects.
