    
      The proposed trial will be an exploratory, open-label, single-centre, phase IIIb safety,
      tolerability and efficacy study, wherein each patient acts as their own control. The primary
      outcome measure is safety and tolerability of panzyga in patients with active CIDP at
      standard and high infusion rates as measured by:

        -  Occurrence of all adverse events with focus on adverse drug reactions (ADRs)

        -  The secondary outcomes include: Patients' treatment satisfaction, proportion of patients
           successfully achieving higher infusion rates, health utilities associated with
           treatment, proportion of responders to treatment based on change in clinical scores,
           grip strength, and quality of life measures. The total sample size is 25-30 patients,
           based on a difference of 30% in adverse events rates between the standard infusion rate
           and the maximum rate tolerated by each patient.
