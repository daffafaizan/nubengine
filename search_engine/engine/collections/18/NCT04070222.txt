      widely. Post-cesarean section scar diverticulum ( PCSD) is a poor healing of the local
      incision after Cesarean section which happened in19.4%~88% of patients. The cavity is formed
      by the original incision connected with the uterine cavity. Patients with diverticulum are
      often accompanied by prolonged menstruation and uterine effusion, which may accompany with
      endometrial inflammation and impair embryo implantation rate.

      Though Cesarean section plays an important role in the treatment of dystocia and also
      decreasing perinatal mortality, it may impact natural conception and the success rate of ART
      in secondary infertile patients. Data from other researchers have revealed that Cesarean scar
      may related to poor pregnancy outcome during ART treatment. We have retrospectively analyzed
      the pregnancy outcome of ART treatment in patients who have had live birth previously from
      January 2014 to May 2018. The biochemical pregnancy rate, embryo implantation rate and
      clinical pregnancy rate are all lower in patients with Caesarean section compared to patients
      after natural labour, the clinical data is even worse in patients with PCSD. The results
      suggest a close correlation between the outcome of assisted reproductive therapy and the
      uterine condition. Further evaluations are required related to whether the dominate
      endometrial microflora is interrupted by the Cesarean section in the infertile women
      undergoing ART, and the potential mechanism will also be explored accordingly. A
      single-center, prospective, case-control study will be carried out.
