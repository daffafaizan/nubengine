      I. Determine the overall response rate (complete response, partial response, or hematological
      improvement) in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes or
      chronic myelomonocytic leukemia treated with sunitinib malate.

      II. Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the
      overall survival of patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the progression-free
      survival of patients treated with this drug. V. Determine the time to disease progression in
      patients treated with this drug.

      VI. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-4 weeks and then monthly
      thereafter.
