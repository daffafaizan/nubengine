      complication of left ventricular dysfunction. Ventricular dysfunction leads to dilation,
      which in turn leads to mitral annular dilation and leaflet traction. This causes a failure of
      coaptation of the otherwise intact leaflets of the mitral valve, leading to regurgitation
      through a central orifice between the mal-coapting leaflet tips. Functional mitral
      regurgitation contributes to heart failure symptoms.Transcatheter Mitral Cerclage
      Annuloplasty (TMCA) is a new catheter technique that reduces the septal-lateral dimension of
      the dilated annulus through circumferential compression, prevents extrinsic compression and
      entrapment of coronary arteries by incorporating a protection element, and exhibits planar
      discordance that achieves annular reduction even when the coronary sinus is anatomically
      located along the posterior left atrial wall. This is an entirely right-sided procedure and
      device.
