      Primary

        -  Determine reproducibility of localized and concentrated adjuvant radiotherapy, in terms
           of isodose curve and dose heterogeneity, in older women with stage I or II breast
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the impact of this regimen on Katz's Activity of Daily Living score and
           Lawton's Instrumental Activity of Daily Living score in these patients.

        -  Determine relapse-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall and specific survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the cosmetic result, as assessed by the patient, surgeon, and radiologist, of
           this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the direct and indirect costs of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients undergo surgery. After surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily for 5
      days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
