      the hippocampus and that these benefits lead to better learning. In contrast, there are mixed
      findings from human studies on the cognitive benefits of exercise with healthy older adults.
      This contrast indicates there is still a lack of understanding for how exercise could change
      the course of cognitive decline in aging adults. However, no human studies have
      comprehensively tested exercise effects on cognition in older adults with learning tasks
      inspired from basic exercise neuroscience. The objective in the proposed research is to fill
      this translational gap by determining if different types of exercise improve the same kinds
      of learning in older adults that have been shown to improve in animal models by improving
      hippocampal function. This will bring the investigators closer to a long-term goal of
      determining how exercise protects the brain from adverse effects of aging in order to develop
      interventions that minimize age-related cognitive decline. The overall hypothesis is that
      exercise improves learning when it increases functional hippocampal-cortical communication
      that otherwise declines with aging. The investigators will test this in a sample of healthy
      older adults by determining if increases in functional hippocampal-cortical connectivity from
      exercise training improve learning on an array of tasks that require the hippocampus for
      acquisition of new relational memories compared to conditions of the same tasks that should
      not require the hippocampus for learning and memory.
