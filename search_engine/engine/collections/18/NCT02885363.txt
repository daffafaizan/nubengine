    
      Isolated Left Ventricular Non Compaction (LVNC) is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy supposed to
      result from the cessation of normal embryogenesis infarction, and characterized by persistent
      ventricular trabeculations prominent.

      This is frequently a familial disease, but for which genetic characterization is still
      incomplete, and then requires the identification of new genes is desirable.

      The prognosis of LVNC is uncertain, with a mortality rate reported in the literature ranging
      from 2 to 38%. Some series conclude that LVNC is a very severe heart disease, responsible for
      a high mortality, other that LVNC is frequently associated with a favorable prognosis. These
      series are however limited by the short duration of follow-up and the small number of
      patients included.

      Between 2004 and 2006, a French registry LVNC, included 105 cases. It was found out that the
      LVNC was associated with a high rate of complications such as outbreaks of severe heart
      failure, need for heart transplantation, severe rhythm disorders, and embolic events. The
      prognosis of LVNC in France appears as pejorative:

        1. - there is no evidence that prognosis is different from other forms of cardiomyopathies.

        2. - the results of this register can be skewed by the inclusion of incident and prevalent
           cases (statistical survival bias).

      Thus, a longer-term monitoring and the identification of relevant prognostic markers are
      imperative to better understand this rare disease and to improve the therapeutic management.
