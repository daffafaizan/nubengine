      (ICU) acquired weakness. This condition occurs in a subset of people admitted into the ICU,
      and is associated with a 30% increased risk of death before discharge from the ICU. There are
      currently major limitations in the ability to diagnose ICU acquired weakness, making it
      difficult to study. The goal is to develop a non-invasive test that can be administered to
      both responsive and non-responsive patients. The current proposal will focus on replicating
      the results of previous research using motion detecting accelerometers to measure fatigue in
      human skeletal muscles. This study is designed to test out the procedures in patients who
      have been transferred from the ICU to a lower level of care so that follow-on studies can be
      designed to help mitigate this condition in the ICU.
