    
      Interventional prospective consecutive comparative case control series of cases; 50 eyes of
      25 patients with mean age 35.7 Â± 12.4 (Range 18-61years) with hyperopia or hyperopic
      astigmatism underwent customized LASIK with concurrent prophylactic high-fluence
      cross-linking in right eye (group 1) and customized LASIK only in left eye (group 2). Cases
      with hyperopia +1 diopter to +6 diopters or hyperopic astigmatism up to 4 diopters were
      included in the study. Patients with previous intraocular or corneal surgery, active corneal
      disease were excluded from the study.

      Main outcome measures were uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), manifest refractive spherical
      equivalent (MRSE), cycloplegic refractive spherical equivalent (CRSE), keratometric
      measurements and spherical aberrations at 4 mm and maximum pupil and their evolution along 6
      months postoperatively.
