      psychotropic medication or psychotherapy as treatment for a mental illness. One in every four
      of these young adults will disengage from mental health treatment before significant symptom
      remission is achieved. Mental health treatment disengagement may be mitigated by reducing
      barriers to self-management and enhancing self-management skills. Electronic self-management
      resource training for mental health (eSMART-MH) is an innovative use of avatars-virtual
      persons who tailor responses to users-to improve mental health treatment disengagement.
