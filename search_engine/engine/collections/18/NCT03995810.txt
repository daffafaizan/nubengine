      around the world, negatively interfering with different aspects of health and everyday life.
      Being the most frequently seen demyelinating disease, MS prevalence varies considerably, from
      high levels in North America and Europe (> 100/100,000 inhabitants) to low rates in Eastern
      Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (2/100,000 population). Due to its rather high prevalence in
      developed countries, the development of effective and applicable strategies to prevent or
      manage MS becomes a must for the medical community. Among other factors, it appears that low
      levels of tissue carnosine and mitochondrial dysfunction accompany MS, with oral carnosine
      might be applicable to tackle impaired bioenergetics and oxidative stress in MS, and perhaps
      win back neuromuscular function. However, several formulations of carnosine have shown
      limited applicability due to restraints in brain delivery or tissue performance thus pushing
      both industry and researchers to find bioavailable and effective formulation of carnosine. No
      human studies so far evaluated the impact of innovative carnosine formulation (Karnozin
      EXTRA) in MS. Here, we will evaluate the impact of supplemental carnosine on neuromuscular
      performance, brain biomarkers of carnosine metabolism, and health-related quality of life in
      a case series of patients with MS.
