      (TI-NDBS) will be well tolerated and effective at manipulating brain activity and reducing
      drug cravings. The investigators will investigate whether stimulation with a mild current
      from temporal interference non-invasive deep brain stimulation (TI-NDBS) to the Anterior
      Cingulate Cortex (ACC), the anterior insula (AI), or the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) will reduce
      nicotine craving and seeking. The TI-NDBS is similar to the traditional transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS), a method approved for use in a number of other studies. Other
      studies have shown there have been some effects of reducing craving with tDCS, however, tDCS
      cannot stimulate structures such as the ACC very effectively because tDCS cannot stimulate
      deeper brain regions. Thus, the Specific Aim ultimately will compare TI-NDBS with tDCS and
      sham stimulation. The study is broken up into four phases. The first two will involve device
      feasibility and identifying the best locations for the electrodes to be placed. In the third
      phase, the investigators will compare TI-NDBS with sham stimulation. In the fourth phase, the
      investigators will compare TI-NDBS with sham stimulation and with tDCS.
