      combination of anthracycline (A) and cyclophosphamide (C), have contributed greatly to
      improve survival rate in breast cancer patients. Despite the clinical benefits of this
      therapy, AC treatment can cause cardiovascular acute and chronic changes. In a recent
      investigation, we observed that an acute AC chemotherapy session increases sympathetic
      nervous activity and blood pressure in patients with breast cancer.

      The present study aims to investigate the chronic effects of AC regimen on sympathetic
      nervous activity, peripheral vasoconstriction, endothelial microparticles and blood pressure,
      in women with breast cancer.
