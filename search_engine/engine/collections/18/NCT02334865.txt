    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of the SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide (SVN53-67/M57-KLH
      peptide vaccine) in Montanide ISA 51 (incomplete Freund's adjuvant) plus GM-CSF
      (sargramostim) (vaccine), given before or after the start of lenalidomide maintenance in
      patients with multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the immune responses induced by SVN53-67/M57-KLH with Montanide ISA 51 plus
      GM-CSF, either alone or with lenalidomide maintenance added either before or after the
      vaccine.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect preliminary data on therapeutic efficacy of this combination against multiple
      myeloma, including response rate, time to progression and disease progression slope.

      II. To test if human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types and survivin positivity affect the immune
      responses induced by SVN53-67/M57-KLH with Montanide ISA 51 plus GM-CSF.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant
      subcutaneously (SC) and sargramostim SC every 2 weeks at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 for up to 4
      doses and then receive a booster in week 12. Beginning in week 4, patients receive
      lenalidomide maintenance therapy orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP B: Patients receive SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant SC
      and sargramostim SC every 2 weeks at weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10 for up to 4 doses and then receive
      a booster in week 16. Beginning in week 0, patients receive lenalidomide maintenance therapy
      PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 16, 20, and 24 weeks and
      then every 3 months for up to 5 years.
