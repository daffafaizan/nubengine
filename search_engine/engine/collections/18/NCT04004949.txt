      associated with decreased motor function, somatosensory function, limited range of motion,
      and spasticity.

      Objective: to investigate the effect of Scapular dyskinesia on the scapular balance angle &
      upper extremity Sensorimotor Function in spastic stroke patient.

      Methods: sixty patients from both sexes were participated in this study. All the patients
      were diagnosed as spastic stroke patients. The patients were divided into two equal groups;
      group A (30 patients): with high scapular dyskinesia scores, group B (30 patients): with low
      or no scapular dyskinesia scores. The patients were diagnosed with the Lateral scapular slide
      test using Palpation meter (PALM) device, Fugl-Meyer upper extremity (FMUE) Scale scores &
      scapular balance angle test (SBA).
