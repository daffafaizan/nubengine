      120 or 160 mg/day lurasidone in the targeted pediatric/adolescent population (6-17 years
      old)with schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar spectrum, autistic spectrum disorder or other
      psychiatric disorders. Data from this study will be used to recommend pediatric doses that
      result in comparable exposures to those observed in currently approved adult doses of LatudaÂ®
      (40, 80, 120 and 160 mg/day) in subsequent efficacy and safety studies.
