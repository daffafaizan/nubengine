      (Body mass index or BMI=30-40 kg/m2) randomized to one of three interventions (n=64/group):
      WL alone (WL; caloric restriction targeting 10% WL); WL plus weighted vest use (WL+Vest);
      targeting â‰¥8 hours/day, weight replacement titrated up to 10% WL); or, WL plus structured RT
      (WL+RT; 3 days/week). Total hip trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) is the
      primary outcome. This outcome will be complemented by exploratory assessment of several
      fracture-related risk factors, including: (1) femoral neck and lumbar spine vBMD, cortical
      thickness, finite element modeling of bone strength, and regional fat and muscle volumes,
      measured by CT; (2) areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the total hip, femoral neck, lumbar
      spine, and distal radius; trabecular bone score; and total body fat/lean masses, measured by
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); (3) muscle function and strength; (4) biomarkers of
      bone turnover; and (5) bone-regulating hormones/cytokines known to influence bone metabolism
      during WL. Therefore, the investigators Specific Aims are to:

      Aim 1: Determine the effects of WL+VEST compared to WL and WL+RT on 12 month change in total
      hip trabecular vBMD. Despite similar reductions in total body weight, Hypothesis 1:
      Participants in the WL+VEST group will show attenuated losses of total hip trabecular vBMD
      versus WL; and Hypothesis 2: Loss in total hip trabecular vBMD will be no greater in WL+VEST
      compared to WL+RT.

      Aim 2: Explore the effects of WL+VEST compared to WL and WL+RT on the 12 month change in
      fracture-related risk factors. Despite similar reductions in total body weight, we
      hypothesize that WL+VEST and WL+RT will demonstrate improvements in fracture-related risk
      factors compared to WL.
