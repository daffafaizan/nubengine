    
      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of women diagnosed with first trimester spontaneous
      abortion. Participants interested in operative evacuation of the uterus will be randomized to
      either operative hysteroscopy or dilation an curettage (D&C). Study population will include
      pregnant women diagnosed with first trimester spontaneous abortion of up to 11+0 weeks from
      last menstrual period (LMP). Women who will electively choose to terminate their pregnancy as
      well as women diagnosed with threatened, incomplete or inevitable abortion will be excluded.
      All participants will undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy 6-8 weeks after allocated treatment in
      order to rule out intrauterine adhesion formation and retained product of conception. The
      primary outcome measure is the risk of intrauterine adhesion formation.
