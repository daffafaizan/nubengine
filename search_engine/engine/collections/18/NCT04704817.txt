      nearly 12% of all cancer deaths, especially among those 65 and over. However, mortality has
      declined steadily since 1980.

      Access to screening for colorectal cancer and resection of precancerous lesions partly
      explains this decline. All sexes combined, it is estimated that about one in five colorectal
      cancer is diagnosed at a limited local stage. The treatment is then less heavy and gives
      better results.

      With the development of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols and their extension
      to rectal excision, it becomes imperative to be able to collect operative data from these
      patients on a perennial basis for the purpose of evaluating our results. Finally, the
      evaluations resulting from this database could have prognostic value and ultimately allow us
      to adapt the surgical management of the patient according to the results.
