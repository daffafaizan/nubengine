      Treatment group. Both groups will complete the same intervention program. The Immediate
      treatment group will start the program right away while the Delayed Treatment group will
      start the program after a 3 week delay. The intervention program is 3 weeks in duration and
      consists of participants completing at least two hours of exercises (adapted from the
      Home-GRASP program) daily and wearing an activity monitor on their affected wrist during
      waking hours for the duration of the intervention. Participants will be asked to meet daily
      movement count goals based on information from the monitor. Participants will have 8 virtual
      sessions with a therapist who will teach and monitor exercises thru an online platform (Zoom
      Video Communications), work with participants to generate and progress daily movement goals
      and discuss barriers and potential solutions to exercise adherence and/or meeting movement
      goals.
