      selumetinib in combination with gefinitib. Once MTD and/or RP2D has been determined in the
      phase Ib dose escalation phase, study drug selumetinib with combination of 250mg QD dose of
      gefitinib will be further evaluated in a phase II dose expansion phase of the study. The
      purpose of the dose expansion phase is to evaluate the efficacy of selumetinib in combination
      of gefitinib and to further characterize the safety, and tolerability of the combination.

      20 patients will be required in the phase II period. In the expansion phase, 10 patients with
      T790M and 10 patients without T790M will be enrolled. It is assumed that 20% response rate is
      the target of clinical interest. If the true response rate is 20%, the probability of
      observing no responses in a random sample of 10 patients is 0.107. The false negative rate
      for detecting a true 20% response rate in each cohort is approximately 10%. Each cohort will
      be enrolled 10 patients to evaluate the efficacy; therefore 20 patients will be enrolled in
      dose expansion part. Patients treated at the MTD and/or RP2D during the phase Ib will be
      considered as part of the required number of patients in the phase II. Patients at the MTD or
      RP2D cannot contribute to the 20 patients require for phase II part.
