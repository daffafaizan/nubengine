    
      Induction Phase (week 1 - 48):

        -  Lenalidomide will be given at 20 mg/day for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle for 12 cycles.
           If no excess toxicity is observed the dose will be increased to 25 mg/day.

        -  Rituximab will be administered at 375 mg/m2 per dose for a total of 9 doses. The first 4
           doses will be administered weekly starting on day 1 of lenalidomide (e.g. days 1, 8, 15
           and 22). Subsequent rituximab doses will be administered for one dose each at weeks 12,
           20, 28, 36 and 44.

      Maintenance Phase (week 49 - progression of disease):

        -  Lenalidomide will be given at 15 mg/day for days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle.

        -  Rituximab at 375 mg/m2 per dose will be administered for one dose every 8 weeks,
           starting at week 52.

      Response Assessment

        -  Year 1-2: Conventional restaging CT scan (or MRI) with IV contrast every 3 months from
           cycle 1 day 1 of the study.

        -  Year 3 onwards: Conventional restaging CT scan (or MRI) with IV contrast every 6 months
           until progression.
