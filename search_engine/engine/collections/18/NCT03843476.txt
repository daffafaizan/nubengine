      patient will answer questions about themselves and also fill out patient reported outcome
      sheets. Spinopelvic measurements will be obtained on the x-rays taken. This registry is
      observational only, and there is no driving hypothesis for data collection. Some broad topics
      of discussion are:

        1. Outcomes of patients sagittal profile through the pre-operative, plan and post-operative
           events

        2. Effectiveness of rod in conjunction with other surgical implants by measurements of
           fusion assessment and sagittal alignment

        3. Outcomes of patients in subgroups as defined by surgery performed, comorbidities,
           radiographic measurement, or other outcome variables

        4. Rod curvature maintenance over the follow-up period

        5. Understand the post-operative risks and complications from the pre-operative condition
