      five partner hospitals to analyze live patient data, including blood pressure and Creatinine
      levels, to determine the algorithm's ability to predict COVID-19 patient prognosis. The
      primary endpoint was mechanical ventilation of study subjects within 24 hours after hospital
      admission separate from a decompensation alert related to oxygen levels.
