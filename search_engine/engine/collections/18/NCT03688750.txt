           heights footwear on spine posture and pelvic position by using formetric 4 D analysis
           system which is a light-optical scanning method based on Video-Raster-Stereography
           (VRS). Accordingly, the system consists of a light projector which projects a line grid
           on the back of the patient which is recorded by an imaging unit. A computer software
           analyzes the line curvature that generates from it. the formetric provides comprehensive
           information about the whole body statics and posture in only one measuring process, e.g.
           spine curvature (lateral and frontal), vertebral rotation, and pelvic position.

        -  There is generally no need for reflecting markers, because the anatomical fixed points
           Vertebra prominens (VP), Sacrum Point (SP), Dimple Left (DL) Dimple Right (DR) as well
           as the spinal center line and spinal rotation are automatically detected by the system.
           That allows a very time-saving and reliable examination procedure.

        -  shoe characteristics: standard shoes will be used and designed to fit females in sizes
           ranging from 37-41 and different heel heights (2.5 cm low, 4,5 cm moderate and 7 cm
           high).

        -  Descriptive statistics including mean and standard deviation will be applied for
           dependent variables and participant demographics. repeated measures analysis of variance
           will be implemented to detect the difference in dependent measures among three heel
           condition.
