      severity was assessed by using a visual analogue scale (VAS). KAT 2000 was used to evaluate
      static and dynamic balance. Dynamic balance and mobility also was assessed using the Berg
      Balance Scale (BBS) and Time Up and Go (TUG) test. QoL was assessed by using Nottingham
      Health Profile (NHP). Patients were evaluated at baseline and the end of the 4-week exercise
      program.
