        1. Study the acute/short term effect and cardio-renal mechanisms of sodium-glucose
           cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition in patients with heart failure.

        2. Determine the effect of chronic combined SLLGT2 and loop diuretic exposure in patients
           with heart failure.

      Primary Outcomes

        1. Aim 1 (Acute): Determine if acute SGLT2 inhibition will improve the natriuretic effect
           of a loop diuretic compared to placebo.

        2. Aim 2 (Chronic): Determine the effect of 14 days of SGLT2 inhibition on blood volume.
