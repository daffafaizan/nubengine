      CS-3150 on the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration after administration of single oral 10-mg
      and 40-mg doses of CS-3150 in healthy male and female participants. This study will also
      determine the safety and tolerability of CS-3150 administration, assess the effect on
      electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, detect QT interval (QT)/QTc prolongation with a positive
      control (moxifloxacin), characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) of CS-3150, and assess
      exposure-response relationship of CS-3150 on QTc.
