      surgery, activation of neuroendocrine and inflammation systems occurs as a protective
      reaction. However, this resistance has some negative consequences for patient health. It is
      associated with infectious complications. At the same time, Postoperative insulin resistance
      has been shown to correlate with the length of postoperative stay in hospital. Recently
      several clinical studies have shown that a carbohydrate-rich drink given 2 h before surgery
      diminishes postoperative insulin resistance in patient. The aim of our study is to
      investigate the influence on insulin resistance in patient with diabetes.
