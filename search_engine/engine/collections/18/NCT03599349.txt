    
      This is a prospective, single-site, non-randomized study designed to evaluate if there is a
      correlation between efficacy results and where the Thermal Coagulation Points (TCPs),
      produced during treatment with the Ulthera System, make contact with the anatomical layers of
      skin and underlying tissues. The study consists of one Ultherapy treatment administered at
      two depths using DeepSEE transducers on the full-face and neck area. Ultrasound images will
      be captured at the beginning, middle and end of each treatment section during treatment.
