      related death worldwide. The 10-year survival of patients with this malignancy is 20% due to
      advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Screening programs in countries with a high
      incidence of gastric neoplasia aim to detect early stage cancer, suitable for curative
      treatment. Well-differentiated dysplastic gastric lesions limited to the mucosa (when
      non-ulcerated or ulcerated and less than 3 cm) or limited to the superficial submucosa (when
      less than 3 cm and with no lymphatic or vascular invasion) have a negligible risk of lymph
      node metastasis and are suitable for endoscopic curative treatment.

      Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) have been
      increasingly used in this setting with promising results. However, even with these advanced
      techniques, en bloc and R0 resection is not possible in up to 13-15% and 16-26% of the cases,
      respectively. The presence of dysplasia after endoscopic resection (DAER) in the
      post-resection scar presents a challenging dilemma due to the technical difficulty, and
      associated complications, of performing subsequent EMR/ESD in fibrotic tissue. Another issue
      of concern is the presence of gastric dysplasia not associated with macroscopic lesions
      (DNAML). In such cases, a targeted endoscopic treatment is difficult and clinical management
      is not standardized.

      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been increasingly advocated for the treatment of dysplastic
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) and early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but its use in
      gastric dysplasia has not yet been tested. The investigators aim to study the role of gastric
      RFA in the treatment of DNAML and DAER.
