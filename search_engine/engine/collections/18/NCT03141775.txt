      www.ClinicalSurveys.net which was set up by researchers of the University Hospital of
      Cologne. This survey platform enables an optimal performance in epidemiological,
      observational, and interventional trials and is characterized by layered access security and
      frequent data backup. It has been used for numerous registry and cohort studies with approval
      of competent authorities and ethics boards.

      The following two differences of data documentation are observed:

        1. Retrospective data documentation:

           Data of patients that are too sick to provide informed consent, (up to 30% of all
           patients enrolled) will be obtained retrospectively, at least 90 days after diagnosis
           and will be documented in an anonymized fashion. For these patients, documentation of
           HRQL will not be feasible.

        2. Prospective data documentation:

      Data of patients with an informed consent.

      The following data items are retrospectively or prospectively documented into our database,
      depending on if a informed consent exists or not:

        -  Demography: age (yrs), gender (m/f), comorbidities (as categories)

        -  Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)

        -  Karnofsky Score (0-100%)

        -  APACHE Score for patients in ICU

        -  Number of hospitalizations in the past 12 months prior to the CDI index episode

        -  Type and duration of antibiotic treatment during the last 3 months

        -  Diagnostic measures (microbiological tests, imaging, endoscopy) leading to diagnosis of
           CDI

        -  Severe and/or complicated CDI (Severe: white blood cell count ≥15 × 10³/μL and/or an
           increase in creatinine ≥1.5 times the baseline level; complicated: at least 1 of the
           following: hypotension requiring vasopressors, ICU admission for a complication of CDI,
           ileus leading to installation of a nasogastric tube, toxic megacolon, colonic
           perforation, or colectomy)

        -  Bowel movements: frequency and consistence according to Bristol stool scale (see
           appendix 1)

        -  Treatment for CDI: substance, dosage, frequency, duration

        -  Other antibiotic treatment: substance, dosage, frequency, duration

        -  Diagnosis of CDI recurrence: time point, diagnostic measures

        -  Treatment of CDI recurrence: substance, dosage, frequency, duration

        -  Duration of hospitalization: overall, types (general, intermediate care, intensive care,
           bone marrow transplantation)

        -  Mechanical ventilation (y/n)

        -  Days with contact isolation

        -  Days in single room

        -  Adverse drug reactions

        -  Health-related quality of life (HRQL) as determined by Garey et al. J Clin Gastroenterol
           2016 (for prospective analysis only)
