      buprenorphine/naloxone adherence, the proposed study compares manual-guided Physician
      Management (PM) and PM combined with on-site manual-guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
      in a 24 week randomized clinical trial of buprenorphine/naloxone in a heterogeneous
      population of opioid dependent patients (N=140) in a primary care clinic. PM, consistent with
      federal regulations, is designed to reflect usual care by primary care physicians and
      includes referral to ancillary services. CBT will be provided by skilled psychologists in
      weekly sessions for the first 12 weeks and focuses on reducing illicit drug use and
      increasing buprenorphine/naloxone adherence. The study will test the hypothesis that that the
      addition of CBT to PM will lead to decreased illicit drug use, durable effects after
      counseling has been discontinued, improved buprenorphine/naloxone adherence and will
      demonstrate incremental cost-effectiveness in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone
      maintenance in primary care. Primary outcome measures include reductions in illicit opioid
      use and abstinence achievement, as assessed by weekly urine toxicology testing and self
      report. Secondary outcome measures include retention in treatment, reductions in cocaine use
      and HIV risk, decreased criminal activity and improved health and employment status.
      Utilization and costs of services, spillover effects in the PCC, and patient and staff
      perceptions of benefits and problems associated with primary care agonist maintenance
      treatment will also be evaluated. The results of this study will help define the role of
      professional evidence-based drug counseling in expanding access to treatment with
      buprenorphine/naloxone.
