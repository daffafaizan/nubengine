      helminth and non-helminth antigens. Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment of schistosomiasis is
      associated with a dramatic interleukin-5 (IL-5)-dependent increase in eosinophilia that is
      correlated with resistance to reinfection. We hypothesize that chronic filarial infection
      with Mansonella perstans (Mp) may attenuate post-treatment eosinophilia and thus impact
      resistance to reinfection. To address the first part of this question, we plan to compare
      post-PZQ reactions and reinfection rates in 20 subjects with schistosomiasis and Mp infection
      to those in 20 subjects with schistosomiasis and no evidence of filarial infection in an area
      coendemic for both infections in Mali. Signs and symptoms, complete blood counts,
      intracellular and serum cytokine levels, and markers of eosinophil activation will be
      assessed at baseline, 4 and 8 hours, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14 days post-treatment and
      compared between the two treatment groups. Schistosoma haematobium reinfection rates will
      also be compared at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment.
