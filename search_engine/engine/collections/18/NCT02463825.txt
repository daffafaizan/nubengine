    
      This clinical trial has two components: an acute therapy component consisting of a Phase II
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized-controlled pilot study of pimozide for the
      treatment of ALS; and a second component featuring a longitudinal follow-up study on ALS
      progression and outcomes. This clinical trial is registry-based including subject recruitment
      facilitated by the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR; National Principal
      Investigator: L. Korngut), and longitudinal follow-up data collection will occur during the
      second component of this clinical trial through the CNDR.

      The acute therapy study duration for each subject is around 11 weeks. The follow up study
      duration through the CNDR is up to 5 years.

      Number of study participants:25

      Randomization: Subjects will be block randomized with a block size of five subjects. Within
      each block one subject will be randomly assigned to placebo with the remaining four subjects
      randomized to the treatment groups. Study physicians will be blinded to patient randomization
      status. Randomization will occur with a 4:1 ratio of study drug (20 subjects) to placebo (5
      subjects). After administration of maximum dose for 45-50 days, subjects will taper the
      allocated treatment or placebo. Randomization will occur via permuted block randomization and
      study personnel will be blinded to the randomization at all times allowing full concealment.
