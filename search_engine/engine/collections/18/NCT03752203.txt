      Children's Hospital Colorado for resection of a central nervous system tumor. This study will
      employ the use of sodium fluorescein and an FDA approved operative microscope equipped with
      excitation and barrier filters for monitoring with sufficient fluorescent enhancement and
      contrast. Fluorescein sodium is a small organic salt that accumulates in areas of diminished
      blood-brain barrier integrity and allows for determination of the margins between tumor and
      normal brain function.
