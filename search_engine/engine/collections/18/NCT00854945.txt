    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ON 01910.Na CIV
      24-hour infusion administered three times a week every other week in achieving by week 25 a
      complete or partial response as defined per the 2000 International Working Group (IWG)
      Criteria in patients with MDS or as defined by Cheson et al. [JCO 21:4642 (2003)] in patients
      with AML.

      The secondary objectives are to assess:

        -  Time and duration of response

        -  Blastic response in bone marrow

        -  Improvement of dyspoiesis as evaluated by the change in aneuploidy in bone marrow

        -  Change in International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) in MDS patients

        -  Major and minor responses in absolute neutrophil count, according to IWG 2000 criteria

        -  Major and minor responses in platelet count, according to IWG 2000 criteria

        -  Major and minor erythroid response, according to IWG 2000 criteria

        -  Time to progression

        -  Overall survival at 25 and 50 weeks

        -  Proportion of MDS patients transitioning to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at 25 and 50
           weeks

      This is a phase 1/2 single arm study in which six to thirty-five patients with MDS or AML who
      meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive ON 01910.Na as an intravenous
      continuous infusion (IVCI) over 72 hours once a week every other week.

      In the phase 1 portion of the study, a traditional dose escalation rule, also known as the
      "3+3" rule, will be used. Three patients will be treated at the 800 mg/m2/day dose level. If
      none of the patients experience a DLT during cycle 1, the next group of 3 patients will
      receive 1500 mg/m2/day. If no DLT is seen at the 1500 mg/m2/day dose level, then the dose
      used in the phase 2 portion of the study will be 1500 mg/m2/day. If there is DLT in one of
      the first three patients at the 800 mg/m2/day dose level, this dose level will be expanded to
      6 patients. If ≤ 1 patient out of 6 experience DLT, then the dose will be escalated to the
      1500 mg/m2/day dose level. If ≥ 2 patients experience DLT at the 800 mg/m2/day dose level, a
      full safety review will determine if further enrollment of patients will proceed. If there is
      DLT in one of the first three patients at the 1500 mg/m2/day dose level, this dose level will
      be expanded to 6 patients. If ≤ 1 patient out of 6 experience DLT at the 1500 mg/m2/day dose
      level, then 1500 mg/m2/day dose level will be considered the MTD. If ≥ 2 patients experience
      DLT at the 1500 mg/m2/day dose level, then 800 mg/m2/day will be designated as the MTD.

      The total study duration is 29 weeks, which includes a 2-week screening phase, a 23-week
      dosing phase, and a 4-week follow-up phase that begins after the last dose of ON 01910.Na.
      Beginning at week 4, and every 2 weeks thereafter, patients will be assessed for response and
      followed up.

      Patients who achieve by week 25 a complete or partial response or stabilization of their
      disease are eligible to receive an additional 24 weeks of ON 01910.Na 1800 mg/24 h for 72 h
      once a week every 2 weeks and will be followed up.
