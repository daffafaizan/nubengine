    
      This is a prospective observational multiple cohort qualitative research study to be
      conducted among diverse groups within the haemophilia community whose lives may have been
      impacted by gene therapy.

      The study is designed to allow English-speaking patients and their families to tell their own
      life stories through narrative accounts. The narratives represent a true sharing of
      experiences and offer insight into how these patients and families cope with haemophilia.
