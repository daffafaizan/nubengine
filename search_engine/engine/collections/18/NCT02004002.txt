      complications associated with obesity. Although excess energy intake and body fat
      accumulation are considered the major culprits responsible for obesity-associated metabolic
      abnormalities, it is possible that insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function are also
      due to increased dietary protein intake.

      Protein intake is ~15 to 25% greater in obese than lean adults and exceeds the current
      Institute of Medicine Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of 0.8 g protein/kg body weight by
      ~75%. An increase in habitual protein intake of only 10 to 40%, assessed using dietary recall
      methods, been shown to increase the risk of developing diabetes by up to 2.2 fold.
      Additionally, the ability to stimulate glucose disposal during insulin infusion is reported
      to be impaired in individuals consuming double the recommended protein intake as part of an
      isoenergetic diet. However, it is not known whether decreasing protein intake can improve
      insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in weight-stable, obese individuals.

      Accordingly, obese men and women will be randomized to 8 weeks of treatment with a weight
      maintaining diet containing either i) 0.8 g protein/kg body weight (as recommended by the
      Institute of Medicine; protein restriction group)or ii) 1.4 g protein/kg body weight (control
      group). All subjects will receive a standardized "base-diet" with or without protein
      supplementation to avoid potential food selection bias that could confound the results when
      using high- and low-protein diets.
