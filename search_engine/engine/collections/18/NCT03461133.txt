      acquisition over 12 months (intervention) using four routine databases: Hospital patient data
      management, anesthesia database, local data of the German Resuscitation Registry, and
      measurement logs of the automated patient monitoring and alert system (intervention period
      only). A preceding time period of 12 months served as control.
