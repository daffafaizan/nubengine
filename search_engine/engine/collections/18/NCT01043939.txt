        -  To evaluate the effect of PGJ on endothelial function, a key measure of vascular health
           and considered a barometer for cardiovascular disease risk.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the effect of PGJ on biomarkers of vascular and systemic oxidative stress.

      Outline:

      Patients undergo a 4-week washout period and refrain from consuming any type of juice, juice
      drink (less than 100% juice), wine or grapes. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm 1: Beginning in week 4, patients consume 6 ounces of purple grape juice (PGJ) twice daily
      for 4 weeks. Beginning in week 12, after a 4 week washout period, patients crossover to
      consume apple juice (AJ) as in Arm 2.

      Arm 2: Beginning in week 4, patients consume 6 ounces of AJ twice daily for 4 weeks.
      Beginning in week 12, after a 4 week washout period, patients crossover to consume PGJ as in
      Arm 1.
