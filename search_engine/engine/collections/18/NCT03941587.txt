      In its exudative or wet form, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) causes an exudative
      maculopathy resulting in sudden loss of vision with severe effects on patients' quality of
      life. Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents (anti-VEGF)
      have become the mainstay of treatment for AMD CNV and has been shown to have favorable
      outcomes in most AMD CNV subtypes. In the Asian population, however, a particular subtype
      called polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), which affects about 50% of exudative
      maculopathy, has been shown to have less favorable response to anti-VEGF therapy.

      The best treatment option for PCV has remained unclear. Current best evidence is from 2
      recent randomized controlled trials, the EVEREST II trial which compares the efficacy of
      ranibizumab with or without photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treatment of PCV and the PLANET
      trial which compares Aflibercept monotherapy against a rescue PDT when Aflibercept is deemed
      ineffective. Both trials have reported significant improvement in visual outcomes, however
      there remain significant unanswered questions and unmet needs regarding the use of
      Aflibercept and PDT as the best treatment for PCV.

      In this study, we aim to compare the efficacy of combination Aflibercept with RF-PDT (at
      baseline) and Aflibercept monotherapy. This particular strategy has not been studies before
      and represents the amalgamation of unanswered questions from the best evidence to date for
      the treatment of PCV.
