      irreversible will be treated with a combination of injections of autologous bone marrow
      derived stem cells isolated from the bone marrow using standard medical and surgical
      practices. Retinal conditions may include degenerative, ischemic or physical damage (
      examples may include macular degeneration, hereditary retinal dystrophies such as retinitis
      pigmentosa, stargardt, non-perfusion retinopathies, post retinal detachment. Optic Nerve
      conditions may include degenerative, ischemic or physical damage ( examples may include optic
      nerve damage from glaucoma, compression, ischemic optic neuropathy, optic atrophy ).
      Injections may include retrobulbar, subtenon, intravitreal, intraocular, subretinal and
      intravenous. Patients will be followed for 12 months with serial comprehensive eye
      examinations including relevant imaging and diagnostic ophthalmic testing.
