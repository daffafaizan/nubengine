    
      This is an observational, prospective study that has the primary goal of validating the
      Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) as described by Behrend and Giesinger in 2012. Patients will be
      given two self-assessment questionnaires (WOMAC and FJS) to perform internal consistency
      analysis, reliability and comparability of results in a population of people undergoing total
      knee replacement prosthetic surgery.

      Comparison of data will be done for each patient by evaluating the evolution of the
      postoperative period, comparing the results obtained with a well known validated score
      (WOMAC).

      Questionnaires will be given pre-operatively, at 6 month ± 2 weeks, and 12 month ± 1 weeks
      after surgery.
