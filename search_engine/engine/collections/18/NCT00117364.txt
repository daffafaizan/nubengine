      was used in a previous study to enhance skin wound healing in animal models. In the present
      study, the effects of the gel on the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as on the healing of skin wounds in humans
      are estimated by a clinical trial.

      The hypothesis regarding the poor healing of the wound is the over-expression of MMP and the
      inhibition of the angiogenic factors. From the previous animal study, the effect of
      SACCHACHITIN was to inhibit the activity of MMP and stimulation of VEGF and we try to prove
      the effect over the human wounds from this clinical trial.

      Patients with a poorly healed wound, in which skin graft is clinically indicated, are
      included in this study. The exudates from the wound are collected and analyzed for the
      activity and concentration of VEGF and MMP. The change of the healing process is recorded.

      Positive results are expected from the clinical trial and the patients will get another
      choice for the treatment of the chronic wound other than skin grafting.
