    
      This study will include patients between 18 and 80 years who have experienced acute traumatic
      cervical spinal cord injury (specifically ASIA A, B or C). Patients will then begin an oral
      drug regimen of Glyburide, which must be started within 8 hours of injury and continued for
      72 hours at a daily dose of 3.125 mg on Day 1, 2.5 mg on Day 2 and 2.5 mg on Day 3. If
      indicated, the patient will also have surgical intervention for spinal cord decompression and
      spinal stabilization. Each patient who takes part in this study will have labs drawn
      regularly and adverse events assessed daily through Day 14 or discharge (whichever is
      earlier). Study participation will last for 365 days (+/- 30 days), with post-hospitalization
      follow-up occurring on Days 28, 42, 84, 182 and 365.
