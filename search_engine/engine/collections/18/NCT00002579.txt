      given after postoperative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF)
      vs. adjuvant CMF alone in women with primary breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by age and by participating
      institution. All patients undergo surgical resection with local radiation therapy, as
      appropriate. Within 4 weeks of surgery, patients receive cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
      fluorouracil (CMF) every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Radiotherapy is given within 4 weeks of
      completion of CMF. Before beginning the last course of CMF, patients are randomized to
      receive either oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years or no further therapy. Patients are followed
      every 6 months for 5 years, then yearly. Hormone therapy is prohibited except as specified
      above and except for short-term hormone replacement therapy for severe unresponsive
      menopausal symptoms.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,000 patients will be required. Data on patients entered in
      Scotland as part of this study will be pooled with data from the EORTC-10901 study.
