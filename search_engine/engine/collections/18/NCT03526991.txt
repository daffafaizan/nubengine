      Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. It is characterized by
      episodes during which patients cannot generate effective forward stepping movements in the
      absence of motor deficits.

      FOG leads to reduced mobility, loss of independence, social embarrassment, and caregiver
      stress. While most motor features of PD respond robustly to dopaminergic agents and deep
      brain stimulation (DBS), there are currently no effective treatments for FOG.

      Indirect evidence from case reports of PD patients undergoing spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
      for neuropathic pain, has consistently described a positive effect of SCS on FOG. In
      addition, two recent reports demonstrated that thoracic SCS improved locomotion and FOG in
      patients with advanced PD. The promising role of SCS for the treatment of FOG in PD has
      encouraged us to assemble a multi-disciplinary team for the systematic investigation of the
      motor effects of SCS on FOG, locomotion and other parkinsonian features.

      The current study integrates minimally invasive SCS and the use of robotic technology to
      determine objective gait parameters. The investigators propose a pilot study for the
      implantation of SCS to the spinal cord on PD patients with treatment-refractory FOG,
      including a longitudinal assessment of motor outcomes.
