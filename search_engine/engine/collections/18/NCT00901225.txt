    
      This is a single-center, Phase 2, open-label study. All patients diagnosed with non-hodgkins
      lymphoma, hodgkins disease or multiple myeloma and candidates for autologous transplantation
      are eligible to enter into the study. The only change to the standard of care is the addition
      of 240 ug/kg Plerixafor following 5 days of (G-CSF) mobilization.

      The results of the study will provide both numeric and categorical estimates of measurements
      of the safety and efficacy of Plerixafor. The primary efficacy endpoint, Treatment Success,
      is a binary response variable categorizing whether the patient was able to mobilize at least
      2 X 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg within 3 days of apheresis.

      The percentage of patients achieving Treatment Success will be summarized. All AEs will be
      followed for 30 days after the last apheresis or until the first dose of ablative
      chemotherapy, whichever occurs first. All SAEs will be followed for 6 months post-transplant
      or until relapse. All patients who receive at least one dose of Plerixafor will be included
      in all summaries of AEs.
