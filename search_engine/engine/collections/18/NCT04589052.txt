      improve quality of life (QoL) and reduce anxiety and depression (A/D) among adolescents/young
      adults (AYA). No study to the investigators' knowledge has evaluated the promising impact of
      hope interventions in AYA cancer patients. To address this gap, the investigators will expand
      the investigators' prior research on hope, A/D, and QoL to AYA receiving care across three
      diverse healthcare systems.

      Patients will be approached for participation within 4 weeks of their initial/relapse cancer
      diagnosis. Eligible patients (and the parent/caregiver for minor patients) will be approached
      in a private area of the clinic or hospital room to explain the research aims and informed
      consent process. After obtaining informed consent/assent (from parents if patients are under
      18, from AYA if patient is 18 or older), participants (patients) will utilize an iPad to
      complete measures via Redcap.
