      near extubation (i.e. within 1-5 days) were selected to undergo continuous heart rate (EKG
      waveform at 500 Hz) and respiratory rate (expired CO2 waveform at 100 Hz) recording. The data
      was collected as per standard practice by the bedside monitor (Phillips Intelivue MP70). A
      portable CPU with TrendfaceTM software was used to download the data for variability
      analysis. All decisions on timing of SBTs and extubation were left to the discretion of the
      treating team who were unaware of the variability results. SBT's were repeated daily from
      trial onset until extubation patient permitting.
