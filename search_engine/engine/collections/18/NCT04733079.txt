    
      The study will include 204 gouty patients without ULT or with ineffective ULT. This is a
      multicenter and randomized study (e-mail follow-up vs usual follow-up groups).

      This study will include the following visits:

        -  Selection/inclusion visit (V0):

             -  If available biological data (leucocyte count, hemoglobin level, creatininemia and
                estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), SUL) were assessed during the last
                month, , included patient will be randomized at the end of the consultation to
                follow either an email-led T2T strategy or usual ULT care.

             -  In the absence of biological results, the patient will be reviewed within the month
                with blood analysis and then randomized.

        -  Follow-up visits: consultations will be carried out according to the usual care of the
           referring physician.

        -  Visit M12 end of research: clinical evaluation of gout, demographic characteristics,
           medication, type and dose of ULT, blood analysis (serum creatinine level, eGFR, SUL).

      The study ends after the M12 consultation. The total duration of participation in the study
      is 12 months.
