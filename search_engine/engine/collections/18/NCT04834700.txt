      has a liquid-filled structure (vitreous body), it is suitable for obtaining some important
      findings with bedside ultrasound. In patients who visit an emergency room with ocular
      symptoms, point-of-care ultrasound can quickly identify several emergency diseases. While
      training of eye ultrasound skills is useful for emergency physicians, hands-on education is
      risky in pandemic situation such as COVID19. As a solution to this, non-face-to-face
      education via online has been on the rise. The investigators hypothesized that even an online
      education is enough to perform basic eye ultrasound by emergency physician.
