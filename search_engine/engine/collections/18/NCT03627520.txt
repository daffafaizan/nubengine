      divided into two stages: the first stage, two volunteers will be enrolled, the volunteers
      should stop collecting the corresponding samples by the investigators based on radioactive
      test results, safety results combined with the actual comprehensive situation. And in the
      second stage sample collection time for another four volunteers will be determined and
      adjusted according to the results of the first stage.
