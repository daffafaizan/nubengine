      I. To describe the magnitude, inter-individual variability and time course of
      sirolimus-induced changes in fasting serum glucose and triglycerides.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess candidate genetic variants for their correlation with changes in fasting glucose
      and/or triglycerides.

      II. To assess tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST,
      version 1.1) and explore whether there is any correlation between response and changes in
      fasting glucose and/or triglycerides.

      III. To assess toxicity by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version
      4.0) and explore whether there is any correlation between toxicities and changes in fasting
      glucose and/or triglycerides.

      IV. To quantify and determine the functional status of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs)
      before and during treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
