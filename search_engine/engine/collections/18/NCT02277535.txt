      critically ill patients will allow reduce malnutrition in the Intensive Care Units (ICU).
      Four ICUs will be included: medical ICU (MICU), coronary care unit (CCU) and two surgical
      ICUs. The investigators will rotate a 2 month period intervention amongst the aforementioned
      participating ICUs and follow simultaneous cohorts to evaluate the effect of our intervention
      (email feedback to treating clinicians) on nutrition delivery in the ICU. After the
      completion of the intervention, there will be a six-month follow-up of nutritional adequacy
      to assess the durability of changes in behavior.
