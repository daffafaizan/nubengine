      cardio-vascular side effects, particularly thrombo-embolic disorders and ischemic heart
      disease. The difference of incidence and type of cardio-vascular events between men and women
      are strongly related to sex hormones. This study investigates the main characteristics of
      patients affected by cardiovascular side effects (of which ventricular arrhythmia's, QT
      prolongation and Torsade de Pointe) imputed to drugs classified as L02 according to ATC.
