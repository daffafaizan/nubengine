      transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01 or
      HLA-A*02:06 positive patients with synovial sarcoma expressing NY-ESO-1, which are surgically
      unresectable and refractory to anthracycline therapy. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the safety in the phase 1 and the efficacy in the phase 2.
