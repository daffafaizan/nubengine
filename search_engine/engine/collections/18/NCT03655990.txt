      replacement for missing teeth in edentulous (toothless) patients. The standard has been a
      titanium metal base. Due to its potential shock-absorbing properties and patients' demands
      for metal-free restorations, there is rising enthusiasm surrounding the use of High
      Performance Polymers (HPPs) such as the polyaryletherketone (PAEKs) as metal alternatives for
      such cases. The JUVORA™ Dental Disc is made from PEEK-OPTIMA™ polymer (Invibio Biomaterial
      Solutions) which allows efficient fabrication of reliable non-metal dentures by using CAD/CAM
      technology to manufacture precise, custom-fit prostheses. The JUVORA™ Dental Disc is
      indicated for the manufacture of: full-arch implant-supported dentures and implant bars; full
      and partial removable dentures and overdentures; crowns and 3-unit bridges.

      This study aims to evaluate the short- and long-term clinical performance and patient
      satisfaction of the JUVORA™ full-arch implant-supported prostheses.

      Two subjects will be included in a run-in phase and 10 subjects will be included in the main
      study.

      The subjects will be followed-up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and for as long as willing
      yearly after the implant of the definitive prosthesis (artificial teeth).
