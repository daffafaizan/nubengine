      compared with fruquintinib single drug treatment in patients with advanced colorectal cancer
      who have failed second-line or above treatment, in order to explore the rationality of this
      strategy with chemotherapy + targeted combination therapy and obtain the relevant survival
      and safety data. A total of 136 patients were planned to be enrolled in this study.
