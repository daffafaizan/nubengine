        -  Compare the effects of selenium versus placebo on the 3-year incidence rate of prostate
           cancer in patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on the rate of increase in prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) in these patients.

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on prostatic cellular proliferation and apoptosis,
           degradation of basal cell integrity of prostatic ducts, and changes in nuclear chromatin
           patterns in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to age (40-60 vs 61 and over), race (African American vs other),
      baseline PSA (less than 4 ng/mL vs 4-10 ng/mL), concurrent vitamin E supplementation (yes vs
      no), and cores obtained from initial biopsy (10 or more vs less than 10). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral selenium once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. Treatment in both arms continues for 3
           years in the absence of progression to prostate cancer or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 8 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 465 patients will be randomized for this study.
