    
      This is a prospective, single-centre observational feasibility study that will measure
      changes in MV signalling and their relationship to inflammatory responses after cardiac
      surgery in children.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that inflammatory renal injury following paediatric
      cardiac surgery is regulated by circulating MV and more specifically MV associated miRNA.

      The investigators secondary hypotheses are:

        1. MV derived signals will differ in cyanotic patients, a patient group at significantly
           increased risk for AKI.

        2. MV subsets and/or MV derived miRNA may act as novel diagnostic biomarkers for AKI.

      To assist with the design of a prospective observational study that will test these
      hypotheses the investigators propose to undertake a feasibility study in 24 children. The
      objectives of this feasibility study are:

      A.To establish the numbers of patients that are eligible for enrolment in the study, the
      number recruited to the study, and their clinical and demographic characteristics.

      B.To determine the proportion of consented patients who develop AKI following cardiac
      surgery.

      C.To measure perioperative changes in MV subgroups and MV associated miRNA, as well as
      platelet and monocyte activation, and the variance of these measures.

      D.To establish protocol adherence, with respect to the adequacy and timing of the blood
      samples that are taken and the calculation of creatinine clearance perioperatively.
