      lists are used in a variety of ways throughout the process of clinical care. In addition to
      its use by clinicians, the problem list is also critical for decision support and quality
      measurement.

      Patients with gaps in their problem list face significant risks. For example, if a
      hypothetical patient has diabetes properly documented, his clinician would receive
      appropriate alerts and reminders to guide care. Additionally, the patient might be included
      in special care management programs and the quality of care provided to him would be measured
      and tracked. Without diabetes on his problem list, he might receive none of these benefits.

      In this study, the investigators developed an clinical decision support intervention that
      will identify patients with problem lists gaps. The investigators will alert providers of
      these likely gaps and offer providers the opportunity to correct them.
