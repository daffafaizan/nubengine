      Philadelphia (CHOP) urban primary care centers. To address this, we developed Child Adult
      Relationship Enhancement Model in Primary Care Parenting Program (PriCARE), a scaled down
      version of Parent Child Interaction Therapy designed for urban primary care clinics. The
      objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the efficacy of the modified PriCARE to decrease
      child behavior problems and improve parenting capacity and skills and 2) understand parents'
      perceptions of the efficacy of PriCARE and strategies for improving its implementation and
      dissemination. We will perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of
      the modified PriCARE on decreasing child behavior problems and improving positive parenting
      among 2- to 6-year-old children with behavior problems and their parents at CHOP's urban
      Primary Care Centers. We intend to randomize 120 child-parent pairs (240 subjects) to receive
      PriCARE immediately plus usual treatment (intervention group) and 60 child-parent pairs (120
      subjects) to receive PriCARE at a later time plus usual treatment (control group) for a total
      of 180 child-parent pairs (360 subjects). All child-parent pairs randomized to the control
      group will be placed on a waitlist and offered PriCARE after completion of data collection.
      Child behavior and parenting style will be measured at baseline (time 1), at 6-19 weeks (time
      2), and at 14-27 weeks (time 3).
