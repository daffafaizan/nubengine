      levels of emission exhaust ultrafine and fine particulate matter. Exercise performance will
      be measured by work accumulation (total kJ) during a 6-min maximal effort cycle ergometer
      ride (CER) done immediately after 30 min cycling at 75% of 6 min mean watts determined from
      familiarization trial. Peak oxygen consumption, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure,
      diffusion capacity(DLco), and SaO2 will be determined for each trial. Blood and urine will be
      analyzed for sildenafil using LC/MS.
