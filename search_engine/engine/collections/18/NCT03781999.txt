      Targeted nutritional interventions may improve health and stimulate physical activity. Both
      orange extracts and pomegranate concentrate have been shown to exert beneficial effects on
      health and exercise performance. However, the effects of a combination of the two extracts on
      exercise and physical activity have not been investigated yet. It is expected that this
      combination may be an effective dietary way to improve exercise performance, physical
      activity in the free-living state, and quality of life in a middle aged population.
