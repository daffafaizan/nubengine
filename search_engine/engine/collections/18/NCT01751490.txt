    
      A two-arm, patient, physiotherapist and assessor-blinded, randomised controlled clinical
      trial will be conducted. 140 patients will be randomly allocated into one of 2 groups: a
      stabilisation surgery group and a control group. Primary outcomes (pain and disability) and
      secondary outcomes (participant-reported improvement and incidence of shoulder dislocations)
      will be evaluated at baseline and 6, 12 and 24 months after randomisation. Additional
      secondary outcomes of shoulder rotation range of motion and strength will be evaluated 6
      months after randomisation.
