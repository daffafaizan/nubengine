      and clinical stage. After obtaining baseline laboratory and clinical values (including an
      ECG, PSA, hematologic, and renal and hepatic panels), men will receive oral LDE225 800 mg/day
      or observation daily for 4 weeks (Â±3 days) prior to prostatectomy. Patients will have a
      clinical visit and an ECG and laboratory testing will be performed at 2 weeks and then again
      at 4 weeks, including a 4-week pre-prostatectomy measurement of PSA and a blood sample to
      determine plasma LDE225 levels. Men will undergo radical prostatectomy (with bilateral pelvic
      lymphadenectomy as appropriate), at which point two 250-mg biopsies of prostate tissue will
      be obtained, frozen and stored for analysis.
