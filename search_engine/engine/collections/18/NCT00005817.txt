      I. To assess the activity of rebeccamycin analog as therapy for advanced breast cancer when
      administered in two different treatment schedules.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity associated with administration of rebeccamycin analog therapy in
      women with advanced breast cancer.

      II. To evaluate topoisomerase I and II levels in human lymphocytes following treatment with
      rebeccamycin analog.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 60 minutes on day 1.

      Arm II: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
