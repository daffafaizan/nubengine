      stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissues and is cultured without additional genetic
      modification, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of
      immunologic rejection.

      It primarily aims to regenerate cartilage. The intra-articular injection of JOINTSTEM is
      expected to stimulate the regeneration of cartilage, and to innovatively improve joint
      function with cartilage regeneration.

      The subjects of this therapy were patients with K&L grade 3 aged 20 or older.

      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study with two arms to evaluate
      JOINTSTEM as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis. Following a 2-week screening
      period, approximately 21 patients will be randomly assigned into one of the following two
      arms in a 2:1 ratio (2 JointStem : 1 placebo control). After each patient completes 12-month
      visit (Visit 6) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the individual
      database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis.
