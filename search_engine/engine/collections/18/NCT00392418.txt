      This study will follow a community-based cluster randomized clinical trial design involving
      three intervention groups. Total number of villages included in the study will be determined
      by the availability of the eligible children. In each village, all eligible children will be
      screened through house-to-house visits. After the screening, all the children will be
      randomized by village using a table with randomly assorted table into one of three groups:

        -  Daily use of 60 Sprinkles® sachets over 60 days.

        -  Flexible use of 60 Sprinkles® sachets over 90 days.

        -  Flexible use of 60 Sprinkles® sachets over 120 days.

      In all groups, assessments will be done at baseline, at the end of a group's intervention and
      at 6 months after intervention in each group for follow-up.

      The study will take place in Kaligong sub-district in Bangladesh. All villages in Kaligonj
      sub-district consist of plain agricultural land. Subsistence farming is the major source of
      livelihood. Rice is the commonly eaten staple mixed with lentil and vegetable curry and
      occasionally with pieces of fish and meat. Similar to the rest of the plain areas of the
      country, malnutrition among women and children is widespread, but malaria is extremely
      uncommon and the prevalence of hookworm is fairly low (less than 2%%).
