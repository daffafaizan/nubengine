    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated-dose study to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) compared to placebo
      in the treatment of patients with fistulizing Crohn's disease. The primary efficacy outcome
      of the study is the number of patients with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the
      number of open fistulae observed for at least two consecutive evaluation visits.

      Patients will be treated with either anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) or matching
      placebo.
