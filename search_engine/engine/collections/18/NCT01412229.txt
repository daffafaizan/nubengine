    
      This is a non-randomized, open-label phase II trial of 40 patients with poor prognosis head
      and neck cancer, defined as surgically unresectable and/or â‰¥N2b disease and judged
      appropriate for non-surgical definitive therapy. Patients must have Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 with good organ function and will be treated
      with six weekly cycles of carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel and cetuximab prior to scheduled
      concomitant chemoradiation. The study is designed to evaluate whether this induction regimen
      can result in an improved response rate (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) with
      less toxicity than the current standard induction docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil
      (TPF) regimen.
