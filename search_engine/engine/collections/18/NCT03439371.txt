      diagnosis of 65 years. Outcomes of AML in elderly population remain unsatisfactory with low
      rates of complete remission, poor disease-free and overall survival. Therapeutic management
      of older patients with AML deals with patient-related features (i.e. comorbid conditions and
      performance status) as well as disease-related prognostic factors (i.e. cytogenetics and
      molecular genetics). Even if allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation provides the
      strongest antineoplasic effect, this treatment option remains limited for older patients
      owing to toxicities, the development of significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
      logistics of donor availability. More recently, micro-transplantation has emerged as an
      alternative strategy based on the infusion of mobilized HLA-mismatched related donor cells
      after induction chemotherapy, thus exerting a graft-versus-leukemia effect without
      substantial donor engraftment and GVHD. Therefore, there is much of interest in investigating
      the efficacy and the safety of this method for older patients with AML who are not candidates
      for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
