      I. Evaluate the activity of the combination of niraparib with epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) inhibitor panitumumab in previously treated patients with rat sarcoma gene
      (RAS) wild type (WT) metastatic colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the toxicity profile of the combination of niraparib and panitumumab.

      II. Evaluate the activity of the combination of niraparib and panitumumab in previously
      treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and panitumumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for
      2 years, and then annually for up to 5 years.
