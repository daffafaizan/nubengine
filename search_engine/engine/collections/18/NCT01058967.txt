    
      This study will be divided into three parts. The first portion involves the
      education/inservices of the aeromedical prehospital providers to document the knowledge and
      skills necessary to perform and interpret eFAST exams using ultrasound pre hospitalization.

      The second portion involves testing the logistics of utilization of prehospital ultrasound.
      Data will be collected by the participating aeromedical prehospital providers to rate the
      durability of the equipment, difficulty in preforming the eFAST exam, interference with other
      actions and ability of retention of images.

      The third portion will involve the aeromedical prehospital providers performing the eFAST
      exam using the ultrasound prehospital and comparing their findings with the gold standard
      exam, CT scan, while patient is in the emergency department.
