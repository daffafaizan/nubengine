      build bone, cartilage, tendons, cornea, skin, and connective tissue. Glycosaminoglycans
      (GAGs) are also found in the fluids that lubricate joints. Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) are
      part of the Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD) family, a group of more than 40 genetic
      diseases, and occur when a particular enzyme exists in a small quantity or is missing
      altogether. The effect is the accumulation of GAGs in the cells, blood, and connective
      tissues, resulting in permanent and progressive cellular damage which affects appearance,
      physical abilities, organ and system functioning and, in most cases, mental development.

      MPS2 (also called Hunter syndrome) is a hereditary, progressive, multisystemic disorder,
      caused by mutations in the IDS gene coding for the enzyme iduronate sulfatase (Ids). It is
      the only type of mucopolysaccharidosis that is X-linked, therefore, if mothers are carriers,
      there is a 50 percent chance for males to be born with the disease.

      MPS2 has a wide range of symptoms that vary in severity, which can be managed with enzyme
      replacement therapy (ERT). ERT is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore it
      addresses strictly extra-neurological manifestations. On this note, further efforts are being
      made to develop novel therapies, in the attempt to stop the disease progression and to offer
      a better quality of life to the patients.

      As MPS2 is very rare and many medical professionals only see a few or no patients in their
      lifelong practice, genetic testing is crucial for diagnosis. This study thrives to identify,
      validate, and monitor potential biomarker/s for MPS2 in genetically confirmed samples.
