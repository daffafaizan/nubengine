      study. The screening will take place at the Yale New Haven Hospital Research Unit (HRU) 10th
      floor, East Pavilion at 20 York St., New Haven, CT. At the screening visit informed consent
      will be obtained. Medical history and documents will be reviewed to screen potential subjects
      by inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will receive a physical examination and
      laboratory blood work (BUN/creatinine, electrolytes, lipid profile, liver function, and
      HbA1c) as well as urine toxicology screens (to confirm self-report of alcohol, and drug
      information) to ensure good physical health.
