    
      The purpose of this study is to help early-stage individuals who have early-stage memory loss
      or early stage dementia and their current or future care partners by providing education and
      skill-training programs designed to reduce stress and distress, increase well-being and
      quality of life, and plan for the future. About 160 early-stage dyads (person with
      early-stage dementia and his/her care partner) will be enrolled across Arizona and Nevada
      through Arizona State University.

      People who decide to voluntarily participate in this program, will be asked to:

        -  Meet others with memory loss and their care partners.

        -  Attend six group sessions (2 hours & 30 minutes each) to learn strategies to help handle
           new situations, reduce stress, improve mood, communicate better with each other, and
           plan for the future.

        -  Participate in one 90-minute individualized session to address specific issues that may
           be unique to each dyad's situation.

        -  Participate in five 2-hour confidential interviews that involve questions about
           background, mood, and quality of life.

        -  Participate in interviews at the start, and again about 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, to help
           us to continue to improve the program.

        -  Attend several monthly booster sessions after completion of the seven EPIC sessions.

      Each person will receive up to $95 for completing all follow-up interviews, or $20- 25 for
      each interview completed. All participants are offered the EPIC sessions shortly after their
      first interview or shortly after their 3-month interview. Some participants will also attend
      an additional free education workshop within one month of the initial assessment.
