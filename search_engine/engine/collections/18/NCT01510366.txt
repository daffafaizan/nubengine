      This is a randomized, blind phase 3 clinical trial. Total 1200 infants (ages 60 days to 90
      days) were selected, randomized to two groups (Sabin IPV and Salk IPV, each group n=600),
      infants in each group will be vaccinated with three doses of either Sabin IPV or Salk IPV
      respectively, one month apart.
