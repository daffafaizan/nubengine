      cancer. Unfortunately for patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer incomplete
      tumor eradication and subsequent relapse occurs in 50-75% of patients. The Src pathway
      appears to be integral to the pathobiology of prostate cancer and may be fundamental to
      radioresistance.

      The primary objective of this trial will be to establish the safety of dasatinib with
      androgen deprivation and radiation for prostate cancer. Three dasatinib dose levels will be
      evaluated, 50 mg/day, 70 mg/day and 100 mg/day. Dasatinib will begin with day #1 of radiation
      and will be discontinued once radiation is completed. The study treatment period, therefore,
      will be when patients receive concurrent dasatinib, hormone therapy and radiation to 30 days
      after the last radiation/dasatinib treatment. However, it will be highly recommended that,
      prior to entering the study, patients receive 2 months of androgen deprivation with a LHRH
      agonist. Furthermore, it will be highly recommended that, after completion of dasatinib
      /hormone therapy/radiation, patients with intermediate risk disease receive approximately 2
      additional months of hormone therapy (to complete 6 months of hormone therapy) and patients
      with high risk disease receive 20 additional months of ADT to complete 2 years of hormone
      therapy. If casodex was given at onset of diagnosis, patient must be off drug for 6 weeks
      prior to beginning radiation therapy
