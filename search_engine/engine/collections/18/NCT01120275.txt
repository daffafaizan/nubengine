    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the six-month progression-free survival and one-year overall survival
      probability in Stage IV melanoma patients treated with RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate in a preliminary manner the relationship between Notch activation status
      and gene expression profile of tumor and clinical outcomes from patients in this study.

      II. To study the effects of the investigational therapy on T cell function, which will
      provide a basis for subsequent trials combining Notch blockade with immunomodulatory therapy
      for advanced melanoma.

      III. To assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial responses).

      IV. To assess toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) on
      days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients undergo blood collection at baseline and during study for analysis of T-cell
      function by flow cytometry and ELISA. Tumor tissue samples from biopsy or surgery are also
      analyzed for Notch activation by IHC and qRT-PCR.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
