      be able to access from any device with internet connection (cell phone included).

      The trial will include patients with shoulder pain because of rotator cuff tendinopathy.

      The investigators will carry on a pilot study with 100 patients randomly distributed into two
      groups, with 6 months follow up. Both groups will perform the same treatment, but the control
      group won´t use the exercise app. There will be four dependent variables: correct exercise
      performance, compliance degree, satisfaction with the treatment and expectations to improve
      with treatment. As secondary dependent variables will be analyzed pain (at rest, with
      movement and at night), functional disability (SPADI questionnaire), and patient´s assessment
      of app video characteristics (usability, utility and satisfaction) and co-interventions.
