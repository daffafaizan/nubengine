      interventions (BI) for excessive or "hazardous" alcohol use in patients seen in medical
      settings. Dissemination projects of brief interventions for alcohol and drugs have recently
      been implemented on a widespread scale. This rapid progression of brief intervention for
      drugs other than alcohol has outstripped its evidence base.

      The aims of the study as outlined in the grant are:

        1. To examine whether BI is effective at improving outcomes (self-reported drug use and
           attendance in drug abuse treatment) in individuals with a wide range of problem drug use
           over and above enhanced care as usual. The enhanced control condition will consist of
           routine screening, patient notification, and referral for treatment.

        2. To test whether fidelity to the BI model or lower severity of drug use is associated
           with better outcomes.

        3. To estimate the impact of BI on several public health outcomes that are directly related
           to the hazardous effects of illicit drug use, including the use of acute health care
           services, involvement in the criminal justice system, employment, HIV risk behavior, and
           mortality.

        4. To estimate the costs of the intervention, potential cost offsets, and its incremental
           cost-effectiveness versus enhanced usual care from the payer perspective based on health
           care service use and drug use frequency.
