      and, if needed, short-term follow-up will have equivalent clinical outcomes when seen via
      telepsychiatry as compared to those patients seen in-person. We also predicted that
      telepsychiatry will be cheaper than in-person care.Study Design: a single-centre equivalence
      trial.We will use a sample size calculation and analytical methods that are specifically
      tailored for equivalence trials.
