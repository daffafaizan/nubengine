    
      Study Procedures:

      Once patients have signed an informed consent they will be asked to complete the ACP
      evaluation questionnaire. Their level of frailty will be assessed with the 5-meter walk test.
      Two weeks after discharge (+ or - 7 days) they will be contacted by phone in order to
      complete 3 sections of the CANHELP questionnaire.

      Study Tools

      Patient questionnaires:
