      K2 intake, notably the higher menaquinones, MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9. Of these higher
      menaquinones, MK-7 was suggested to be the most effective form with respect to intestinal
      absorption, biologic half-life time, and efficacy on circulating biochemical markers. MK-7 is
      a natural product that is found in cheese, curd, and the Japanese food natto. Therefore, a
      nutrient enriched dairy product has been developed containing MK-7. The efficacy of this new
      product will be investigated on vitamin K status and on general health markers.
