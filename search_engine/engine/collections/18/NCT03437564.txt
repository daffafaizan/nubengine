      being tested in Japanese healthy adult participants. This study will look at the
      bioequivalence of a single oral administration of a vortioxetine 20 mg tablet in comparison
      with two of vortioxetine 10 mg tablets, and also look at the safety of a single oral dose of
      vortioxetine 20 mg in Japanese healthy adult participants.

      The study will enroll 28 (14 for each sequence) healthy participants. In case bioequivalence
      cannot be demonstrated with the number of participants initially planned, an add-on
      participant study may be conducted (as a maximum 28 participants additionally). Participants
      will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment
      groups.

        -  Treatment Group A: Vortioxetine 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet) in Period 1 + Vortioxetine 20
           mg (two 10 mg tablets) in Period 2

        -  Treatment Group B: Vortioxetine 20 mg (two 10 mg tablets) in Period 1 + Vortioxetine 20
           mg (one 20 mg tablet) in Period 2

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 25 days. Participants will make two visits to the clinic and be
      hospitalized for ten days in total.
