      the impact of molecular signatures and molecular heterogeneity on disease-free survival after
      surgery in IIIA-N2 NSCLC patients. Identification of specific molecular profiles in primary
      tumors and evolution profiles in nodes might provide clues to the potential risk of
      metastatic evolution and trigger specific management.

      For patients included prospectively, we planned to analyze cell free circulating tumor DNA
      (ctDNA) as prognostic marker. Because multiple biopsies are not always available in care
      settings, ctDNA could also be analyzed as a surrogate marker of molecular heterogeneity. Next
      generation sequencing (NGS) that was validated in our lab to screen ctDNA using a specific
      bio-informatics workflow allows accurate and cost effective ctDNA screening
