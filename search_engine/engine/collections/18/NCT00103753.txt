      results in abnormal red cell production. The survival of affected individuals is dependent
      upon lifelong blood transfusions. Unfortunately, this causes total body iron overload, and
      50% of the patients in the UK are dead by the age of 35. Approximately 70% of these deaths
      result from heart failure which results as a consequence of cardiac iron toxicity.

      A Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) technique (which exploits the fact that T2* signal
      decay relates to tissue iron) developed at the Royal Brompton Hospital provides a
      non-invasive and reproducible assessment of cardiac iron. CMR therefore provides a very
      useful method to assess response to new treatments in this condition. Using cardiac T2* as a
      primary endpoint, we will investigate whether the oral chelator, deferiprone in combination
      with traditional treatment (deferoxamine), is superior in removing cardiac iron as compared
      to deferoxamine alone. This trial will provide the first randomized controlled,
      double-blinded, evidence for the efficacy of combination treatment in TM.
