      study. The study will observe subjects and specific outcomes from the time a PICC insertion
      procedure begins until the subject is cleared for administration of their prescribed therapy.
      It will compare two approaches for PICC line placement and confirmation of PICC tip
      placement.

      The two methods for placing and confirming PICC lines to be examined in this study are: 1)
      Standard of Care, defined as PICC line placement with Chest X-ray tip confirmation, and 2)
      Sherlock 3CG® TCS magnetic tracking PICC placement and ECG-based tip confirmation. These two
      approaches are currently in use, and are not investigational.

      The study will evaluate the time elapsed from the beginning of PICC line placement procedure
      through the catheter tip confirmation (subject released for IV therapy). A researcher will
      observe from the time the catheter kit is opened until your catheter is cleared for
      administration of treatment. Limited subject follow-up includes review of subject medical
      records related to the PICC line placement. Subjects will be followed only up to the point at
      which the PICC line tip has been confirmed and the subject has been released to receive IV
      therapy. For most subjects, all study data will be collected on Day 1.

      The study is expected to include 120 subjects, 60 subjects will have confirmed PICC line
      placement using Chest X-ray, and 60 will have confirmed PICC line placement using Sherlock
      3CG® TCS. Each group of subjects will be from two clinical sites using either tip
      confirmation method, for a total of 4 study sites.
