      hypertension and its adverse consequences. Despite the availability of numerous effective
      pharmacologic treatments, adequate blood pressure control is not achieved in a large number
      of subjects. Patients with essential hypertension generally have increased efferent
      sympathetic drive to the kidneys and an increased rate of sympathetic-nerve firing, possibly
      modulated by afferent signalling from renal sensory nerves. Recently developed endovascular
      catheter technology enables selective denervation of the human kidney. A safety and
      feasibility trial of this procedure identified substantial reductions of blood pressure
      without substantial procedure-related complications. The therapeutic value seems to be
      present not only in hypertension but may also be of interest in many clinical conditions e.g.
      heart failure, chronic end-stage renal disease and insulin resistance and diabetes.

      The present study (COMBI-RDN) is a randomised clinical trial in 40 patients to investigate
      safety and efficacy of the combination of Percutan Coronar Interventiom (PCI) and renal
      denervation (RDN) where RDN is performed early after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This
      study is considered a pilot study to evaluate efficacy and safety in patients with ACS. In a
      second phase there will be a randomised, multicenter study in approximately 2500 patients to
      demonstrate whether RDN early post ACS could decrease major adverse cardiovascular events in
      hypertensive patients with ACS.

      Research hypothesis Is the treatment with renal denervation (RDN) early post ACS safe and
      effective and does it leads to improved cardiac function and attenuation of pathologic left
      ventricular remodelling?
