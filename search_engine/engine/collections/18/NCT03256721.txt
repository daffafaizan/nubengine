      lung cancer (NSCLC). Detection and early intervention are difficult because pathogenesis of
      NSCLC is not yet entirely clear.Most of them are advanced or metastatic patients, so approach
      3/4 NSCLC undergo chemotherapy. Fewer treatment options exist on NSCLC whom is wild type of
      EGFR. The patient did not benefit from the existing treatment regimen after first-line
      treatment. There is currently no effective drug to treat this group of patients.

      Apatinib, a novel targeted inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), shows significant antitumor
      activity in the patients with GC. The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib
      plus chemotherapy drug can improve progression free survival compared with chemotherapy drug
      in patients with metastatic the non-small cell lung cancer who failed one lines of
      chemotherapy.
