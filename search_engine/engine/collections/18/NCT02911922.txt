    
      This is a randomized, two arm study for patients with low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk
      prostate cancer as defined by 1.2016 NCCN criteria.

      Patients will be randomized to either rectal spacer placement or endorectal balloon
      placement, daily prior to each radiation treatment.

        1. Endorectal balloon (ERB): Immobilization device manually placed into the rectum prior to
           radiation treatment planning CT and daily treatment delivery, to immobilize the prostate
           and reduce prostate motion.

        2. Rectal spacer (RS): Biodegradable gel that is transperineally injected between the
           rectum and prostate under transrectal ultrasound guidance, to increase physical distance
           and thereby reduce radiation dose to the anterior rectal wall. The spacer begins to
           biodegrade in 2-3 months, and is fully absorbed within 6 months.

      This study plans to enroll a total of 40 patients with an accrual period of 4 years.
