      bevacizumab is needed to ensure that no specific toxicity is induced by this association, and
      that this triplet have interesting activity. As pleural mesoth√©lioma is a rare tumor, a phase
      III trial, using the survival data from the phase II part study, will be able to include a
      sufficient number of patients, in a reasonable period of time, to answer the question of
      efficacy of the anti-angiogenic triplet, providing the efficacy outcomes could be considered
      as favorable, at the end of the phase II part of the study.
