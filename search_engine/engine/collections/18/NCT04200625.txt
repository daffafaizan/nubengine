      retrospective review of the electronic medical records.

      Patients were treated with either semaglutide, dulaglutide or metformin as standard of care,
      during routine clinical practice, regardless of the study. Each patient underwent routine
      labs and an onsite ultrasound measurement of EAT thickness at baseline and at the routine
      12-week follow up visit, as standard of care.
