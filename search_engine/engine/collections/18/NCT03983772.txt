      Inflammatory Bowel diseases, colorectal cancer, obesity, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and more.
      The incidence of chronic diseases is greater in the industrialized society consuming a diet
      low in microbiota-accessible-carbohydrates. Thus, research is growing to seek prebiotics,
      which are substrates that host microbes selectively use, providing a health benefit.

      Better-tolerated prebiotics may be desirable, particularly for those avoiding FODMAPs
      (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) due to
      gastrointestinal distress. Additionally, the intestinal microbiome may benefit from a
      diversity of prebiotics that may affect different types of bacteria to contribute to overall
      microbial diversity as well as provide stronger effects on positive outcomes. Resistant
      starch type 2, also called RS2, so named due to its ability to resist digestion in the upper
      gastrointestinal tract, is a candidate prebiotic, growing in popularity for increasing
      beneficial intestinal bacteria and improving gastrointestinal symptoms and reducing glycemic
      responses.

      This study aims to test the hypothesis that a unique blend of resistant starches and fiber
      will promote gastrointestinal health, as measured by an increase in short-chain fatty acids
      and improvement in quality of life measures in conjunction with microbial community changes.
      This study specifically evaluates the impact on short-chain fatty acids and gut microbiota
      and the impact on quality of life from a resistant starch blend in healthy adult humans with
      occasional gastrointestinal distress.
