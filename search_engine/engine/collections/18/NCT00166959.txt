      Impaired postural stability has been shown as one of the primary risk factors of falls in
      these patients. Research has shown that patients who have moderate level of mobility and
      stability are more likely to fall than those who have very good or very poor mobility and
      stability. Therefore, there is an urgent need for physical therapists, who are used to play
      an important role in improving balance function of patients with stroke, to be able to early
      detect stroke patients who are at high risk of falls, and to implement fall prevention
      training and education on these patients. However, to date, there is not any clinical
      assessment scale that can be used for early detection of fall-prone stroke patients.
