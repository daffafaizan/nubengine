      {MarketScan Commercial (2000-2010)} and the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database
      {MarketScan Medicaid (2002-2009)} will be analyzed separately; no merging of the databases
      will occur.

      The claims data extracts are fully de-identified and compliant with the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (U.S.) (HIPAA).

      The children will be observed from birth to the earliest of end of continuous eligibility
      (due to disenrollment, data cut-off, or death) or 5 years of age. Observation time will be
      classified using two different definitions of Rotarix vaccination coverage, and analyses will
      be conducted for each different scenario.

      The two definitions for Rotarix vaccination coverage are:

        1. Rotarix vaccination according to compliance with the Advisory Committee on Immunization
           Practices (ACIP)-specified vaccination window of 6 weeks to 8 months old.

        2. Rotarix vaccination according to compliance with the Rotarix prescribing information
           (PI) window of 6 weeks to 6 months old.

      All outcomes will be analysed for 1) vaccination coverage according to compliance with the
      ACIP vaccination window, and 2) vaccination coverage according to compliance with PI
      vaccination window; for both Rotarix vaccination coverage scenarios there will be four
      cohorts.

      An additional 'complete Rotarix vaccination off-ACIP/off-PI' cohort will be created if more
      than 5 percent of total person-time in the four cohorts would be complete vaccination if
      vaccine doses outside of the vaccination window were considered.
