    
      This study will be carried out in 2 parts:

      Part 1: A sequential Dose Escalation Part of four doses following a 3 + 3 design where dose
      escalation will be made based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), for a single cycle (28-days)
      of BEL-X-HG treatment

      Part 2: A Dose Extension Part of up to 5 cycles (28-days each) at the same dose level
      (starting dose) of BEL-X-HG treatment

      Approximately 24-48 eligible subjects with confirmed advanced refractory solid tumors will be
      enrolled sequentially, in 3 subject cohorts, from the lower to the higher dose cohort into
      the study. Escalating dose levels of BEL-X-HG in 4 study cohorts and one modified dose will
      be as follows:

      Cohort 1: Dose level 1 - 0.5 g/day (0.25 g, bid)

      Cohort 2: Dose level 2 - 1.0 g/day (0.5 g, bid)

      Cohort 3: Dose level 3 - 2.0 g/day (1.0 g, bid)

      Cohort 4: Dose level 4 - 4.0 g/day (2.0 g, bid)

      Modified dose level Cohort 5: Dose level 5 - 1.5 g/day (0.75g bid) This re-escalation is
      allowed only when dose de-escalates from Dose level 3 to Dose level 2, and 1 DLT in 6
      evaluable subjects of Dose level 2.

      BEL-X-HG will be administered orally at the assigned dose level for a single cycle consisting
      of 28 days during the Dose Escalation Part to each subject. Thereafter, if eligible and
      willing, subjects can continue to Extension Part for 5 more cycles of treatment (each cycle
      lasting 28 days), at the same assigned dose level of BEL-X-HG treatment.
