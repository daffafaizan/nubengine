      hemodialysis of the hemodialysis.Intradialytic hypotension is a decrease in systolic BP by
      â‰¥20 mm Hg or a decrease in mean arterial pressure of 10 mm Hg associated with symptoms like
      cramps, dizziness, headache ,nausea and vomiting according to The National Kidney
      Foundation.Intradialytic hypotension occurs during 20%-30% of hemodialysis sessions. It is
      associated with poor long-term outcomes. Patients with Intradialytic hypotension show
      increased morbidity and mortality.The etiology of Intradialytic hypotension is multifactorial
      and depends on patient-related factors, as well as on complications related to the dialysis
      procedure. The main causes Intradialytic hypotension have been reported to be acute
      hypovolemia during ultrafiltration and inadequate compensatory mechanisms such as left
      ventricular dysfunction, inappropriate plasma refilling ,Impaired vasoconstriction induced by
      dysregulation of autonomic nervous system.

      Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of chronic renal failure .Diabetic patients are
      more prone to cardiovascular diseases than non-diabetics .Although diabetes is in relation
      with hypertension ,It is associated with autonomic neuropathy which contribute to
      intradialytic hypotension . Recent researches suggested that older age and long dialytic age
      may incease risk of intradialytic hypotension.
