      enhanced local control with the addition of radiation therapy to adjuvant FFX. The recently
      reported PRODIGE 24 study, demonstrated that 12 cycles of adjuvant FFX without radiation
      therapy significantly improved survival and time to metastatic failure rates as compared to
      GEM alone. Excessive distant failures rates using prior adjuvant systemic therapies, may have
      limited the impact of radiation therapy; therefore, improvements in systemic control can
      increase the benefit of local control.

      In this study, the investigators utilize 5 fraction PRT, delivered over 1 week, during
      adjuvant FFX (between cycles 6 and 7) to minimize the interruptions in chemotherapy as well
      as to reduce the length of time from surgical resection to initiating adjuvant radiation
      therapy. Conventional radiation therapy is typically delivered over 5 weeks and is commonly
      given after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Conventional radiation therapy cannot be
      given concurrently with FFX due to the synergistic toxicities. In contrast, PRT significantly
      reduces the exposure of normal tissues to the effects of radiation therapy and has been
      safely delivered using a 5 fraction schedule with chemotherapy, as previously discussed.

      Chemotherapy will consist of mFOLFIRINOX in 14-day cycles x 12 as used in the PRODIGE 24
      study:

        -  Irinotecan 150 mg/m2 IV day 1

        -  Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV day 1

        -  Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV day 1

        -  5-fluorouracil 2,400 mg/m2 IV days 1-3 (no bolus)

        -  Pegfilgrastim 6 mg SC on-body injector day 3 (optional, up to investigator's discretion,
           can alternatively do day 4 without on-body injector)

        -  Suggested supportive care medications: fosaprepitant 150 mg IV day 1, dexamethasone 12
           mg IV day 1, ondansetron 16 mg IV day 1, dexamethasone 4 mg PO q AM days 2-3,
           ondansetron 8 mg PO BID days 2-3.

        -  Dose adjustments will be permitted at the discretion of the treating oncologist based on
           patients' prior tolerability to FFX

        -  Proton radiation will consistent of 5 daily doses of 5 GyE total, ideally administered
           Monday through Friday but can be administered within 7 business days, between cycles 6
           and 7
