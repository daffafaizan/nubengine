      treatment of localized prostate cancer and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the
      MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens to evaluate the
      maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and
      within 6 months after the completion of CIRT. Once the MTD for localized prostate cancer is
      determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria in the Phase II part of the trial.
