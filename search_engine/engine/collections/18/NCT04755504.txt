      electrodes behind each ear. The device was designed as a wearable for seizure detection in
      epilepsy patients. The purpose of this study is to test its ability to capture the
      information necessary for sleep monitoring in elderly patients. Trained electrophysiologists
      are unable to stage sleep on data from novel wearable devices, since AASM sleep scoring rules
      are only defined for standardized recording positions on the head. Therefore, we need an
      automated algorithm to perform sleep staging with data from the Sensor Dot device. We will
      train this algorithm using manual annotations made with the polysomnography simultaneously
      acquired with the wearable EEG.
