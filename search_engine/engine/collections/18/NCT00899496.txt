        -  Optimize and standardize the in vitro cell kill assay using human white blood cells and
           human cancer cell lines from patients with metastatic cancer and from healthy
           participants.

        -  Determine the results of the in vitro cell kill assay in patients with metastatic cancer
           and in healthy participants with no history of cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Peripheral blood is obtained from healthy participants and from cancer patients. Tissue is
      collected from archived samples. White blood cells are obtained from tissue and blood samples
      and are assessed by the in vitro cell kill assay.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients and 24 healthy participants will be accrued for
      this study.
