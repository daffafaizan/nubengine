      will be the most efficient and the safest. Every centre will follow its own local protocol
      for AHSCT which usually refers to the recent update of the EBMT Guidelines for HSCT in
      autoimmune disease. Patient selection for AHSCT treatment technique with regard to the
      risk/benefit balance has to be carefully addressed by standard patient pretransplant
      evaluation, whereas treatment local regimen, follow-ups evaluation, supportive medication and
      prophylaxis will be recorded and analysed.
