      counteracts the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. According to epidemiological
      data, exercise is also associated with a reduced risk of tumour developement and an improval
      of survival in some tumours. However, the underlying mechanisms by which exercise affects
      tumour cells are poorly understood in adult cancer patients and mostly unknown in children.
      Recent studies demonstrate anti-cancer effects of exercise-induced adrenaline through natural
      killer cell mobilisation and Hippo signalling. In addition, several exercise-induced
      molecules such as catecholamines (e.g., adrenaline) are known to change cancer cell
      signalling, proliferation and have been linked to clinical outcomes such as survival. The aim
      of this pilot study is the analysation of exercise-induced changes in adrenaline
      concentration in childhood cancer patients and to show feasibility of the study concept.
      Following recruitment within the first and third cycle of chemotherapy and consent for study
      participation, all recruited patients perform a single high-intensity interval exercise
      intervention on a cycle ergometer. Intensity of the intervals is examined both subjectively
      via a scale for rate of perceived exertion and objectively via changes in lactate
      concentration pre- and post-exercise as well as heart rate monitoring. Blood samples are
      taken by trained personnel staff and prepared for processing (centrifuged, snap-frozen).
      Changes in adrenaline concentration are measured with a commercial ELISA kit. For further
      identification of metabolites that change with exercise, a non-biased mass spectrometry
      metabolomics analysis will be used.
