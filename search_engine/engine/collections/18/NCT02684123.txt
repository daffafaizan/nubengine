    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study consisting of two phases.
      A total of 30 subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata (including universalis and
      totalis) involving 50-100% of the scalp will be enrolled. A possible maximum of 15 patients
      (approximately 7 patients each) with current episodes of AA totalis / universalis may be
      included in this study.

      In Phase 1, subjects will be randomized (2:1) to either receive apremilast or placebo for 24
      weeks.

      In Phase 2, eligible subjects will receive apremilast from Week 24 through Week 48. The
      following subjects will be eligible to enter into Phase 2:

        1. Subjects who received placebo in Phase 1 of the study

        2. Subjects who received apremilast in Phase 1 of the study, and who achieved a minimum of
           50% regrowth (SALT50) at Week 24, compared to Baseline.
