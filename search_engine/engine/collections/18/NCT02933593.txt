      from outside hospitals to Labor & Delivery or the Perinatal Special Care Unit (PSCU). All
      women with severe hypertension (defined as 160/110 or above for 15 minutes or more) will be
      screened for inclusion and asked to participate in the study. If the woman agrees to
      participate she will be randomized to one of three groups with the following protocol:

      Labetalol Administer 20mg IV labetalol Repeat BP in 10 minutes, if still severe administer
      40mg IV Labetalol Repeat BP in 10 minutes, if still elevated administer 80mg IV Labetalol
      Repeat BP in 10 minutes, if still elevated administer 10mg IV Hydralazine Repeat BP in 20
      minutes, if still elevated consider ICU consult Hydralazine Administer 5mg IV hydralazine
      Repeat BP in 20 minutes, if still elevated administer 10mg IV Hydralazine Repeat BP in 20
      minutes, still elevated administer labetalol 20mg IV Repeat BP in 10 minutes, still elevated
      administer labetalol 40mg IV and consider ICU consult Nifedipine Administer procardia 10mg po
      Repeat BP in 20 min, if still elevated administer procardia 20mg po Repeat BP in 20 min, if
      still elevated administer procardia 20mg po Repeat BP in 20 min, if still elevated administer
      labetalol 40mg IV and consider ICU consult

      Administration of medication will be determined by the routine sphygmomanometer blood
      pressure as that is what the guidelines are based upon.

      Women will then have their central arterial pressure and their carotid waveform assessed
      before administration of medication. The central pressure will be assessed every 5 minutes
      and carotid waveforms every 10 minutes until blood pressures are <160/110 for 20 minutes.

      Administration of the above medications is standard of care. Randomization to different
      medications, measuring the central pressure and the carotid waveform is part of the study.

      Once the patient's BP stays below 160/110 for 20 minutes their participation in the study
      will end.
