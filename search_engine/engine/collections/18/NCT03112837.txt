      and neck radiotherapy.It can lead to dose-limiting and debilitating side effect. There is no
      guideline on an acknowledged intervention that significantly reduces its severity. In the
      mucosa, the immune system's T cells and B cells have position-specific phenotypes and
      functions that are influenced by the microbiota. These cells play pivotal parts in the
      maintenance of immune homeostasis by suppressing responses to harmless antigens and by
      enforcing the integrity of the barrier functions of the gut mucosa.We designed a randomized
      trial of Live Combined Bifidobacterium,Lactobacillus and Enterococcus Capsules in patients
      with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. The aim of this study was to determine if regulating
      intestinal tract flora was effective in reducing the severity of radiation-induced mucositis
      in patients receiving radical dose radiotherapy. The effect of this intervention on a
      patient's general well-being was also investigated. The primary end-point of the study was
      the incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 mucositis.In 2017, 40 patients are
      estimated to be recruited into the study at Jiangxi Cancer Hospitals, China.20 patients were
      randomized to receive Live Combined Bifidobacterium,Lactobacillus and Enterococcus Capsules
      and 20 to receive a placebo.
