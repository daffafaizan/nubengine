    
      This Phase 1 study is designed as a cell dose escalation trial evaluating the safety of
      TAEST16001 T cell therapy in subjects with NSCLC who have received prior therapy for their
      disease but the disease has progressed or relapsed. Anti-tumor activity and other exploratory
      objectives will be assessed. Subjects enter from a Screening Protocol and are positive for
      HLA-A2*02:01 and have tumor that express NY-ESO-1. The subjects will be evaluated DLT and MTD
      using a modified 3+3 cell dose escalation design to determine the cell dose range. Subjects
      will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (250-500mg/m2/day) plus
      fludarabine (25mg/m2/day) on day -7 to day -5 followed by infusion of dose of about 5Ã—109
      TAEST16001 and IL-2(s.c.).

      Subjects will stay in hospital for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion
      (Day 0) through Day 7, and then weekly until week 4 and then at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks
      and every 3 months until progression of their disease.
