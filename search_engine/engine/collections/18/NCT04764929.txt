      respiratory distress syndrome, superior tolerance and improved respiratory scores compared to
      nasal/facial CPAP in infants, and no major safety concerns were identified with the use of
      helmet CPAP. This is a prospective pilot study to (1) determine if infants and pediatric
      patients requiring CPAP in the PICU will tolerate helmet CPAP for at least four hours, and
      (2) measure changes in the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate and blood pressure
      over four hours. If helmet CPAP is found to be well tolerated in this small cohort, a larger
      study comparing it directly to other CPAP interfaces will be conducted.
