      the effect of soy protein supplementation on HDL function. To ensure that there are no
      effects of treatment order on outcome measures, subjects will be randomized to a treatment
      sequence. Healthy males and females (n = 20; 35 to 60 years of age) with systolic blood
      pressure greater than 120 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 80 mm Hg will be
      recruited for this study. Subjects will undergo 3 treatment periods in random order. These
      treatment periods will include: A) 25 g/d soy protein powder; B) 50 g/d soy protein powder;
      C) 0 g/d protein powder (control). Each treatment will be provided for 6 weeks separated by a
      2-week break between treatment periods. All subjects will be encouraged to maintain body
      weight and physical activity levels during the study.
