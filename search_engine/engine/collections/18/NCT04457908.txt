      function, including the timed up-and-go test, mini-cognitive assessment, and sentence
      repetition. Subjects will be recorded using a camera and microphone. The intelligent system
      uses the built-in intelligent algorithm to analyze the gait video, sound, and picture to
      provide information on gait features (stand-up time, turnaround time, stride length, step
      velocity, stride length, step width, etc.), language features (pronunciation, intonation,
      word order, language accuracy, language fluency, etc.), and clock features (contour, numbers,
      pointers, etc.).

      All subjects in the doctor group will consult with a doctor in the non-intelligent group
      according to the routine treatment procedure. Doctors in the non-intelligent group are
      required to be internal medicine clinicians with intermediate title or below, and they should
      have registered their qualifications, relevant knowledge and training experience, educational
      background, and other information in the early stage of the study. The doctors in the
      non-intelligent group will make clinical diagnoses for the subjects based on routine medical
      operations such as a history of the present illness, previous history, and physical
      examination, and the data in medical records in the outpatient department will help determine
      whether the subjects have gait disorders.

      All subjects' walking videos will be assessed by the gold-standard panel, which will consist
      of 2 experts of movement disorders. If there is any difference, a third expert will be
      included in the evaluation. According to the clinical experience, the expert doctors will
      evaluate the subjects' gait, and the results will be divided into normal gait and abnormal
      gait.
