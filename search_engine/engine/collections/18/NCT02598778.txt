      been obtained, the participant will be randomly assigned to one of the four mouth rinses
      being studied. A pre rinse stimulated salivary sample will be taken in which about 3cm of a
      sterile tongue depressor is introduced into the mouth and turned around 10 times to
      contaminate it with saliva. Each side of the spatula was then pressed against a petri dish
      containing Mitis-salivarius agar. The patient will then rinse 10 ml of the assigned rinse for
      a timed 30 seconds, expectorate, and then a post stimulated salivary sample will be taken
      similarly to the pre rinse sample. The samples will be transported to a lab for incubation
      and quantitative analysis of Streptococcus Mutans.
