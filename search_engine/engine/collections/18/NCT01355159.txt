      worldwide and has serious health consequences to these women and their babies. Preeclampsia
      is hypertension (high blood pressure) in pregnancy with proteinuria. Proteinuria is when
      protein is found in the urine, and it is a sign that the kidneys are not functioning
      properly. The only effective treatment for preeclampsia is delivery of the baby. Because
      delivery may be required before the anticipated date of delivery; preeclampsia is also one of
      the leading causes of preterm delivery and accounts for 25% of very low birth weight infants.
      Recent research has also shown that women who have had preeclampsia during pregnancy are more
      likely to be at risk for future cardiovascular events later in life.

      Recently some studies have shown that supplementation with multivitamins containing folic
      acid is associated with a reduced risk of developing preeclampsia. These findings also
      suggested that for the prevention of preeclampsia, a high dose of folic acid (much higher
      than the amount of folate received from food intake or what is usually taken during
      pregnancy) may be needed.

      A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 70 obstetrical centres in 5 countries
      (Argentina, Australia, Canada, Jamaica, and the UK) to evaluate the effect of high dose folic
      acid started in early pregnancy on the risk of developing preeclampsia in high-risk women. A
      sample size of 2464 allowed for 80% power and a 10% loss to follow-up/study withdrawal.
      Participants received either placebo or four 1.0 mg oral tablets of folic acid.
