      intra-nasally was shown to be effective, safe, well tolerated, immunogenic - in both systemic
      and mucosal compartments - and effective at preventing influenza illness.

      In two separate studies using the Human Viral Challenge Model, subjects were selected for
      susceptibility to A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus and then dosed with one of three regimens:
      (A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1), A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2), B/Victoria/504/2000 or
      B/Shangdong/7/1997) or placebo via a nasal spray. One or two doses were given, 14 days apart,
      before subjects were challenged with ~8.5 x 105 EIDÂ¬50 of A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) virus.
      Immune responses to the vaccine antigens were measured, namely serum IgG (via the
      aemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI)) and nasal wash secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies (via
      ELISA). Viral titres in nasal washes and symptoms of influenza illness were assessed after
      viral challenge and compared.
