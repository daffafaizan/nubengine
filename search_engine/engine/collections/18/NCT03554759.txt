      prospectively from patient visits occurring within approximately 7 calendar days prior to the
      first dose of avatrombopag, on Procedure Day, on Discharge Day, and from any clinic visit
      performed up to 30 days post-procedure. All treatment decisions and clinical assessments will
      be at the discretion of the treating physician per routine medical care and are not mandated
      by study design or protocol.
