    
      The new immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) derivatives of thalidomide (CC-5013 lenalidomide and
      CC4047 pomalidomide) are endowed of direct antitumor activity besides the indirect effects
      attributed to antiangiogenic, antiinflammatory and T-cell co-stimulatory properties.

      Combination therapy with cytotoxic agents or other anticancer drugs could lead to additive or
      synergistic interactions and support their clinical development in tumor types in which the
      specific activities of IMiDs could be of potential value.

      Combinations with weekly paclitaxel could be of interest because of its antiangiogenic
      activity, antitumor activity in prostate, NSCLC, ovary, breast cancer, tumor types in which
      IMiD could be of clinical value because of either enhancement of tumor specific immunity
      (ovary, prostate) or inhibition of Treg function (breast, NSCLC, ovary).
