    
      PRECISE is an open-label, single arm, single-center site study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dosing interval-optimized etanercept in
      obese patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA).
      Approximately 30 patients with JIA or RA who are starting etanercept standard-of-care will
      take part in the study.

      Eligible patients will have blood collections before and after starting the biologic of
      interest to assess PK and disease activity. Five (5) blood samples will be collected through
      a combination of clinic and home visits.
