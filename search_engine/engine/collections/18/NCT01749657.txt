      tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD). Data on currently used devices remain limited. Current
      device designs are restrictive and focus on correction of flatfoot kinematics in subjects
      with stage II PTTD. Restrictive designs that limit ankle motion may lead to weakness and
      altered gait dynamics. It remains unclear if less restrictive device designs would be more
      optimal for subjects with stage II PTTD. The aims of the current proposal are to examine the
      in-vivo biomechanics of different device designs and to use outcomes to identify the device
      and design optimal for subjects with stage II PTTD. Research Design: This study will use a
      laboratory based repeated measures design to explore the function of four different orthotic
      devices in a sample of 60 subjects with stage II PTTD at baseline. Then each subject will be
      followed prospectively for 12 weeks while wearing one of the orthotic devices. Clinical
      outcomes including strength, tendon morphology, and self-reported outcomes will be measured
      at 12 weeks. Baseline foot kinematics will be collected using a three segment foot model
      (first metatarsal, calcaneus, tibia) while data on ankle kinetics will be derived from the
      kinematic data and the ground reaction forces. Impact: There are currently no head-to-head
      comparisons available among the various devices used in the conservative management of stage
      II PTTD. The proposed study will provide the necessary controlled data to determine the
      kinematic and kinetic effects of selected devices and the specific components needed to
      optimize device design. Outcomes will be used to determine which designs are successful to
      use clinically.
