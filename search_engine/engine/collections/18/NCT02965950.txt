      is considered palliative. However, many patients may live for years with their metastatic
      disease with a reasonably good quality of life. As for locally advanced primary breast
      cancers in need of primary medical therapy, lack of responsiveness to regular chemotherapy is
      associated with a poor prognosis, with a high risk of relapse and, subsequent, breast cancer
      death. TP53 mutations have been shown to predict a poor response to anthracyclines, a group
      of cytotoxic agents which is extensively used and which is in general efficacious in breast
      cancer. Notably, dose-intensification with cyclophosphamide has been found to significantly
      improve the response rate in TP53 mutated primary breast cancers. Our preliminary experience
      indicates that the use of dose-dense cyclophosphamide monotherapy every 2nd week with G-CSF
      support is well tolerated. As for patients with metastatic disease for whom the alternative
      would be to receive continuous chemotherapy at 3-weekly intervals the hypothesis is that
      cyclophosphamide given at 2-weekly intervals over a limited time period, followed by a
      "treatment holiday" among responders should be associated with a non-inferior quality of life
      all-over. As for patients with TP53 mutated locally advanced breast cancers where standard
      chemotherapy fails, the hypothesis is that cyclophosphamide dose dense treatment may be an
      effective treatment option downstaging the tumor prior to surgery.
