        -  Determine whether filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation reduces the incidence of non-leukemic mortality in patients with acute
           leukemia.

        -  Determine the kinetics and durability of engraftment after treatment with this regimen
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the leukemia-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Donors receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days -5 to -1. Donors then
      undergo leukapheresis on days -1 and 0.

      Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -7 to -4. Patients receive 2
      doses of intrathecal methotrexate per local guidelines between days -10 and -3. Patients also
      receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Patients receive infusion of allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
