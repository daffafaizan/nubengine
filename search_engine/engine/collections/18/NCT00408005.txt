    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine, through randomization, the relative safety and efficacy of the addition of
      nelarabine (Compound 506U78) to augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster (BFM) therapy (Regimen C,
      Children's Cancer Group [CCG]-1961).

      II. To determine the relative safety and efficacy of high dose methotrexate (5 g/m^2) with
      leucovorin (leucovorin calcium) rescue compared to escalating methotrexate without leucovorin
      rescue plus pegaspargase (Capizzi I) delivered during interim maintenance.

      III. To gain preliminary data on the use of nelarabine in patients with high risk T-cell
      lymphoblastic lymphoma and its effect on long-term survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relative safety and efficacy of withholding radiation in patients with
      low risk T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), while treating Intermediate and high
      risk patients with 1200 cGy of prophylactic cranial radiation.
