      marrow ablative chemo/radiotherapy in addition to peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      and interferon alfa maintenance therapy versus interferon alfa maintenance therapy alone in
      patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. All patients receive 8 courses of
      cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide and vincristine
      IV are given on day 1, along with oral prednisone on days 1-5. Courses are repeated every 3
      weeks. Patients are randomized to receive one of two treatments 4 weeks after completion of
      CVP chemotherapy if a partial or complete response is achieved and there are less than 15%
      monoclonal B-lymphocytes in the bone marrow. Patients randomized to arm I receive interferon
      alfa subcutaneously 3 times per week for a maximum of 3 years. Patients randomized to arm II
      receive cyclophosphamide IV followed by subcutaneous filgrastim (granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF). Leukapheresis begins after leukocyte, platelet, and CD34+
      levels recover and lasts 3-4 hours on 2-3 consecutive days. If an insufficient number of stem
      cells are collected from the peripheral blood, bone marrow harvesting is performed. After
      stem cell collection, a conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide IV on days -4 and
      -3 and total body irradiation on day -1 is administered. Stem cells are infused on day 0. If
      granulocyte and platelet counts recover within 8 weeks, patients receive interferon alfa
      maintenance therapy as in arm I. Patients are followed every 4 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 469 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
