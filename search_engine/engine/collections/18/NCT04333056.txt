      examination as it is the standard in the investigator's hospital.

      The IOL Master 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena) and the Heidelberg Anterion (Heidelberg
      Engineering, Germany) are biometry devices that use swept-source optical coherence tomography
      technology in combination with a multidot-keratometer, that obtain two-dimensional images of
      ocular structures.

      The difference between the two devices resides in the wavelength of the infrared laser:
      1200-1400nm for the Anterion and 1050nm for the IOL Master 700.

      The SS-OCT devices provide a scan depth of 44mm and a resolution in tissue of 22 μm for the
      IOL Master 700 and of 14x16.5 mm and 30 μm for the Heidelberg Anterion.
