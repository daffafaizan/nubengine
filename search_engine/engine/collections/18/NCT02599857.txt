      adults with CHD. Moreover, during a twelve months follow up period the investigators aim to
      evaluate whether management with a CONCOR smartphone application results in a lower rate of
      heart failure events and arrhythmia as well as a better quality of life than usual care,
      because of increased patient awareness, behavioral stimuli, healthy life style reminders and
      more precise medical treatment.
