      preterm delivery, the risk of a local relapse in patients with dysplasia-affected resection
      margin is high.

      The Goldstandard standard technique in conization for women with cervical dysplasia is the
      large loop excision of the transformation zone ("LLETZ"). Nevertheless other techniques such
      as the excision of the abnormal tissue with the so called "Fischer Cone Biopsy Excisor" could
      provide advantages and is yet not enough investigated. The loop excision technique uses a
      circular electrode, in contrast Fischer Cone Biopsy Excision is done by a triangular
      electrode.

      It is unknown, whether the use of the circular or the triangular electrode is superior
      regarding the dysplasia-free resection margin rate and other outcome parameters such as the
      resected cone volume, postoperative bleeding and postoperative pain. Therefore, the
      investigator designed a randomized clinical trial of 160 women undergoing conization for
      cervical dysplasia, comparing the two electrosurgical techniques, "LLETZ-conization" and
      "Fischer Cone Biopsy Excision". The primary outcome of the study is the dysplasia-free
      resection margin rate independently proved by a pathologist, secondary outcomes are
      intraoperative blood loss measured as difference in serum hemoglobin pre- and
      postoperatively, postoperative pain according to a 11 step VAS scale, time to complete
      hemostasis measured in seconds, duration of the intervention measured in minutes, resected
      cone volume, users satisfaction according to a 11 step VAS scale and intra- and postoperative
      complications, defined as necessity to intervene surgically up to 14 days postoperatively.

      The study Population consists of women undergoing conization for histologically proven
      cervical dysplasia.
