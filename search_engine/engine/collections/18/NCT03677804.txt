      Ozaki et al., published first in 2011 provides potential benefits due to the missing
      necessity of oral anticoagulation and its use in patients with small aortic annuli, because
      of the huge orifice area. There is a need of more data to evaluate the significance of this
      technique in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis and regurgitation. The department of
      cardiac surgery/ University Hospital Basel/ Switzerland started to use this technique in
      September 2015. The aim of this study is to analyse the short-term results of the first
      patients undergoing the OZAKI procedure.
