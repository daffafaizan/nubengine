      studies where reductions in the incidence of stroke in patients with AF have been reported.
      However, the benefits of an anticoagulant are offset by increased incident rates of bleeding
      including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, less commonly, intracranial bleeding,
      warranting careful anticoagulation management during periods when patients are susceptible to
      the risks for bleeding, stroke and thromboembolism.

      The exact duration for withholding NOAC after acute GIB is unknown and in general, current
      clinical society guidelines and statements are non-specific and relatively open-ended
      regarding the optimal timing to restart non-warfarin oral anticoagulant (NOAC) after
      gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who require the
      prophylactic medication for stroke prevention. These patients are at increased risk for
      devastating future thromboembolic events including stroke if NOAC is not resumed, whilst
      premature resumption of anticoagulants can result in recurrent GIB, haemorrhage, anaemia,
      myocardial ischaemia and infarction in those with ischaemic heart disease, and even death.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if restarting NOAC very early after endoscopic
      haemostasis of bleeding peptic ulcer lesions is equivalent to early resumption in AF patients
      in terms of safety and efficacy for prevention of recurrent bleeding freedom from GIB
      recurrence, while maintaining undiminished benefits in reducing incident rates of systemic
      thromboembolism.
