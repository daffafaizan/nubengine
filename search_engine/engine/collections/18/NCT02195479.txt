    
      The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (within 21 days prior to randomization),
      Treatment Phase (Cycle 1 Day 1 to discontinuation of all study treatment), and Follow-up
      Phase (from discontinuation of all study treatment up to death, lost to follow up, withdrawal
      of consent, or the study ends, whichever occurs first). Treatment phase will include 2
      treatments (Treatment A: participants will receive Velcade MelphalanPrednisone (VMP) alone
      and Treatment B: participants will receive daratumumab in combination with VMP).Two interim
      analyses are planned. The first will be to evaluate safety after a total of approximately 100
      participants have been treated for at least 2 cycles or discontinued the study treatment. The
      second will be to evaluate cumulative interim safety and efficacy data, and will be performed
      when approximately 216 PFS events have been accumulated. The maximum duration of the study
      will be 5 years after the last participant is randomized or after 330 participants have died,
      whichever comes first. Efficacy will be primarily measured by comparison of PFS between the
      two treatment arms. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
