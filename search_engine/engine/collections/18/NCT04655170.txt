    
      A prospective, parallel group, randomized clinical trial in 60 patients hospitalized with the
      primary diagnosis of AECOPD or acute respiratory failure with a secondary diagnosis of COPD
      (ICD-10 codes J44.1 and J96 - J96.2 with J44.9).

      The plan is to:

      Administer standard bronchodilator protocol with nebulized Albuterol and Ipratropium every 6
      hours (n=30)

      versus

      Nebulized Revefenacin 175 μg once per day and Formoterol 20 μg twice per day (n=30) for up to
      7 days of treatment. Study medication will be administered by standard jet nebulizers in both
      groups.

      Investigators will:

        -  Collect the Borg dyspnea scale twice a day during hospitalization

        -  Record the total doses of bronchodilators per day received by each patient

        -  Record the number of rescue doses needed per day of hospital stay

        -  Record the lowest level of FiO2 employed on days 1, 3 and 7 of hospital stay

        -  Record all adverse events and concurrent medications

      Investigators will collect:

      Physical Exam (Day 1, 3, 7, or ET) Serum Chemistry (Day 1, 3, 7, or ET) Hematology (Day 1, 3,
      7, or ET) Chest X-Ray (Day 1).
