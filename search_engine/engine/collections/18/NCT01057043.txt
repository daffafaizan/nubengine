      osteoarthritis of the knee. In this randomised trial we want to study the effect of pulsatile
      cupping in osteoarthritis of the knee compared to waiting list control. Pulsatile cupping is
      administered by a special cupping machine (HeVaTec) with silicone cupping glasses to the knee
      joint. Pulsatile pressure is generated by a pump that generates vacuum.
