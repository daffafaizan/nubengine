      preschoolers and disproportionately impact lower socioeconomic status (SES) children. Despite
      a robust evidence base, behavioral sleep interventions are rarely tested with lower-SES
      children or in primary care, an accessible service delivery setting. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine whether the Sleep Well! behavioral sleep intervention is feasible
      and acceptable to families. The investigators will also examine the direction and magnitude
      of change in child sleep and behavior from pre-intervention to post-intervention. This is a
      randomized controlled trial of the Sleep Well! program with pre-intervention,
      post-intervention, and follow-up assessments. Caregiver-child dyads (child ages 1-5 years
      with a sleep problem) will be recruited from CHOP urban primary care sites.

      Sleep Well! is a brief, behavioral sleep intervention for toddlers and preschoolers who have
      a caregiver-reported behavioral sleep problem or who are not getting enough sleep. The
      intervention includes evidence-based behavioral sleep approaches and strategies to engage and
      empower families. The primary outcomes for this open trial are feasibility (number of
      caregivers recruited, engaged, and retained in intervention; participant intervention
      attendance rate) and caregiver acceptability, assessed via a questionnaire and qualitative
      post-intervention interview. Secondary outcomes are the direction and magnitude in any change
      in child sleep. Tertiary outcomes are the direction and magnitude in change in child
      behavior. Assessments occur at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up.
