      15 healthy male volunteers, who were divided into 2 groups: experimental or control group. In
      the first test phase, the subjects in the experimental group were instructed to rinse with
      the mouthwash containing ClO2 and those in the control group with the placebo mouthwash
      without ClO2. In the second test phase after one week washout period, same procedure was
      conducted with the opposite mouthwashes. Oral malodor was evaluated at before rinsing, right
      after rinsing and follows up every 30 minutes till 4 hours with OM, and the concentrations of
      hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S) which are the
      main volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) of human oral malodor were evaluated with GC.
