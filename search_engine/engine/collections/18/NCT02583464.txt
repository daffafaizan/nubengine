      Caucasian volunteers in a fasting state. A single oral dose of either T or R formulations was
      followed by a 7-day washout period. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 0.25, 0.50,
      0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 7, 12, 24 and 48 h after administration. Emtricitabine and
      tenofovir concentrations were determined using a validated LC (liquid chromatography) - MS
      (mass spectrometry) / MS method. Adverse events were monitored based on clinical parameters
      and volunteer reports.
