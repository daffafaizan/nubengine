    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to investigate the effect of
      intravenous thiamine (vitamin B1) on renal injury in septic shock. Patients admitted with
      septic shock who have a lactate of at least 2.0mmol/L and do not have pre-existing renal
      failure requiring dialysis will be eligible for the study. Enrolled patients will be
      randomized to intravenous thiamine 200mg twice daily for 6 doses or matching placebo. Blood
      will be drawn at several time points to assess biomarkers of renal injury. Secondary
      endpoints include need for renal replacement therapy, length of ICU stay, and hospital
      mortality.
