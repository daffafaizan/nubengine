      for their participation. They will be assessed, subtyped for mu-opiate receptor and
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) allelic variants and 88 individuals (44 with the more
      common AA gene and 44 with either an AG or GG gene) will be randomly assigned to take either
      naltrexone (50 mg/day) or a matching placebo for 7 days. Since the val and met alleles of the
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene are each present in about 50% of the population they
      will be equally distributed by urn randomization to all opiate allele and treatment groups.
      After 5 days of natural drinking and one day of abstinence, subjects will undergo an alcohol
      cue-induced brain activity scan using well-established fMRI techniques on Day 6 of study
      drug. The following day all subjects will receive a standard dose (gender and weight
      corrected) of alcohol and be evaluated for alcohol reactivity (stimulation, sedation,
      intoxication, craving) over 40 minutes. They then will be allowed to consume up to 8
      mini-drinks over a 2-hour period. Afterwards all subjects will receive
      educational/motivational counseling regarding their alcohol use and its effects. Referral for
      treatment will be offered.
