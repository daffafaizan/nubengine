      consent will be taken from each consenting participant. Initial caries excavation will be
      done under rubber dam isolation. The patient will then be randomly allocated to two groups:
      selective removal to soft dentin or stepwise caries removal. Composite restoration with glass
      ionomer liner will be then placed in both groups. Additional complete caries excavation will
      be done in the stepwise caries removal group after six months.
