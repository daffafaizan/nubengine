      primary congenital glaucoma and younger than 1 month of age at the outpatient clinic of
      Mansoura Ophthalmic Center of Mansoura University in Mansoura, Egypt. Eyes will be randomly
      assigned to undergo one of 3 surgical interventions: viscotrabeculotomy (VT),
      visco-circumferential-suture-trabeculotomy (VCST) or combined VT-Trabeculectomy with MMC
      (VT-Trab).

      The primary outcome of this study is compare the success rate in lowering IOP between the 3
      surgical options in infants with Primary Congenital Glaucoma (PCG) below 1 month of age. The
      secondary clinical outcomes will include Intraocular pressure (IOP), horizontal corneal
      diameter, axial length, cup-disc ratio, refractive error and postoperative complications in
      these 3 surgical procedures. Data will be analysed. Complete success was defined as an IOP
      from 5 to 16 mmHg (under general anesthesia), without antiglaucoma drugs (AGD) or further
      surgical interventions, without progression of corneal diameter or disk cupping, and without
      serious visual complications. Qualified success was defined as fulfilling the same criteria
      but with the use of AGD.
