      propionate delivered by HFA-pMDI in children of different ages. The one-hour steady-state
      fluticasone plasma concentration which is an indirect measure of airway delivery and direct
      measure of systemic exposure, was determined. Sixty children with well-controlled persistent
      asthma received two actuations of 110 mcg twice daily for at least 3 days. A blood sample was
      collected one hour after the last dose when 100% adherence was documented by electronic
      monitor. Five groups of 12 each were studied: 1) 12-18 yr by actuator alone; 2) 5-9 yr by
      actuator alone; 3) 5-9 yr by antistatic VHC/mouthpiece; 4) 5-9 yr by antistatic VHC/mask and
      5) 1-4 yr by antistatic VHC/mask. Fluticasone concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS assay.
      Fluticasone plasma concentration between groups was compared using one way ANOVA.
