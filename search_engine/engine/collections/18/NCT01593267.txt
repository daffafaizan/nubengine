      outcome endpoints will be assessed at Discharge, 6 Months, 1 Year, 3 Years, and 6 Years. One
      hundred (100) subjects will participate in neuropsychological testing at 1 Year; after the
      100th subject an interim data analysis will be performed and the viability of future
      neuropsychological testing will be determined. Subjects will receive preoperative,
      intraoperative or postoperative, 3 Year follow up, and 6 Year follow up angiograms. In this
      fashion immediate clinical outcome, including peri-procedural morbidity and mortality, will
      be assessed as will long term outcome, both clinical and angiographic.
