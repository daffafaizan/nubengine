      reducing the number of items in the BFM checklist by administering the expanded checklist to
      at least 50 patients with schizophrenia and using the standard psychometric item-reduction
      strategies to create a shorter checklist. In phase two we will conduct mental health provider
      focus groups to discuss the content of the Options List and the delivery of the intervention.
      In phase three we will automate the BFM intervention using an existing web-based computer
      touch-screen platform. In phase four we will conduct individual patient debriefing interviews
      with 30 patients to evaluate the understandability of the BFM survey. In phase five we will
      evaluate the test/re-test reliability of the survey in a new sample of 30 patients. BFM
      intervention implementation will include a stratified randomization of patients to the BFM
      intervention or usual care. BFM intervention evaluation will include testing the feasibility,
      acceptability, and outcomes associated with the intervention versus usual care in a single
      trial with 200 patients (100 intervention and 100 usual care).
