      I. To identify the skin features that drive inter-individual variation in dermal drug
      permeation between individuals.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To relate breast tissue drug concentration to skin histology, skin vascularity, skin
      transporter proteins, and skin features measured using confocal reflectance microscopy.

      II. To assess the feasibility of transdermal drug delivery to the radiated breast.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply afimoxifene gel topically once daily (QD) to both breasts for 4 weeks and then
      undergo core needle biopsies of both breasts.

      Patients receive follow up phone call 21-35 days after biopsy.
