    
      The objective of this study is to determine overall response rate, event-free survival,
      time-to-progression, time-to-next-therapy, and freedom-from-relapse in patients with
      low-grade lymphoma in first or second relapse treated with Zevalin followed by 2 years of
      Rituxan maintenance therapy in a multicenter, community-based setting, as well as evaluate
      relative response rates in populations with and without prior rituximab therapy, in first
      versus second relapse, and with and without bulky (> 5 cm in greatest diameter) disease.

      To meet the initial trial enrollment goal of 300 patients over two years, 42 total sites were
      activated. The study has subsequently closed to accrual. Currently 8 sites remain active to
      follow the 12 subjects enrolled in the past year.
