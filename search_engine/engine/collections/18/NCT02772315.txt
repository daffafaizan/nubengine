      hypertension centers about 25% of patients have a single cause for hypertension, so-called
      secondary hypertension, mostly of endocrine, adrenal origin (primary aldosteronism,
      pheochromocytoma/ paraganglioma, Cushing's syndrome). This rate steps up to 50% in patients
      with drug resistant hypertension. Proper treatment of secondary hypertension improves
      prognosis considerably but depends on adequate diagnosis. Classically the diagnosis of such
      forms of hypertension rests on cumbersome biochemical and imaging procedures that may not
      completely take away uncertainty. Modern '-omics' techniques (genomics, metabolomics,
      proteomics of plasma and urine) may allow faster and better diagnosis. In addition, they may
      provide a basis for stratification of hypertensive patients that do not have a identifiable
      cause of hypertension, so-called primary hypertension. This stratification may help
      predicting response to antihypertensive drugs and determining prognosis and thus, help to
      establish personalized medicine in hypertension care.
