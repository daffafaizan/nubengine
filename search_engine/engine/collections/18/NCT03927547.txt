    
      Specific Aims:

        -  To examine the relative efficacy of postural therapy (a 15-degree wedge mattress) on
           measures of chronic cardiometabolic stress in high altitude residents.

        -  To determine the tolerability of postural therapy.

      Primary outcomes, at 4 and 8 weeks:

        -  Mean nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation (SPO2)

        -  Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).

      Secondary outcomes

        -  Markers of hypoxemia exposure: the investigators will evaluate for differences in
           average hemoglobin and erythropoietin concentrations between intervention groups using
           t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as considered appropriate. If transformations are
           necessary, the investigators will use Box-Cox power transform to identify the best
           transformation for the investigators' data.

        -  Markers of metabolic dysfunction: the investigators will evaluate for differences in
           average Glycated hemoglobin test (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment of insulin
           resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL),
           High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides, SVEGF-R1 , and soluble
           Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (SVEGF-1) concentrations between intervention groups
           using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate. If transformations are
           necessary, the investigators will use Box-Cox power transform to identify the best
           transformation for the investigators' data.

        -  Markers of cardiometabolic stress: the investigators will evaluate for differences in
           average systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse, and %
           change in endothelial function (reactive hyperemia index) as assessed by brachial artery
           reactivity testing (BART) between intervention groups using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum
           tests, as considered appropriate.

        -  Adherence (the average number of nights during the 8-week period that participants slept
           on the wedge mattress),
