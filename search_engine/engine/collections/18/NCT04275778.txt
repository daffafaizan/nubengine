      practice; Patients fulfilling all criteria may be randomized following receipt of written
      informed consent.

      After the inclusion visit, the patients will be followed by the investigator every months
      until the end of the pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum.

      At each visit, a clinical examination, routine biological analysis, APL antibody and
      complement determination will be performed. Hydroxychloroquine blood levels, PFA, Xa
      inhibition,and treatment adherence will be assessed during pregnancy.

      Biologiques"(CRB) of the Saint Antoine Hospital. Last visit for children : At 12 months The
