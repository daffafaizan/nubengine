      healthy subjects consisting of up to 3 dose steps of DAA-I. In the sequential step wise
      design, a single dose of DAA-I or placebo will be administered to 6 subjects for one
      treatment group. For each dose step, 4 subjects will receive DAA-I and 2 subjects will
      receive placebo. Subjects will be randomly allocated to one dose step. Step One would have to
      be completed before Step Two. Escalation up to Step Two and subsequent steps would depend on
      the safety results from the preceding step(s). There will be an interval of 6 hours between
      the dosing of the first and second DAA-I-treated volunteers of each cohort to allow for early
      cardiovascular monitoring. Only if there are no safety signals identify from these subjects
      as assessed by the Safety Review Committee can simultaneous dosing of the remaining
      volunteers be carried out.
