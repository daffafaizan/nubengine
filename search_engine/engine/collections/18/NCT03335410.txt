      day-case surgery and the patients go home in the afternoon. Shoulder surgery is one of the
      most common procedures performed in private surgical practices. Because of the complex nature
      of the joint, the recovery may be complicated by severe opstoperative pain, which is relieved
      with strong opioids. Recently this has been addressed in the literature, as prescribed
      opioids too often lead to substance abuse. Pain in the acute phase after surgery is one of
      the common risk factors for persistent postoperative pain, which is a major burden for both
      the individual patient and the society.

      In this prospective, observational cohort study we aim to describe current standards of
      practice in planning and taking care of anaeshtesia and prescribing opioids and adjuvants for
      postoperative pain relief at home.

      The data is collected prospectively from the care provider and the patient in a webrobol
      questionnaire at three time points: the day of surgery (care provider), one week after
      surgery (patient) and three months after surgery (patient).
