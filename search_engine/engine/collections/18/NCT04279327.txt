    
      This is a prospective study that will be conducted at the pathology lab of Assiut University
      Hospital. The study will include effusion specimens (pleural, peritoneal & pericardial) and
      the aspirated fluid will be examined for physical characters e.g. color and appearance.

      The sample will be divided into 2 equal parts: one for conventional smear preparation, and
      the other for cell block. A minimum of 2 thin smears will be prepared and stained with
      Papanicolou stain.

      Cell block sections of 4-6 Î¼ thickness will be prepared and stained with the hematoxylin and
      eosin stain (H&E).

      For immunohistochemistry, cell blocks will be used. Expression of claudin 4, EZH2, and MOC-31
      will be evaluated in benign and malignant cells by using immunoperoxidase technique.
