      Patients undergoing lung resection have 1 or 2 chest tubes in the pleural cavity to evacuate
      air and pleural fluid. Digital drainage systems (recently approved for usage in Canada) offer
      the advantage of maintaining a stable intrapleural pressure through interactive balancing
      depending on the needs of the patient. In contrast, the traditional chest tube system offers
      continuous suctioning and negative pleural pressure, regardless the ongoing needs of the
      patients. Therefore, usage of digital drainage system (already shown to be beneficial in
      reducing the duration of air leak after lung resection when compared to the traditional
      system) may potentially reduce the amount of pleural drainage and hence reduce the duration
      of chest tube drainage until removal and overall patient's length of stay in hospital.

      The following is a proposal for a randomized, controlled trial where patients will be
      randomized to have either a digital drainage system (intervention group) or non-digital
      drainage system, a conventional system currently used to drain the pleural space (the control
      group) after major lung resection for malignancy. The primary outcome of this study is
      comparing the overall amounts of pleural fluid drainage after major lung resection using two
      different chest tube drainage systems. Secondary outcomes will include measurement in time
      (hours) that chest tubes remain in-situ before removal following an operative procedure, and
      overall reduction in the length of stay (LOS) of patients; 90 days overall mortality and
      morbidity; occurrence of dyspnea related to the reoccurrence of pleural effusion; clinically
      significant reintervention needed (thoracocentesis, re-insertion of chest drain(s) and number
      and type of imaging studies required which are related to potential re-accumulation of
      pleural effusion); readmission rates within 1 month of discharge; comparison of pleural
      fluid/plasma protein ratio and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1RA, TNF-Î±)
      between the two groups, a potential indicator for differences in pleural inflammation and
      permeability between the two groups.
