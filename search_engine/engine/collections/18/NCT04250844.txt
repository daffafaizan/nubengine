      physical and psychosocial impact for patients and families. Currently there is no
      straightforward treatment algorithm for these issues, and management often involves multiple
      medication trials and procedures. Intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection has been proposed as
      a treatment for nausea and vomiting in adults, but there is minimal prior research on use in
      children and no prior research on use in children with feeding disorders. The aims of this
      study are: (1) to determine the efficacy of intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection for
      reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in children, (2) to determine the efficacy of intrapyloric
      botulinum injections for improving feeding outcomes in children, and (3) to define predictors
      of response to intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection.
