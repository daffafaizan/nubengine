      intubation and acute hypoxia remain among the major contributing factors of anaesthesia
      related deaths. Difficult intubation prevalence in literature is very inconsistent and varies
      between 1.5-20% of cases in general population, to even 50% in obese Thai population.

      Obesity remains a challenging problem in perioperative care. It is assumed that the airway
      access may be restricted due to anatomic changes resulting from excess body weight. There are
      factors like diagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea or large neck circumference that also relate
      to occurrence of difficult intubation in obese patients.

      There is a number of anthropometric scales and tests used for predicting difficult intubation
      in obese patients. However, none of them appears to be sensitive and specific enough to
      effectively predict difficult intubation.

      Recently, simple and non-invasive test predicting difficult intubation was
      introduced-thyromental height test (TMHT). It shows promise as a more effective substitution
      for frequently cited anthropometric measures. It is based on the height between the anterior
      border of the thyroid cartilage and the anterior border of the mentum, measured while the
      patient lies in the supine position with closed mouth.

      The main objective of this trial is to assess the clinical usefulness of TMHT in prediction
      of difficult intubation in obese patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures. The
      secondary aim is to evaluate usefulness of other commonly used predictive tests associated
      with difficult intubation in obese patients.
