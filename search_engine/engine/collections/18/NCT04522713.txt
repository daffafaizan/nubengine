      Depression and the common anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and associated with
      disability and reduced quality of life. There is reason to believe that the majority of these
      patients are found in primary care. Official Swedish guidelines dictate that primary care
      clinics are responsible for treating mild to moderate cases, but access to treatment is
      limited. Transdiagnostic psychological interventions have been found to be efficacious for
      anxiety and mood disorders, and require a relatively rudimentary pre-treatment assessment. A
      large-group transdiagnostic course based on cognitive-behavioral principles may constitute an
      effective use of limited resources to improve access to treatment, and offer a sufficiently
      effective intervention, for most primary care patients with mild to moderate mental health
      problems.

      Aim:

      To investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a large-group transdiagnostic
      intervention for depression and clinically significant anxiety in Swedish primary care.

      Design:

      This is a prospective single-group feasibility study where 68 adults with clinically
      significant symptoms of depression or anxiety, and up to 25 adults with subclinical symptoms,
      are offered 6 weekly structured transdiagnostic large-group course sessions which focus on
      evidence-based strategies to reduce psychiatric symptoms and increase wellbeing. If
      necessary, due to the covid-19 pandemic, the course will be held online. The primary outcome
      is patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes include within-group effects on psychiatric
      symptoms (response rates), adherence rates, need for additional treatment, and adverse
      events.
