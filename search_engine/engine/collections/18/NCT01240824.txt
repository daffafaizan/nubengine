      if aminophylline is safe, when placed directly into the bladder of patients who have bladder
      cancer. We will give it along with BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) - a medication put into the
      bladder through a catheter tube to treat bladder cancer.

      We also would like to determine the maximum dose of aminophylline that can be safely given
      and how the drug is absorbed and used by the body as well as document side effects when
      aminophylline is given in the bladder.

      This is a study about aminophylline instilled into the bladder. Aminophylline has not been
      proven to be safe or a helpful treatment for bladder cancer. It is considered an experimental
      drug as used in this protocol for bladder cancer. Aminophylline has not been given to anyone
      who has bladder cancer. Aminophylline is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA ) to give directly into the bloodstream for the treatment of asthma. We intend to use it
      at doses much lower than that used for asthma.
