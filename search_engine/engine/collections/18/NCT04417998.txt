      MAP Reconstruction. The motion correction (Aim 1) cohort will involve a group of 30 subjects
      who are already enrolled in Mayo Clinic Rochester research study 08-005553 (PI: Dr Val Lowe)
      and are scheduled to be scanned on the Siemens Biograph Vision 600 PET/CT system in the
      PET/CT Molecular Imaging Research Center in Charlton 6 of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The data
      gathered from this cohort will assess the effectiveness of motion correction software for
      patients undergoing PET brain scans. The parametric imaging (Aim 2) cohort will include 30
      subjects that have recently undergone a brain or whole body oncologic PET/CT scans on the
      V600-R1. The purpose of this cohort is to assess the data acquisition and image processing
      workflow for parametric analysis of brain and whole body scans. The MAP Reconstruction Cohort
      (Aim 3) is a retrospective study to assess the quality of PET images reconstructed with
      maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction algorithm.
