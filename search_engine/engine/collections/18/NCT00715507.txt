      anesthesiologists in a clinical setting, the PKPD models must be validated to assess the
      clinical reliability of the model-based predictions for patients undergoing general
      anesthesia. Second, once the PKPD models have been successfully validated, presenting it to
      anesthesiologists during administration of anesthesia will assess the impact of the graphical
      medication monitor. Differences in performance and patient care will be determined by
      comparing anesthesiologists who are presented with the monitor to those who care for patients
      without the monitor.
