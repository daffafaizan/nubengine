      I. To decrease the mobile mammography unit no-show rate by sending text message appointment
      reminders to patients.

      II. To assess the efficacy of the text message reminders at addressing the no-show rate by
      collecting satisfaction survey data from patients that received the texts and that came to
      their scheduled appointment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 1-2 text messages a few weeks before and 1 text message 24 hours before
      their mammography screening appointment. Patients also receive a phone call reminder as per
      standard practice.
