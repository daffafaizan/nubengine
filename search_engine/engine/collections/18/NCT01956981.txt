      surgery (FESS) in order to increase the visibility of the surgical site. Our primary goal was
      to investigate the effects of magnesium sulfate and dexmedetomidine used for controlled
      hypotension on visibility of surgical site.

      Methods: Sixty patients aged between 18-65 years were enrolled. Patients were divided into
      two groups. In the magnesium sulfate group (Group M) patients were administered 40 kg-1
      magnesium sulfate in 100 ml saline solution in 10 minutes as IV loading dose 10 minutes
      before the induction and 10-15 mgkg-1hour-1 infusion during the surgery. In the
      dexmedetomidine group (Group D) patients were administered 1 µgkg-1 dexmedetomidine in 100 ml
      saline solution as loading dose 10 minutes before the surgery and 0.5-1 µgkg-1hour-1
      dexmedetomidine during the surgery. Deliberate hypotension was defined as a mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) being 60-70 mmHg.
