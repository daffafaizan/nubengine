      methotrexate and TNFa inhibitors. New immunosuppressive drugs are at disposal, Orencia*
      (abatacept) which is a T cell co-stimulation modulator (CTLA4Ig) and RoActemra*
      (tocilizumab), an antibody against IL6 receptor. In solid organ transplant recipients under
      immunosuppressants, emergence of lymphoma can be predicted by monitoring EBV load in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs). EBV load above 1000 copies per 500 ng PBMNC DNA
      is considered a limit above which patients will develop EBV associated post transplant
      lymphoproliferative disorder, a condition characterized by polyclonal EBV positive B
      lymphocyte proliferation which can evolve into EBV positive B cell lymphoma .

      In a first study, we showed that Rheumatoid arthritis patients have 10 fold systemic EBV
      overload, very similar to that observed in healthy organ transplant recipients. More
      recently, we showed that methotrexate tended to decrease EBV load over time, but this did not
      reach significance and that TNFa inhibitors did not significantly modify EBV load over time.

      Our objective is to monitor Epstein Barr Virus load over time in patients with Rheumatoid
      arthritis under Orencia* (abatacept) or RoActemra* (tocilizumab), to detect possible
      immunosuppression associated EBV dysregulation, as seen in post transplant
      lymphoproliferative disease.
