      third-parties during the patient's intensive care course, versus education-alone, on reducing
      acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay greater than 72 hours, and who
      were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24 hours, were recruited and randomized to
      either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation, or psychoeducation alone.
      Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the
      intensive care unit. Psychometric testing with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at
      weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge.
