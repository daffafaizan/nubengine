      assay. Patients are randomized to two arms. Arm A receives SQV plus RTV plus two NRTIs. Arm B
      receives EFV plus two NRTIs. Patients must take their dose at approximately the same time
      every day. Patients have the option of taking daily dose in AM or PM. Patients are evaluated
      for changes in plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4/CD8 counts and for adverse experiences and
      laboratory determinations. Evaluations are made every 4-8 weeks until Week 48. Patients
      continuing beyond Week 48 who reach Weeks 60, 72, 84, and common study closure, will be seen
      at those weeks.
