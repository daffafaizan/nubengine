      to participate, gave an informed consent and were randomly assigned either to receive every 6
      hours the nebulized 0.9% saline (NS) (group I) or the 3% HS (group II) in addition to
      aerosolized epinephrine (1.5 mg) and to the conventional treatment (oxygen, fluids). Patients
      were randomized to receive different saline treatments using a computer-based randomization
      program. Study solutions, prepared by the local hospital pharmacy, were blinded to
      participants and investigators. Each treatment was delivered by a nebulizer with continuous
      flow of oxygen at 6 L/min through a tight-fitting facemask.

      The main study endpoints were the length of stay (LOS) in hospital and the clinical response.
      LOS in hospital was defined as the time between study entry (within 12 hours of admission to
      the hospital) and the time at which the infant was discharged on the basis of the clinical
      grounds by the attending physician. Clinical response was determined using daily CSS
      evaluation; furthermore, the CSS was evaluated every day before and 30 minutes after
      nebulisation.
