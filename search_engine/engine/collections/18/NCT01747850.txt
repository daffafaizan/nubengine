      buccal spray) using the same approach as outlined below for the randomized controlled trial.
      In the twelve-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study visits will occur weekly during
      the medication phase of the study. The medication will be self-titrated over three weeks and
      a target quit date will be set up at Day 21. There will be a total of 12 weeks of drug
      exposure. Throughout these 12-weeks, all participants will receive a combination of
      pharmacotherapy (Sativex Spray or Placebo Spray) associated with a weekly intervention of
      combined Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT) in
      accordance with the intervention practices shown to be effective in treatment of cannabis
      dependence. The intervention will be adapted from the Brief Counselling for Marijuana
      Dependence manual published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
      (SAMHSA). At each study visit, vital signs and self-report ratings will be collected. In
      addition, the subjects will have to come daily to the centre to assess medication usage and
      will be asked to provide urine sample (two times weekly) and blood sample weekly. As there
      may be compliance issues, a contingency management approach will be also implemented.
