      cytologic test. After being informed about the potential risks, each volunteer giving written
      informed consent will be asked to complete a questionnaire. Then, cervical and vaginal swabs
      and cervical exfoliated cells will be taken from each volunteer to perform 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing microecology assessment on cervical secretions and detection and genotyping of HPV
      and pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases. If there is something abnormal with the
      diagnostic outcomes in the previous examinations, according to the doctor's judgement, those
      volunteer will be asked to undergo a vaginoscope and a cervical biopsy to evaluate the grade
      of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. After six months since the entry, each volunteer will
      be asked to go back to each research center to do the same sampling and examination as
      previously did in entry.
