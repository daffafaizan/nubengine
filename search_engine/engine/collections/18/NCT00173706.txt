      into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. A lack of carnitine in hemodialysis patients is caused
      by insufficient carnitine synthesis and particularly by the loss through dialytic membranes,
      leading in some patients to carnitine depletion with a relative increase of esterified forms.
      Many studies have shown that L-carnitine supplementation leads to improvements in several
      complications seen in uremic patients, including cardiac complications, impaired exercise and
      functional capacities, muscle symptoms, increased symptomatic intradialytic hypotension, and
      erythropoietin-resistant anemia, normalizing the reduced carnitine palmitoyl transferase
      activity in red cells.
