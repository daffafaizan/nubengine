      shortness of breath, and has a mortality rate of 2-4%. Outcomes are worse among the elderly
      and those with cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer and other co-morbidities. Several
      treatments are also emerging as promising therapeutic candidates, hydroxychloroquine and
      azithromycin - both available as generic pills and widely used for other indications - are
      potential options for treatment. A small randomized controlled trial (RCT) of hospitalized
      patients suggests chloroquine may be superior to placebo in promoting viral elimination and
      shortening disease course. Hydroxychloroquine is preferred to chloroquine in the U.S. A small
      non-randomized trial found azithromycin had a clinical benefit. When azithromycin and
      hydroxychloroquine are given together, they can cause cardiac side-effects that limit use in
      the outpatient setting. These drugs, however, have independent potential benefits against
      COVID-19 that require more rigorous study before either is considered standard of care. We
      propose a 3-arm RCT to determine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin in
      treating mild to moderate COVID-19 among Veterans in the outpatient setting.
