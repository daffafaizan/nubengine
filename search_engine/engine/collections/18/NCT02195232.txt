    
      -  This research study is a Phase II/III clinical trial.

           --The goal of this trial is to evaluate if isoquercetin can prevent blood clots in
           patients with pancreas, non small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer. In the Phase II
           part of this study, the investigators are looking for the dose of isoquercetin to reduce
           D-dimer and demonstrate safety.

        -  Phase III Endpoint and Treatment Plan

             -  Primary Endpoint for Phase III portion of protocol: Cumulative incidence of VTE.

             -  Following the completion of the phase II portion, enrolled patients will be
                randomized 1:1 to Arm C (isoquercetin) or Arm D (placebo). The dose for Arm C will
                be determined after evaluation of the Phase II portion of the trial. The protocol
                will be amended when the decision is made whether to proceed to Phase III and what
                dose to use for Arm C. The study will be double-blinded to treatment arm. Lower
                extremity ultrasound will be performed at 56 days. Baseline D-dimer and correlative
                labs will be drawn at Day 1 and at 56 days. Patients will be followed for survival
                after completion of 56 days.

             -  At BIDMC, optional blood draw will be performed at time 0 and 4 hours following the
                first dose of study drug.
