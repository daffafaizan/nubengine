    
      Patients suspected of having AV access stenosis will be referred to the Division of Vascular
      and Endovascular Surgery by the dialysis center. Patients with signs of AV access failure who
      are found to have significant stenosis (more than 50%) at the venous end of the anastomosis
      will then be randomized to either high pressure balloon (Conquest) or to a cutting balloon
      (Boston scientific Balloon). Angiograms will then be performed before and after intervention.

      Data will be collected from standard of care visit, including physician visits and
      ultrasounds. Follow up will be based on the function of the AV access, dialysis center
      criteria and/or standard of care ultrasound results: including venous pressure of the AV
      access, difficult cannulation, urea recirculation, and change in character and sound of the
      AV access (thrill/bruit), which are standard of care assessment at a dialysis center. All
      patient data sheets will be kept in a study binder and locked in the research room.
      Randomization will be performed with a computer program.
