      concentration supplemental postoperative oxygen therapy on short-term and long-term results
      of liver transplantation, particularly with respect to infections and biliary complications.
      A total of 296 patients immediately after liver transplantation will be randomly assigned to
      receive either 80% (high concentration) or 28% (controls) fraction of inspired oxygen for 6
      hours after surgery with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients will be blinded to the type of
      received intervention. Randomization will be stratified by the Child-Turcotte-Pugh
      classification. Both groups will be compared to short- and long-term outcome measures.
