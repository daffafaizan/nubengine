      (+) and HBeAg (-) group. Each group will be divided into two subgroups, which are treated
      with combination treatment of Entecavir and Poly IC and Entecavir monotherapy respectively.
      All the patients will be followed up for one year. From this study, the investigators want to
      study if Poly IC can enhance antiviral efficacy of Entecavir for chronic hepatitis B.
