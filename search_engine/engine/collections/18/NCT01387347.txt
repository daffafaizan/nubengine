      corneal epithelial cell migration, decreases inflammation and has anti-apoptotic activities.
      It up-regulates the gene expression of laminin-5, a major subepithelial adhesion protein,
      located in the basement membrane region of the cornea, conjunctiva, and important in wound
      healing. In compassionate-use cases, Tβ4 has demonstrated efficacy in repairing non-healing
      neurotrophic corneal ulcers and other corneal epithelial wounds. In twenty-four nonclinical
      toxicology and safety pharmacology studies, the safety of Tβ4 has been demonstrated for its
      current and planned uses in man. The results of the two recent dry eye murine mouse model
      studies show that Tβ4 reduced corneal staining more than positive controls and demonstrated
      statistically significant reduction in staining compared to vehicle control. The results of
      these studies, in addition to data from compassionate use studies in patients with
      non-healing corneal surface defects, suggests that Tβ4 has a significant potential to be an
      important new safe and effective therapeutic in the treatment of dry eye syndrome.
