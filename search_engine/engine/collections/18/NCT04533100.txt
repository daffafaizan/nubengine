      especially if they undergo Renal Replacement Therapy, RRT. Optimization of nutrients
      especially energy and protein can ensure a better health outcome for critically ill patients
      with AKI. Moreover, there is no research on the association of Protein- Energy adequacy with
      mortality among critically ill patients with AKI in Malaysia. So, the main purpose of this
      study is to investigate the relationship of Protein-Energy adequacy with mortality among
      critically ill patients with AKI

      Subjects will be recruited upon admission in ICU after fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. They will be follow up from day 1 until day 14 or until ICU Discharge. Data
      including Demographic, Clinical, Laboratory, and Nutritional Status will be recorded. On Day
      28, the outcome data including Mortality, length of ICU Stay, and Length of Ventilator day
      will be recorded.
