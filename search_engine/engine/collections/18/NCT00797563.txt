      laboratory glucose method. Subjects and healthcare professionals tested subject capillary
      blood and healthcare professionals tested subject venous blood. Two meter configurations were
      evaluated. The study evaluated the acceptability of product labeling in enabling subjects to
      perform blood glucose testing with the new meter system and for using meter features.
      Subjects and healthcare professionals provided feedback about the BGMS and its features.
