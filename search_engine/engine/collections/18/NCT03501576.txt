      I. To determine the seroprotection and seroconversion rates after influenza vaccination in
      patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize influenza-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after influenza
      vaccination in patients with lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      II. To investigate the longevity of humoral immunity to influenza virus in patients with
      lymphoma receiving active treatment or in follow up observation.

      III. To assess the timing and strength of the peak immune response to influenza vaccination.

      IV. To assess the effect of different lymphomas and treatment modalities in the immune
      response to influenza vaccination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 14, 28, 90, and 180
