      utilization of, previously acquired knowledge and skills. It has been commonly assumed that
      impaired knowledge in AD, as well as in other patients with cortical lesions, is due to an
      actual loss or disorganization of a specific knowledge base or system. This hypothesis has,
      however, recently been called into question by data from tasks that purport to tap knowledge
      on a more automatic and implicit level. For example, although AD patients are impaired on
      object naming and verbal fluency tasks, they show a normal pattern of semantic facilitation
      on reaction time based priming tasks. In fact, the level of facilitation or activation on
      these tasks has often been reported to be greater in AD patients than in normal individuals.
      These and similar data have been used to support arguments that performance decrements in AD
      patients are due to deficits in attentional and/or retrieval processes rather than a
      degradation of knowledge stores. The central focus of this project will be to test a model of
      the semantic representations of object that predicts increased facilitation or hyperpriming
      in AD patients as a result of degraded representations. The relationship between performance
      on on-line priming tasks, visual attention and spatial processes, and explicit and implicit
      measures of memory also will be examined. In addition to normal controls, patients with
      cognitive and memory impairments, but without semantically-based naming difficulties (elderly
      depressed, Huntington's disease, Korsakoff's disease) will serve as controls for overall
      slowness of response and degree of explicit memory deficit.
