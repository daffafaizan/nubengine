      electrodes placed in the cochlea and the current is measured by electrically evoked Compound
      Action Potential (ECAP).This ECAP is measured intra operatively, 4 weeks(at switch on) and
      after 3months and 6 months following cochlear implantation. Neural Response Telemetry (NRT)
      is a quick and non-invasive way of recording ECAP of the peripheral auditory nerves in-situ.
      It gives clinicians valuable information for programming the T- (Threshold) and C-(Comfort) -
      levels of the recipient's speech processor map. Intraoperative NRT in conjunction with
      electrode impedance data can help indicate the integrity of the implanted electrodes and the
      electrode/auditory nerve interface, confirming that the implant is functioning correctly
      intraoperatively.
