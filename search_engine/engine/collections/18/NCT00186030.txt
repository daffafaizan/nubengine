      behavior among HIV-positive men and women. As a result, we know very little about how stress,
      particularly trauma-related stress, influences HIV risk behavior. This study will be one of
      the first randomized studies to examine the efficacy of reducing HIV risk behavior by
      combining a trauma-focused stress reduction intervention with a standard HIV prevention
      skills intervention. This study is specifically targeting a low-income, urban population, a
      group that experiences a disproportionate rate of crime as well as HIV infection. Findings of
      the research will likely provide information on the relationship between trauma and risk
      behavior. Furthermore, this research can identify key issues related to stress, psychosocial
      factors, and overall health that will be relevant to investigate in future, larger-scale
      studies of HIV-positive as well as HIV-negative populations.

      Individuals who reported living with HIV, engaging in HIV risk behavior in the past 3 months,
      experiencing a traumatic stressor and trauma-related symptoms in the past 3 months were
      assigned to one of three conditions: 1) standard HIV prevention skills; 2) standard HIV
      prevention skills + trauma-focused stress reduction skills training; or 3) trauma-focused
      stress reduction skills training.
