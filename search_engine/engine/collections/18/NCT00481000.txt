      psychopathology. We designed a new treatment (Dialectical Cognitive Trauma Therapy, or DCT)
      specifically to treat these patients. DCT includes elements of emotion regulation,
      mindfulness exercises, cognitive and exposure treatment, as well as new elements. This
      randomized controlled study evaluates the effect of inpatient DCT on these patients.
