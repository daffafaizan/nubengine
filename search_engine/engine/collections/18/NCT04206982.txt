      Indeed, two approaches have prevailed over the past two decades "cox-maze" strategy and
      mapping of the left atrium but both methods have failed to decrease AF recurrences (as shown
      by the clinical trial STAR AF 2). Two studies have demonstrated that the ligament of Marshall
      (LOM) could be the source of focal activities, the substrate of reentries and a strong
      parasympathetic modulator. For these reasons, LOM may represent a major target in AF
      treatment besides PV isolation. Nevertheless, conventional ablation techniques do not ensure
      the complete destruction of Marshall's musculature and parasympathetic ganglia that surround
      it, largely isolated by a sheath of adipose tissue. To overcome this technical limitation,
      LOM elimination can be achieved by alcohol injection into the vein of Marshall.The
      investigator innovative approach called Marshall Plan will then consists in 3 steps: 1) the
      destruction of Marshall bundles by ethanol infusion followed by the ablation of the distal
      Coronary Sinus (CS) bundles, the ridge and the saddle; 2) the standard PV isolation; 3) and
      finally ablation of the mitral line, the roof and of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus, main causes
      of recurrence in atrial flutter.

      Before ablation procedure patients will be randomized in 2 arms: Marshall Plan (treatment
      arm) or pulmonary vein isolation (control arm). Patients will be followed at 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months in-office visits or hospitalization. Patients will have different tests:
      electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac echography, stress test, 24hours Holter and transtelephonic
      ECG monitor with weekly transmitted ECG and at any time in case of symptoms.
