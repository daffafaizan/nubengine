      cardiac surgery, mediastinal and pleural drains are routinely used. The rate of pneumothorax
      following chest drain removal is approximately 1.5-13%, resulting in increased patient
      morbidity and hospital stay. The standard method for the determination of pneumothorax (PNX)
      in most institutions is to obtain a chest radiography (CXR) following chest tube removal, but
      the reliability of the supine anteroposterior chest radiography is not utter, with up to 30%
      of pneumothoraxes misdiagnosis. The delay of ordering, performing and interpreting a CXR post
      mediastinal tube removal, results in potential delay in patients transfers, with an estimated
      cost savings of omitting an additional chest radiography, of approximately $10 000 per year.

      Lung ultrasound (LUS) is recommended for detection of pneumothorax as per evidence-based
      guidelines and expert consensus. Lung ultrasound is a safe technique due to minimal
      radiation, with the potential for immediate results when compared with the standard CXR. LUS
      has high accuracy for PNX detection, with better pooled sensitivities (78.6%) when compared
      to CXR (39.8%) and equal specificity (98.4 vs 99.3%). In intensive care units, those results
      have been reproducible, with LUS having greater sensitivity than CXR for PNX diagnosis (0.87
      vs 0.46) and equal specificity, 0.99 vs 1.00. LUS is more accurate and faster than chest
      radiography.
