      function. It was especially designed for an effective follow-up of shoulder patients which
      were also allowing for a quantitative assessment of the Constant, Shoulder Pain and
      Disability Index (SPADI) and DASH score consisting of a 30-items questionnaire. It based on
      subjective and objective parameters of shoulder function.

      Standart questionnaire enable to follow patients on a close and regular base with manageable
      effort for both the disability and the patients.an optimal instrument for outcome measurement
      of shoulder problems should meet the following requirments: a) the instrument should be a
      self-assmment patient reporting tool, b) the questions must be easily comprensible, c)
      filling in should be finished less than 30 minutes, d) the results should provide calculation
      of several well established scoring system. MSQ can be completed at home and typical
      functional abilities about evaluation are explained with pictures so these can make it easy.
      As a result, we choose to translate the MSQ into Turkish as it is less costly, practical and
      time consuming than developing a new tool. In addition, objective (normal joint movement and
      muscle strength) and subjective (pain, daily life activity, sport and leisure time
      activities) parameters in a single form to create the advantage in terms of ease of use and
      time. With these properties, MSQ may be preferred during follow-up of the results of
      conservative and / or surgical treatment.
