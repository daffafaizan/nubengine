      and nidus=nest) in 1988.

      The pilonidal disease is usually predisposed by the presence of a deep natal cleft containing
      a lot of hairs within it, which is also supplies a good environment for maceration, sweating,
      hairs penetration, and bacterial contamination . A lot of surgical treatment techniques are
      described for pilonidal sinus disease as simple excision and packing, excision with primary
      midline closure, marsupialization and eccentric closure by different types of flaps.

      Though no surgical technique has been widely accepted, but the flaps closure including natal
      cleft obliteration and eccentric closure are becoming more popular due to their lower rate of
      recurrence.

      Although the off-midline approach seems optimal for closure, the standard off-midline surgery
      has not yet been concluded.

      According to our best knowledge, no randomized study has yet compared the lateral advancement
      adipo-fascio-cutaneous flap and the classic Limberg flap. Therefore, the aim of the present
      study was to compare in a randomized controlled trial the short-term results of the surgical
      treatment of non-complicated pilonidal sinus with the lateral advancement
      adipo-fascio-cutaneous flap versus the classic Limberg flap.
