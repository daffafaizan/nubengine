    
      Lazertinib is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective and irreversible EGFR Tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing
      wild type-EGFR.

      This is a Multi-center, Prospective, Early Access Program of Lazertinib in locally advanced
      or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with T790M mutation-positive after
      1st/2nd generation EGFR TKIs therapy to assess the safety and efficacy of real world evidence
      as second-line treatment.
