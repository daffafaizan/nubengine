      population that grows in parallel with the increased life expectancy at birth in recent
      years. It is characterized with a progressive deterioration in cognitive abilities and
      memory. Due to the increasing losses in cognitive and physical functions, people with
      dementia become in need of nursing over time. Agitation is the most common behavioral
      symptom.

      Agitation is defined as improper verbal, vocal and motor activity that are not purposeful and
      are not caused by confusion. Verbal and physical aggression, restlessness, aimless wandering,
      profanity, self-harm, continuous and repetitive questioning behavior emerges.Agitation should
      be managed with reliable and tolerable, effective methods in order to affect the quality of
      life of both the patient and the caregiver negatively.

      Doll therapy is one of the non-pharmacological methods that can be practiced in managing the
      symptoms of dementia patients. Nurses can practice doll therapy independently, and literature
      reports that it has positive effects on the behaviors, moods, emotions, cognitive states and
      social life of patients with moderate and severe dementia.Our country had no study that
      investigated the effect of doll therapy in managing the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of
      dementia patients. This study is a randomized controlled trial that aims to investigate the
      effect of Doll therapy on the cognitive states and agitation levels of patients with moderate
      and severe dementia.
