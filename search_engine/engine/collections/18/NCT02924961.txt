    
      The goal of this study is to perform a kinematic evaluation of a MB and FB knee prosthesis
      designs (Triathlon, Stryker, USA), by means of fluoroscopy and RSA and compare the different
      designs. The findings of this study will contribute to improve total knee designs and improve
      rehabilitation strategies.

      Objectives:

        1. To evaluate if there is micromotion of the prosthesis with respect to the bone and if
           there is a different migration pattern between the designs.

        2. To assess and compare the in vivo kinematic patterns of the knee designs by means of
           fluoroscopy. This will be done on a subset of the patients (the first 20 patients able
           to perform step-up and lunge motions 6 months post-operatively in a controlled manner
           without the use of bars and walk more than 1 km)

        3. To evaluate if the polyethylene bearing in the mobile bearing is rotating and if this
           changes over time.

        4. Results of the RSA study will be used to correlate the kinematic parameters
           (fluoroscopy) with the migration results in order to identify factors of risk for the
           survival of total knee prostheses.
