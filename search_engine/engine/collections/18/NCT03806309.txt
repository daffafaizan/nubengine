      is chemotherapy, preferential regimen being FOLFIRINOX (5FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and
      oxaliplatin) in fit patients (PS 0-1, bilirubin < 1.5 ULN). The question of how and when the
      FOLFIRINOX regimen and doses can be deescalated after a period of disease control (i.e.
      maintenance therapy) remains unanswered. In routine practice, oxaliplatin is usually stopped
      after 6-8 cycles due to limiting neuropathy, and the fluoropyrimidine is continued, either
      alone or, more frequently, in combination with irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen), until disease
      progression.

      Immune therapies have opened new opportunities in cancer therapy. However, results of
      immunotherapy in PDAC have been disappointing so far, with failure of checkpoint inhibitor
      monotherapies (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies [mAb]) in progressive advanced
      PDAC, while monovalent vaccines were demonstrated to be safe but with limited activity.
