      treatment of Erectile dysfunction in a small randomized controlled trial of 24 men.

      The investigators conduct a phase 2 trial to confirm the initial results in a larger group of
      men.70 males will be included in the study. The participants will be subjected for full
      history taking, general and genital examination. Penile duplex will be performed to assess a
      vascular etiology before the treatment and 2 weeks later. The patients will be randomized
      into a treatment group (35 patients) and a control group (35 patients).

      All patients will sign an informed consent. The treatment group will be injected IC with a
      trimix solution (20 ug alprostadil + 1 mg phentolamine + 30 mg papaverine) for color Doppler
      assessment, followed, next day by 50 units of BTX-A. The control group will be injected with
      the trimix solution during penile color Doppler assessment followed next day with a normal
      saline injection. The erection hardness score (EHS) will be assessed during the Doppler exam.

      Procedure: At least 1 day after the penile color Doppler test, the patient is placed in the
      supine position flaccid and stretched penile length and girth would be measured from tip of
      the penis to the pubic bone will be done. A rubber band will be applied to the base of the
      penis. The skin will be prepped with alcohol swabs followed by the IC injection of 100 units
      of BTX-A. Direct pressure will be applied for 2 minutes. The rubber band will be removed
      after 15 minutes.

      Patients and controls will fill the Sexual Health Inventory for men (SHIM) questionnaire and
      answer the the Sexual Encounter Profile questions 1 and 2 (SEP 2 & SEP 3), and the global
      assessment question (GAQ) before and 4 weeks after treatment.
