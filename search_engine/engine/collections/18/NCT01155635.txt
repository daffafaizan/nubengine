      (STEMI) in the current guidelines although its efficacy in those patients who have undergone
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been adequately evaluated. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate whether beta-blocker, carvedilol improves 6-year
      clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction
      after primary PCI. The design of this study is multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled
      trial enrolling 1300 patients without any exclusion criteria.
