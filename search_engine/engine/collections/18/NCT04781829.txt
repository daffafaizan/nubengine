      compare an antibiotic strategy based on routine use of a novel rapid diagnostic test to usual
      care in critically ill adults with severe community acquired pneumonia (SCAP). We hypothesize
      that when results from a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) are used to guide antibiotic therapy,
      broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure will be reduced in critically ill patients with SCAP
      without an increase in adverse events.
