      sleep laboratories in many European countries (https://esada.med.gu.se/). Since 2007,
      Grenoble is one of the two French centers with Paris and is a very active participant in this
      European database for patient inclusion and data exploitation. A partnership agreement exists
      between University Hospital Grenoble (CHUGA) and ESADA for the reuse of CHUGA data. The data
      collected at CHUGA as part of the ESADA-Follow-up and outcomes questionnaire are also
      collected in the other European centers and will be centralized at the level of the
      coordinating center.

      ESADA currently contains data from more than 30,000 patients with very different severities
      of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome. One of the main limitations of this cohort is the
      relatively limited amount of information concerning the long-term follow-up of the patients
      included in the registry.

      The first objective of the "ESADA Follow-up and outcomes" project is to collect
      cardiovascular events during the follow-up of patients in the European database through
      telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire. Other objectives are to collect
      metabolic events, incident cancers and deaths in the same population using the same mean.

      An additional objective at the end of this data collection is to aggregate the follow-up data
      of more than 10,000 patients from all participating European centers to assess the impact of
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, the reference treatment for OSA) on the occurrence
      of cardiovascular and metabolic events and incident cancers, as this is still discussed in
      the literature.
