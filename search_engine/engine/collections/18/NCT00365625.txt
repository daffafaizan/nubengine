      of a variety of cytokines and adhesion molecules. Recently much attention has focused on the
      Junctional Adhesion Molecules (JAM). The three members of this adhesion molecule family,
      namely, JAM-A, -B and -C, have been shown to govern the last step of leukocyte extravasation
      (transmigration) - the process of leukocytes passing between endothelial cells. In addition
      to transmigration, some members of this family seem to support additional steps in the
      leukocyte extravasation cascade. We recently showed, that antibody-mediated inhibition of
      JAM-C significantly reduced hapten induced skin inflammation (J Invest Dermatol;125(5):969).

      Recent unpublished work from our laboratory showed, that JAM-C expression of lymphocytes can
      be up-regulated through specific activators. Hence, we hypothesize, that JAM-C expression is
      elevated in patients with psoriasis. As it is currently not know, which factors may influence
      the expression of JAM-C, we intend to analyse JAM-C expression on CD3+CD41- cells at several
      time-points during the treatment of psoriatic patients. Expression of JAM-C will then be
      correlated to disease activity (PASI).
