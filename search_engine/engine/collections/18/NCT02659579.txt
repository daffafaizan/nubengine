      Programme is more effective at improving the language development of children than a free
      library reading group. Intervention group: Fifty parents of children (3 to 4-years of age)
      will be recruited to take part in a 8 weeks long shared reading programme. The shared reading
      programme is comprised of two different modules: a) 'Magical Storytimes', in which a
      collection of shared book reading sessions are led by a project worker and b) 'Stories for
      You and Yours', in which parents will be taught how to choose books and read interactively
      with their child. Control group: Fifty further families, matched for age and background will
      be recruited to a reading control group and asked to attend a weekly shared reading group at
      a library where parents/children will read in a shared pre-school library reading group,
      coordinated by a group facilitator. Location: The Shared Reading Programme will take place in
      the child's nursery (in nurseries across Liverpool). Control group parents and children will
      attend a weekly reading group at a library. All standardised tests, for all children, will
      take place in the child's nursery. Language gains from pre- to post- intervention will be
      measured.
