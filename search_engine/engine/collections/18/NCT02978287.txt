      inflammation. This is physiopathologically defined as ischaemia/re-perfusion injury (IRI) in
      organ transplantation. Parathyroid allotransplantation has an increased popularity at the
      last decade. But the cold ischemia due to transportation of the transplant tissue is a very
      important problem.

      Calcium sensing receptor plays a crucial role in regulating Parathormone secretion which
      means controlling of the calcium-dependent systemic ion homeostasis.

      The investigators developed a new tissue transporting solution for parathyroid
      allotransplantation and the investigators measured the parathyroid cell viability and the the
      amount of calcium sensing receptor of the parathyroid cells at the 0., 6., 12. and 24. hours
      of the parathyroid cells which were placed into our new solution.
