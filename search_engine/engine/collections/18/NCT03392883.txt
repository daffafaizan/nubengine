      Latin America. Specifically, in this new multi-component, mental health service delivery
      intervention, the investigators propose to: (1) harness mobile behavioral health technology
      for mental health (with a primary focus on depression and a secondary focus on problematic
      alcohol and other substance abuse), (2) launch new workforce training and service delivery
      models (including the integration of technology into service delivery), (3) launch and evolve
      an integrated data management system for systematic data tracking and outcomes assessment,
      and (4) launch and grow a learning collaborative of organizations integrating mental health
      into primary care. The investigators will launch this project at multiple primary care sites
      in various parts of Colombia, with a plan to inform subsequent adoption in several other
      Latin American countries, including Chile and Peru.
