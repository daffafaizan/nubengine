    
      In this study, patients will be observed who receive an E-vita OPEN NEO implant for the
      treatment of thoracic aneurysm or acute or chronic thoracic dissection. E-vita OPEN NEO will
      be implanted according to the instructions for use and at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      Participating physicians will provide their observations collected during routine care for
      patients treated with E-vita OPEN NEO. Written informed consent, specifically allowing the
      use of clinical records for this observational study, will be obtained from every patient
      prior to data collection.

      The period of data collection will be approximately 60 months from the date of intervention
      for each patient. Source data verification will be performed on 100% of the patients; data
      from all the visits that was provided in the database will be reviewed and verified against
      existing source documents. Complete DICOM image files of the CT scans will be sent to the
      CoreLab for independent evaluation. All adverse events defined prior to study start will be
      adjudicated by the Clinical Event Committee (CEC).
