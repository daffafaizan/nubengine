      sleep). Poor quality and fragmented sleep leads to an increase in the risk for development of
      chronic health conditions. Given the importance of good quality sleep and its critical role
      in overall well-being, there is a need for regular monitoring and assessment of sleep quality
      in individuals. However, current technologies will only allow for this to be performed in
      sleep clinics and with the help of full polysomnography (PSG) systems which require the
      patients to spend a night at the clinic with several wired electrodes connected to their
      scalp. This will cause discomfort for the patients in a long run. To solve this problem,
      Compumedics has recently developed a miniaturized, portable and affordable sleep monitoring
      system with code name of "Somfit" which can be used in the comfort of patients' home. The aim
      of this study is to validate Somfit for home based sleep studies.
