    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumour effects of treatment with
      Prolarix in subjects with advanced HCC (Child-Pugh A and B only).

      All subjects will receive an IV infusion of Prolarix once every 21 days until disease
      progression is observed.

      Subjects will have CT scans for tumour measurements before starting treatment with Prolarix
      and every 6 weeks until disease progression.

      Subjects will undergo evaluation for safety (adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory
      measurements, weight, ECG) every 21 days until disease progression.
