      are performed with any number of FDA cleared catheters, guide wires, and devices designed for
      efficient removal of clot within an intracranial vessel. Among institutions involved in this
      case study, the latest devices are readily available and fully support standard treatment
      paradigms.

      However, several cases, recently completed, using only large bore catheter and aspiration
      have anecdotally demonstrated a superior ability to remove clot from vessels, restoring blood
      flow to the affected vessel and brain tissue. In these limited number of cases, full
      restoration of blood flow has been achieved. While this combination of approved devices is
      minimalistic, the efficiency of the procedure, rapid technical success, and relative
      simplicity of the approach is unique and should be thoroughly reviewed and possibly prepared
      for publication.
