      dysfunction (segmental wall motion abnormalities, cardiac-specific enzyme elevations, and ECG
      changes) in patients with SAH. 2) Determination of predictive clinical variables for the
      occurrence of myocardial dysfunction following SAH. 3) Impact of myocardial dysfunction on
      neurological prognosis: death, secondary cerebral ischemia, hydrocephalus and rebleeding.

      Methods: For this purpose serial echocardiograms and ECGs will be obtained and cardiac
      enzymes will be measured in 200-400 patients admitted to hospital with SAH in the four
      participating centers. The clinical variables that will be studied to predict cardiac
      dysfunction are: medical history, the CT-scan score, circulatory parameters, blood samples,
      medication, surgical intervention (coiling or clipping), and the neurological condition
      (Glasgow Coma Scale). The echocardiograms, ECGs and cardiac enzymes will be studied to
      determine if they have independent prognostic value for the outcome in SAH patients.

      Expected Results: As ECG changes and drops in blood pressure are known to occur frequently,
      the researchers expect to find that cardiac contractile dysfunction in patients with SAH
      occurs more frequently than is assumed now. Moreover, if cardiac abnormalities have
      neurological prognostic significance further studies are needed for early recognition and
      treatment of the cardiac abnormalities in SAH, a condition with a very poor prognosis.
