      health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

      Specific pharmacological treatment and - in selected patients, refractory to agents - lung or
      combined heart and lung transplantation can improve physical functioning and long term
      survival. Initial trials with limited numbers of patients were encouraging. Investigation of
      larger cohorts is essential to assess the efficacy of rehabilitation programmes in PH.

      We hypothesize that a 3 week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves PC, BC and
      HRQOL in patients with PH in functional classes (FC) II and III. Critical ill patients with a
      functional class IV are excluded. All patients with PH undergo a 3-week inpatient
      rehabilitation program (interval bicycle and strength training, physiotherapy, psychological
      support, education). Exercise testing (peak work load (PWL) 6-min-walk distance), body
      composition (bioimpedance analysis BIA: lean body mass (LBM), body cell mass (BCM), BCM/LBM
      ratio, phase angle (PA)) and HRQOL (SF 36 questionnaire) are assessed at baseline and
      completion of PR.
