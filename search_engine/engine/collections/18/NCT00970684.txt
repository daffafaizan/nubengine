      Primary

        -  Estimate the 1-year progression-free survival rate in patients with stage IIIB, stage
           IV, or recurrent non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer treated with bevacizumab,
           docetaxel, and gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Estimate the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the median overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the incidence of adverse events associated with this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes and docetaxel IV over 60 minutes
      on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with responsive or stable disease may then continue to receive bevacizumab
      alone for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
