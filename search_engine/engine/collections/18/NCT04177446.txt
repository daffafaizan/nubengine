      factors. And nutritional supplement, particularly the supplement of protein, can decrease the
      nitrogen balance, improve the nutritional status, accelerate the speed of healing and
      decrease the mortality rate. This is a multi center prospective randomized controlled trial.
      180 patients with critical illness will be included and randomly divided into two groups. In
      the control group, patients will be fed with basic energy; and in the experiment group, the
      patients will be given extra protein intake except the basic energy intake. The intervention
      duration will last 6 days. The primary outcomes of this study are urea nitrogen of 24h and
      prealbumin(PA). And other outcomes include nutritional status(total protein, albumin, grip
      and calf circumference), safety indicators(liver function, kidney function, tolerance, etc.)
      and clinical indicators(overall complication rate, length of hospital stay and cost).
