      on the erythrocyte aggregation, further providing a feasible strategy for developing an
      appropriate exercise regimen that improves cardiopulmonary fitness and minimizes the risk of
      hemorheological disorders. This study evaluated the distinct effects of hypoxic exercise
      training (HE) and normaxia exercise training (NE) for 6 weeks on the following issue: (1)
      intrinsic/extrinsic erythrocyte aggregation, (2) binding affinity of fibrinogen to
      erythrocyte, (3) erythrocyte turnover rate and (4) characteristic of mature erythrocytes in
      blood, under hypoxic exercise test (HET) (100W under air 12% O2 condition) in healthy
      sedentary men.
