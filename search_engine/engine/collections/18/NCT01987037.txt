      the battery to evaluate the psychomotor functions. The results will be compared with other
      data collected from the routine practise : socio-demographic data, medical and developmental
      antecedents,psychological tests (KABC II, Rey test, London Tower test, ...), psychomotor
      evaluation (MABC, evaluation of manual praxis, visual abilities, Frostig test), understanding
      data (N-EEL test), neuropediatric examination, clinical assessment (ADI-R, CARS).

      The use of this battery allows this fine discriminative assessment of the psychomotor
      functions involved in the movement. Exploring each function will allow to take into account
      qualitative and quantitative aspects of the movement in every aspects, and this is not
      applied in the routine care until now. Calibration for each event can explore each function
      independently of each other, and will provide information to determine any specific
      developmental characteristics improve care.
