           are analyzed to investigate the length of lesions, reference vessel diameter, and
           minimal vessel diameter.

        4. intravascular ultrasound In the blinded state, the vessel's vessel area, plaque area,
           lumen area, etc. are measured by analyzing intravascular ultrasound images of the
