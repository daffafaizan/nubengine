      (n=11). During the nitrite infusion and for 120 min after the infusion is completed, blood
      pressure and heart rate will be monitored.

      The first 3 patients randomized to receive IV nitrite will receive the lowest dose (1 mg) of
      IV nitrite and compared to one placebo treated patient. If there is no significant decrease
      in blood pressure or elevation in heart rate, we will then dose escalate to the 6 mg dose in
      4 patients and placebo in two patients. Dose escalation to the highest (14 mg) dose will
      again be contingent on the absence of significant hypotension or tachycardia in the drug
      treated patients compared to the pooled (n=3) placebo treated patients. The final block of
      patients will be randomized to the high nitrite dose (n=4) or placebo (n=2). Final
      comparisons of all groups will be made to the pooled (n=5) placebo group
