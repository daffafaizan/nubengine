    
      A total of 36 subjects with active eosinophilic esophagitis (≥ 15 eosinophils/HPF; SDI PRO ≥
      5) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive BT-11 500 mg twice daily, BT-11 1000 mg
      once daily, or placebo. Each of the treatment arms will comprise 12 subjects. The
      randomization will be stratified by ongoing PPI use at baseline (yes/no) and prior
      corticosteroid use (yes/no).

      The study will consist of a 28-day screening period, a 12-week induction phase, and a 2-week
      post-treatment safety follow-up period. A final analysis will be conducted after all subjects
      have reached Week 12.
