      Resection - TUR), followed by series of intravesical instillations of prophylactic
      chemotherapeutic drugs such as Mitomycin C (MMC) or BCG. Unfortunately, this treatment
      approach is limited due to rapid dilution of the chemotherapeutic drug by the incoming urine
      and clearance by urination.

      TheraCoat's core technology is based on a reverse thermal biodegradable gel (TC-3 Gel) (low
      viscosity at cold temperature (5Â°C) and gel appearance at body temperature)for drug retention
      in the urinary bladder.

      Prior to instillation, the TC-3 Gel, in its liquid state, is mixed with MMC and instilled
      into the bladder by a standard catheter. Once inside the bladder, the gel solidifies and
      forms a drug reservoir. Upon contact with urine, the gel dissolves, release the drug slowly
      and is finally cleared out from the bladder.

      Intravesical MMC instillation using TheraCoat's gel is expected to increase treatment
      efficiency due to prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder
      exposure to MMC.

      Treatment Protocol - Immediately following baseline cystoscopy and tumor diagnosis and
      patient undergoes 6 weekly instillations followed by 2-4 weeks healing period.

      1st Follow-Up Visit (Pre-Scheduled TURBT Visit): The patient will undergo a second cystoscopy
      to compare to baseline status. The patient will be followed-up for a period of 1 year as
      follows: 3,6,9,12 months.
