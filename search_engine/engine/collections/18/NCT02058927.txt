    
      This is a prospective, observational cohort study of 230 HIV-1-infected children initiating
      ART at public clinics in Lusaka, Zambia to measure the magnitude and quality of general
      immune reconstitution and pathogen-specific immune reconstitution to measles virus.
      Non-specific immune reconstitution will be assessed by serial measurements of the number and
      percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, number and percentages of activated CD4+ and CD8+
      T-lymphocytes (using cell surface staining for HLA-DR and CD38), changes in the proportions
      of na√Øve and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte subsets (using cell surface staining for
      CD45RA and CCR7), and changes in thymic output as determined by TREC levels. Virologic
      responses to ART will be assessed by serial measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels.

      Within the observational study, there is a nested study of revaccination against measles
      virus of HIV-1-infected children receiving ART who lack protective antibody titers to assess
      the proportion of revaccinated children who develop protective immunity and the duration of
      protective immunity. Anti-measles virus IgG antibodies will be measured 9 months after
      initiation of ART. The results will be available at the 12-month follow-up visit and measles
      revaccination will be recommended to those children lacking protective antibody levels to
      measles virus.
