      with a portable telemedicine system. In cases of suspected acute coronary syndrome (including
      STEMI), the paramedics can use this system to contact a so called "tele-EMS physician" after
      consent of the patient is obtained. The tele-EMS physician has an audio-connection to the EMS
      team and receives vital parameters (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure)
      in real-time. Also 12-lead-ECGs can transmitted to the tele-EMS physician. The transmission
      of still pictures - taken with a smartphone - and video streaming from the inside of the
      ambulance can be carried out, if meaningful. The tele-EMS physician supports the EMS team in
      obtaining all relevant medical history, ECG diagnosis, general diagnosis and can delegate the
      application of medications. This can be carried out to bridge the time to the arrival of an
      EMS physician or in less severe cases without an EMS physician on-scene.

      The quality of prehospital care and the possible influences on the initial inhospital phase
      should be investigated and compared with regular EMS.
