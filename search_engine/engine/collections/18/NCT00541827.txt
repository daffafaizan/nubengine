      skeletal muscle and circulating platelets of severely septic and septic shock ICU-admitted
      patients, as compared to otherwise healthy surgical ones. In order to better clarify the
      pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction during sepsis, cardiogenic shock patients
      (suffering from systemic hypoperfusion) will act as additional controls. Markers of oxidative
      stress will be measured in tissue samples from septic patients. The clinical relevance of
      mitochondrial dysfunction during sepsis will be assessed in terms of both skeletal muscle and
      platelet function.
