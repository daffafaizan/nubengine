      non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2 and compared to arterial blood samples
      assessed by COOximetry. A minimum of 10 healthy adult subjects, ranging in pigmentation from
      light to dark, will be enrolled in the study to meet the study design requirements defined by
      ISO 80601-2-61 and by the FDA's Guidance for Pulse Oximeters (March 4, 2013). The subjects
      will have an arterial catheter placed in the radial artery to allow for simultaneous blood
      samples during stable plateaus of induced hypoxic levels. The investigational devices will be
      placed on fingers for the test sites. Simultaneous data collection will be set up for each of
      the systems under test.

      For the data analysis, the control oximeter will be used to assess the stability of each data
      point. Data that is found to be unstable will be removed prior to the comparative analysis.
      Next the CO-Oximeter data will be reviewed to make sure it does not contain any anomalous
      values such as elevated COHb, MetHb or inconsistent data. Anomalous values will be removed
      from the analysis prior to pairing of the SpO2 and SaO2 data. The statistical analysis is
      performed on a minimum of 200 data points collected on at least 10 subjects for the range of
      67% to 100% SaO2. Functional SaO2 as measured by Reference CO-Oximetry will be used as the
      basis for comparison. The Accuracy Root Mean Square (ARMS) calculation is used to determine
      the SpO2 accuracy performance. Success will be achieved with an ARMS of 3 or better showing
      equivalence to the Gold Standard Reference CO-Oximetry providing documentation to support
      SpO2 accuracy claims for the investigational device.
