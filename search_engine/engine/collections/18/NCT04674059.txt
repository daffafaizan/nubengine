      accessibility to intensive mental health care in Rwanda for patients with bipolar disorder.

      Knowing about the barriers to treatment, risk and protective factors as well as the current
      treatment offered for patients with bipolar disorder is essential for the development of
      therapeutic approaches and improvement in access to care. Up to now, no data on
      characteristics of patients with bipolar disorder in Rwanda and related risk and protective
      factors is available. For this purpose, all outpatients with bipolar disorder in Rwanda age >
      18 years, will over a 1-year period be invited to participate in a survey on their experience
      living with bipolar disorder in Rwanda. Moreover, patients and relatives will be invited for
      in-depth interviews to explore their perceptions and experiences with the mental health
      system. Health care providers will meet for focus discussions on to assess the experience,
      knowledge and practice of caregiving for individuals with bipolar disorder.
