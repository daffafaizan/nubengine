    
      It is a prospective, randomized trial.

      The patients will be randomized to one of the 2 groups:

      Group 1 - NERVE BLOCK. Ultrasound-guided ILIH nerve block will be performed by attending
      anaesthesiologist.

      Group 2 - LOCAL INFILTRATION. Local anaesthetic infiltration of the operative area will be
      performed by operator.

      During surgery patients will receive low-dose propofol infusion in order to achieve conscious
      sedation level, when indicated.

      An extra dose of local anaesthetic drug for infiltration of the surgical field or intravenous
      fentanyl or/and intravenous paracetamol will be given as rescue analgesics in patients
      reporting pain sensation.

      The patients will be observed for 24 hours. The pain at rest will be assessed using numeric
      rating scale (NRS 0 -10; 0 = no pain: 10 = max pain imaginable).

      On the first postoperative day intravenous analgesics will be given on demand (paracetamol 1
      g iv (if NRS <5) and oxycodone 2,5 mg iv (if NRS > or = 5)).
