      altered cerebral representation when they attempt to process a verbal WM task. Specifically,
      our data show a post-TBI pattern of activation that is dispersed and more lateralized to the
      right hemisphere, as compared to healthy controls. Taken together, we interpret these
      findings to mean that it is requires more cerebral resources for TBI subjects to process
      tasks that were previously more automatic. In other words, their processing is less
      efficient. This is consistent with TBI patients' self-reports of needing to expend greater
      cognitive effort to perform such tasks, both in the lab and in everyday life. Our preliminary
      data was the first step in understanding the cerebral substrate of these difficulties.
      However, simply indicating that individuals with TBI have a WM problem is not enough. The
      development of targeted interventions to ameliorate these deficits is the next step in the
      treatment process.

      The present proposal has important implications for TBI rehabilitation. One of the major
      goals of cognitive remediation is to help TBI patients learn new information more accurately
      and efficiently, and to improve their performance in activities of everyday life. 123 Because
      WM impairments are so prevalent in TBI, the present study can help to shed light on potential
      treatment alternatives for these potentially devastating problems. In spite of the prevalence
      and popularity of cognitive remediation strategies and procedures, there remains little
      empirical support for their efficacy, and virtually no understanding of the underlying
      neurocognitive processes that facilitate intervention. The ability to develop a potentially
      efficacious treatment modality, which has a solid foundation, would be immensely beneficial.
