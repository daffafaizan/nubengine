    
      Three DOACs with marketing authorisation in Switzerland and the EU for the prevention of
      stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation can be used. Eligible
      patients will be randomly assigned to either the control (antiplatelet) or the experimental
      (DOAC) arm with a ratio of 1:1. Each study participant will be observed during a follow up
      period within one year after index stroke.
