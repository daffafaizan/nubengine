      I. To assess the clinical activity of MLN8237 (alisertib) in patients with recurrent or
      persistent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus who have received one or two prior cytotoxic
      therapies and the frequency of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      after initiating therapy or have objective tumor response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE v4) among women with leiomyosarcoma
      treated with MLN8237.

      II. To determine the distribution of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relationship of Aurora A Kinase expression, measured by
      immunohistochemistry, with objective response, PFS at 6 months, survival, and
      progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
