      demonstrating the risks associated with long term opioid therapy, non-opioid modalities need
      to be developed. Spinal cord stimulators are implanted devices that modulate the pain
      signaling system in the spinal cord. This research hopes to determine if the use of a spinal
      cord stimulator in patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy will lead to an
      increase in quality of life and decrease in pain.The primary endpoints will be the number of
      patients who undergo permanent implantation. The endpoints will measure pain with the Brief
      Pain Inventory Short Form visual analog scale. The sleep quality will be measured using the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment.
