    
      100 consecutive high-risk patients who meet the following inclusion criteria: are 18-75 years
      of age, require a cervical spine MRI as part of their standard of care show evidence of CSM,
      and have cervical alignment allowing posterior instrumented fusion. High-risk will be defined
      as having a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, current smoker, or BMI >30.
      Patients will be excluded if they have any MRI incompatible devices, have any prior cervical
      instrumentation, require an instrumented anterior cervical fusion, or have an underlying
      neurological condition affecting the cervical spine (MS, ALS, HIV).

      Patients will be sequentially randomized to one of two treatment groups. Group I, will
      receive current best practice for posterior instrumented fusion (locally harvested autograft,
      demineralized bone matrix, and cadaveric allograft). Group II, will receive locally harvested
      autograft and 20 cc of bone marrow aspirate concentration. To assist with analysis, we will
      collect information from patients' hematology results, obtained per their standard of care
      pre-operative workup. All patients will be treated post-operatively at the discretion of the
      treating surgeon. All patients will follow-up at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and
      24 months. At the 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up all patients will undergo flexion/extension
      X-rays, fusion will be defined as less than 2 mm or motion. A cervical spine CT may also be
      obtained at 24 months on all patients to assess fusion at the discretion of the treating
      surgeon. All radiographic assessments of fusion will be made by a Washington University staff
      radiologist, blinded to patient treatment.
