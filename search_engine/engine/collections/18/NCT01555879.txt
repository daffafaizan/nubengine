        -  Abatacept aids in achieving low disease activity or clinical remission in patients of
           the following Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) sub-groups: RF+/CCP+, RF+/CCP- RF-/CCP+
           RF-/CCP-; first time on a bio-tech drug; having previously failed a biological drug;
           having interstitial lung disease; identified as disabled; twenty-eight individual joints
           identified as {swollen, painful, tender, deformed or having decreased range of motion};
           on or not on oral DMARD; age; or gender.

        -  A database with sufficient attributes exists from which a patient's efficacy on
           abatacept is accurately predictable.
