      design(15), to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of 1) Cabazitaxel, in Part A, and 2)
      Radiotherapy, in Part B. The determination of the MTD is given in Section 5.2, Definition of
      Dose - Limiting Toxicity. All patients who enter the study, and begin concurrent
      chemo-radiation are analyzable for the primary endpoint of the study.

      Assuming that dose-limiting toxicity is not encountered, and both the maximum dose of
      Cabazitaxel is reached, in Part A of the study, and the maximum dose of Radiotherapy is
      reached in Part B of the study, the maximum number of patients required is as follows:
      Clinical Study Protocol - The JET study Date: September 11, 2012 Part A: 3 patients per level
      x 5 levels, plus 3 patients (for a total of 6) at the highest dose level of Cabazitaxel = 15
      + 3 = 18 Part B: 3 patients per level x 3 levels, plus 3 patients (for a total of 6) at the
      highest dose level of Radiotherapy = 9 + 3 = 12 The total number of patients required is 30.
      Patients that do not complete concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and androgen deprivation
      therapy, for reasons other than DLT will be replaced.

      Given our experience in chemo-radiation studies in a similar patient population, our Centre
      is anticipated to accrue 3 patients per month.
