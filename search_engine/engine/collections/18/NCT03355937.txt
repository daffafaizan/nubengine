      examination will be perform on day 3 of the cycle for assessment of ovarian size and to
      exclude patients with large ovarian cysts. If a cyst >20 mm is present, the cycle will
      cancel. At an initial dose of 225 IU, hMG will be given daily by IM injection commencing on
      day 3 of the cycle. The dose will be adjusted as re- quired depending on the E2 (estradiol)
      level. Daily endovaginal US examinations for follicle growth assessment will be started when
      the E2 level reached 275 pg/mL (1,000 pmoljL). When at least two follicles would reach 18 mm
      in diameter, 5,000 IU of hCG will be administered intramuscularly. Oocyte retrieval will be
      performed vaginally under US guidance 36 hours later. Sperm for ICSI procedure of oocytes
      will be prepared by a standard swim-up technique using for control group and sperm chip
      method will be used for study group for Unexplained Infertility and Recurrent Implantation
      Failure group. Uterine transfer of embryos will be carry out fifth day after oocyte retrieval
      using a catheter.
