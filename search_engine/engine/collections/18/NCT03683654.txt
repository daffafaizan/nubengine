    
      Subjects participating in the study are characterized by the availability of one 24-hr urine
      sample, blood serum, 24-hr dietary recall (24HDR) and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
      data.

      The main objectives of the proposal are:

        1. To collect a set of high-quality metabolomic data containing rich information on the
           food-derived metabolome.

        2. To mine this data in different Metabolome-Wide Association Studies in order to identify
           food-derived metabolites discriminating consumers and non-consumers of various foods,
           nutrients and dietary patterns.

        3. To identify the food-derived metabolites characteristic of the consumption of the
           different foods/nutrients and dietary patterns.
