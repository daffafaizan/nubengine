      forms of childhood osteoporosis is idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Affected children suffer
      from pain, decreased activity tolerance, and increased fractures, including vertebral
      compression fractures. Even mild childhood osteoporosis may have long-term consequences since
      individuals who achieve a lower peak bone mass during the first 2-3 decades of life may be at
      increased risk for osteoporosis as adults.

      Alendronate (Fosamax (Trademark), Merck & Co.), an aminobisphosphonate, is a potent inhibitor
      of bone resorption. It has been used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis, idiopathic male
      osteoporosis, and glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis in adults. The goal of this protocol is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Alendronate in children with glucocorticoid induced and
      idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study
      design. We hypothesize that children treated with this drug will have an improvement in bone
      mineral density and decrease in osteoporotic fractures.
