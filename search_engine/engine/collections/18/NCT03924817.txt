      volume of the pharynx decreases. Air cannot pass through as it would in the awake state and
      thus airflow limitations occur. Diminishing airflow can lead to snoring or to the airways
      collapsing completely (obstructive sleep apnea, OSA). Patients who suffer from OSA have
      trouble breathing during sleep and will have a disturbed sleep architecture as repeated
      airway closure causes wake reactions and arousals. This does not only lead to severe daytime
      sleepiness with high risk of causing car accidents, for instance, but also affects synaptic
      activity during sleep and the balance of blood gas levels. These factors can have a
      aggravating effect on blood pressure and worsen the prognosis for cardiovascular
      comorbidities. First line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is positive airway
      pressure (PAP) that keeps the airways open with a pneumatic splint. Positive airway pressure
      is being applied through a facial mask and some patients cannot tolerate this therapy or
      refuse it. An alternative treatment approach is by fitting an MAD that the patient wears
      during sleep. An MAD pushes the lower jar forward and thereby increases the volume of the
      upper airways, thus preventing them to close. Studies have shown good compliance with MAD
      therapy and benefits in terms of sleepiness and quality of life. The Narval registry study
      aims to investigate MAD usage in real life and reasons for non-compliance. The registry aims
      to record patient characteristics (e.g. comorbidities) and side effects that lead to a
      termination of therapy, but also how the costs for therapy are split between the patient and
      public or private health insurance providers and how this affects therapy initiation and
      usage.
