      muscles in the body. Six DMD patients ages 3 months to 3 years in Cohort A, and six DMD
      patients ages 4 years to age 7 years in Cohort B, will be enrolled. All patients will receive
      SRP-9001. Patients will have infusions over 1-2 hours in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit
      (PICU) at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Before the gene therapy a muscle biopsy will be
      done at the screening visit. Patients will have a second muscle biopsy to see if the gene
      allowed for replacement of the missing dystrophin protein at 90 days post-delivery. After the
      gene transfer, patients will be carefully monitored, for 5 years to evaluate any side effects
      of the treatment.
