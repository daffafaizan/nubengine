      months of age with high-risk NB with primary refractory disease or in first relapse. Patients
      will be randomized 2:1 to receive either IT + naxitamab + GM-CSF or IT alone. Patients
      randomized to treatment with IT alone who either develop progressive disease or do not
      achieve overall response at or during the initial 4 cycles or who discontinue IT treatment
      due to toxicity, will be offered treatment with naxitamab + GM-CSF; naxitamab treatment can
      be administered with IT (treatment group C) or without IT (Treatment group D), as applicable.
      The Follow-Up period ends 2 years after randomization.
