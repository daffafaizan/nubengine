      Traditionally this nerve is blocked to alleviate tourniquet pain. The etiology of tourniquet
      pain is complex and the study team hypothesize that blocking the ICBN has no impact on
      tourniquet pain. Patients will receive a supraclavicular block and be divided into two
      groups; ICBN with local anesthetic or ICBN with saline. All patients in this study will
      receive a supraclavicular block as their primary anesthetic and then be divided into two
      groups; those who receive ICBN and those who do not. Amount of intraoperative analgesics,
      conversion to deep sedation or general anesthesia, and onset of time to tourniquet pain will
      be the primary measures of this study.
