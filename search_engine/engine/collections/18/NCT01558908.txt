    
      The purpose of the trial is to determine safety of intramuscularly derived menstrual
      mesenchymal stem cells (otherwise known as Endometrial Regenerative Cells, or ERC) in
      patients with critical limb ischemia ineligible for revascularization. Safety will be defined
      as freedom from treatment associated adverse events. Efficacy parameters will comprise
      endpoints of changes in ankle-brachial index, toe-brachial index, TcPO2, ulcer healing, rest
      pain, quality of life, and reduction in amputation.

      Patients will receive 25, 50, or 100 million menstrual derived mesenchymal stem cells
      (Endometrial Regenerative Cells: ERC) in ten injections of 2.5, 5, or 10 million mesenchymal
      stem cells suspended in a volume of 1 ml per injection. Injections will be spaced at least 2
      centimeters apart from each other in the gastrocnemius muscle above the failed vascular
      perfusion area.
