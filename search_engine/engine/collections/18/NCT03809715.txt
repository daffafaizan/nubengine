      eluting stent system which is an improved version of the predecessor device Coroflex® ISAR
      which was extensively studied in the ISAR 2000 Registry. The rationale of this observational,
      post-market, single-armed study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of Coroflex® ISAR NEO,
      also as part of the manufacturer's post-market surveillance obligations in particular for the
      re-certification of the device.
