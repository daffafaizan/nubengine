      groups (42 patients for each), upon enrolment into the study.

      In the first group, the blind technique is used to perform the medial brachial cutaneous
      nerve block and the intercostobrachial nerve block : it consists in performing a subcutaneous
      injection of the local anesthetic at the root of the arm, in the anterior-posterior
      direction.

      In the second group, the ultrasound-guided technique is used to perform the medial brachial
      cutaneous nerve block and the intercostobrachial nerve block : ultrasounds are used to
      visualize the anatomical variations, the good position of the needle and the good local
      anesthetic diffusion.

      The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided technique compared to blind
      technique in medial brachial cutaneous nerve block and intercosto-brachial nerve block, in
      the axilla
