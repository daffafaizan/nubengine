      study are to compare intravenous (IV) daptomycin and IV vancomycin administered in a home
      infusion setting for the treatment of cSSSI due to Gram-positive bacteria in participants who
      are prescribed vancomycin for 7-14 days and who are planning to receive vancomycin in a home
      infusion setting. Study objectives include evaluation of clinical and resource utilization
      endpoints and economic analysis from the perspective of the home infusion provider.
