      Cannulation itself can carry substantial risk to the patient. Acute pancreatitis following
      ERCP can occur up to 5% of cases. The risk increases in patients with non dilated bile ducts,
      young age, known past history of pancreatitis and suspected sphincter of oddi dysfunction.
      During the procedure of ERCP, the number of pancreatograms also correlates with incidence of
      post ERCP pancreatitis. Hydrostatic pressure by contrast injection into the pancreatic duct
      may be the principal cause of pancreatitis. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized
      controlled trials that compared the technique of contrast guided to wire guide cannulation in
      achieving bile duct cannulation during ERCP and found that wire guide cannulation was better
      at the prevention of post ERCP pancreatitis. The use of a guide wire obviates the need for
      contrast injection. The current standard is the use of a 0.035" guidewire with a hydrophilic
      tip. We now postulate that the use of a 0.025" further reduces post-ERCP pancreatitis as a
      finer wire theoretically induces less trauma to the pancreatic orifice.
