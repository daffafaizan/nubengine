      in association with implantation of different devices in cardiovascular diseases
      (percutaneous valve replacement and circulatory support devices).

      The main objective of the study was to describe the time-course of VWF abnormalities
      onset/offset during implantation of devices in cardiovascular diseases.

      Adult patients > 18 years who need a CF-LVAD or trans-aortic valve implantation are included
      in this cohort; Blood samples are obtained just before procedures
