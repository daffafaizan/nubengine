    
      -  Sections of the tumor tissue will be HE stained.

        -  Sections of the tumor tissue will be stained with an uPAR antibody for
           immunohistochemistry.

        -  Immunohistochemical staining against cytokeratin which colors cancer cells will be made
           to assist the observer in the evaluation of uPAR microexpression pattern.

        -  A semiqualitative scale corresponding to the level of uPAR expression will be made.

        -  Quantitative polymerase chain reaction will be used to validate the immunohistochemistry
           uPAR expression pattern.

        -  An electronic scoring system (digital pathology) will be trained to access the
           expression of uPAR in both tumor- and normal tissue.
