      physiological studies of patients with focal dystonia have demonstrated sensory dysfunction.
      It has also been shown that patients with dystonia have impaired sensory perception including
      when assessed with the JVP gap detection test. This could possibly result from enlargement
      and dedifferentiation of representations in the sensory cortex. We therefore hypothesize that
      sensory training could improve the impaired sensory perception and hence improve the
      dystonia. This study will examine if Braille reading as a sensory training program can
      correct the sensory perception and the dystonia. The primary outcome is improvement in the
      JVP gap detection test.
