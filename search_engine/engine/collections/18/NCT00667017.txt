    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell
           non-Hodgkin lymphoma (CTCL) following treatment with RFT5-dgA immunotoxin (anti-CD25
           immunotoxin IMTOX25) .

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether responses correlate with the level of CD25+ expression on the CTCL
           tumor cells.

        -  Determine whether changes in the pre-treatment and the post-treatment levels of
           CD4+CD25+ Treg cells correlate with responses.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive anti-CD25 immunotoxin IMTOX25 IV over 4 hours on days 1, 3, and 5.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Tissue and blood samples are collected at baseline, and during study for CD25+ expression by
      fluorescent-activated cell sorter analysis, immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
