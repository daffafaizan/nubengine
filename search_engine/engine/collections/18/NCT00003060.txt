      melanoma who have failed first-line therapy when treated with match-related allogeneic bone
      marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients receive a preparative regimen of busulfan and
      cyclophosphamide. Busulfan PO is administered every 6 hours on days -7 to -4.
      Cyclophosphamide IV is administered on days -3 to -2 followed by one day of rest. Bone marrow
      infusion occurs on day 0. Cyclosporine begins on day -1 and continues until day 180.
      Methotrexate IV is administered on days 1, 3, 6, and 11. Granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor is administered as a continuous IV every 2 hours starting on day 12 and continuing
      until absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1,000 g/dL for 2 consecutive days. Patients
      receive weekly follow up for the first 180 days and monthly thereafter. Patients are followed
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 6 patients with melanoma will be accrued.
