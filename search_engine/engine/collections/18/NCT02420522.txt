    
      This is an open-label pilot study to test the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) on cognitive improvement in individuals with mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI). 16 patients with trauma-related MCI and 16 patients with non-trauma-related MCI will
      be recruited. All patients will undergo one week of active rTMS stimulation and one week of
      sham stimulation, separated by at least one week. Each treatment week will consist of five
      consecutive daily stimulation sessions. The order of active versus sham treatment sessions
      will be counterbalanced across subjects within each group (i.e., half of the subjects in each
      group will receive active stimulation first and half will receive sham first). Cognitive and
      psychological assessments will be administered before and after each week of rTMS therapy,
      for both active and sham conditions.

      Additional participants (n=32; 16 without TBI) will be recruited who are receiving a full
      course (30 sessions) of active rTMS treatment (without a sham intervention). These
      participants will complete the same cognitive testing as the sham-crossover group at three
      time-points: pre-treatment, mid-treatment (after session 16), and post-treatment (after
      session 30).
