      cholecystectomy will be invited to participate. Those having da Vinci cholecystectomy
      procedures will also be eligible. The da Vinci System is a minimally invasive option
      utilizing robotic technology. Once randomized, the patient will undergo either ultrasound
      guided bilateral TAP blocks or LWI at the beginning of the surgical procedure. Prospective
      data regarding pain scores, use of opioid medication, and nausea and vomiting episodes will
      be collected for both groups. Due to the nature of the study, it will not be possible to
      blind the investigators to the randomly selected method of injecting local anesthesia;
      however the personnel involved in the post-anesthetic and post-operative assessment will be
      blinded to the intervention, as well as the subjects themselves.
