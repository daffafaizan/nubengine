      HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of CD4 cell count or disease stage ("Option B+") and
      given the high antenatal HIV seroprevalence, HIV-infected pregnant women represent the
      largest group of patients initiating ART in primary care facilities. However, there are few
      well developed models of service delivery to support implementation. There are particular
      concerns regarding the postpartum period, with multiple studies indicating high levels of
      non-retention in care and/or inadequate adherence to treatment postnatally. Adherence Clubs
      (ACs) are an innovative but untested model of care based on chronic disease management
      strategies that emphasize social support, adherence to treatment and retention in care,
      rather than intensive clinical management, as the most important determinant of long-term
      health outcomes in stable patients in chronic care. ACs have preliminarily been shown to to
      result in virologic outcomes that are similar to routine clinic services in patients stable
      on ART. The investigators are conducting a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial to evaluate
      two different strategies for delivering HIV care and treatment services during the postpartum
      period to HIV-infected women who initiated ART during pregnancy. Participants will be
      allocated to receive ART care at either local adult ART clinics, following the current
      standard of care, or the community-based adherence club system.
