    
      All Vietnamese, infertile women, with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria present at
      IVFMD Tan Binh and IVFMD Phu Nhuan will be enrolled to the study. Phenotypes of PCOS are
      classified into A, B, C and D due to hyperandrogegism (HA), ovulatory dysfunction (OD) and
      polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM)

        -  A: HA + OD + PCOM

        -  B: HA + OD

        -  C: HA + PCOM

        -  D: OD + PCOM

      All patients enrolled in this study will have:

        -  Standard anthropometric data will be done by professional and experience physicians
           according to standard study protocol: Weight, height, waist and hip circumference, waist
           to hip ratio, BMI calculated, followed by World Health Organization guidelines for Asian
           women.

        -  Blood pressure

        -  Fat mass measure by specific caliper which are available at the clinic. Fat mass index
           (FMI) are classified as: deficit < 5, normal 5-9, excess female >9-13, obese >13

        -  Gynecologic ultrasound scan

        -  Blood tests:

             -  Hormonal profile evaluation: Luteinizing hormone (LH) (Roche Cobas e411, S: 25.816
                mIU/mL, CV: 5.8%), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (Roche Cobas e411, S: 25.045
                mIU/mL, CV: 5.8%), Estradiol (Roche Cobas e411, S: 210.390 ng/L, CV: 6.6%), Total
                testosterone, SHBG, androstenedione, TSH (Beckman Access - S: 2,712 ng/dL, CV:
                5.6%), Total triiodothyronine (total T3) (Beckman Access - S: 7.284 pg/mL, CV:
                6.1%), Free thyroxine (free T4) (Beckman Access - S: 2.712 ng/dL, CV: 5.6%),
                Prolactin (Roche Cobas e411 - S: 37.993 mcg/L, CV: 5.5%), Progesterone (Roche Cobas
                e411, S:10.553 ng/mL and CV: 5.4%),17(OH)-progesterone (Elisa, DRG International,
                S: 0.03 ng/ml and CV: 5.8-9.2%), Free androgen index (FAI) = Serum testosterone
                (nmol/L)/serum SHBG (nmol/L) × 100, HDL, LDL, Fasting serum insulin (Roche Cobas
                e411 - S: 1.39 pmol/L, CV: 1.4%), Insulin sensitivity is estimated by homeostasis
                model assessment of insulin resistance (1/HOMA-IR) index. HOMA-IR is calculated by
                the following formula: HOMA-IR = fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin
                (uIU/mL)/22.5

             -  Glucose tests:

                  -  Fasting plasma glucose: will be measured by Humastar 600 System (Humastar
                     Systems,), sensitivity (S): 6.421 mmol/L and coefficient of variation (CV):
                     2.5% and performed when patients have already had fasting for at least 8
                     hours. A volume of 2 ml of blood will be withdrawn and contained in a
                     vacutainer with additive of natri oxalate and EDTA. Diagnosis of diabetes
                     mellitus will be made when fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL (7 nmol/L) or HbA1C
                     ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (American Diabetes Association, 2018). When glucose ≥126
                     mg/dL (7 nmol/L) or HbA1C ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (American Diabetes Association,
                     2018).

                  -  Oral glucose tolerance test with 75 g glucose (75 g OGTT) will be performed to
                     those with normal fasting glucose and HbA1C levels. Women will be recommended
                     to have normal diet for 3 days and overnight fasting for at least 8 hours. The
                     blood withdrawal will be performed twice: (i) fasting and (2i) 2 hours after
                     solution administration. The volume of blood for each test is 2 ml. Impaired
                     glucose tolerance will be diagnosed when two-hour glucose levels of 140 to 199
                     mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/l) (American Diabetes Association, 2018).

             -  Hyperandrogenism:

                  -  Clinical hyperandrogenism: Hirsutism using the modified Ferriman Gallwey score
                     (mFG) and severe acnes

                  -  Biochemical hyperandrogenism: free testosterone (normal range below
                     2,53nmol/ml), free testosterone index, SHBG
