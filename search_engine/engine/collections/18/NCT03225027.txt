      the emotional prosody, is necessary to interact adaptively with others. People in the
      schizophrenic spectrum have social difficulties. Is emotional prosody comprehension altered
      in these people? According to Edwards et al. (2002), there is methodological issues
      concerning the tasks used to answer this question. Investigators built an emotional judgment
      task more adapted to study the perception of emotional prosody in the schizophrenic spectrum
      than the classical paradigm designed to evaluate participants with cerebral injury. The
      investigators have elaborated a material that consists of 140 short sentences (7Â±2 words)
      with a simple syntactic structure. The verbal content expressed positive, neutral or negative
      emotions. These sentences were announced by four professional actors (two female) with an
      emotional prosody content congruent or inconsistent with the verbal content. Participants
      will have to evaluate the emotional intensity of the recordings on a five points Likert
      scale, from strongly negative to strongly positive. Psychotic experiences of all participants
      will be evaluated too.
