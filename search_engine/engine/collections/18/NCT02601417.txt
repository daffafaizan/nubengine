      transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) as the modality of biliary drainage. All patients will
      start empirical antibiotics as soon as they are diagnosed acute cholangitis. Randomization
      will be done after the blood sample and bile sample for culture are obtained. The patients
      will be allocated to one of the control or trial group. Patients in control group considers
      both blood and bile culture for the choice of antibiotics, and patients in trial group
      considers only blood culture for the choice of antibiotics. Organ failure and mortality rate
      are the primary outcomes. Data will be analyzed as intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol
      (PP). The rate of organ failure and mortality will be analyzed by Pearson chi-square & Fisher
      exact test.
