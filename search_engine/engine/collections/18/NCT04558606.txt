      the dental surface everyday. Moreover routine recalls ensure a better oral health and greater
      protection against caries, gingivitis and periodontitis. Regular attendance to oral hygiene
      sessions plays an important role but has to be accompanied by the compliance with home oral
      care instructions. The patients should be adequately instructed to take care of their oral
      health.
