      the first part of the study, volunteers will be given a statin medication to see if their
      muscle symptoms return. Those who experience muscle symptoms on this statin rechallenge will
      be invited to continue in the second part of the trial, in which participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either CoQ10 or a placebo (sugar pill) to take with statin
      medication. We hypothesize that those who receive CoQ10 will experience an improvement in
      their muscle symptoms compared to those who receive placebo, and, secondarily, that those who
      receive CoQ10 will be more likely to continue taking the statin medication.
