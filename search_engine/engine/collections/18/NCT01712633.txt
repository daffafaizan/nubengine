      scientists to understand the biological basis of higher order cognitive functioning such as
      emotions, attention, language and visual processing. It has been used as a research tool
      since the 1980 s. Recently, fMRI has received approval by the Center for Medicare and
      Medicaid Services (CMS) to be used clinically which we believe will drastically increase its
      use in clinical decision making by physicians in the very near future. However, currently
      implemented imaging techniques have technical and physiologic limitations such as
      susceptibility artifacts, image distortions, physiological noise, and MRI induced energy
      deposition from radiomagnetic waves typically used in fMRI acquisitions that may potentially
      reduce the clinical effectiveness of this imaging modality. This protocol is a unique
      technical development pilot study being conducted jointly by researchers at the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the
      performance of physiologic and technical factors of fMRI imaging methods and equipment that
      may affect image quality, reproducibility, and reliability in the clinical setting. These
      studies are an important basis upon which improved regulatory evaluation of new functional
      imaging technologies can be performed as these technologies become increasingly used in
      patient care in the future.
