      exercise. This includes providing carbohydrate and a number of ergogenic nutrients prior to,
      during and/or following exercise. As a result a number of pre-workout supplements have been
      developed to increase energy availability, promote vasodilation and/or positively affect
      exercise capacity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential ergogenic value
      of acute ingestion of a pre-workout dietary supplement prior to exercise.
