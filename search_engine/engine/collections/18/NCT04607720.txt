      with contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopy ultrasonography (CH-EUS) follow by EUS-guided
      fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). First, all patients will be diagnosed both by the
      AI-assisted diagnosis system and the endoscopists under CH-EUS; Second, to compare the
      EUS-FNA under the guidance of the AI-assisted ultrasound diagnosis system and the EUS-FNA
      under manual identification, patients were randomly assigned to undergo EUS-FNA with or
      without the guidance of AI-assisted diagnosis system for the first two passes.
