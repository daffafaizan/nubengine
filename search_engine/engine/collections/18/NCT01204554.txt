      flaps, mostly because of reduced donor site morbidity and superior aesthetic result. However,
      the there is still much to learn about the hemodynamic changes within these flaps.The aim of
      the present study is to assess the microcirculatory changes in the distal part of the
      perforator flap using ICG fluorescence angiography.
