    
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to
      evaluate the efficacy, concentration versus efficacy relationship, and safety of NTC-510 and
      NTC-510A at doses of 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 mg.

      The study will consist of 4 phases: screening (within 28 days before check-in), check-in
      (before surgery on Day 1), treatment (surgery, randomization, and treatment with study drug
      on Day 1), and follow up (Days 6 to 8). During the screening phase, screening procedures will
      be performed, subject eligibility will be determined, and written consent will be obtained.
      Subjects will then undergo dental surgery to extract 1 or 2 third molars (with at least 1
      partial or complete bony mandibular extraction). The impaction score ([1] erupted in tissue,
      [2] broken soft tissue, [3] partial bony impaction, and [4] full bony impaction) will be
      collected for statistical adjustment should there be randomization imbalance. The surgery
      will be conducted according to standard clinical unit procedures.
