    
      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group multicenter study of
      oral brincidofovir (BCV) in approximately 450 cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive subjects who
      had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). The study consisted
      of a screening evaluation and a treatment phase of 10 to 14 weeks. Dosing with the study drug
      (BCV or placebo) was initiated as soon as individual subjects could ingest tablets after
      transplant but no later than Day 28 post-transplant, and was continued through Week 14. All
      randomized subjects remained on study and followed the same scheduled study treatment. Study
      assessments were performed weekly from randomization through completion of the first
      post-treatment follow-up assessment at Week 15, and every 3 weeks thereafter through Week 24.
