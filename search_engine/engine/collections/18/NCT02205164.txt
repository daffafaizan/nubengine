      AML scheduled to receive multiple days chemotherapy.

      Patients will receive either PALO+APR or the PALO regimen in a 1:1 ratio according to a
      computer-generated, random allocation schedule. Below are described the details for both
      antiemetic regimens:

      PALO+APR regimen: oral aprepitant will be given on days 1-3 (day 1, 125 mg, days 2-3, 80 mg 1
      hour before chemotherapy ) and multiple intravenous bolus of Palonosetron without
      dexamethasone, prior to the administration of chemotherapy, starting the first day of
      treatment.

      PALO regimen: multiple intravenous bolus of Palonosetron without dexamethasone, prior to the
      administration of chemotherapy, starting the first day of treatment.
