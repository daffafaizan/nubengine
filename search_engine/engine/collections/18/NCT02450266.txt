      antigen (PSA) value, it is unclear which biopsy strategy offers the highest detection rate
      for significant prostate cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that targeted MRI/ultrasound
      fusion-guided biopsy improves the detection rates of significant prostate cancers compared
      with systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.

      Men with at least one previously negative transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy and
      persistently elevated PSA values (> 3 ng/ml) or PSA velocity >0.75 ng/ml/p.a. will be
      submitted to a multiparametric MRI examination of the prostate. Subsequently, all
      participants will be randomized (1:1) into both study arms. In study arm A patients will be
      submitted to the gold-standard which comprises systematic transrectal ultrasound--guided
      prostate biopsy. In study arm B patients will be submitted to targeted prostate biopsy based
      on the multiparametric MRI findings. Targeted biopsies will be performed using MRI/ultrasound
      fusion-guided.
