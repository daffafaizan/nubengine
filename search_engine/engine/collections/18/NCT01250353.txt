      biological tissues. It also induces vascular neoformation and promotes extra cellular
      provisional matrix formation, fundamental steps for any kind of wound healing. In humans, it
      was successfully used in chronic cutaneous ulcer and otologic surgeries. In rabbits' eyes,
      the latex biomembrane was efficient in ocular surface reconstruction with adequate
      conjunctiva functional recovery, compared to bare sclera. To study the latex biomembrane
      action in human ocular surface, it was compared to conjunctival autograft in humans eyes.
      Considering the deficiency of adequate sized groups and the pterygium recurrences criteria
      differences, this study proposes the fibrovascular tissue growing measure like an auxiliary
      method of pos-operative evaluation. The biomembrane of natural latex seems to be efficient in
      ocular surface reconstruction and must be employed in future studies of other ocular
      pathologies. This material revealed to be a new source of therapeutic resort to external eye
      diseases and conjunctival replace in surgeries living bare sclera.
