    
      The study, designed to assess the safety and tolerability of two doses given one month apart
      of Ad26.RSV.preF, an investigational RSV vaccine candidate based on a Ad26 vector expressing
      the RSV F protein, will be conducted in a double blinded manner. The study will be divided in
      two sequential cohorts: cohort 0 (18-50 year-old adults) and cohort 1 (12-24 month-old RSV
      seropositive toddlers). The vaccine safety will be monitored by reporting solicited and
      unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and all serious adverse events (SAEs). The data will be
      reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to assess safety data and to
      ensure the continuing safety of the participants enrolled in this study. The safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
