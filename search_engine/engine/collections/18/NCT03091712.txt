    
      This is a prospective randomized controlled two-group parallel design intervention trial. The
      primary endpoint, change from baseline to week 16 in HbA1c is planned to be tested for
      superiority of the Glooko Mobile Insulin Dosing System versus standard of care for insulin
      degludec titration - both with treatment of Tresiba® U-200 FlexTouch®. An estimated n= 240
      subjects with type 2 diabetes will be enrolled in order to obtain approximately 200 evaluable
      subjects who will complete the 16 week study. The subjects, will be already on long-acting
      insulin or insulin naïve subjects and will be started on long-acting insulin degludec
      (Tresiba® U-200 FlexTouch®). The subjects will be randomized into one of the two groups:
      Group 1 will receive standard of care using the STEP WISE degludec titration algorithm for
      long acting insulin titration. Group 2 will receive standard of care along with treatment
      facilitated by Glooko mobile insulin dosing system, using the STEP WISE degludec titration
      algorithm. Major study assessment will be conducted at Baseline (Screening & Visit 1), at a
      second Visit (Visit 2) after 12 weeks or 3 months and, after 16 weeks or 4 months, a final
      set of labs, meter download, and subject surveys will be administered (Exit Labs and Meter
      Download), in addition, any interactions and subsequent care plan changes completed by the
      HCP during Unscheduled HCP Interactions will be documented. Baseline, Visit 2 and the final
      screen/Exit Labs visit will include: blood draw, body weight, and questionnaires.
