      delivered via two electrodes on the venous cannulation site (radial side of the wrist of
      dominant forearm) 20 min prior to venous cannulation and control group received placebo (no
      current) TENS. Venous cannulation with a 22 gage cannula was performed. During venous
      cannulation the pain intensity (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) was measured. Any
      side effects during study periods were recorded
