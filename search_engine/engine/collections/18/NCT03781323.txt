      cycles of FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) chemotherapy, with interval analysis
      after six cycles. Patients who have stable or progressive disease will be treated per
      discretion of the treating physician following multidisciplinary discussion. Those determined
      to have partial or complete response will complete full neoadjuvant treatment and undergo
      close surveillance with watchful waiting for local recurrence without immediate surgery. The
      primary endpoint of this study will be the rate of cCR, which is to include complete and near
      complete clinical response, with secondary endpoints of disease free survival (DFS), overall
      survival (OS), quality of life (QOL), as well as evaluation of safety and toxicity.
