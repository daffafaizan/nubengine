      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome
      (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia.
      Mortality rates of sickle cell patients with pulmonary hypertension are significantly
      increased as compared to patients without pulmonary hypertension. Recent studies report up to
      40% mortality at 22 months after detection of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in sickle
      cell patients. Furthermore, pulmonary hypertension is thought to occur in up to 30% of clinic
      patients with sickle cell anemia.

      This study is designed to determine the prevalence and prognosis of secondary pulmonary
      hypertension in adult patients with sickle cell anemia, and to determine whether genetic
      polymorphisms in candidate genes contribute to its development or response to treatment.
