    
      Main objective

      Phase 1:

      -Study the in-vivo development of ultrasonic method in terms of quality of the acquisitions
      and intra-operator reproducibility.

      Study the ease of positioning in relation to MRI and fusion of MRI and FCPI data via the
      neuro-navigation system

      Phase 2:

      -Study the variability of cerebral pulsatility of measured by "Fast Cerebral Pulsatility
      Imaging" or FCPI with age.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Compare the results of displacements cartography's and vascular cartography obtained by
           MRI (especially by Arteriel Spin Labelling = ASL)

        -  Compare results of FCPI with results of cognitive tests of aging separating fluid
           functions (prefrontal) and functions called crystallized; and study the residual effect
           of age on cognitive tasks and speed of cognitive processing after taking into account
           the effect of the cerebral pulsatility

        -  Compare results of FCPI with electrophysiological measures (PE EEG) describing the
           attentional control

        -  Perform an exploratory analysis to highlight the propagating part of the brain
           displacement maps
