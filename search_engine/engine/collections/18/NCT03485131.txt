      efficacy in treatment refractory auditory verbal hallucinations in inpatients with chronic
      schizophrenia. Based on and expanding the findings by Brunelin et al. the hypothesis is that
      tDCS treatment with the cathode on the left temporal-parietal junction and the anode on the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can reduce the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations
      in patients with treatment refractory schizophrenia. The impact of tDCS on other
      schizophrenia symptoms in secondary exploratory outcome analyses together with the
      examination of the durability of an ameliorating effect will also be investigated.
