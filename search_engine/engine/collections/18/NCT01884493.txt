      dysynchronization (ERD) will be analyzed for the investigation of the possible differences of
      brain activities prior to leg voluntary movement between patients and controls. In addition,
      the synchronized recorded gait parameters for gait ignition,turning and termination will also
      be analyzed. The information gathered will allow us to further understand the pathophysiology
      of the gait freezing in PD. Investigators will deliver a course of rTMS with intermittent
      theta burst paradigm of the leg motor cortex to investigate whether the non-invasive brain
      stimulation can ameliorate the gait freezing in PD patients. The subjects will be assessed
      before and 4 times after rTMS during an 8-week period with clinical scoring batteries and
      electrophysiological recording as aforementioned. At the end of the 8th week, the test group
      and sham group will cross over and undergo the same procedures as aforementioned. The serial
      comprehensive investigations in this project will not only promote our understanding of the
      gait freezing pathophysiology but also may charge a novel trail for the management of long
      suffering symptom of the PD patients.
