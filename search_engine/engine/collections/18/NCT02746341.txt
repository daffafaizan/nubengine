      to and including 9 years, who have been diagnosed with MPS IIIA. The study will detail the
      natural course of MPS IIIA via standardized clinical, biochemical, neurocognitive,
      developmental, behavioral and imaging measures. This information is anticipated to inform the
      design and interpretation of future interventional studies.
