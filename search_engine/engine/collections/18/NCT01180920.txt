      elevating the hosts' susceptibility to periodontal breakdown. The specific aims are the
      following; To determine if Periostin is a biomarker of periodontal disease, and To evaluate
      Periostin in periodontal tissue healing and homeostasis by harvesting healthy or diseased
      tissue from 22 patients requiring periodontal surgery.
