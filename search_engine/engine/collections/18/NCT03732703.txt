      to patients relapsing with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, who have

        -  received at least one prior but no more than 3 prior therapies

        -  exposed to both a PI and an IMiD

        -  had early relapse after initial treatment. Relapse is defined as the IMWG uniform
           response criteria (Kumar et al, 2016). Early relapse as defined by at least one of the
           following:

             1. Relapse within 3 years post autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) on
                maintenance, or 18 months if unmaintained

             2. Relapse within 18 months of initial non-ASCT based therapy
