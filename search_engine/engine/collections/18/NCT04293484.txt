    
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease, which is a group of
      neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control
      voluntary muscles of the body. The disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the
      body due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons. Current drugs approved for
      ALS treatment only modestly slow disease progression.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique, which has been
      demonstrated to modulate cerebral excitability in several neurodegenerative disorders and
      modulate intracortical connectivity measures.

      The present randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study followed by an open-label phase
      will investigate a repetition of two-weeks' treatment with bilateral motor cortex anodal tDCS
      and spinal cathodal tDCS, after a six months interval, may further outlast clinical
      improvement in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and modulate intracortical
      connectivity, at short and long term.
