    
      Patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit at John H Stroger Hospital are randomly
      assigned to Unit A or B. Unit B was randomly selected as the intervention unit. For 6 months,
      all patients in Unit B will be bathed with the 2% CHG Antiseptic Cloth system and all
      patients in Unit A will receive soap and water baths. After this 6 month period, there will
      be a 2 to 4 week washout period and the interventions will cross over, with Unit A receiving
      Chlorhexidine baths and unit B receiving soap and water for 6 months.

      Each week, two randomly selected patients will have cultures of the inguinal area,
      neck/subclavian region, and endotracheal aspirates. A comparison of the colonization of the
      skin and sputum will be done between the two intervention groups.

      Daily infection surveillance will be done on all patients in the intensive care unit. A
      comparison of blood stream infections, clinical sepsis, and other nosocomial infections will
      be done between the two intervention groups.
