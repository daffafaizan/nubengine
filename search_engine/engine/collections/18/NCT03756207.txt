      its impact for bladder cancer has not been documented. Although radical cystectomy (RC) has
      long been the standard of care for the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), a
      multidisciplinary approach has led to the development of bladder-preservation therapy using
      maximal transurethral resection (TURBt) followed by radiotherapy with concomitant
      radio-sensitizing chemotherapy for MIBC. There are no randomized-controlled data comparing
      radical cystectomy with multidisciplinary bladder-preservation therapy (MBPT) available for
      comparison. However, observational data continues to support the use of MBPT as an acceptable
      alternative for patients with MIBC who wish to preserve their bladder or are not candidates
      for cystectomy because it may result in equivalent disease outcomes in select patients and
      offers the benefit of maintaining a functioning urinary system with subsequent improvements
      in quality of life. But there are also lots of issues need to be studied, such as the patient
      selection, approaches for completeness of TURBt, choices of radio-sensitizing chemotherapy,
      accuracy of radiotherapy and so on. In this study, the investigators plan to prospectively
      recruit 80 MIBC patients, who don't want to receive RC or are not candidates for RC, treated
      with MBPT from Nov 2018 to Dec 2020 in Peking University Third Hospital. The investigators
      will collect, compare and analyze their clinic-pathological data before and after MBPT, in
      order to confirm the safety and efficacy of MBPT for MIBC in China. At the same time, the
      investigators want to find out the patients who are not suitable for MBPT and the approach
      which can improve the efficacy of MBPT, as a result, the investigators intend to make a
      standard MBPT approach for Chinese MIBC patients.
