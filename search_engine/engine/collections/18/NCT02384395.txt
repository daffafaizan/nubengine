      University in Durham, NC. The investigators plan to enroll up to 44 participants who will be
      enrolled for 96 weeks and will receive DTG/3TC/ABC FDC.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy and time to viral suppression with
      DTG/3TC/ABC FDC as initial therapy for AHI (acute HIV infection), as well as the feasibility
      of prompt administration using a rapid HLA-B57 (human leukocyte antigen) screening antibody
      assay. In addition to validating the restriction of RCI (resting cell infection) by ART
      (antiretroviral therapy) including a DTG-based regimen initiated during AHI, the
      investigators will seek correlations between low RCI, residual GALT (gastrointestinal
      associated lymphoid tissue) HIV expression, and measures of immune activation. The
      investigators hypothesize that rapid reduction in plasma viremia with this regimen will limit
      the area under the pre-ART viral load curve, and thus reduce the latent reservoir size as
      measured by a viral outgrowth assay one to two years following ART start, and as compared
      with the latent reservoir size in acutely infected individuals started on regimens without an
      integrase inhibitor based regimen. In addition, the investigators will examine the
      longitudinal impact of the proposed integrase-based regimen initiated during the acute period
      on immune activation through week 96. If residual viral expression and persistent immune
      dysfunction is related to the burden of the latent viral reservoir (and presumably its
      periodic activation) these abnormalities should be ameliorated by early ART with rapid viral
      suppression. The investigators hypothesize that earlier treatment coupled with more rapid
      ART-mediated virus suppression will be associated with better long-term T cell function,
      specifically better T cell function after 2 years of durable HIV suppression.
