      oocytes, has severe impairment on women fertility. Some women experience DOR may develop into
      premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), which defined as a cessation of function of ovaries in
      women younger than 40 years old. The pathogenesis of DOR is multiple and the etiology of most
      DOR remains obscure. Genetic factors, including chromosome abnormality, genetic variation,
      and non-coding RNA abnormal regulation are considered the major mechanisms of DOR. More than
      12 gene mutations, detected by whole-exome sequencing (WES), have been implicated as
      potential causes of DOR. However, we have found that coding gene mutation detected by WES may
      only account for a small part of DOR. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been developing into
      an important strategy for identifying exons, introns and mitochondrial DNA mutation. However,
      the application of WGS is still lacking in detecting pathogenic genes of DOR. Therefore, this
      study intends to explore the possible pathogenic genes by WGS in order to deeply and
      comprehensively understand the pathogenic mechanism of DOR.
