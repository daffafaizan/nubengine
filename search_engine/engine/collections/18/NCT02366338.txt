      ischemic stroke. The prognosis of ischemic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation (AF)
      tends to have a worse prognosis for recovery compared with other ischemic stroke subtypes.
      The risk of stroke was shown to decline to 68% by oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy.The
      investigators have evaluated appropriate use of anticoagulants in non-valvular AF patients.
      Appropriate use of oral anticoagulants was assessed by Medication Appropriateness Index
      (MAI). The MAI consists of 10 criteias namely, indication, choice, dosage, modalities and
      practicability of administration, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions,
      duplication, duration, and cost-effectiveness. The tenth criteria was not evaluated because
      of limited data regarding cost-effectiveness of the drugs.
