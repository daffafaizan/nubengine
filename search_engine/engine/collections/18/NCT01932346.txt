    
      Study Design:

      Prospective observational study

      Target Number of Participants:

      To recruit 50 patients into this study.

      Patient Selection:

        1. Patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass surgery.

        2. The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system(ASA)
           Class I~III

        3. Age ≧20 y/o, ≦75 y/o

      Exclusion Criteria:

        1. ASA Class IV

        2. Current skin lesion over the sites where the NIRS patches are designed to be attached.

        3. Patients received cardiopulmonary bypass during the surgery.

        4. Patients with previous history of allergy to the NIRS patches.

      Study Method:

      After the induction of anesthesia, four NIRS patches are attached to the patients on the
      following sites:

        1. Biceps brachii muscle area

        2. Gastrocnemius muscle area

        3. Posterior side of neck

        4. central part of the forehead

      The four non-invasive NIRS patches are only to measure the tissue oxygen saturation and have
      no other physiological effects on the participants.

      The data will be collected every 5 minutes until the surgery is completed. The data from
      other routine monitors used during the surgery (including hear rate, blood pressure, and
      mixed venous saturation) will also be used to compare with the data from NIRS.
