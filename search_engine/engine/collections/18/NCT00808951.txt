      obstacle for controlling malaria in endemic countries; that's why most sub-Saharan countries
      have changed their antimalarial drug policy to Artemisinin Containing Therapies (ACT), which
      produce a rapid clinical and parasitological cure, reduce gametocyte carriage rate and are
      generally well tolerated. Burkina Faso has recently changed its policy for the treatment of
      uncomplicated malaria, from Chloroquine to Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) and
      Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AQ+AS). However, there are still little available data on safety and
      efficacy of these treatments in Burkina Faso; a recent study carried out in Bobo Dioulasso
      showed that both treatments were extremely efficacious (adjusted treatment failure less than
      5%) but with AL showing significantly high occurrence of recurrent infections during the
      28-day follow up period. The higher risk for recurrent infections for AL was confirmed in a
      subsequent trial comparing AL with AQ-SP and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, but so far no
      direct comparison between AQ+AS and AL has been completed, though a study in Nanoro, near
      Ouagadougou, is ongoing. Thus, the present study aims at comparing the in vivo safety and
      efficacy of AL and AS-AQ (42-day follow-up),AND at comparing the in vitro sensitivity of the
      different ACT components, in patients with recurrent infection, with the results obtained in
      vivo.
