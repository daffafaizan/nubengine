      venous whole blood, and plasma demonstrates at least 98.0% sensitivity and specificity
      compared to an FDA-approved HIV testing algorithm.

      The study will have two parts. The first part of the study will be conducted in institutions
      where HIV testing is routinely performed and where HIV counseling is offered [i.e. point of
      care (POC) centers]. The second part of the study will be conducted in a central laboratory
      that routinely conducts laboratory-based HIV testing using an FDA-licensed HIV-1 ELISA and
      Western blot test.

      Geographically diverse POCs will be selected in the USA. Approximately 15-20 POCs are
      planned. Approximately 2,500 subjects will participate in the study including 1,500 subjects
      with unknown HIV status and 1,000 seropositive subjects. Across these POC sites, voluntary
      testing of 1500 subjects with unknown HIV status is planned with at least 500 of these
      subjects being high risk. Samples will be obtained from consenting subjects in the voluntary
      testing population including high-risk and known HIV 1 seropositive individuals.

      Each subject is to receive an INSTI™ on finger-stick blood and parallel HIV testing of
      EDTA-treated venous whole blood and plasma samples will be conducted at a central laboratory.

      The results of INSTI™ will not be given to the subject. The subject will be given the results
      of the POC HIV test only, per their standard of care procedures. Subsequent subject care
      decisions will NOT be based on the results of INSTI™.
