      haemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis, and onycholysis in the nail bed or pitting,
      leuconychia, erythema of the lunula and crumbling in the nail matrix.Diagnosis is customarily
      made by patient history and physical examination, though it may be necessary to rule out
      onychomycosis as a differential diagnosis.

      The nail psoriasis severity index has recently been reported as a possible reproducible,
      objective, and simple tool for clinical assessment of psoriatic nail disease.

      The modified target nail psoriasis severity index has been proposed for target nail
      assessment which would give a degree of gradation for each parameter of 0 to 3 (0 = none, 1 =
      mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) in each quadrant.The topical therapies include topical
      and intralesional corticosteroids , topical vitamin D3 analogues (calcipotriol) , topical
      tacrolimus and tazarotene[8]. The efficacy of these topical therapies in nail disease is
      limited mainly by the impenetrability or low penetrability of the nail and nail matrix. In
      patients with nail psoriasis that is resistant to topical therapies, conventional systemic
      therapies (e.g., phototherapy, retinoids, cyclosporine, methotrexate) have been shown to be
      partially effective. More recently, biological therapies (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab,
      alefacept, etanercept) have proven efficacy in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and some
      are effective in treating nail disease in patients with psoriasis .

      Previous study proved successful treatment of onychodystrophy using fractional carbon dioxide
      laser with topical steroid. Fractional Carbon dioxide laser might be an effective therapy for
      nail psoriasis due to its ablative ability which produce microscopic holes that perhaps
      improve topical drug delivery. Moreover it was hypothesized that tissue ablation and
      remodelling process stimulate rejuvenation of the abnormal nail bed.The investigators
      hypothesized that the combination of Fractional carbon dioxide laser and topical tazarotene
      treatment will have a higher therapeutic effect on nail psoriasis through multiple mechanism.
