    
      This is an open-label Phase I/II study, with a dose escalation part (Phase I) and a 2-arm
      randomized part (Phase II), in patients with recurrent SCLC.

      In the Phase I part, patients will receive plinabulin at escalating doses in combination with
      nivolumab and ipilimumab. Doses of study drug will be administered as intravenous (IV)
      infusions in 21 day cycles. Patients will receive all study drugs on Day 1 of each cycle.
      After 4 treatment cycles, ipilimumab is stopped and patients continue treatment with
      nivolumab and plinabulin every 2 weeks (maintenance period) or until disease progression,
      development of unacceptable toxicity or one of the protocol-defined reasons for treatment
      discontinuation occurs.

      At least 3 patients will be enrolled in each cohort, starting at 20 mg/m2 of plinabulin. The
      dose of plinabulin will be escalated in sequential patient cohorts after the safety data from
      the first cycle is reviewed. Thereafter the dose of plinabulin will be escalated to 30 mg/m2,
      provided that dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not observed per the specified criteria,
      until the RP2D is determined.

      In the Phase II part, approximately 40 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either nivolumab + ipilimumab (Arm NI) or the triple combination of plinabulin (at RP2D) +
      nivolumab + ipilimumab (Arm PNI). Patients will continue treatment until disease progression,
      development of unacceptable toxicity or one of the protocol-defined reasons for treatment
      discontinuation occurs.
