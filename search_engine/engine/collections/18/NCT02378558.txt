      address the ease of transition from use of the MagneWire to fully implanted MagneMarkers.
      Before embarking on a pivotal study, comparing the wireless MagneMarker with a standard
      breast localization wire, we propose an open label single arm pilot II study. In the pilot II
      study each surgeon (n=3) will treat 14 cases with the MagneMarker using magnetic localization
      alone. The outcomes of this study will be:

        1. Completeness of excision.

        2. Time for the biopsy.

      Overview: The goal of the MagneMark system is to replace the use of wires with the use of
      fully implanted MagneMarkers. In the Pilot II trial patients will be localized on the morning
      of their surgery comparable to the timeline utilized in a traditional wire localization
      procedure.

      Eligibility for surgeons: Experienced breast surgeons practicing at Maimonides Medical Center
      with full proficiency at standard wire localized excisions as well as sentinel lymph node
      biopsy who have completed the required number of MagneWire guided excisions for training on
      the MagneMark system. Because this is a single arm pilot there will be no blinding of the
      surgeons involved.

      Eligibility for patients: Eligible patients have a single non-palpable breast cancer
      (invasive or DCIS) requiring preoperative needle localization with a single wire. Lesions may
      include discrete solitary mammographically or sonographically identified targets that can be
      definitively identified by specimen imaging, including previously biopsied lesions that have
      been marked by a biopsy site marker. All patients who are eligible will be consented for off
      label use of the MagneMarker system there will be no randomization, blinding or
      stratification of patients.

      Study Location: All procedures will be completed at the Maimonides Medical Center.
      Localizations will happen in the radiology suite at the Maimonides Breast Center and
      excisions will happen at the Ambulatory Surgery Center at Maimonides Medical Center.

      Duration: For the enrolled patients participation in the trial is limited to the amount of
      time the localization and excision procedures take, approximately 5 hours. To enroll enough
      patients for three surgeons to complete fourteen surgeries we anticipate that recruitment
      will continue for one calendar year.

      Description of device: The MagneJector will be used to insert a 1x20mm Arnokrome MagneMarker
      and anchor it in position with its center anchors centered in the target. Sonographic guided
      localizations will be performed with the MagneJector hand held while mammographic guided
      localizations will be performed on dedicated prone stereo tables with the MagneJector mounted
      on a rail. The Arnokrome component of the MagneMarker will be coated with Parylene, a plastic
      polymer meeting the International Organization for Standardization 10993 standards for
      biocompatibility.

      Administration: moving through a MagneMark study procedure day.

        1. On the day of the localization procedure, the patient will go to one of the three
           radiologist involved in the project.

        2. The radiologist will insert the study device using the MagneJector.

        3. The patient will be transported t the surgical suite for excision.

        4. Surgery will be performed at the ambulatory surgery suite of Maimonides Medical Center.

        5. The surgeon will use the MagneProbe to identify the location of the MagneMarker as well
           as the lesion, and remove both the MagneMarker and lesion.

      Data endpoints: the rate of successful excision of the target lesion, the size and weight of
      the specimens removed and the presence or absence of positive tumor margins will serve as
      primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints will include the length of stay for the day of surgery
      with the hypothesis that length of stay will be significantly reduced. Additional endpoints
      will include comparison of the accuracy and precision of centering the marker in the center
      of the lesion.
