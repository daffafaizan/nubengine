    
      PURE is a multi-national, prospective, observational cohort study of patients with moderate
      to severe chronic plaque psoriasis aimed at assessing the real-world safety and effectiveness
      of secukinumab and other indicated therapies. The study will enroll patients for whom, prior
      to and independent of study enrollment, the treating physician has decided to treat with
      secukinumab, or one of the other indicated therapies regimens approved for the management of
      moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

      Two study cohorts will be defined by patients treated with secukinumab (Cohort 1), and
      patients treated with other indicated therapies (systemic, phototherapy, or biologic therapy;
      Cohort 2). Each investigator will recruit approximately the same number of patients in each
      treatment arm. 2,500 patients (1,250 patients in each cohort) will be followed over a period
      of 5 years from the Baseline assessment (Visit 1).
