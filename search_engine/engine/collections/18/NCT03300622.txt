      The morbidity and mortality of pulmonary resection surgery is conditioned by both the type of
      intervention and the patient's condition. Functional deterioration is a risk associated with
      hospitalization in the elderly, with a high prevalence (35-70%) and serious consequences,
      since in the majority it can lead to the appearance of complications not related to the
      reason for admission or the specific treatment. It is very important to evaluate the clinical
      profile of patients after pulmonary resection in order to stablish a more specific
      repercussion.
