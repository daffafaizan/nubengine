    
      Leinurad is a weak in vitro inhibitor of the hepatic transporter OCT1 and the renal
      transporters OAT1 and OAT3 (OAT1/3). To assess the clinical relevance of these in vitro
      findings, this clinical study will evaluate the effect of lesinurad on the PK of metformin
      (OCT1 substrate) and furosemide (OAT1/3 substrate).
