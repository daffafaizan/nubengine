      previously seen in the ASPECT clinical trial and to gather additional data to understand the
      effectiveness of the intervention pacing features. Specifically, the goal of the trial is to
      demonstrate a reduction in frequency in symptomatic atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation
      recurrence with the intervention pacing features in patients with a pacing indication and a
      history of atrial tachyarrhythmias with atrial pacing leads located in the region of
      Bachmann's Bundle.
