      multifactorial character. Despite extensive research that has already been performed in the
      field of electrophysiology the exact pathophysiological process of the different arrhythmias
      remains incompletely understood. The ability to identify subgroups of patients within a
      population with the same type of arrhythmia that can benefit from a specific treatment
      strategy might provide more individualized therapeutic opportunities, improve prognostication
      or provide preventive opportunities in patient with cardiac arrhythmias. Biobanks can make a
      valuable contribution to the development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic methods.
      More insights into the correlations between genes, environmental factors and susceptibility
      to illness may be of great value. The 'ADAPT' Biobank has been designed to establish a
      systematic and qualitative collection of bodily materials for future research in the
      cardiovascular field. The Biobank includes bodily material of patients with cardiac
      arrhythmias undergoing (non-) invasive treatment or control patients undergoing
      cardiothoracic surgery. Clinical data related to the cardiac arrhythmic disease is recorded.
      The data and samples will be linked to the participants' medical records to allow
      longitudinal follow-up.
