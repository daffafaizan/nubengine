      total of 80 subjects from approximately 8 centers. All subjects will be firstly randomly
      assigned to 1st month OCT (40 pts) or 2nd month OCT group(40 pts). Then both two groups will
      be randomly assigned to undergoing implantation of BuMA Supremeâ„¢ stent (20 pts) or Xience
      V/Prime stent (20 pts). If non-inferiority was met, superiority test will be planned.

      All of the patients be followed up to 2 years. The follow-up visits will be conducted at 1 or
      2 months (including QCA/OCT investigation), 3 months, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post
