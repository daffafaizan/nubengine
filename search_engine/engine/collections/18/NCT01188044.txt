      toddlers from Lungwena will be recruited. The participants will wear an ActiGraph GT3X+
      -accelerometer fitted on their waist with an elastic belt for 7 days. During the measuring,
      they will have two videotaped one-hour activity observations while wearing and additional
      accelerometer device fitted on their ankle. The output from the two devices will be compared
      to observed activity classified with CPAF-method.
