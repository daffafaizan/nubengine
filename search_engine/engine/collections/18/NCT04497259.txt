      follow-up after 2 years. This follow-up requires about 5 multi-professional evaluations
      during the first year. This can be cumbersome in patients living far from the reference
      centre and who may perceive the necessary time, cost and lost of income, and constraints as
      imbalanced. Teleevaluations and teleconsultations may solve this issue by replacing some of
      the classical evaluations (at 6 and 9 months). An RCT would be necessary, and a pilot study
      is proposed to describe the distribution of the judgment criteria.

      This pilot study aims at describing all the parameters necessary to build an RCT, and
      involves the randomisation of operated patients recruited 3 months after surgery, in to
      groups. One will have the classical follow-up (venue and consultations at 6 and 9 months) the
      over will have teleevaluations and teleconsultations ; the parameters will be described at 12
      months. The teleevaluation is either proposed as usual (a file is sent by secure mail) or by
      chatbot interaction. The consultation and the teleconsultation are based on the standard of
      care scenario.
