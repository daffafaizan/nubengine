      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) display clinical, metabolic, and immunogenetic features of type 2
      diabetes during follow-up. Prior studies by our group and other investigators indicate that,
      at presentation, these patients a) have markedly decreased insulin secretion and impaired
      insulin action, b) have low prevalence of positive B-cell autoantibodies, and c) respond to
      aggressive diabetic management with significant improvement in B-cell function and insulin
      sensitivity sufficient to allow discontinuation of insulin therapy. Upon discontinuation of
      insulin, the period of near-normoglycemia remission (defined as the ability to discontinue
      insulin injections for ≥ one week and remain in good metabolic control - fasting blood
      glucose ≤ 120 mg/dl and A1c ≤ 7%) may last for a few months to several years. These patients
      are referred to as having atypical diabetes, Flatbush diabetes, or ketosis-prone type 2
      diabetes (KPDM). Patients with "KPDM" are therefore an ideal model to follow throughout their
      clinical course in order to correlate their response to treatment with the mechanism(s) and
      markers of short- and long-term remission and determine the optimal therapeutic approach in
      order to prevent future glycemic decompensation.
