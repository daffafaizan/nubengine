      I, patients monitored by Virtual Hospital the first year and arm II patients monitored in the
      hospital the first year (standard of care). After 1 year of follow up, patients were crossed
      into the other arm. A "Virtual Hospital" was developed to integrate the control of patient in
      a multidisciplinary telecare team, allowing the patient to be remotely followed-up by the
      healthcare professionals through Internet. Virtual Hospital had four main services: Virtual
      Consultations, Telepharmacy, Virtual Library and Virtual Community. A technical and a
      clinical evaluation of Virtual Hospital were made.
