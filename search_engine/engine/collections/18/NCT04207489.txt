      laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer, and analyze the relevant factors, so as
      to guide the submucosal injection of preoperative indocyanine green better.

      This study is prospective and observational. In order to analyze the related factors that
      affect the imaging effect, we enrolled patients who were to undergo indocyanine green
      fluorescence imaging for laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer.
