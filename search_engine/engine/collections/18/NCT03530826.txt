      patients in an online knowledge sharing platform will enable patients to better understand
      cancer, better inform treatment decisions made by oncologists and accelerate cancer research.
      Leftover samples from patients with cancer (blood, bodily fluids and/or tissues collected for
      clinical purposes) will be obtained and sent for various types of analyses and results will
      be shared on the All4Cure website.
