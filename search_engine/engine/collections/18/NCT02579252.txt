    
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain.
      Over the course of the disease, pathological proteins accumulate in the brain, damaging
      neurons, thus causing them to lose their connections and die.

      Currently available treatments are designed to compensate for the neurotransmitter loss
      caused by the disease without affecting the disease process itself.

      AADvac1 is designed to raise antibodies against pathological tau protein (the primary
      constituent of neurofibrillary pathology in AD). These antibodies are expected to prevent tau
      protein from aggregating, to facilitate the removal of tau protein aggregates and prevent the
      spreading of pathology, slowing or halting the progress of the disease.
