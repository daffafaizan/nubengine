      subjects will receive a single dose of 14C ONO-4053 administered orally as a suspension.
      Safety measurements (ECG, vital signs, biochemistry and haematology) and adverse events will
      be monitored throughout the study. After administration of 14C ONO-4053 subjects will remain
      in the clinical facility for collection of blood, urine and faecessamples. Samples will be
      analysed for recovery of radioactivity and characterisation of metabolites of ONO-4053.
