      30 patients who have proteinuria exceeds 1 g per day with biopsy proven IgA nephropathy. The
      experimental arm recieves the non-pharmacological treatment, weight reduction protocol. All
      patients in this arm must be reduce their body weight in 3-5 % from baseline as protocol.
      Another arm is control group which recieves standard treatment of IgA nephropathy including
      ACEIs/ARBs for blood pressure control (target < 130/80 mmHg). The primary outcome is
      proteinuria level. The secondary outcome is cytokines and inflammatory markers level
      including interleukin-6, resistin, adiponectin, leptin and monocyte chemoattractant
      protein-1.
