      parents can not establish the perception of premature infants and lack of communication with
      medical staff, which will lead to negative emotions represented by uncertainty of disease.The
      research on uncertainty of disease started late in China, mostly used in tumor, epilepsy and
      congenital heart disease. The research on parents of NICU children mostly focused on the
      analysis of influencing factors of uncertainty of disease, lacking intervention research, and
      the measures were only the information support mode based on health education. We want to
      explore the intervention effect of family participatory nursing on the uncertainty of illness
      of parents of hospitalized premature infants, and to evaluate the uncertainty level of
      parents of premature infants in different stages. Describe the feeling of parents of
      premature infants after family participation nursing through interview. We will provide
      support for families of premature infants, and then to provide support for growth and
      development of premature infants.
