      dyslipidemia, increased blood glucose and hypertension--diabetic metabolic symptoms--upon
      treatment with atypical antipsychotic medication. As a result, cardiovascular disease risk is
      significantly increased.

      The long-term goal of this collaborative study is to identify, for each individual atypical
      antipsychotic (AAP) medication, the gene variations associated with elevated risk of diabetic
      metabolic symptoms (DiMS). If such genes are identified, in the future genetic testing may
      help mental health care professionals choose treatment while minimizing the risk of
      undesirable side effects of antipsychotics. We propose to develop a novel product termed
      "Physiotype" to deliver personalized information for each patient on the drug specific risks
      among aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone. The Physiotype
      consists of a multi-gene ensemble of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that, interpreted
      with a biomathematical algorithm, may explain most of the inter-individual differences in
      DiMS among the 5 AAPs. If this study does identify related genes, genetic tests will be
      developed to provide patients and health care professionals with tools to identify those
      patients who are at risk of developing adverse metabolic side effects to antipsychotics.
