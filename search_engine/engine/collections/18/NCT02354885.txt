      acid (TXA) seems to improve survival and outcome; this was shown partially by the CRASH2
      study, where patients received TXA in the emergency room. Thus this study evaluates the
      administration of TXA on scene by the EMS or by the crew of a rescue helicopter in multiple
      trauma patients or isolated TBI. Coagulopathy will be assessed by standard laboratory tests
      as well as thromboelastometry in 50 patients. The results will be compared to a study
      published by Theusinger et al. (Changes in Coagulation in Standard Laboratory Tests and ROTEM
      in Trauma Patients Between On-Scene and Arrival in the Emergency Department.Theusinger OM et
      al. Anesth Analg. 2014 Dec 24. [Epub ahead of print] PMID: 25545751) where no TXA was
      administered on scene and only changes in coagulation between on scene and in the emergency
      department were assessed.
