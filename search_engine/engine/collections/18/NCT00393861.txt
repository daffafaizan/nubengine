      used in colorectal cancer in refractory germ cell tumor patients. Oxaliplatin is a drug of
      known activity. Although bevacizumab has no single agent data, it combines dramatically well
      with numerous chemotherapy drugs, such as oxaliplatin increasing response rates and improving
      survival. Furthermore, VEG-F appears to be an important target in germ cell tumors as it does
      in so many other types of solid tumors. We will be using the identical dosages of oxaliplatin
      + bevacizumab as has been utilized in previously treated colorectal cancer, without the
      addition of 5-FU + leucovorin. This dose and schedule has been proven to be safe and
      effective.
