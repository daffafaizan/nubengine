      Re injury during return to sport is significant and clinical and biomechanical risk factors
      are described. But no study investigate link between clinical and biomechanical during this
      risk period.

      The study will search to highlight correlation between clinical and biomechanical factors.
      Investigators will realize clinical evaluation (pain, translation) and functional tests
      (single hop test, triple hop test, 6m time hop test, crossover test). For biomechanical data,
      investigators will test 2 exercises in motion analyse laboratory (drop vertical jump and
      cutting task), a translation knee test with GnRB and isokinetic evaluation.

      Investigators will compared results of injured subjects with a control group non-injured.
