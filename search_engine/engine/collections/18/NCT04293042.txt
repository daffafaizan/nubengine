      virus-specific CTLs isolated from whole blood or leukapheresis products. The BK virus
      -specific CTLs will be generated automatically by the CliniMACS® Prodigy using the CliniMACS
      Cytokine Capture System (IFNgamma) after incubation with MACS GMP PepTivator® Peptide Pools
      of BKV VP1 and BKV LT.
