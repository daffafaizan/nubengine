      local relapses and distant metastases are frequent, with 5-year survival of 3-17% for
      inoperable disease. Staging has historically subdivided stage III disease into clinical stage
      IIIA, thought to be potentially amenable to surgery, and stage IIIB, treated by defi nitive
      radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. This phase II trial is to compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC to address optimal
      induction strategy.
