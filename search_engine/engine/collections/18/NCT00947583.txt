      in subjects who receive TLIF surgery at one or two levels. These subjects will present with
      degenerative conditions in the lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and will
      be screened prior to study enrollment. Subjects will receive Osteocel Plus during their TLIF
      operation. Subjects will be followed for 24-months following surgery to determine the number
      of study subjects that are solidly fused at or before 24 months postoperatively, and to
      determine the mean time to fusion. This data will be compared to published and/or
      retrospective data for autograft, synthetic ceramics and BMP.
