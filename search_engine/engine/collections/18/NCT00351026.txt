      all have completed the 12 week study period and elected to transfer to the regular methadone
      program at the same location, that was started in the last 2 years with support from the
      Global Fund. A 1-year supplement has been awarded to pilot test an intervention developed by
      Dr. Dvoryak to facilitate enrollment in methadone by persons who could benefit, and an
      intervention called "Life Steps" developed by Safren and colleagues and aimed to facilitate
      adherence to antiretroviral therapy. A site visit was completed in 5/09 in which we conducted
      two focus groups to determine local conditions that needed to be included in Life Steps so as
      to make it relevant to Ukrainian cultural conditions, followed by modification and training
      in the slightly revised version of Life Steps. We anticipate that the 25 additional HIV+
      patients who will be enrolled to complete the supplement will start to be enrolled in 10/09,
      when recruitment for the parent study has been completed.
