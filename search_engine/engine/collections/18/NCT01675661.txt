      matched placebo (PBO) twice daily, added to contingency management (CM), on cannabis use
      among treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent adults (ages 18-50). After assessment and
      inclusion into the study, participants will be randomized to receive a 12-week course of NAC
      1200 mg or matched placebo twice daily. All participants will concurrently participate in a
      twice-weekly contingency management (CM) intervention. Medication management will be
      conducted weekly throughout treatment by the medical clinician. Urine cannabinoid testing
      will occur at all visits, and will be used as the primary determinant of cannabis use.
      Participants will return approximately four weeks after treatment conclusion for evaluation
      of adverse events with medication discontinuation and sustained treatment effects.
