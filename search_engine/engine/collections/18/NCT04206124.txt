      in human brown adipocytes. The working hypothesis is that inhibition of mTORC1 or activation
      of autophagy improves thermogenesis in human brown adipocytes. It will be first determined if
      the mTORC1/autophagy signaling modulates thermogenic gene expression and beige markers by
      collecting human brown fat from lean non-diabetic subjects. The brown fat during the anterior
      cervical spine surgery or thyroidectomy from lean subjects with a BMI <25, or obese
      participants who have a BMI >30, will be harvested and then be used to determine: 1) whether
      mTORC1 signaling, autophagy and thermogenic gene expression, and the fraction of various
      types of immune cells in human brown fat are different from those in rodents;2) whether
      rapamycin treatment enhances basal or CL-induced thermogenic gene expression and O2
      consumption in primary human brown adipocytes; and 3) whether inhibition of autophagy by
      3-methyladenine (3-MA) suppresses thermogenic gene expression induced by CL316,243, a
      Î²3-adrenoceptor agonist that mimics cold stress in vivo in human brown adipocytes.

      Overall, this study will lead to the identification of mTORC1 as a key regulator of
      thermogenesis in human adipose tissue and reveal promising new anti-obesity drug targets. In
      addition, this study will further investigate the role of rapamycin administration in obesity
      in human adults near the future. These studies are designed to be a proof-of-principle. If
      the results are promising, then future drug development could focus on designing new
      inhibitors of mTORC1.
