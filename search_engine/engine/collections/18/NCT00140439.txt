    
      Prospective, randomized clinical trial of a single visit to a specialized emergency
      department-based asthma follow-up clinic occurring 2-15 days after emergency department care
      for an acute exacerbation. All patients were followed for 6 months. Analysis was by
      intention-to-treat with adjustment for baseline differences. Our primary hypothesis was that
      this intervention would decrease subsequent unscheduled visits (both to EDs and other sources
      of urgent care) for asthma over a six-month follow-up period. We further hypothesized that
      the intervention would decrease hospitalizations for asthma, improve compliance with an
      individualized medical plan and with trigger control, increase scheduled primary care
      practitioner (PCP) visits for routine asthma care, and decrease asthma symptoms while
      improving asthma quality of life (QOL).
