      I. To evaluate response of relapsed or progressive multiple myeloma to lenalidomide after
      allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      II. Proportion of patients achieving a complete, partial or minor response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate toxicity and tolerability of lenalidomide in this setting.

      II. For patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), evaluate the response to
      lenalidomide.

      III. Evaluate time to progression (TTP).

      IV. Evaluate overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for 2
      years or longer in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
