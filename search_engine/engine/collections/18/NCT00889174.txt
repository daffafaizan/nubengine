      1:5000 live births. As many as 50% of patients with white matter disease remain undiagnosed
      after conventional neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic testing, and therefore have
      unclassified leukodystrophies. Moreover, the mechanisms of disease in many leukodystrophies
      of known cause are very poorly understood: many are systemic abnormalities that manifest only
      in white matter. The purpose of this study is to: (a) define novel homogeneous groups of
      patients with leukodystrophy and work toward finding the cause of these disorders and (b)
      establish disease mechanisms in selected classified leukodystrophies. In order to achieve
      these goals, patients with leukodystrophy will be analyzed by clinical, neurophysiological,
      biochemical and genetic means. For goal (a), patients would have been diagnosed as having an
      unclassified leukodystrophy or no known cause of their leukodystrophy at outside centers. At
      the Clinical Center, such patients will undergo a series of neuropsychological, blood, urine,
      spinal fluid, radiological, and peripheral tissue pathological tests. Some of these tests
      will be part of a standard battery while others will be tailored to individual patients. For
      goal (b), selected leukodystrophies with a defined genetic cause will be selected for further
      mechanistic study, using clinical and laboratory tools to establish increased understanding
      of the underlying pathophysiology. It is hoped that the present study will help clarify the
      nosology of the leukodystrophies and significantly advance our understanding of the
      pathogenesis of these diseases.
