      (oxycodone 10mg PO plus lorazepam 1mg SL) and intravenous conscious sedation (fentanyl 100 µg
      plus midazolam 2mg) for first trimester surgical abortion. We hypothesize that oral conscious
      sedation will be equivalent to intravenous conscious sedation as defined by ± 1 point on a
      21-point pain scale. Subsidiary objectives include describing subject satisfaction with each
      method of pain control and characteristics of each method such as side effect profile,
      recovery room time, and postoperative pain.
