      relation between risk of falls in patients with and without motor dysfunction. The results
      may enable new and more precise recommendations for exercise in diabetic patients with
      diabetic neuropathy. In addition, the results may lead to a better understanding of the
      mechanisms underlying the effects of training. The improvement of motor function may lead to
      improved gait stability, fewer fall injuries and better quality of life for type 2 diabetes
      patients, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality.
