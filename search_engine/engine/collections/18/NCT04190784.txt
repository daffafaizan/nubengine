      get shorten leading to restricted neck mobility as they are most frequently used to maintain
      posture,there seems to be strong rationale for stretching these muscles however, to date
      there is no agreement about the optimal stretching parameters . A multitude of stretching
      parameters are used in the clinical setting. However, there is no convincing evidence to
      suggest which parameters are most effective in the management of Chronic myofascial pain
      syndrome . In this regard, although the stretching duration is considered one of the most
      important variables that can affect the treatment outcome, to date there is little agreement
      on the most effective stretching duration.

      In theory, reflex inhibition during the stretching procedure, an increased stretch tolerance
      , decreased viscoelasticity, and a degree of reduced musculotendinous stiffness could all
      contribute to the sustained increase in elastic ROM. Regardless of these proven underlying
      mechanisms, all the previous studies ignored the adverse mechanical tension that developed
      during stretching exercises . Based on the literature, this tension may adversely affect the
      central nervous system and nerve root function . Accordingly, in the current study ,we will
      try to answer the question that is it theoretically possible, that increased longitudinal
      stress and strain on the spinal cord and nerve root from stretching exercises may subtly
      impair the neural function.in addition to investigate the effect of stretching on other
      management outcomes;pain intensity,disability,range of motion,and Pressure-pain threshold.
