      contributes to atherogenic dyslipidemia and predisposes to both cardiovascular disease and
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effects on insulin resistance of changes in dietary
      macronutrient composition in the absence of weight loss are poorly understood. To better
      understand these effects, we will study men and women with insulin resistance after 4 weeks
      on a basal diet (15% protein, 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat) and 4 weeks after random assignment
      to the basal diet or one of 4 diets with 35% carbohydrate and either 20% or 30% protein, and
      either 7% or 15% saturated fat. At the end of each dietary period (4 weeks and 8 weeks), we
      will draw a blood sample for detailed metabolic measurements and measure insulin sensitivity
      by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) method. In addition to
      insulin resistance, we will assess the effect of dietary composition on parameters of
      atherogenic dyslipidemia.
