      to different patients (each individual patient will get the same dose for all treatments).
      The doses will be very low at the start of the trial, and will increase only when the lower
      dose levels are proven safe.

      In the second part of the study, up to 2 dose levels that are both safe and show promising
      activity against MM will be given to more patients
