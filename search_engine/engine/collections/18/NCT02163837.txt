      hepatic failure. Sleep architecture is disturbed in this syndrome, and patients complain
      mainly of excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep disturbances. Hypothesis to explain these
      symptoms is, among others, disturbed melatonin metabolism. Few studies have been conducted in
      order to study sleep disorders during HE, and effect of treatment is unknown. Recently,
      rifaximine, an oral broad spectrum antibiotic, have been proved to decrease ammoniac
      production in patients with HE. The purpose of our study is to assess sleep quality,
      quantity, sleep schemes and physical activity in patients suffering from HE, before and after
      a 2 weeks treatment with rifaximine.
