      marrow transplantation in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia. II. Determine toxic
      effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      subcutaneously on days 1-7, 9-14, and 16-22. On days 8 and 15, patients receive IL-2 IV over
      2 hours. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 6-9 patients receive escalating doses of
      IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 2 of 9 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients
      are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-27 patients will be accrued for this study.
