      invited to participate in a randomized clinical trial.

      Those who are willing will be randomly allocated to one of the following arms: a) Digital
      cognitive based stress management, b) Digital mindfulness based intervention or c) Control
      group.

      The intervention is based on a revised version of the Stressproffen app, which was developed
      by the Oslo University Hospital (Lise Solberg Nes, Elin Børøsund and others).

      Outcome measures include measures of perceived stress and HRQoL.
