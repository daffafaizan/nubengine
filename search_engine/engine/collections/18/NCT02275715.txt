      waitlist control group. Study assessments evaluating feeding and mealtime behaviors,
      nutritional intake, daytime behaviors, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities, parent
      stress and parent-child interactions will be completed at Baseline, Week 10, and Week 20
      timepoints. Treatment Fidelity forms will be completed by the therapist at the end of each
      treatment session to assess achievement of session goals and parent adherence during each
      session.
