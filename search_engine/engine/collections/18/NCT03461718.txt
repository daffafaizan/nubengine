      in the Gastroenterology Service to demonstrate the efficacy of ketamine and its utility in
      moderate sedation. Patients presenting to the endoscopy lab for esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      (EGD) and/or colonoscopy who meet inclusion criteria will be approached, and if amenable,
      will be consented and enrolled. Patients will be randomized to receive either a ketamine
      loading dose and then subsequent doses IV ketamine and midazolam 1mg IV prior to
      administration of ketamine or standard fentanyl/midazolam moderate sedation during their
      procedure. Participants will then undergo the planned procedure. The primary outcome will be
      patient satisfaction, which will be measured using the validated "Patient Satisfaction with
      Sedation" instrument (PSSI). A number of secondary outcomes will include the following: (1)
      provider satisfaction (measured using and the "Clinician Satisfaction with Sedation"
      instrument (CSSI), (2) the time from sedation administration to procedure start (when the
      scope is inserted), (3) the time from sedation to recovery (defined as the time from the end
      of the procedure until the patient meets discharge criteria from the recovery area), (4) time
      to cecum (for colonoscopy) total doses of medications given (midazolam, fentanyl, and
      ketamine), (5) overall time of the procedure, (6) adverse events, (7) changes in vital signs,
      (8) and the need for additional medications, in particular reversal agents.
