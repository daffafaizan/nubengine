      recipients from Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM), Prague. The primary
      objective of the study is to assess humoral and cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA
      vaccines in SARS-CoV-2-naive kidney transplant recipients using immunochemiluminescent and
      Enzyme Linked Immuno Spot (ELISPOT) assays. As comparator several cohorts will be evaluated:

        1. kidney transplant recipients with previous SARS-CoV-2 exposition verified by real-time
           reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

        2. kidney transplant recipients vaccinated on waiting list (a) SARS-CoV-2 naive (b)
           SARS-CoV-2 previously exposed

      The secondary objective is to determine clinical variables affecting antibody levels.
      SARS-CoV-2 anti S1/2 antibodies will be tested â‰¥ 15 days after the second dose of mRNA
      vaccines and in 3 months after the first blood sampling.

      In subanalysis 50 kidney transplant recipients will be examined for a cell-mediated immune
      response after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.
