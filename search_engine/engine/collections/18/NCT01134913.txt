    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational, and sample procurement study of adult
      subjects presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in whom ACS is in the differential
      diagnosis. Subjects must present to one of the participating EDs within 6 hours or less from
      the time of symptom onset, and must have experienced at least 5 minutes of chest discomfort.

      Those ED patients with possible ACS who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      approached for study enrollment by trained research personnel.

      The patient's diagnostic work-up and treatment will continue per the standards of the
      treating institution. As indicated by their clinical presentation, it is anticipated that all
      patients in this study will have an electrocardiogram (ECG) upon admission to the ED and if
      the patient is found not to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), objective
      cardiac testing will be conducted for evidence of MI. The Principal Investigator at each site
      will evaluate the results of the objective cardiac tests combined with biomarker evidence of
      myocardial necrosis to determine whether or not a patient enrolled at their site has a final
      diagnosis of ACS.

      Cardiac events and procedure, such as angioplasty-stenting and coronary artery bypass surgery
      (CABG), will be recorded during the index ED visit, hospitalization and post-hospital
      follow-up period. Subjects will have a 30-day, 3 month and 6 month follow-up contact by phone
      or medical chart review to collect this information on cardiac events, procedures and
      survival.

      Blood samples collected at several time points during the index ED visit will be used for
      future testing of novel blood markers as they become available.
