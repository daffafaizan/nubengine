      for perinatal mortality. In these cases, the placenta is smaller and often the centre of
      thrombotic lesions. The estimation of the placenta volume by 3D ultrasound coupled with
      growth factors and D-Dimers measures could improve the understanding of these pathologies to
      optimize their detection. Thus, the identification of predictive factors of the risk of
      occurrence or recurrence of PVP could allow us to propose a monitoring of patients at risk,
      to anticipate corticoids administration for the foetuses pulmonary maturation and perhaps
      later to adapt anti hypertensive and antithrombotic therapeutics.
