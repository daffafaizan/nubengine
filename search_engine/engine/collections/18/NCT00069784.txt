    
      The ORIGIN study was conducted by the Population Health Research Institute in Hamilton,
      Ontario (Canada), working in conjunction with the sponsor, and an independent Steering
      Committee.

      Routine visits were to occur at 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks following randomization, then every
      four months for the rest of the study, for all participants

      The duration of the study was based on the number of events observed (event-driven study) and
      was originally planned to be 5 years. In 2008-2009 ORIGIN's follow-up was extended by
      approximately 2 years, because of published literature of completed studies suggesting that a
      longer period of effective glycemic contrast between treatments might be needed to see an
      effect on cardiovascular events.
