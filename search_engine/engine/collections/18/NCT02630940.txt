      8-isoprostane in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients' exhaled breath condensate (EBC). EBC
      samples will be collected using RTube, prior to analysis for levels of 8-isoprostane. An
      acceptability assessment will be performed for this non-invasive method of EBC collection
      through a non-validated questionnaire.

      A regression analysis will then be performed for 8-isoprostane levels against the severity of
      the patient's cough, assessed through the use of the visual analogue scale for cough (VAS),
      the King's brief interstitial lung disease questionnaire (KBILD), the Medical Research
      Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale and the Leicester cough questionnaire. Alongside this an
      exploratory comparison of cough scores and 8 isoprostane concentration between patients with
      and without honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis.
