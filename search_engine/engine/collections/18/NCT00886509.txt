      Current revascularization therapies are PCI or surgical revascularization. However, inherent
      to them are procedure-related risks and the fact, that progression of CAD is not prevented.
      Additionally, up to one fourth of all CAD patients are not amenable to standard
      revascularization therapies. Thus, there is a need for alternative therapies. The coronary
      collateral circulation is prevalent in humans, and in CAD the amount of collateral flow is a
      pivotal protective factor with respect to infarct size, all-cause- and cardiac mortality.
      Coronary collateral growth promotion is an alternative to conventional revascularization
      which can be achieved by cytokine-based approaches (e.g. with colony-stimulating
      factor-therapy) in humans. The goal of collateral promotion is to reduce myocardial damage in
      case of a coronary occlusion.
