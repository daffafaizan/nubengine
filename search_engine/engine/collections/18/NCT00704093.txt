      electrical activation sequence in the heart. This abnormal activation pattern of the
      ventricles may have detrimental effects on cardiac structure and function. Several clinical
      trials have demonstrated an association between RV pacing and an increased risk of heart
      failure and death. In addition, RV pacing has been shown to impair left ventricular (LV)
      function both in normal and failing hearts. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that this
      deterioration in LV function is related to the presence of LV dyssynchrony during RV pacing.

      The exact effects of RV pacing on myocardial perfusion, oxidative metabolism and cardiac
      efficiency have not been fully elucidated. Importantly, the relation between the presence of
      LV dyssynchrony during RV pacing and changes in myocardial perfusion, oxidative metabolism
      and cardiac efficiency has not been studied.

      Ten patients with normal LV ejection fraction and VVI/DDD pacemaker will be studied during
      AAI-pacing/sinus rhythm without RV pacing (pacing-OFF) and with RV-pacing (pacing-ON) at the
      same heart rate. Dynamic [15O]water and [11C]acetate positron emission tomography is used to
      measure perfusion and oxidative metabolism (kmono) of the LV. An echocardiographic
      examination is used to assess LV stroke volume (SV) and LV dyssynchrony.

      The PET data will be first analyzed based on RV pacing mode only, comparing the two pacing
      conditions (pacing-ON vs. pacing-OFF). Thereafter, the study population will be divided into
      two groups, according to the presence of LV dyssynchrony during RV pacing.
