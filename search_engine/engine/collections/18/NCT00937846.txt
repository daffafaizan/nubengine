      ascertain if GSK1034702 is crossing the blood-brain barrier to enable it to elicit a central
      effect. GSK1034702 has been shown in vitro to be a substrate for human Pgp, therefore the
      distribution of GSK1034702 into human brain could be adversely affected. This use of PET in
      conjunction with radioactively labelled GSK1034702 will help ascertain the role Pgp plays in
      limiting brain penetration in the presence and absence of a pharmacological relevant oral non
      labelled dose of 5 mg. Subjects will have an MRI scan to aid definition of brain anatomy, a
      baseline PET scan and a post-dose PET scan. For each subject the study will consist of at
      least three visits; screening visit, scanning day and follow-up.
