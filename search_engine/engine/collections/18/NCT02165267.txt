    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and drug levels of five
      different schedules for the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of a human
      monoclonal antibody (VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB [VRC01]) against HIV in healthy, HIV-uninfected
      adults.

      The study will enroll 88 healthy, HIV-uninfected adults aged 18 to 50 years.

      This study will enroll participants in 5 groups. Groups 1-3 will enroll simultaneously.
      Groups 1 and 2 will be randomized together but not blinded, while Group 3 will be randomized
      separately and will be blinded. With the implementation of Version 2.0, Groups 4 and 5 will
      be randomized together and will enroll simultaneously. Each group will have a different
      schedule of clinic visits and receive different doses of VRC01 or placebo for VRC01.
      Participants will attend 8 months of scheduled clinic visits.

      Participants in Group 1 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 on Days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, and
      140. Participants in Group 2 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 on Days 0, 56, and 112.
      Participants in Group 3 will receive an IV infusion of VRC01 or IV placebo for VRC01 on Day
      0, followed by SC injections of VRC01 or SC placebo for VRC01 on Days 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84,
      98, 112, 126, 140, and 154. Participants in Groups 4 and 5 will receive an IV infusion of
      VRC01 (each group will receive a different dose) on Days 0, 56, and 112.

      Participants will remain in the clinic for about an hour after receiving the infusions and
      injections for observation and monitoring. Participants in Group 3 who have no problems with
      the first SC injection will have to wait in the clinic for only a half an hour after the rest
      of the SC injections.

      At study entry, participants will give a medical history; undergo a physical exam, blood
      collection, and urine collection; and receive HIV risk reduction counseling. At follow-up
      visits, participants will undergo a brief physical exam and blood collection, receive HIV
      risk reduction counseling, and be asked questions about their health and their experience
      participating in the study. At all visits, participants who were born female will have a
      pregnancy test. At select study visits, saliva, rectal, and semen or cervical secretion
      samples will be collected from participants who consent to collection of these samples.
