      will be measured. All subjects will complete a moderate treadmill exercise test and a test to
      determine how they use sugar (oral glucose tolerance test). The amount and type of energy
      burned by each subject will be measured. Subjects will be randomly assigned to follow either
      a high carbohydrate diet or a reduced carbohydrate, high protein diet for 4 months. At the
      end of 4 months, the tests will be repeated.
