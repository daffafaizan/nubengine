      since the early 70s to treat mild to moderate hypertension. In addition to hypertension,
      clonidine has been evaluated and used extensively for several other indications, including
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

      An easy to administer clonidine formulation is needed that retains the efficacy of the
      current oral formulation but has an improved safety profile. The current trial will
      investigate the safety and efficacy of clonidine delivered from the sustained release
      formulation of CLONICEL in the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD.
