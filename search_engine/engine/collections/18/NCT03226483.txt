      adjuvant radiotherapy after resection of space occupying lesions local recurrence rates are
      high. That is why guidelines recommend a cavity boosting with x-rays. External beam
      radiotherapy can lower the risk of local recurrence but means longer hospitalization,
      prolongs the time to systemic salvage therapies and bears risks of radionecrosis and
      leucoencephalopathy with neurological and cognitive decline. A solution for this problem
      could be onetime intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with soft x-rays to sterilize the
      resection cavity, which may provide both: freedom from local recurrence fast track salvage
      therapy initiation.

      INTRAMET is a single institution, open-label, prospective, phase 2 feasibility study for
      intraoperative radiotherapy immediately following resection of brain metastases. 50 adult
      patients with resectable not dural brain metastases should be treated in surgery after tumor
      resection with IORT with 20-30Gy prescribed to the margin of the resection cavity. The
      highest dose tolerable to surrounding risk structures (N. opticus, brainstem) should be used.

      With this method, the investigators hope to show similar local control rates to postoperative
      external beam radiotherapy in line with guideline recommendations with less patient
      hospitalization and faster start of rescue therapies which could lead to a favorable overall
      outcome and less cognitive side effects.
