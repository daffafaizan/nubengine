      promote general health. This trial is designed to see whether a complex supplement (Stem Cell
      100+) that targets multiple longevity pathways could also have positive effects on several
      markers of successful aging and good health. Multipath causes of aging include: stem cell
      function, telomere loss, chronic stress, inflammation, insulin-like growth factors,
      autophagy, vascular loss, neural dysfunction, and oxidative stress. The goal of the study was
      to test the effects of this novel multipath intervention strategy in a clinical trial of
      healthy people using health markers such as blood pressure, cholesterol status, lung
      function, stress levels, and self-reported health status. Hundreds of published animal and
      human clinical studies have been done with each of the individual active ingredients in the
      formulation, which target many critical causes of aging.

      Based on their published animal studies showing extension of life span in a model animal and
      their laboratory work on adult human stem cells, the investigators believe that Stem Cell
      100+ will provide evidence of efficacy in addressing multiple index markers of health and
      life expectancy outcomes.
