        -  To measure the protein expression of candidate proteins in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
           tumor samples.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for protein expression (i.e., Notch1,
      Hey1, FGFR4, and Sp1) by IHC techniques and standard commercially available antibodies.
      Candidate proteins are then correlated with each patient age, gender, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
      tumor stage, and RMS tumor subtype.
