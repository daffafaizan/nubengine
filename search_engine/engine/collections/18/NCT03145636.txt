      Rechargeable System for the treatment obesity. The Maestro Rechargeable System delivers
      intermittent, electrical blocking signals to the anterior and posterior trunks of the
      intra-abdominal vagus nerve (termed vBloc Therapy) and is designed to reduce sensations of
      hunger and produce satiety leading to weight loss.

      Subjects in the observational arm (100 subjects total) will receive the device implant and
      use the vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program.

      The randomized sub-study (100 subjects) will randomly assign subjects (1:1) to either
      treatment (50 subjects) or control (50 subjects). The treatment arm will receive the device
      implant and use of the vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program. The control arm will
      participate in the Control Weight Management (CWM) during a 6 month period prior to receiving
      the device implant and using the vBloc Achieve program.

      The vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program consists of recommendations regarding diet,
      exercise and behavior modification, and will be utilized by all subjects following their
      device implant.
