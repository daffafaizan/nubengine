      appears to both increase IL-2 receptors on lymphocytes in vitro and enhance lymphocyte
      maturation in vivo; thus, the drug may further enhance the CD4 T cell levels in patients
      receiving AZT and PEG IL-2.

      Patients are stabilized on oral AZT daily for 8 weeks and then begin receiving bolus
      infusions of PEG IL-2 every other week for at least four doses. Thymosin alpha 1 (given SC)
      is then added to this regimen twice weekly for 4 weeks. If no significant toxicity occurs,
      thymosin alpha 1 is increased to and administered along with scheduled doses of PEG IL-2 for
      an additional 8 weeks.
