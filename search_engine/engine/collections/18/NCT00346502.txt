      Dysplastic melanocytic nevus (DMN) is a histopathologic term implying a disordered
      proliferation of melanocytes associated with discontinuous and variable cellular atypia. DMN
      is graded into mild, moderate, and severe based on standard histological criteria. DMN is
      considered to be a likely precursor for melanoma, and individuals with DMN often have
      multiple instances of it scattered over their trunk and extremities. For this study, only DMN
      where the dysplasia is either moderate or severe will be included.
