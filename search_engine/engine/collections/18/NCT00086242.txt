        -  Compare quality of life (QOL) at baseline and changes in QOL, immune response, and
           neuroendocrine parameters over time in patients who have completed treatment for stage
           I-III cervical cancer receiving psychosocial telephone counseling vs usual care.

        -  Correlate psychosocial measures with immunologic stance.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, parallel-group study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo psychosocial telephone counseling comprising 5 weekly sessions
           and a 1-month follow-up session to learn strategies for reducing stress.

           questionnaires and Quality of life assessment at baseline and at 4 months. They also
           undergo saliva and blood sample collections at baseline and at 4 months for neuroimmune
           studies.
