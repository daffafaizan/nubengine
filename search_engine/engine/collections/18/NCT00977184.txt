    
      Objective:

      To demonstrate cumulative and long-lasting improvement of parkinsonian symptoms by 50 Hz rTMS
      (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) and its safety in Parkinson's Disease (PD)
      patients.

      Study population:

      Up to 30 PD patients in Hoehn and Yahr disease stage 2-4 while off medication will be
      enrolled. Patients must be receiving more than 300 mg of levodopa (including dopamine
      agonists) and have gait problems.

      Design:

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo (sham)-controlled study of 26 patients with PD in
      2 groups (real versus sham stimulation). The study involves performance (8 interventions) of
      50 Hz rTMS with large circular coil over the motor cortex on both sides of the brain.
      Assessment of PD symptoms with standard tests of motor function will be performed over a
      one-month period.

      Outcome measure:

      The primary endpoint include the changes in gait speed as assessed by the time it takes to
      walk 10 meters and the changes in bradykinesia as assessed by measuring the time it takes to
      do 10 combined hand and arm movements.

      Secondary endpoints include the changes in the total, motor and activities of daily living
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score.
