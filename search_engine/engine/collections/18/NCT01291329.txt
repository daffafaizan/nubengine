      both in vitro and in vivo. Several clinical trials have been performed using autologous bone
      marrow-derived MSCs, but the results of these trials have been unsatisfactory because of a
      low number of MSCs in older patients and in those with coronary heart disease. WJ-MSCs from
      the human umbilical cord matrix which are of epiblastic origin and contain both human
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cell markers appear to have a number of
      important advantages: they do not raise ethical issues, are widely multipotent, are not
      tumorigenic, and are not immunogenetic. Because of a short population doubling time they can
      be rapidly scaled up in large numbers. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction to receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or placebo medium into the infarct
      artery 4-7 days after successful reperfusion therapy.
