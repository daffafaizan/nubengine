      correct because it appears as a result of the interaction of numerous etiological factors
      (genetic, dental, skeletal, functional, soft tissue, and habit) that contribute to its
      development. Various therapeutic approaches have been proposed for the treatment of an
      anterior open bite. These approaches vary depending on the causative factors and involve
      myotherapy, preventive treatment, functional therapy, orthognathic surgery, and orthodontic
      treatment using anterior teeth extrusion or posterior teeth intrusion. Among the non-surgical
      orthodontic treatment methods are the temporary anchorage devices (TADs) including miniplates
      and miniscrew or micro-screw implants. The intrusion of posterior teeth with temporary
      anchorage devices was suggested to lead to decreased lower facial height by a
      counterclockwise rotation of the mandible; this may resemble the orthognathic surgery
      outcomes for any open bite patients. To the best of the investigators current knowledge, this
      is the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of molar intrusion in
      adolescence and adult patients in the permanent dentition stage.
