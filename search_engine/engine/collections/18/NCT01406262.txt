    
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind study designed to investigate the effect of
      treatment with albiglutide given weekly over 6 weeks on the cardiac repolarization (corrected
      QT interval) in healthy male and female subjects. Moxifloxacin, a positive control, or
      moxifloxacin placebo will be given in order to validate the ability of the study to detect a
      change in the corrected QT interval.
