    
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of orthodontic treatment using Invisalign® on
      the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and orofacial muscular complex, on the recorded number of
      bruxism/clenching events during sleep, and on the reported amount of bruxism/clenching events
      during the day.

      Principal objective:

      * Evaluation of the effect of continuous wear of Invisalign® trays on the TMJ and muscles of
      the orofacial complex.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Objective evaluation of the effect of Invisalign® trays on bruxism/clenching events at
           night.

        -  Subjective evaluation of the effect of Invisalign® trays on bruxism/clenching during the
           day.

        -  Evaluation of the evolution of symptoms over the course of six months.

      Appointment 1:

      -Initial Exam (Initial complete orthodontic record)

      Appointment 2 (T0):

        -  Presentation of the treatment plan

        -  Informed consent

        -  iTero Scan for Invisalign

        -  TMJ exam (baseline)

        -  Diagnostic bruxism/clenching questionnaire (baseline)

        -  Give Electromyogram (EMG) machine to patient for night study at home (baseline)

        -  Instructions on how to use the EMG machine

        -  NB: Patient returns EMG by courier

      Appointment 3:

        -  Delivery of Invisalign® trays #1

        -  Instructions on wearing the Invisalign® trays

        -  Take mailing information to send EMG machine by courier (EMG recording the night before
           Appointment 4 / T1)

      Appointment 4 (T1: 2 weeks after appointment 3):

        -  Patient brings back EMG machine

        -  TMJ exam

        -  Daytime bruxism/clenching questionnaire

        -  Bonding attachments onto teeth

        -  Give Invisalign® trays #2

        -  NB: Patient will be followed every 6-8 weeks

      Appointment 5 (T2: 6 months after appointment 4):

        -  TMJ exam

        -  Daytime bruxism/clenching

        -  Give EMG machine for night study at home

        -  Patient returns EMG by courier

      All subjects in the study will be treated using the Invisalign® appliance. To obtain
      statistically and clinically significant results, it was calculated that at least 30 patients
      will need to complete the study. Our objective is to recruit about 40 patients.
