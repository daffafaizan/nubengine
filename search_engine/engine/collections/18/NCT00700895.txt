      using a simplified genotyping procedure requiring the identification of a single CYP2C9
      allele and a single nucleotide polymorphism of VKORC1 to discern between the 2 major
      haplotypes H1 and H7.

      Aims: The aim is to compare the clinical benefits of genetics-guided dosing versus
      traditional trial and error dosing with protocol guided-adjustments. Two secondary objectives
      are (1) to prospectively evaluate a dosing algorithm built on demographics and genetic
      predictors; (2) to assess the feasibility of a simplified test for CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 SNP in
      clinical practice.

      Methodology: A randomized controlled trial targeted at accruing 100 patients with indication
      for wafarin therapy. The endpoint for comparing genetics-guided dosing against traditional
      dosing method at the anticoagulant clinic is the number of dosage titrations to achieve
      targeted International Normalized Ratio (INR) at 1, 2 and 3 months of initializing warfarin.
      Upon reaching steady-state, pharmacokinetics of warfarin R- and S-isomers will be assessed
      for correlation with dose requirements based. An assay for easy identification of genetic
      polymorphisms required in this dosing regimen in a clinic setting will also be validated.

      Significance: This concerted, multi-disciplinary effort to bring pharmacogenetics-based
      therapy from bench to bedside has the potential to reduce the efforts incurred with multiple
      dose titrations of the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. With the aid of
      mathematical modeling, a simplified and more cost-effective genotyping method could be
      implementation for the future treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolic diseases.
