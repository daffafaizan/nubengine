      trial of a dietary intervention in a population of adults with asthma and to determine sample
      size estimates for a larger, more definitive trial aimed at improving asthma clinical
      outcomes and improving markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The study uses a feeding
      trial design comprised of a 4 week dietary intervention in which all meals are provided to
      study participants and a 4 week control diet comprised of usual dietary intake. Participants
      are randomized to the intervention or control diet and then cross over to the alternate
      assignment after a 4 week washout period.
