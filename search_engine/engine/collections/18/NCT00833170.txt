      adults. Explanations for this are unclear, especially since children are less likely to
      engage in some behaviors (e.g., smoking) that may have a deleterious effect on disease course
      as noted in adults. In many ways children are a better "experimental model" of IBD because
      they don't have as many confounding medical factors as adults. Both Crohn's disease and
      ulcerative colitis are believed to result from a complex interaction of genetic and
      environmental factors (1). Recently, the gene CARD15/NOD2 on chromosome 16 has been
      identified in approximately 25% of Caucasian patients with Crohn's disease and is felt to be
      a significant predisposing factor to the development of fibrostenosing disease (2).
      Additionally, seropositivity for perinuclear antinuclear cytoplasmic factor (pANCA) has been
      demonstrated much more frequently in patients with ulcerative colitis than in those with
      Crohn's disease, while anti-Saccharomyces antibody (ASCA) is more common in the latter
      population (3). The importance of these serological abnormalities is not clear, though some
      data suggest an influence on the development of complications.

      Our hypothesis is that phenotypic, genotypic and serologic characteristics may provide
      prognostic information on response to therapy and course in children with IBD. This type of
      prognostic information is particularly important as newer therapies are developed.
