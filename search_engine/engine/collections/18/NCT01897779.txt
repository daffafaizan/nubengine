      members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of
      hospital acquired infections. In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine
      carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable
      threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents.

      Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem (RPX2014) plus a new
      beta-lactamase inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine beta-lactamases,
      including KPC. This Phase 1 study will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      of intravenous RPX2014 and RPX7009, administered alone and in combination, in healthy adult
      subjects.
