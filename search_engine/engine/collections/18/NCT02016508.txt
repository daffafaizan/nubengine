    
      This study is an open-label investigation of the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      unilateral intravitreal injection of autologous bone marrow stem cells in subjects with
      Geographic Atrophy secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Subjects will be
      enrolled based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and evaluated at regular post
      transplant intervals.

      Human central nervous system -stem cells will be transplanted by a vitreoretinal surgeon. The
      transplantation will be conducted in the eye with the inferior best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) (i.e., the Study Eye). Only the Study Eye will undergo transplantation. The adult bone
      marrow stem cells will be administered into the vitreous cavity through a standard surgical
      approach.

      Moxifloxacin 300 mg(once per day ) will be administered orally to all subjects for a period
      of five days ( 2 days pre and post operatively) .

      Subjects will be monitored frequently for a total of one year after adult bone marrow stem
      cells cell injection .
