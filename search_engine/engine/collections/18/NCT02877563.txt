      undergo either surgical or percutaneous revascularization. Limb rest-stress CEU perfusion
      imaging will be performed before and 3-4 weeks after revascularization. Quantitative
      measurements of pre-revascularization perfusion, post-revascularization perfusion, and change
      in perfusion will be compared to symptom status (Rutherford classification and PAD [Criqui]
      questionnaire) at each study point, and to data on time to onset of claudication on an
      upright treadmill exercise study (Gardiner protocol). Results of angiography will be scored
      and allow determination of the relationship between angiographic severity of disease and
      exercise perfusion.
