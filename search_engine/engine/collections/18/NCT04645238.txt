      Kellgren-Lawrence Stage II and III knee OA by the physician were included in the study.
      Participants were divided into two groups as static stretching group (n = 18) or PNF
      stretching group (n = 18). Patients' demographic and clinical information was recorded. Pain
      intensity was evaluated with visual pain scale, hamstring flexibility with Active Knee
      Extension Test, functional status with Western Ontario and McMasters University
      Osteoarthritis Index and Timed Get Up and Go Test. In addition to the standard physiotherapy
      program, the subjects praticed stretching exercises for 15 sessions according to the groups
      that they've been separated. Evaluations were repeated in the end of the treatment (4th week)
      and in the 3rd month after the treatment.
