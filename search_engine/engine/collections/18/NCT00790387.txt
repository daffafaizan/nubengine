      compared to unfractionated heparin.

      Introduction: The benefit of the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIa inhibitors with low molecular
      weight heparins in high risk patients undergoing percutaneous intervention (PCI) over
      traditional unfractionated heparin (UFH) is debated. Methods; The study is a prospective
      single center open-label trial of patients with high-risk acute coronary syndrome treated
      with PCI who were randomised to anticoagulation with UFH or enoxaparin with 'high dose' (25
      mcg/kg bolus) tirofiban This study measured a panel of platelet activation markers,
      inflammatory biomarkers and thrombus generation between the two groups.
