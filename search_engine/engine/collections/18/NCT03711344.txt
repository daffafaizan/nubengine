      Ontario and Canada. Beginning with a participatory/qualitative research approach, common
      themes amongst clients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, and community leaders, will
      divulge basic elements needed to develop a culturally adapted model of cognitive behavioural
      therapy. The information from the adapted model will be taught to participating psychologists
      who will deliver the therapy in a randomized control trial design, with feasibility testing
      of the intervention using a quantitative approach ensuing. Immediate guidelines will then be
      developed for use by therapists working with East Asian youth.
