    
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of blindness among people of working age.
      Treatment of DME included blood pressure and glycemic control, grid laser, intravitreal
      injection of steroids (acetonide of triamcinolone, dexamethasone implant, fluocinolone
      implant) or anti-Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (Bevacizumab, Ranibizumab,
      Aflibercept) (2015). The advent of anti-VEGF therapy has revolutionized the management of
      DME. Aflibercept, one of the drugs in this group has recently been approved in France.
      However, there is no report in the efficacy and tolerance of Aflibercept in vitrectomized
      eyes in the diabetic macular oedema . In this study, in order to prove the efficiency and
      tolerance of Aflibercept, data will be collected in a anonymous way in medical records of
      patients having received a treatment by Aflibercept in the past.
