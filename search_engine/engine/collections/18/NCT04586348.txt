      disabilities in the child. Following results of a 2004 national survey of school-aged
      children showing that mild iodine deficiency had re-emerged in the south-eastern parts of
      Australia, the Australian government mandated the addition of iodine to salt used in bread
      making to increase population iodine intake. It is also recommended that all pregnant and
      lactating women take an additional iodine supplement containing 150 µg/d of iodine.

      Since this time, further evidence has emerged from cohort studies that children born to women
      with high iodine intake (as well as low iodine intake) have poorer neurodevelopmental scores,
      suggesting that more tailored supplementation may be a better strategy. Our PoppiE trial will
      determine if limiting iodine supplementation in women who already consume adequate iodine
      from food, improves cognitive scores in early childhood.

      A total of 754 pregnant women from around Australia who are ≤13 weeks of gestation will be
      enrolled and randomised to receive a standard prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement with a
      reduced amount of iodine (20 μg - intervention) or a standard prenatal vitamin and mineral
      supplement with 200 μg of iodine (control). The control supplement contains a level of iodine
      to match the amount in most commonly used vitamin and mineral supplements sold in Australia.
      Infant neurodevelopment at 24 months of age will be assessed using the Bayley-IV and
      conducted at participating centres or a location convenient to the family.
