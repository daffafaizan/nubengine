      health care providers. The overall purpose of doing so is to reduce disparities in medication
      self-efficacy, adherence to therapy, and HIV viral load suppression. We will conduct a
      randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a combined provider and patient
      communication intervention conducted at two separate visits compared to usual care in
      improving the quality of patient-provider communication, patients' medication self-efficacy,
      patient adherence to therapy, and HIV RNA suppression. The following primary and secondary
      hypotheses will be addressed.

      Primary Hypothesis.

      1) There will be more and higher quality patient-provider communication about antiretroviral
      medication adherence in the intervention compared to control arm at both visit 1 (V1) and
      visit 2 (V2).

      Secondary Hypotheses

        1. Higher quality patient-provider communication in the intervention arm will be associated
           with

             -  higher patient ratings of communication (overall, HIV-specific, adherence-specific,
                and interpersonal style of provider) at V1 and V2;

             -  increased patient preference for a shared decision-making role at V1 and V2;

             -  more positive health beliefs at V1 and V2;

             -  higher patient medication self-efficacy at V1 and V2;

             -  better adherence to antiretroviral medication (assessed by 3-day recall) at V2; and

             -  a greater percentage of patients with HIV-1 RNA suppression at V2.

        2. The intervention will reduce disparities in medication self-efficacy, adherence, and
           HIV-1 RNA suppression.
