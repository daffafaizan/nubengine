      (CMT) than in people without the condition. CMT is a condition which affects the nerves
      causing a variety of symptoms including sensation impairments and weakness. The impairments
      are usually most evident in the feet and hands, but they can progress very slowly moving
      closer to the trunk. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO's) are often prescribed to help with walking
      and daily function. So far the effects of AFO's on standing balance in people who have CMT
      have not been looked at. Insoles are also often prescribed to realign foot deformity and
      reduce pain. Insoles which give a vibratory input have had a positive impact on walking in
      older people but have not been looked at in balance and in CMT. Insoles which give a
      vibration feedback to the sole of the foot when worn have been designed. This study will look
      at whether the use of AFO's and the vibratory insoles have an effect on standing balance in
      people with CMT or related peripheral neuropathy. Balance measurements will be taken in a
      single session comparing a variety of postures. Patients will be recruited from neurology
      outpatient clinics at the National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery.
