      on Tourette's Syndrome (TS)-spectrum OCD as a possible homogeneous form of OCD, and
      investigating the relevance of intact 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) function to the mechanism of
      anti-OC drug action. The validity of TS-spectrum OCD as a distinct subtype is assessed using
      a detailed clinical, family, drug treatment response profile in adult OCD patients.

      In Study I, patients are divided prospectively into 2 putative subtypes (TS-spectrum and
      non-TS-spectrum OCD) on the basis of clinical history and direct, structured interviews of
      family members (approximately 400 interviews).

      In Study II, patients enter an 8-week single-blind trial with the potent and selective 5-HT
      reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FX). Patients with an incomplete response to FX alone
      (approximately 64 patients) are randomized to a 4-week double-blind trial of FX in
      combination with the dopamine (DA) 2 antagonist olanzapine (OLA) or placebo (PLA).
