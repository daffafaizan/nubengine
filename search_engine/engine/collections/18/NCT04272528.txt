      lead hospital to establish a uniform care network for stoma patients in Shaanxi Province.
      This network includes the management system of stoma nursing and the management organization
      of stoma patients in Shaanxi Province. It formulates the whole quality standard of stoma
      nursing in Shaanxi Province, carries out "standard training" for the stoma specialty nurses
      in the group, and carries out on-site inspection in various hospitals from time to time,
      establishes the feedback mechanism and standardizes the stoma nursing process. The contact
      card of stoma therapists was made and distributed to patients with stoma, so that patients
      can easily get the information of stoma therapists in the nearest hospital and receive
      professional and convenient care. WeChat group of specialized stoma nurses was established to
      provide remote guidance for difficult cases, share new stoma ideas and knowledge, and
      facilitate communication among stoma nurses in the group. The leading hospital holds training
      courses on knowledge and progress of stomatology every year, competitions on knowledge and
      skills, and dispatches therapists to provide work guidance, so as to share new knowledge,
      skills and scientific research abilities. At the same time, the efficacy of the network was
      evaluated by investigating the complication rate, self-care ability, quality of life, medical
      costs of stoma patients,as well as the specialized nursing skills and professional
      development of nurses.
