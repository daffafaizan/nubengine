      However, the presence of hyperkalemia can prevent patients from increasing plant-based foods
      in their diets. While hyperkalemia can have severe health consequences in advanced CKD, the
      decreased consumption of plant-based foods can be associated with adverse health outcomes in
      this population.

      Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) is a non-absorbed cation exchanger that selectively
      binds potassium in the intestine.

      This study plans to enroll CKD patients with an eGFR ≤45mL/min and a serum potassium ≥
      5mEq/L, administering SZC to achieve normokalemia, and provide them with a diet rich in
      fruits and vegetables. Endothelial function, inflammatory biomarkers and stool microbiota
      will be measured to assess the potential benefits of providing a diet rich in fruits and
      vegetables, albeit rich in potassium, in advanced CKD patients. Because these patients are
      usually restricting the intake of plant-based proteins and foods due to the concerns of
      hyperkalemia, eliminating this serious and potentially-life threatening clinical condition
      might carry health benefits, such as improved endothelial function and decreased inflammation
