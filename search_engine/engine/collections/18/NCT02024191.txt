      (modified, Folinic acid 400 mg/m2 1 day, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 1 day, 5-fluorouracil l 400
      mg/m2 bolus 2400 mg/m2 continuous infusion 48 hours) regimen. We randomly assigned the
      patients into two groups. We administered glutamine at dose of 3x10 gr/day to one patient
      group concomitantly with mFOLFOX6 regimen and other group had no additional intervention. We
      performed questionnaire, neurological examination and EMG (Electromyography) before and after
      4th cycle of mFOLFOX6 regimen in both patient groups. We planned to compare the neurological
      signs, symptoms and EMG action potentials between mFOLFOX6+Glutamine and only mFOLFOX6 group.
      We aimed to search the role of glutamine as a prophylactic agent against oxaliplatin induced
      neuropathy.
