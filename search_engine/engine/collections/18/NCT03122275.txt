    
      The secondary objectives will be the following:

        1. To test the non-inferiority of interventions based on step 1a and step 1 (1a+1b),
           considering a non-inferiority limit of 5%;

        2. To test the superiority of the specific components of the multistage intervention
           corresponding to step 2 and step 3;

        3. To quantify the differences in adherence to cervical cancer screening, for interventions
           based on step 1 (1a+1b) and multistage interventions based on steps 1 and 2 and steps 1
           to 3, between:

             1. Urban and rural areas;

             2. Younger and older population;

             3. Deprived and wealthy population;

             4. Never vs. ever users of screening;

             5. History of regular vs. irregular participation in screening programs.

        4. To quantify the differences in adherence to cervical cancer screening when using a
           positive or a neutral content of text messages and automatic phone calls, in step 1;

        5. To estimate the proportion of women who were performing cervical cancer screening in
           private health care services who started to be screened in an organized cervical cancer
           screening program, after a nurse face-to-face appointment at their primary care unit.

      Intention-to-treat analysis will be used as primary strategy for all comparisons between
      interventions and control. Secondary per-protocol analysis will also be conducted. Binary
      logistic regression may be used to control for confounding, or in secondary analyses of the
      isolate effects of steps 1a, 2 and 3.
