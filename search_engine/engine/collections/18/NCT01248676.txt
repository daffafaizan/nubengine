      cancer patients and online media sources are gaining popularity as a cancer communication
      method. It is important to know whether having multi-language online education modules are
      usable for and beneficial to the multicultural cancer patient population at Sunnybrook
      Hospital, given that recent research suggests that this cancer population in general faces
      many barriers to effective online cancer communication. Approximately 10 new patients from
      the radiation oncology clinic at Sunnybrook Hospital will be screened to participate in the
      study. Usability testing will involve a combination of interviewing, observation, think-aloud
      methodology and a short survey.Results will be analyzed by assessing the percentage of
      patients identifying with a certain level of the Likert scale on the survey as well as
      through content analysis of responses to the interview and open-ended survey questions.
