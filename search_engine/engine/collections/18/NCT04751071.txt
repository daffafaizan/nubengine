      intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) level. As the second messenger, cAMP activates protein kinase
      A, which phosphorylates the subsequent downstream cAMP-response element binding (CREB)
      protein. In the central nervous system, this signaling cascade exerts both pre- and
      post-synaptic effects and is essential for a variety of cellular functions, including
      neurotransmitter release and neuroprotection. Inhibition of PDE4 prevents cAMP breakdown,
      which is well recognized as the mechanism by which PDE4 inhibitors can treat impaired memory
      linked to several brain disorders. In pre-clinical studies and early-stage clinical trials,
      PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram have been shown to enhance memory. They also improve
      depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress, lipopolysaccharide,
      or ethanol abstinence . Consequently, it is reasonable to believe that PDE4 is a potential
      target for treatment of the comorbidity of depression and AD.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the potential adjunct antidepressant effect of
      Roflumilast in adult patients with MDD. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between
      HAM-D score and BDNF as well as their role as a therapeutic targets of MDD.
