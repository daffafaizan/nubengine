      specificity, predictive values) of multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) coronary
      angiography among patients having idiopathic hypokinetic dilated cardiomyopathy in sinus
      rhythm, compared to conventional coronary angiography. The secondary aims are to assess the
      performance of MSCT in coronary sinus anatomy assessment, and in quantitative measurement of
      left ventricular anatomical criteria (telediastolic diameter, septal and posterior wall
      thickness, and ejection fraction) compared to echocardiography. Lastly, renal tolerance of
      MSCT will be studied. This prospective monocentric study will include 120 patients scheduled
      to undergo coronary angiography for etiologic diagnosis of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (defined
      by a left ventricle echographic ejection fraction â‰¤ 40 %, without anamnestic or
      electrocardiographic arguments in favour of coronary artery disease) in sinus rhythm. MSCT
      will be performed within 3 months after conventional coronary angiography, with blinded
      analysis.
