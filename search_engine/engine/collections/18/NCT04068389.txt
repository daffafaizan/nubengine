      the progress of pregnancy and postnatal health.

      Experimental studies have suggested the transplacental passage of asbestos fibers, but
      despite the strong growth in the use and production of fine and ultrafine particles, no study
      has examined the permeability of the placenta to these compounds or the exposures fetuses
      that may result.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the transplacental passage of fine and ultrafine
      particles (nanoparticles) inhaled by the mother.
