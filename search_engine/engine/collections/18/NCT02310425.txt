      improve growth and clinical outcomes in preterm and low birth weight infants.

      A prospective, randomized case-controlled trial was conducted in infants with a gestational
      age of 30 to 37 weeks and a birth weight between 1500 to 2500 g. The study group received S.
      boulardii supplementation, 50 mg/kg twice daily, compared to no intervention in the control
      group. The primary outcomes were short term growth parameters including weight gain, linear
      growth, head and chest circumference, and secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes, feeding
      intolerance and complications.

      A total of 125 infants were enrolled in the study, 63 in the treatment and 62 in the control
      group. S. boulardii was administered for the first time at 2.63 days after birth (1 day to 6
      days, 46 within 3 days, only 5 between 4 and 6 days).
