    
      VAPOR-C is a pragmatic, event-driven, randomised controlled trial, with a blinded 2x2
      factorial design for sevoflurane/propofol and for intravenous lidocaine/placebo
      administration.

      This trial is designed to test for superiority in disease free survival (DFS) of propofol
      (total intravenous anaehesia -TIVA) over sevoflurane (inhalational volatile anaesthesia) and
      intravenous lidocaine over placebo in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal or non small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The combination of two cancer types will help address the need to
      demonstrate the effects of anaesthetic technique across cancers to inform generalisable
      anaesthesia guidelines. Both NSCLC and colorectal cancer are important for this study due to
      high incidence rate, many longer-term survivors, and importantly the high risk of local or
      distant recurrence despite complete surgical resection. In addition, the study will collect
      additional data in a nested cohort related to the exploratory objectives.

      The study aims to recruit 5,736 patients in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States and
      Europe.
