      I. To examine the effects of 20 hertz (Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) on delay discounting rates and multiple measures of self-regulation and walking.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients participate in a home-based exercise program of at least 10,000 steps per
      day (about 30 minutes of daily exercise) for 5 days weekly (150 minutes per week) for 12
      weeks. Patients also undergo repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over 1 hour for 8
      sessions during the first 2 weeks of the walking program.

      GROUP II: Patients participate in a home-based exercise program of at least 10,000 steps per
      day (about 30 minutes of daily exercise) for 5 days weekly (150 minutes per week) for 12
      weeks. Patients also undergo sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over 1 hour
      for 8 sessions during the first 2 weeks of the walking program.
