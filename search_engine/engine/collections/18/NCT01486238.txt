    
      This is a 24 week clinical study which will be double-masked. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned 2:1 to Macugen® every 4 weeks (IVMac q4 arm) or Macugen® every 6 weeks (IVMac q6
      arm). If both eyes are eligible, then one eye will be randomized into the trial. Fellow eyes
      of patients with two eligible eyes will be monitored and treated with standard clinical care.
      If sufficient fellow eyes are treated, this will provide an internal control group for direct
      comparison of the Macugen® treated study eyes versus the fellow eyes. Both study eyes and
      fellow eyes will be assessed in the same fashion at every time point during this study.

      Each site is to have at least one Unmasked investigator to perform the study injections and
      one Masked investigator to perform study evaluations and assess adverse events. Roles cannot
      be reversed after study treatment for a given subject has begun.

      Patients assigned to IVMac q4 will receive a total of 6 intravitreal Macugen® injections
      administered at 4 week intervals beginning on Day 0 and ending at Week 20. Patients assigned
      to IVMac q6 will receive a total of 4 intravitreal Macugen® injections administered at 6 week
      intervals beginning on Day 0 and ending at Week 18. Each Macugen® injection will be
      administered as described in the package insert.
