    
      Two active interventions are being studied and compared against placebo. Participants will
      therefore be randomized to one of six possible sequences. Washout periods will be 1 week.

      Effects of interventions on outcomes will be assessed using mixed effect model analyses: we
      will quantify the effect of active treatment 1 (referenced to placebo), the effect of active
      treatment 2 (referenced to placebo), adjusting for effects of time (period number), carryover
      effects, and baseline values (fixed effects). Participants are considered random effects.

      Primary outcome is based on significance of active intervention 1 versus placebo.
