      lead to the emergence of mental symptoms such as stress, anxiety, insomniaâ€¦ The French
      COCONEL study during the COVID pandemic have shown the major psychological impact of this
      crisis on the population, leading to stress and fears.

      Stressful life events are well-known factors of chronic inflammatory rheumatisms set-up or
      flare. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the psychological impact of COVID-19
      pandemic on chronic inflammatory rheumatism (CIR) affected patients.

      A case-control prospective multicentric study will be performed on 212 CIR patients versus
      106 controls to compare the stress level in each group. Patient reported outcomes will be
      evaluated, using electronic questionnaires, as well as classical clinical informations on CIR
      evolution during a 6-months follow-up period. An ancillary study on 100 patients will also be
      realized to quantify cytokine serum levels and determinate transcriptomic profiles.
