      early stages of the disease, as a modest antiparkinsonian symptomatic treatment. This
      treatment is usually maintained for no more than the first few months of management, before
      resorting to drugs deemed more effective as dopamine agonists and l√©vo-DOPA (L-DOPA). A more
      modern use of the drug is at a more advanced stage of PD when dyskinesia are already
      established and become disabling for the patients. There is no data between these two
      extremes of life stages of Parkinsonism. However, the mechanisms of action of amantadine and
      the pathophysiology of the motor complications induced by L-DOPA, in particular dyskinesia
      suggest that the early and prolonged use of amantadine in the early years of management,
      before L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia have already emerged, should have a positive impact on
      long-term occurrence and fate of these symptoms, possibly through a glutamatergic mechanism
      of brain plasticity-of the "disease modification" type.

      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that early introduction of treatment with
      amantadine (200 mg / d) in the early years of therapeutic care, that is to say during the
      "honeymoon" of levodopa (early phase of disease <3 years of diagnosis <1 year of L-dopa and
      lack of complications of levodopa therapy) decreases the rate of subjects with abnormal
      involuntary dyskinetic movements after 18 months of follow-up.
