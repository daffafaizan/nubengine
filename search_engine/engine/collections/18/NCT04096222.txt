      desmogleins 1 and 3, which are part of the epidermis desmosomes. The first line of treatment
      are corticosteroids with or without the use of adjuvants (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate or
      rituximab). T lymphocytes are responsible for the initiation and maturation of the humoral
      response and the B cell activation required for the production of autoantibodies. In the last
      decade, the Th17 immune response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pemphigus.
      Recently, the existence of tertiary lymphoid organ-like structures within the skin lesions
      was suggested. This structures contain T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and plasma cells; these
      cells interact and create a local microenvironment for the production of autoantibodies. Most
      of the T cells in this structures are T helper CD4+ and express IL-21, and half of them
      produce IL-17.

      In this study the investigators aim to evaluate prospectively the Th17 and T regulatory
      immune response in the lesional skin and serum of active pemphigus subjects that are treated
      with corticosteroids with or without adjuvants. The investigators will study skin and serum
      due to the difference of lymphocytes and cytokines in both tissues. The primary hypothesis
      is: "the subjects who receive corticosteroids with or without adjuvants and who reach a 75%
      of improvement (measured by the pemphigus disease area index) in comparison to the enrollment
      visit will have a decrease in Th17 immune response (IL-23).

      The investigators will use descriptive statistics, association and correlation test of
      hypothesis.
