      intraocular pressure, gonioscope lens and 90D lens with slitlamp exam fundus. A number of eye
      diseases are irreversible at on early stage. Both glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy(DR)are
      frequently asymptomatic until significant, often-irreversible, damage to the vision has
      already occurred. It has been estimated that only 10% of persons in India with glaucoma are
      diagnosed, and the Handan Eye Survey reports that only 10% of persons with diabetes in rural
      areas of China have received diabetic eye care. In order to deliver effective care for DR and
      glaucoma in areas with limited resources, education of patients and interventions to promote
      compliance among patients will both be needed.
