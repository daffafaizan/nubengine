      neuropathy markedly limits the use of oxaliplatin. Many drugs have been tried to decrease the
      development of oxaliplatin induced peripheral neurotoxicity, however, the results remain
      disappointing. This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to
      assess the efficacy of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) for preventing oxaliplatin
      induced neurotoxicity in colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based adjuvant
      chemotherapy.
