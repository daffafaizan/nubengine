    
      Rationale: Study to assess the feasibility of real-time automatic cardiac output measurements
      using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)

      Objective: To assess the correlation and feasibility of real-time automatic continuous
      cardiac output measurements using transthoracic ultrasound (TTE) in adult ICU-patients in
      comparison to Flotrac measurements

      Study design: prospective, feasibility study

      Study population: Adult Intensive Care patients ( > 18 years)

      Intervention (if applicable):

      Consecutive adult patients on the ICU in which the there is an indication for continuous
      cardiac output measurements.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

        -  Percentage of patients in which continuous cardiac output can be measured using TTE

        -  Correlation between continuous TTE and Flotrac measurements
