    
      This is a phase I/II open-label study to determine the lowest safe, effective dose of
      budesonide given with calfactant as the vehicle; the investigators will perform an unblinded
      dose escalation study. The investigators will administer four dosing levels of budesonide
      suspended in calfactant beginning with 0.025 mg/kg of budesonide administered to 8 extremely
      low gestational age newborns (ELGANs) who are intubated at 3-10 days of age. Daily doses (at
      the same dosage) will be administered to infants who remain intubated for a potential of 5
      total doses in each patient. Subsequent groups of 8 infants each will receive 0.05 mg/kg,
      0.10 mg/kg, and 0.15 mg/kg of budesonide in calfactant (up to 5 total doses in each patient).
      A total of up to 32 infants will be enrolled in the trial. The investigators will evaluate
      the clinical, laboratory and safety data from each group of treated infants to 28 days of age
      before moving to the next dosing level of budesonide.
