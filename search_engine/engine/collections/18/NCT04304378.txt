      PTSD. The high levels of psychological distress are linked directly to the report of remote
      and more recent trauma exposures, the most notable of which is the agrarian political regime
      of the Khmer Rouge during the 1970s, which occurred in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.
      During this period, approximately 1.5 million Cambodian residents died of starvation and
      sickness, 500,000 individuals were executed, and another two million were displaced over the
      course of several years. Political stability took shape in the early 1990s after the
      enactment of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. However, the prior
      violence undermined an already fragile healthcare system, including mental health
      institutions and physicians providing direct patient care.

      The combination of high trauma exposure, sustained conflict, and limited psychiatric capacity
      has created heightened vulnerability for Cambodians, and the need to assist those struggling
      with PTSD. There is a pressing need to reverse this trajectory using novel approaches to
      address mental health needs that are effective and scalable, providing a strong basis to
      conduct the proposed work in Cambodia. In partnership with the Cambodian Department of Mental
      Health and Substance Abuse, Ministry of Health, this NIH-sponsored study will examine the
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy integrating BA into trauma treatment
      that is being delivered by the Mekong Project in Cambodia.
