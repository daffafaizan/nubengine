      disease and cancer, have been regarded as the fall high-risk patients. These patients are
      considered to be at risk for sarcopenia due to decreased exercise, nutritional status, and
      other reasons. Sarcopenia can be diagnosed and intervened effectively to delay the vicious
      cycle of health. Past studies have pointed out that in addition to drug intervention,
      treatment for sarcopenia must be accompanied by appropriate exercise and nutritional
      intervention (such as protein supplements, vitamin D) in order to achieve the best prevention
      and treatment.
