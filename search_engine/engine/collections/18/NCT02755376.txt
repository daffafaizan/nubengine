           injury using stem cell.

        2. Subject: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury 30 patients

             -  ACL reconstruction: 10

             -  ACL reconstruction + Human cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells and hyaluronic
                acid (Cartistem (TM)): 10

             -  ACL reconstruction + hyaluronic acid: 10

        3. Hypothesis: Human Cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells can enhance healing between
           bone tunnel and graft in ACL reconstruction.
