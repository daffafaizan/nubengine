      overweight and obese adult males. Serum levels of CRP, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 are measured prior
      to the challenge meal and at various times (1,2,4,8, and 12 hours) after the challenge meal.
      The challenge meal is given once without intervention and once after 5 daily doses of
      concentrated black-raspberry powder mixed in water.
