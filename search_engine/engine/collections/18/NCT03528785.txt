    
      This is a study to determine the proportion of patients affected by resectable pancreatic
      cancer who achieve R0 resection after a perioperative 6-cycle chemotherapy, 3 pre- and 3
      post-surgery, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients in the program will be identified by a unique identifier number assigned
      sequentially.

      Patients will receive a treatment scheme of nal-IRI, oxaliplatin, Levofolinic Acid and
      5-fluorouracil (5 -FU) on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28 day cycles.

      C1D1 is a fixed day, C1D15 and Day 1 and Day 15 of all subsequent cycles should be performed
      with a window of Â± 2 days.

      Patients achieving stable disease or better will undergo pancreatectomy 4-8 weeks after
      completion of first 3 courses of treatment. Within 4-8 weeks following pancreatectomy,
      patients will receive an additional 3 cycles of nal-IRI, oxaliplatin, Levofolinic Acid and
      5-fluorouracil (5 -FU) treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Tumor responses will be assessed after 3 cycles of preoperative treatment and after 3 cycles
      of postoperative treatment or sooner if the treating physician suspects disease progression
      based on clinical signs and symptoms. All treatment decisions will be based on the local
      radiologist and/or treating physician assessment of disease status.
