    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new chemotherapy schedule using biweekly
      combination of paclitaxel (Taxol®), gemcitabine (Gemzar®) and Avastin would help to lessen
      in-between-cycle growth of resistant cells and to evaluate the toxicity of this therapy.

      Taxol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in metastatic breast and
      metastatic ovarian cancer but its use in this study is investigational. Gemzar is FDA
      approved for the use in breast, lung and pancreatic cancer but its use in this study is
      investigational.

      The Avastin being given in this study is commercially available, however, it has not been
      approved by FDA for use in metastatic breast cancer.
