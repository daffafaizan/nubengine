      increased media attention towards these activities has also raised the profile of altitude
      related illness. The most effective preventive measure for acute mountain sickness
      (AMS)-gradual ascent-is frequently difficult or impractical for modern international travel
      to locations such as Lhasa in Tibet (3650 m) and La Paz in Bolivia (3740 m). In order to
      solve this problem, prophylactic acetazolamide was most commonly used. But prescription
      needed and side effects such as paresthesia and nausea are the disadvantage of using
      acetazolamide. Some over-the-counter herbal supplements with essentially no adverse effect
      were widely used, such as Rhodiola species. Rhodiola crenulata are widely used to prevent AMS
      in Himalayan areas and Lhasa in Tibet but none was examined by human study. The investigators
      conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study to investigate the
      efficacy of Rhodiola crenulata in preventing AMS.
