      the successful development of IVF. The "long" GnRH agonist protocol, also known as the gold
      standard, has been widely used with considerable success. More recently, on the other hand,
      GnRH antagonist provide a new promising approach for endogenous gonadotrophin suppression by
      blocking the GnRH receptor. There is conflicting data in the literature regarding the
      relative merits of the two ovarian stimulation protocols.

      COMPARISON: Pregnancy rates and embryological data will by assessed in IVF patients treated
      with either the "long" GnRH agonist (Arvekap) or the flexible GnRH antagonist (Ganirelix)
      protocol.
