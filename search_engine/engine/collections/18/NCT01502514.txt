      assess the safety and cardiovascular effects of Adipose-derived Stem Cell (ASC) implantation
      using a catheter delivery system in patients who have experienced myocardial infarction. A
      percutaneous transluminal endomyocardial injection catheter will be used for delivery of
      ASCs. The therapy is composed of cells isolated from a patient's own adipose tissue.
      Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent
      processing to isolate the stem cells.
