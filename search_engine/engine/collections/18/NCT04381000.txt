      will be included in the study. They will complete some questions about anxiety, depression,
      sleep, nutrition, quality of life, pain behavior and characteristics, illness perceptions,
      functioning and daily routine. Questionnaires will be completed twice (first and last week of
      quarantine, 40 days of duration). A group of patients will follow an exercise program during
      this time. It will be evaluated the link between the question of physical and psychological
      factors in the experience of pain in quarantine situation and, also, it will examine whether
      a telerehabilitation exercise program is effective during the lockdown period.
