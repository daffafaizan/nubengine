      of illness. Patients with CHF have diminished health-related quality of life, and due to the
      high demand associated with their everyday activities and self-management, there is
      consequently a burden upon family caregivers. Though exercise is a component of clinical
      practice guidelines for the management of CHF, previous studies have not examined the
      interrelationships among changes in exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQL)
      and important predictor variables such as self-efficacy, as a result of exercise training in
      CHF patients. Furthermore, research to date has failed to examine whether a hospital-based or
      a home-based approach to exercise is the best-suited strategy for long-term adoption and
      benefit from exercise training. Thus, the most important effective approach to, and
      environment for, exercise training to improve the health and self-management of CHF patients
      has not yet been determined. This study will address some important gaps in the existing
      literature related to the benefits of exercise in CHF, specifically how different exercise
      approaches and strategies contribute to an individual's HRQL and self-efficacy.

      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial using a two-group, repeated measures
      design. Male and female patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class
      I-III CHF will be eligible to participate. Participants will be randomized to receive either
      supervised, hospital-based exercise or monitored home-based exercise. The participants in the
      study will train for a period of six months and will be reassessed six months following
      completion of the intervention to assess sustainability of any observed changes.
