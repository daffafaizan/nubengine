      population of COPD patients. OMT was defined as the therapeutic application of manually
      guided forces by an osteopathic practitioner to improve physiologic function and/or support
      homeostasis that has been altered by somatic dysfunction. Concerning the respiratory system,
      osteopathy considers a model that describes the interdependent functions among five body
      components as follows: 1: the inherent motility of the brain and spinal cord; 2: fluctuation
      of the cerebrospinal fluid; 3: mobility of the intracranial and intraspinal membranes; 4:
      articular mobility of the cranial bones; 5: the involuntary mobility of the sacrum between
      the ilia. This model is the so called primary respiratory mechanism.
