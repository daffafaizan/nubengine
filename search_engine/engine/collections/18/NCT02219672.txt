      infection phase would be allocated to two arms, and treated with the antiretroviral drugs
      (Tenofovir plus lamivudine plus Lopinavir / ritonavir plus raltegravir). Six months later, 12
      patients will be treated with Triplitode, in order to observe the impact of of Triptolide
      wilfordii on HIV-1 reservoir of patients in acute infection phase. All patients should be
      explored for 18 months in terms of the clinical features, drugs side-effects, and
      immunological and viral response, and the HIV-1 reservoir. We hypothesis that Triptolide
      wilfordii might further reduce the HIV-1 reservoir. The result would provide proofs for
      further practical antiviral therapy for patients in acute infection phase in China or other
      resource limited countries.
