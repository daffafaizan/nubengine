      influence on clinical symptoms may need to take into account the effect of the female urinary
      microbiome (FUM) on a patient's response to treatment. Compared to asymptomatic patients,
      several bacterial species are more common in patients with overactive bladder.

      Currently, physicians have limited ability to personalize a patient's urinary urgency
      incontinence treatment and, consequently, the prescribed medication may provide minimal
      symptom relief. Since the FUM can be assessed prior to treatment, this study proposes to
      determine if baseline FUM assessment can provide insight into future symptom relief with
      mirabegron treatment.
