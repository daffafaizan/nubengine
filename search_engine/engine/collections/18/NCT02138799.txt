    
      The study consists of 2 randomized treatment arms. In both arms the subjects receive a single
      oral dose of enzalutamide.

      In Arm 1 the subjects are admitted to the clinic on Day -1 where they remain until Day 3.
      Each subject receives a single oral dose of enzalutamide, administered under fasted
      conditions on Day 1. Ambulant visits take place from Day 4 to Day 50. Full PK profiles are
      obtained for enzalutamide, Major Inactive Carboxylic Acid Metabolite (M1) and Active
      Metabolite N-desmethyl Enzalutamide (M2) from Day 1 up to Day 50 after intake of
      enzalutamide.

      In Arm 2 each subject receives a once-daily dose of rifampin on Days 1 to 21. On Day 8, a
      single oral dose of enzalutamide is administered under fasted conditions concomitantly with
      rifampin. Full PK profiles are obtained for enzalutamide, M1 and M2 from Day 8 up to Day 57
      after intake of enzalutamide.

      An End of Study Visit (ESV) takes place between 7 and 10 days after the last PK sample or
      early withdrawal.

      Safety assessments are performed throughout the study.
