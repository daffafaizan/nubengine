      intervention that facilitates mother-child emotional connectedness and co-regulation. Many
      current interventions aim at helping the child to self-regulate with or without the mother's
      help. However, according to the investigators' Calming Cycle Theory, the ability of the
      mother-child dyad to promote optimal development is dependent on the dyad's ability to
      co-regulate. The interactive co-regulation between the mother and the child shapes the
      behavior of both. This study aims to investigate the short and long term effects of FNI in a
      multiple family group setting for preschool aged children to prevent and/or treat
      developmental/behavioral problems.

      Previously, FNI implemented in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for premature infants
      and their mothers at Columbia University Medical Center demonstrated that FNI positively
      alters neurodevelopment of premature infants. Infants who received FNI in the NICU
      demonstrated increased brain activity in the prefrontal cortex at term age, improved
      cognitive and language development at 18 months as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant
      Development, improved behavior on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and reduced risk for
      autism as indicated by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) at 18 months.
      The pilot study of FNI with preschool aged children and their mothers shows a 40% reduction
      in behavioral problems on the CBCL. Accordingly, the investigators hypothesize that the
      Family Nurture Intervention will alter physiological regulatory capacities and will result in
      improved indices of mother-child emotional connection and other outcomes in the preschool
      population similar to the results in the preterm population.
