      development from Shin-Kong Ho-Su Memorial Hospital as controls. Information obtained from the
      interview included socioeconomic and basic demographic characteristics as well as children
      function, health condition, and quality of life. On the other hand, blood and urine samples
      of the participants were collected for the analysis of arsenic methylation related enzymes
      using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. 2 ml blood were
      digested for the determination of mercury, lead and arsenic. The relationship between arsenic
      methylation and blood metals in children with developmental delays and its correlation with
      health related quality of were analyzed.
