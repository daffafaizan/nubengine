      one group with IDD (with different ethiology), another one with Down Syndrome and the third
      with typical development. Ages range from 22 to 31 years-old (Average=26,5; St.
      Deviation=3,76), 6 were females and 9 males. All adults with IDD were all institutionalized
      at an Occupation Activities Centre of an institution and adults without ID were selected by
      convenience, with ages comprised within the selected range. All groups were compared through
      both evaluation instruments: the Portuguese version of Adaptive Behavior Scale (PABS) and
      Bruininks-Oseretsky Motor Proficiency Test (BOT-2). Both tests were applied according to
      original protocols. Ethics requisites were fulfilled. After the initial assessment, a
      Psychomotor Intervention Program was designed specifically for participants with IDD. This
      program integrated individual and group sessions during 3 months, and the main goals of the
      program were related to motor coordination (balance, manual dexterity and coordination,
      global and fine praxis), economic and professional activities, academic and verbal skills.
