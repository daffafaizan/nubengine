        -  Flocked eSwab (Copan, Italy) of the oropharynx

        -  Flocked nasopharyngeal eSwab (Copan, Italy) of the nasopharynx

        -  Dry flocked nasopharyngeal Swab, placed in lysis buffer Each swab will be tested for the
           presence of SARS-CoV-2 with an in-house reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (Egene).
