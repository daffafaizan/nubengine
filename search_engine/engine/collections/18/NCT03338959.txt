      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) per institutional standard at the Seattle
      Cancer Care Alliance as an outpatient therapy. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks, up to a maximum
      of three doses, for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily for 5-6 weeks beginning on Day 1 of Week 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days after last dose, 90
      days after last dose, 30 days after post-operative visit (wound care follow-up), and then
      every 12 weeks for up to 1 year, then every 6 months up to 5 years.
