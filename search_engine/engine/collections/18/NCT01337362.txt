      Patients with type 1 diabetes are at risk of severe hypoglycaemia as a severe side effect to
      insulin therapy, in particular subjects who have lost warning of hypoglycaemia (hypoglycaemia
      unawareness). The episodes are associated with impaired quality of life and can lead to
      permanent brain damage and death.

      During hypoglycaemia a low frequent activity can be seen with electroencephalography (EEG) as
      cognitive function declines. Repeated hypoglycaemic episodes result in down regulation of
      counter regulatory and symptomatic responses. It is not known whether a similar phenomenon is
      present for cerebral dysfunction as judged by EEG changes and cognitive function.

      The purpose is to investigate the activity in the brain, the cognitive function, and the skin
      temperature when patients are exposed to repeated hypoglycaemia. The results will show
      whether the response to hypoglycaemia will change after repeated episodes.

      The methods:

      The investigators will recruit two groups of patients: Patients with hypoglycemia awareness
      and patients with hypoglycaemic unawareness.

      The patients are exposed to hypoglycaemia on two concomitant days while the investigators
      record EEG and perform cognitive tests. Skin temperature is assessed by the use of
      thermography. If the patient has hypoglycaemic unawareness a 4 week period follows where the
      glycaemic control is loosened to avoid hypoglycaemia episodes and the patients is then
      exposed to hypoglycaemia again.

      The prospect:

      It is the investigators hope that results can contribute to improved understanding of
      hypoglycaemic EEG changes and skin temperature changes. This could be of potential benefit
      for patients with hypoglycaemic unawareness.
