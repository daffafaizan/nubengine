      years) entered into this randomized, placebo-controlled study. To obtain 50 enrolled
      subjects, screening procedures and inclusion/exclusion criteria were evaluated for 126
      subjects during a variable screening period of up to 21 days. Once enrolled, subjects were
      randomized to either Staccato Loxapine or Staccato placebo.

      Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected beginning on Day 0, pre-dose and
      continuing for 24 hr post dose. Blood samples for the PK analysis of loxapine and its
      metabolites (8-OH loxapine, 7-OH loxapine and amoxapine) were obtained at time 0 (immediately
      before dosing), at 30 sec, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 30, 45 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 hr after dosing.
      Plasma concentrations of loxapine and metabolites were used to estimate the following PK
      parameters for loxapine and its metabolites: area under the plasma concentration time curve
      from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf), AUC from time 0 to time tlast, the last
      quantifiable concentration (AUClast), maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), observed
      time of Cmax (tmax), terminal phase elimination rate constant (ke), apparent terminal
      elimination half life calculated from ke (TÂ½ ), apparent total body clearance / fraction
      absorbed calculated from AUCinf and dose (CL/F) (for loxapine and the metabolites where
      permitted by measurable concentrations).

      Safety was evaluated by the incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory testing (blood
      chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), physical examination, vital signs, pulse oximetry,
      postural vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, continuous 12-lead
      Holter monitoring, sedation assessments, akathisia assessments.
