      Niantic. Making use of GPS and the camera of compatible devices, the game allows players to
      capture virtual creatures, called Pokemon, who appear on cellphone screens as though in the
      real world. In order to search and capture the Pokemon, the players needs to go out and
      become more active. For this reason, the game has great potential to promote physical
      activity. Nevertheless, there has no study evaluating the potential impact of Pokemon Go on
      physical activity. The investigator proposes a retrospective online survey. Participants are
      instructed to enter data of their daily physical activity as reported in iPhone Health App.
      Number of "Steps" and % greater than 10,000 steps/day will be compared before and after
      installing the Pokemon Go app.
