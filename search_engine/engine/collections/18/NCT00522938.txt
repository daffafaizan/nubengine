      Maximum tolerated dose will be determined during Cycle 1. Tumor assessments will be made
      after Cycle 2 (56 days), although it is not mandatory for Phase A patients to have measurable
      disease. Patients who have satisfactory outcomes after Cycle 2 may continue treatment for up
      to a year with erlotinib 150 mg/day, and the dose of CHR-2797 they received in Study Phase A.

      Study Phase B:

      Patients will be treated with the dose of CHR-2797 selected in Study Phase A and 150mg/day
      erlotinib. Patients will receive 2 cycles of treatment (56 days) before efficacy assessment.
      Patients who have complete response, partial response, or stable disease are eligible to
      continue the study for up to a year until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If a
      patient has complete response, partial response, or stable disease at the end of the 1-year
      study period and the Investigator believes that continuation treatment would be beneficial,
      the patient may continue to be treated at the dose of CHR-2797 under a separate protocol.
