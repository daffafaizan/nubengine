      I. Demonstrate the efficacy of the DVD intervention to a) increase patients' knowledge of
      their legal rights in the workplace, b) improve patient perceptions of workplace
      communication about the impact of cancer treatment and ongoing surveillance, and c) increase
      the number of requested and received workplace accommodations.

      II. Compare employment status (employed vs non-employed) between the treatment and control
      arms.

      III. Compare weekly hours of work between the treatment and control arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive a DVD containing educational information about patients' legal rights
      in the workplace and communication skills demonstrated through four scenarios depicting a
      variety of employer-employee communication challenges for patients, provided by the Legal
      Information Network for Cancer (LINC) group.

      Arm II: Patients receive information about the LINC group

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4, 12, and 52 weeks.
