      Forty subjects with DSM-IV trichotillomania will receive 8 weeks of double-blind Naltrexone
      or placebo. The hypothesis to be tested is that Naltrexone will be effective and well
      tolerated in patients with trichotillomania compared to placebo. The proposed study will
      provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly
      effective treatment.
