      metabolites, after a regimen of 1.8 mg over two hours. After a fast of at least 10 hours,
      fifteen healthy non-smoking, non-obese, non-pregnant adult volunteers between the ages of 18
      and 55 will be given colchicine 1.2 mg (2 x 0.6 mg) orally followed by an additional single
      0.6mg dose one hour later. Fasting will continue for 4 hours after the first dose at which
      time a standardized meal will be served. Blood will be drawn from all participants at times
      sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of colchicine and its 3 major
      metabolites, 2, 3 and 10 demethylcolchicine. A further goal of this study is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers. To this end, subjects will be
      monitored throughout participation in the study for adverse reactions to the study drug
      and/or procedures. Seated and standing blood pressure and pulse will be measured prior to the
      first dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 12 hours post-dose. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms will be
      obtained at the same time points. All adverse events whether elicited by query, spontaneously
      reported, or observed by clinic staff will be evaluated by the Investigator and reported in
      the subject's case report form.
