    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pathologic response rate (>= 95% necrosis) after preoperative treatment
      with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate), epirubicin (epirubicin hydrochloride), ifosfamide, and
      hypofractionated radiation for high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or body
      wall.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further characterize the safety of sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy, including wound
      complication rate.

      II. To estimate time-to-event rates, including overall survival, overall disease-free
      survival, distant disease-free survival, and local disease-free survival in patients with
      high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or body wall treated with preoperative
      sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy and postoperative sorafenib plus chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-71 and 85-155,
      epirubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes, and ifosfamide IV over 90
      minutes on days 15-17, 36-38 (ifosfamide only), 57-59, 99-101, 120-122, and 141-143. Patients
      undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) on days 36-45 and surgical resection on day
      78. Patients with positive margins, undergo EBRT boost on days 91-98.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for 2 years.
