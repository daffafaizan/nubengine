      prescribing is not always inappropriate but does require regular review to ensure that the
      balance of risk and benefit in individuals is appropriate. High risk prescribing is common
      and varies widely between practices, and there is evidence that intensive interventions (for
      example, pharmacist led medication review) can reduce rates of high risk prescribing. The aim
      of this study is to test whether a simpler and therefore cheaper feedback intervention can
      reduce high risk prescribing. The study is a three arm cluster randomised trial with primary
      care medical practices as the unit of randomisation and outcomes measured at patient level
      using routinely held prescribing for individual patients. The trial will compare two forms of
      feedback of practice rates of high risk prescribing with usual care. Usual care matches
      existing NHS working practice. The first active arm will receive quarterly feedback. The
      second active arm will receive the same feedback plus a health psychology informed
      intervention designed to promote response to feedback embedded in the feedback.
