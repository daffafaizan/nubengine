    
      This study will be conducted as a phase I/II clinical trial. In addition to determining the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydralazine, the phase I trial will be performed to identify
      unexpected toxicities that may occur when hydralazine is used in conjunction with neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in normotensive patients with rectal cancer. Once the phase I trial is
      successfully completed, the phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of hydralazine in
      producing a demethylation effect will begin.

      This phase I/II trial will require between 31 to 47 patients to complete.

      â€¢ Phase I Study

      The objective of this study is to determine the MTD for Hydralazine added to standard
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable recta cancer. Four dose levels of hydralazine are
      planned:

      Dose Level 1: 150 mg/d 50 mg PO TID Dose Level 2: 200 mg/d 50 mg PO QID Dose Level 3: 225
      mg/d 75 mg PO TID
