      the Laboratory of Immunology at MIGAL Galilee Research Institute, Kiryat Shmona (MIGAL) and
      Breinin Center for Type 1 Diabetes and Endocrinology at the Ziv Medical Center in Safed
      (Ziv). In this study we will first identify carriers of the HLA-A0201 allele among pediatric
      and young adult T1D patients at Ziv. We will then screen the T cell pool in the peripheral
      blood samples of these patients for CD8 T cells reactive against any of 3 known
      HLA-A0201-binding peptides associated with autoreactivity in T1D: Insulin beta chain 10-18,
      IGRP 265-73 and IGRP 222-230. The influenza virus-derived peptide MP 58-66 will serve as
      reference. Next we will isolate polyclonal CD8 T cells from blood samples of the same
      patients, activate and expand them ex-vivo and transfect them via electroporation with
      in-vitro-transcribed mRNA encoding the respective peptide/MHC/CD3-zeta construct(s). We will
      then perform co-culture experiments assessing the ability of the mRNA-transfected T cells to
      kill the autoreactive T cells of the same patient in a peptide-selective manner.
