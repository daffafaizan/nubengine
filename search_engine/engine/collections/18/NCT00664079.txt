      mechanical ventilation have thyroid hormone alterations. We will measure TSH, tT3, fT3, rT3,
      tT4, fT4, adn tyrosine concentrations in critically ill children with hypotension and/or
      respiratory failure and correlate thyroid hormone alterations to severity of illness,
      intensity of therapeutic interventions, and associated morbidity and mortality by using
      clinical outcomes parameters.
