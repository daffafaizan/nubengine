      for disease assessment of their cancer. In cases of hematological malignancies, bone marrow
      aspiration & biopsy are routinely performed.

      As part of this project, the following will be done to the samples collected and with
      clinical outcomes data:

        -  donate peripheral blood specimens whenever blood is already being drawn for clinical
           purposes.

        -  donate bone marrow aspiration samples whenever a bone marrow aspiration procedure is
           already being done for clinical purposes.

        -  donate saliva whenever blood draw is already being done for clinical purposes.

        -  allow the investigators to perform gene mutation profiling.

        -  allow the investigators to study gene mutation results.

        -  allow the investigators to perform pharmacogenetic profiling.

        -  allow the investigators to study pharmacogenetic profiles.

        -  allow the investigators to examine chromosome copy number variations.

        -  allow the investigators to examine genomic methylation.

        -  allow the investigators to quantify metabolomics/cytokines.
