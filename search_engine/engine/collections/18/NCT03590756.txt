      resistant starches. Although a role of mangoes in skin health has long been advocated in
      traditional medicine, little scientific research has been conducted.

      We hypothesize that 85g (0.5 cups) of mango intake for 16 weeks will have minimal impact on
      skin health, while 250g (1.5 cups) of mango intake will produce significant benefits.
