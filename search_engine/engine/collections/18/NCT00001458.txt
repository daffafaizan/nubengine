      mechanisms, pathogenesis and treatment of diseases. Clinical research has evolved into an
      increasingly narrow focus on specific diseases and disease presentations in select subgroups
      of patients. It is desirable and consistent with Clinical Center policy, for clinical
      investigators to maintain exposure to a more broad spectrum of disease and disease
      presentations than mandated by the clinical research protocols in order to preserve clinical
      skills of physician and nursing staff, ensure adequate training of clinical research fellows,
      and stimulate ideas for future clinical research. This protocol permits evaluation and
      treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases who do not fulfill eligibility criteria
      for participation in existing clinical research protocols, but who are of medical interest
      for the purpose of training professional staff.
