      showed varying outcomes of this conventional sedation for maintained sedation. Propofol is
      increasing used for sedation in gastrointestinal procedure owing to its rapid recovery
      profiles but the complications associated with propofol are not negligible.The investigators
      prospectively compare the efficacy, induction time, recovery time, patient satisfaction and
      side effect between propofol based and conventional sedations in patients undergoing ERCP.
