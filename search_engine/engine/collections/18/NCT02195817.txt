    
      635 patients are planned (total number of patients) with 475 patients treated with Selincro®
      (Cohort A) and 160 patients not treated with Selincro® (Cohort B) to determine the reduction
      in alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol dependence.

      Cohort A will comprise patients who maintain a high drinking risk level (DRL, defined by
      World Health Organization (WHO) as >60g alcohol/day for a man or >40g alcohol/day for a
      woman), or above, in the period between the Screening and Inclusion Visits.

      Cohort B will comprise patients who reduce their alcohol consumption in the period between
      the Screening and Inclusion visits, that is, patients who do not maintain at least a high DRL
      at the Inclusion Visit (and are therefore not eligible for treatment with nalmefene according
      to the SmPC).
