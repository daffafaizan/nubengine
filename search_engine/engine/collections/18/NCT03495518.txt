      age and who can understand English, and who are expected to be in hospital or in clinic daily
      for 5 days.

      SPARK RCT will be a pilot multi-center RCT in which we will randomize children to either
      undergo daily symptom screening for 5 days with symptom reports provided to the healthcare
      team or standard of care. Feasibility will be met if at least 30 participants are enrolled
      within one year and at least 75% complete at least 60% of evaluations.

      Quality of the Idea Children receiving cancer treatment have excellent survival outcomes, in
      part, related to the provision of intensive therapies. Unfortunately, most children suffer
      and experience severe and bothersome treatment-related symptoms. Symptoms not only impact on
      QoL and morbidity but, in addition, may negatively influence future psychosocial functioning.

      Symptoms remain unaddressed even during healthcare encounters because children do not
      complain and clinicians fail to ask about them. We recently developed SSPedi, a
      pediatric-specific symptom screening tool on an iPad. SSPedi, however, consists only of the
      questions which ask about symptoms. SPARK is the web-based application which will facilitate
      access to SSPedi, encourage symptom screening, generate reports and allow children to track
      their symptoms. Careful thought to design is required to ensure SPARK optimizes future use
      and has clinical utility. The proposed project output is a product that facilitates
      longitudinal symptom screening and provides the groundwork for a future RCT of symptom
      feedback.
