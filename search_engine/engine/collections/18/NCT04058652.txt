      specifically, individuals who receive the injection of medication in two separate sites. The
      inclusion criteria will be an age of > 18 years old, a diagnosis of psoriasis, and currently
      receiving biologic medication injection in two sites during their dermatology clinic visit.

      The first step is to administer the biologic medication in one thigh without the use of TENS
      therapy. This is done to establish a control, or baseline, for how painful the injection
      experience is. The second step involves a study team member applying two to four TENS unit
      pads (made of adhesive gel) to the skin of your thigh approximately two centimeters from the
      site where injection of the biological medication takes place. The device will be turned on
      during the injection of the medication. Medication injection will take place by either the
      patient or nursing staff as it would normally take place without involvement in this study.
      Immediately after both steps, subjects will be given a brief survey to determine their pain
      level.

      The study will be conducted at Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest School of Medicine.
      Data will also be analyzed at Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest School of Medicine.
