      the acute phase. The role of fever in defence against malaria or in other infectious diseases
      remains unclear. However, it has been shown that febrile temperatures inhibit the growth of
      P. falciparum in vitro.

      Antipyretic drugs are commonly and widely used to treat malarial fever in endemic areas.
      There is however a controversy about the benefit of reducing fever in children with malaria.
      Data from Gabon have revealed that neither paracetamol, nor naproxen or metamizol -
      antipyretics often used in this area - had an effect on fever clearance time. Worryingly,
      paracetamol increased parasite-clearance times (i.e. inhibited clearance of parasites) and
      decreased significantly the production of oxygen radicals and tumour necrosis factor (TNF),
      mechanisms of the innate immune response, pivotal to combat infections.

      Another antipyretic drug often used to treat malarial fever in endemic areas is ibuprofen.
      However, the rationale of its use and its capacity of reducing fever due to P. falciparum
      infections has never been proven in this area.

      Comparison: The effect of ibuprofen plus mechanical fever "treatment" (continuous fanning,
      tepid sponging, and cooling blankets) is compared to mechanical treatment alone to treat
      fever in children with malaria.
