      human secretin (ChiRhoClin Inc., Burtonsville, MD) at a dose of 0.2 Âµg/kg will be
      administered while the endoscope is positioned in the second portion of the duodenum. From
      within the duodenum and without cannulation of the papilla of Vater, a 2.3-mm plastic
      aspiration catheter (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) will be passed through the biopsy channel of the
      endoscope until visible on screen in the endoscopic monitor. Once active visible secretion
      via the papilla has begun, the first 10 ml of pancreatic juice will be collected via
      suctioning. This entire process from secretin injection to sample collection takes an average
      of 5 minutes. The sample is then aliquoted into 2 ml ampules, which are snap-frozen in liquid
      nitrogen (or portable rapid-freeze freezer) and freezer-stored until the assays are
      performed. The top 10 candidate markers from discovery and validation on tissue (AUCs >0.95)
      and from pilot pancreatic-juice testing (AUCs >0.9) will be evaluated in this study.
      Following extraction from an equivalent of 0.4 ml pancreatic juice, DNA will be bisulfite
      treated using optimized methods. Then, an assay of aberrant methylation on target genes will
      be conducted using the QuARTS technique. Results will be normalized to either a human DNA
      marker (eg, beta-actin) or a methylated DNA marker identified for normal pancreatic
      epithelium.
