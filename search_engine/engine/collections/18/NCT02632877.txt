      (ketanserin) and the experimental group (PFD+MODD). Demographics data and medical history
      will be registered on a monthly basis, relative ulcer volume will be calculated by measuring
      the longest, widest and deepest ulcer side with sterile flexible graduated ruler. The ulcer
      will be classified according to Wagner scale and photographs will be taken. Ulcer area will
      be washed with aseptic solution (accua aseptic solutionâ„¢) and a biopsy of around 10-15 mm3
      will be taken from the middle of the ulcer using a scalpel blade. Patients in the
      experimental group will receive topical PFD+MODD (8% gel) three times a day and patients in
      control group will receive ketanserin (2% cream) twice a day. Both groups will apply the
      medicament for six months previous cleansing of the area. Biopsies will be taken at the
      beginning, at month one and month two. After this time, only photographs will be performed,
      and relative ulcer volume will be measured. 5 ml of blood will be taken at the beginning and
      the end of the study to measure general clinical parameters.
