      likely to show lymph node involvement at diagnosis, and biologically more aggressive. Women
      with TNBC have a higher rate of distant recurrence at early-stage and a worse 5-year
      prognosis than women of other molecular types. Although PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint
      inhibitors are showing promise to patients with advanced TNBC, however, these targeted
      therapies and immunotherapy for TNBC can not increase the clinical benefits of early-stage
      patients.

      As adjuvant therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma after curative liver resection, a
      multicentre study demonstrated a significant prolongation of RFS and reduced extrahepatic
      recurrence in Huaier group. Retrospective studies have shown that Huaier granules can improve
      the rates of disease-free survival（DFS） and overall survival（OS）, and reduce the incidence of
      adverse events among operable patients with TNBC.

      In this study, 1072 high-risk early-stage triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma
      participants (536 cases in the observation group and 536 cases in the control group) from 30
      research centers will be included. The block randomization was adopted, participants will be
      randomly divided into the experimental group (Huaier granule plus conventional
      treatment/visit) and control group (conventional treatment/visit only). All participants will
      be followed up for 5 years, including 2-year treatment follow-up and 3-year survival
      follow-up. During the treatment period, the participants will be followed up every 3 months,
      and the survival follow-up period will be followed up every 6 months.
