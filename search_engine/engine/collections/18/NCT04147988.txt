      offer to these patients a diagnostic assessment, with questionnaires, ADOS-II, Vineland
      Adaptative Behavior Scale and psychiatric examination. Patients who will show negative scores
      at the detecting questionnaires will not be further assessed, except for 10 out of them, who
      will be drawn by lot. Then the investigators will be able to discuss the feasibility of such
      a procedure with these tools, as well as to describe the clinical profile of adult people
      asking for ans ASD diagnosis.
