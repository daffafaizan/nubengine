    
      This was a randomized, open-label, phase IV strategy trial for participants from
      resource-limited settings (RLS) who presented with advanced HIV disease and no probable or
      confirmed tuberculosis (TB), and who were initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART).

      Participants were randomized to one of two strategy arms: immediate, empiric TB treatment
      (Empiric arm) or local standard of care TB treatment (IPT arm).

      Randomization was balanced by clinical trial unit and stratified according to CD4+ T cell
      count (<25 vs. â‰¥25 cells/mm^3) and presence of any of the following prognostic factors:
      reportable hospitalization within the past 30 days, BMI <18.5 kg/m^2, or anemia (hemoglobin
      <8 g/dl).

      Participants were followed for 96 weeks. Participants attended study visits at screening,
      enrollment, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 48. Signs and symptoms, ART
      modifications, concomitant medications, and clinical events as defined by AIDS Clinical
      Trials Group (ACTG) Appendix 60 were collected at each visit. Blood was collected for CD4 and
      HIV-1 RNA at study entry, weeks 4, 24 and 48, and blood for safety laboratories (liver
      function, hematology, and renal function) was collected at all visits except week 1. A sputum
      sample was collected and stored at study entry. Phone contact was conducted at weeks 60, 72,
      84 and 96 to obtain information about vital status, reportable hospitalization, TB status
      (including screening and follow-up), TB and HIV treatment modifications, and quality of life.
