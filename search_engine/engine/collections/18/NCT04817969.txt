    
      The study design is a prospective, multicenter data collection model of the 510(k) cleared
      Persona Ti-Nidium Total Knee System. The study will require each site to obtain institutional
      review board (IRB) approval prior to study enrollment. All potential study subjects will be
      required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

      All study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their total knee
      arthroplasty. Investigators will collect clinical data for a required 10 years. Follow-up
      clinical visits include Early Post-op, 6 months, 1 year, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years
      post-operatively.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate clinical performance, benefits and safety of the
      Persona Ti-Nidium implant in total knee arthroplasty.

      Specific assessments include:

        1. Confirming the long-term safety, performance and clinical benefits of the Persona
           Ti-Nidium total knee system and instrumentation in primary and revision TKA.

        2. Verifying that, under normal use, the performance and clinical benefits of this device
           and its instrumentation conform to those intended by the manufacturer by recording
           patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs) and radiographic outcomes (if
           available).
