      (WFG) and aberration free ablation in single-step transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy
      (TransPRK) in myopic patients with high pre-existing corneal higher order aberrations (HOAs).

      Background: Corneal WFG and aberration free treatments have been proposed as methods to
      achieve better visual, refractive, and optical outcomes.

      Methods: prospective case series was conducted in El-Hekma Eye-LASIK center, Menoufia
      governorate, Egypt during the period from January 2017 to December 2017. TransPRK was
      performed to eligible myopic patients with or without astigmatism with corneal HOAs ≥ 0.35 µ
      utilizing either aberration free or corneal WFG patterns provided by ORKCAM software (SCHWIND
      eye-tech-solutions, Kleinostheim, Germany). Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA),
      manifest and cycloplegic refractions, best spectacle corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA),
      thorough slit lamp examination and corneal topography were assessed and repeated six months
      postoperatively.
