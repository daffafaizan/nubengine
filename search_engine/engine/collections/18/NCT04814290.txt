      clinical, laboratory, and radiological parameters and long-term health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL) in 237 living liver donors and 239 matched controls during 48 to 168 months of
      postdonation follow-up.

      We used the 36-item short-form health survey (short form-36 health survey, version 1
      [SF-36]). The scores for the 4 following subscales were higher in nondonors than in donors:
      physical functioning (P = 0.009), role limitations due to physical health (P = 0.002),
      energy/fatigue (P < 0.001), and bodily pain (P < 0.001). The scores on the 8 subscales of the
      SF-36 were higher in donors with living recipients than in donors whose recipients died (P <
      0.001). Our results suggest that living donor right hepatectomy is safe and results in a
      postdonation HRQoL similar to that of nondonors in those donors whose recipients are healthy,
      while donors whose recipients die have a lower HRQoL that is significantly negatively
      correlated with the time since recipient death and improves over time.
