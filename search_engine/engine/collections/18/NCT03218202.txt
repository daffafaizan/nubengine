      months using imaging (including MRI/intestinal ultrasound) and biochemical analyses
      (including CRP/calprotectin). Patient's with symptomatic or asymptomatic ulcerative colitis
      related strictures will be followed similarly. Risk factors for progression of strictures and
      development of symptoms will be identified.
