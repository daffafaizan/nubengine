      multiple sclerosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis are reported to have more difficulty
      recognising negative emotions, especially anger and fear.

      In this context, RECODE study has a twofold objective:

        -  To determine whether the positive emotions recognition remains preserved by combining
           behavioural and neurophysiological measures (electrodermal activity).

        -  To study this disorder's etiology through a comparison between a multiple sclerosis
           patient group and a control group (matched in sex, age, and education's level).
