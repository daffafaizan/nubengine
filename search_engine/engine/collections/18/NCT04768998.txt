      together and in interaction with other components of the National Research Network of
      University Medicine on COVID-19 (NUM), provides the essential basis for the successful
      understanding and thus combating pandemics using the example of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19). NAPKON represents a sustainable, integrative and comprehensive concept that
      provides benefits for society as a whole in defending against and coping with pandemics,
      especially at the level of public health care, in hospital and patient management and from
      the individual patient's perspective.

      The intersectoral platform records data and biomaterial of severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients through a network of university clinics,
      hospitals at all levels of care, general practitioners and specialist practices with
      appropriate study experience and infrastructure. The longitudinal phenotyping programme
      tracks patients for up to one year and collects detailed and harmonized clinical data as well
      as biomaterial. Follow-up data is enriched by patient-reported outcomes (PROM) and
      recruitment is intensified by focusing on hot-spot regions. Mobile study teams are used to
      reach, among others, long-term care and rehabilitation facilities, thus mapping all
      structural elements of the German care network.

      The primary aim of the intersectoral platform is to provide a comprehensive and harmonized
      collection of data and biomaterial for researchers from national consortia, pharmaceutical
      companies and for participation in international research collaborations for the purpose of
      studying COVID-19 disease and future pandemics.
