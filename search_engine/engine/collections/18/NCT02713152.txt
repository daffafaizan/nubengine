    
      Open Angle Glaucoma (OAG) is an eye disease which can lead to irreversible loss of vision
      caused by damage to the optic nerve at the back of the eye. It is often associated with
      raised fluid pressure in the eye and treated by lowering this pressure. However, despite
      treatment, some patients continue to lose vision and it is suspected that other factors are
      contributing to the optic nerve damage. Among them is Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), though
      the link between OAG and OSA is controversial.

      This study aims to determine whether the prevalence of OSA is higher in patients with OAG in
      comparison to people without glaucoma. In addition, it will establish whether OSA is an
      independent risk factor for OAG and whether a future randomised controlled trial assessing
      the impact of OSA treatment with Continues Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) on OAG outcomes
      would be acceptable and feasible in this population. The usefulness of OSA screening tools,
      including oximetry and questionnaires will also be determined. We comprehensively phenotype
      glaucoma patients using novel techniques, which include angiographic ocular coherence
      tomography and retinal oximetry. Ocular perfusion pressure will be calculated based on
      central retinal vein pressure measured by ophthalmodynamometry.

      The study is a collaborative project between sleep specialists at Papworth Hospital and
      ophthalmologists at Hinchingbrooke Hospital and will involve patients attending glaucoma
      clinic and their relatives who will act as a control group. Two study visits will be required
      on consecutive days. Participants will undergo a comprehensive ocular examination and a sleep
      study in the form of respiratory polysomnography (respiratory PSG) at home. A brief medical
      history focused on cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities will be taken.
