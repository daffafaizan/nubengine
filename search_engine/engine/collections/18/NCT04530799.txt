      infections in immunocompromised patients as well as in immunocompetent patients and is
      associated with a high mortality. Antifungal prophylaxis might prevent influenza-associated
      pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) and thus might improve the outcome in patients with severe
      influenza. However, clinical related risk factors should be identified to assess whether a
      patient will benefit from antifungal prophylaxis. This prospective multi-center observational
      study will assess the incidence of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) in ICU
      patients in 12 ICUs in The Netherlands, Belgium and France over 4 influenza seasons. The
      secondary objective of this study is to identify host- and pathogen related risk factors for
      IAPA in EORTC negative ICU patients with severe influenza. Patients aged 18 or older admitted
      to the intensive care unit (ICU) during the inclusion period due severe influenza without
      classic risk factors defined by the EORTC will be included.
