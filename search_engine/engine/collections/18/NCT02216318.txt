      an influence on the production of the sleep hormone (melatonin) and the the circadian rhythm.
      Entrainment of the circadian rhythm to the surroundings is accomplished by light-sensitive
      retinal ganglion cells and these cells are sensitive to blue light.

      Based on previous research, blue light early in the day and abscence of blue light during
      evening is important for the entrainment.

      In this study, lightning conditions in the home of healthy subjects are set to either blue
      enriched or red enriched from 8 a.m to 1. p.m. The lightning condition is based on a
      randomization protocol in a cross-over study for 3 weeks in each condition, separated by a
      one week pause.
