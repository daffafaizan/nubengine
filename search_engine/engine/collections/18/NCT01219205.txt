      after diabetic retinopathy. One of the main reasons for visual loss in BRVO is the
      development of macular edema. Treatment options for BRVO include grid laser treatment,
      intravitreal injection of steroids, surgical procedures, and off-label treatment with
      intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. During recent years,
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment with bevacizumab has been shown to efficiently reduce
      macular edema and improve visual acuity in numerous case series and prospective or
      retrospective studies.
