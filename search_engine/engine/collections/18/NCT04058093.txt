      and a waiting list control group. Here, the investigators aim to test the feasibility and
      effectiveness of a 6-months functional training program in sedentary users of PDHC. The
      recruitment of participants will be held in PDHC by health professionals (e.g., family
      medicine doctors, nurses, nutritionists, psychologists, etc). Participants will be allocated
      into two groups (experimental and waiting list control groups). After signed informed consent
      and baseline measures, experimental group will conduct a 6-months functional training program
      (FTP), which comprises functional training sessions and group nutrition counseling. In every
      session, it will be evaluated the participants' adherence and theirs perceived enjoyment and
      exertion. The other outcomes (primary and secondary) will be analyzed through a face-to-face
      contact, in three different moments: baseline (T0), post-intervention (at month 6, T1) and
      6-month follow-up (at month 12, T2). The control group will not participate in any specific
      intervention, but will receive the FTP after the experimental period. An intention-to-treat
      and per protocol analysis will be performed to analyze intervention effectiveness and
      efficacy.
