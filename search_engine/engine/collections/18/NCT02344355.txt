      followed by radiation combined with temozolomide (a chemotherapy pill you take by mouth).
      After radiation, patients receive additional cycles of temozolomide (adjuvant chemotherapy).

      Participants will:

        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate three times a week during the combined
           radiation and chemotherapy phase

        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate twice a week during adjuvant
           chemotherapy (after radiation)

        -  complete health-related quality of life questionnaires pre-radiation, 4 weeks into
           radiation, 4 weeks after radiation, and then every 3 months. In addition, patients will
           complete neurocognitive testing pre-radiation, 4 weeks into radiation, 4 weeks after
           radiation, and approximately 9 months after initiating radiation therapy.

      The adjuvant chemotherapy portion of this study lasts for 6 months. After that is completed,
      participants will go back to standard therapy for their cancer. Participants will continue to
      have life-long follow-up for this study.
