    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of myo-inositol (inositol), administered for 3 months, on phospho
      (P)-beta (B)-catenin staining in areas of low-grade dysplasia or in areas of prior low grade
      dysplasia in subjects with known colitis-induced low grade dysplasia at baseline.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effect of myo-inositol on regression of dysplasia. II. To examine the
      effect of inositol on p53 and Ki67 staining within remaining dysplasia.

      III. To examine the effect of inositol on epithelial apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3) within
      dysplasia.

      IV. To examine the effect of inositol on reductions in mucosal messenger ribonucleic acid
      (mRNA) levels of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), inducible nitric oxide synthase
      (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Beginning within 14 days after colonoscopy, patients receive inositol orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) on days 1-14 and twice daily (BID) on days 15-90.

      ARM II: Beginning within 14 days after colonoscopy, patients receive placebo PO QD on days
      1-14 and BID on days 15-90.

      After completion of treatment, patients undergo biopsy and colonoscopy with or without
      mucosal resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.
