      some retrospective studies and preclinical studies, TIVA is suggested to be more favorable
      than inhalation anesthesia regarding cancer recurrence and survival after surgery. However,
      to our knowledge, there is no study which investigates the influence of type of anesthesia on
      recurrence of renal cell carcinoma after nephrectomy.
