      Rib fracture repair utilizing open reduction and internal fixation with commercially
      available rib plating systems improves outcomes (i.e., infectious complications), decreases
      hospital stay and mortality.

      Study Design:

      This is a prospective, observational study of 50 patients who, due to their injury pattern,
      are operative candidates for open reduction and internal fixation with commercial available
      rib plating systems for one of the following indications:

        1. Flail chest with/without failure to wean from the ventilator

        2. Significantly displaced rib fractures with/without lung impalement

        3. Symptomatic multiple rib fractures - Failure of pain control

      Outcome measures to be evaluated include:

        1. Hospital Mortality

        2. Ventilator free days

        3. Need for tracheotomy

        4. Infectious Complications (pneumonia, bacteremia, UTI, empyema)

        5. Hospital & ICU Days

        6. Disposition following discharge
