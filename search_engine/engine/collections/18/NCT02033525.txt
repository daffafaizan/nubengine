      assessor pilot study in which 20 patients with degenerative meniscus injury grade 3 (Crues et
      al.) will enter the study with the primary objective of assessing the efficacy of the
      treatment by VAS of pain at 12 month. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy through imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires (IKDC, KOOS, Lysholm and
      SF-36.

      Patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (XCEL-M-ALPHA and standard
      rehabilitation program or standard rehabilitation program alone). Thereafter, patients will
      be followed for 12 months.

      Imaging assessment will be performed by an independent blinded radiologist.
