      test results influenced: selection between standard therapies or a clinical trial; offered
      insight into mid therapy treatment changes; or helped physicians determine what therapy to
      offer patients who do not have a complete pathologic response. Patient demographics,
      diagnosis, type of treatment, surgery and pathologic results will be recorded. Patients will
      be followed for 5 years. Recurrence and survival data will be recorded.

      Participating sites will submit de-identified patient data via electronic case report forms
      (eCRFs) into a secure study website.

      All patients are required to sign an Informed Consent Form. All investigators and staff will
      have Human Subject Protection Training.
