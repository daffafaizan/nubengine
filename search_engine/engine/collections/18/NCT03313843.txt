      objectively and non-invasively by serial OCT measurements of the RNFL and GCL.

      This will be a prospective cross-sectional, non-interventional study; total recruitment will
      be 200 subjects. Recruitment will be stratified to enroll at least 50 subjects currently
      taking Lemtrada and 50 subjects with a documented diagnosis of ON. The study will enroll
      subjects primarily from practices in the Tampa Bay Area and adjacent counties. It is a
      planned non-interventional study; subjects will be followed by their neurologist and the
      study ophthalmologist and will receive standard of care. All subjects will have the
      ophthalmological examination and diagnostic measures, by the Principal Investigator, Dr.
      Grace Levy-Clarke, at Tampa Bay Uveitis Center.

      Study Duration: The study duration will be 24 months, with an interim analysis at 50%
      recruitment status.

      There are two primary aims of this longitudinal observational study:

        1. To determine whether atrophy within specific retinal layers over time is associated with
           clinical neurological progression of MS

        2. To determine whether an ON history affects the relationship described in aim # 1

      Eye Exam: Subject will have an eye exam, including:

      Visual Acuity Testing Color Vision Testing Automated perimetry/Peripheral Vision Testing
      Completing the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI/VFQ) Slit Lamp
      Examination Measurement of Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Dilated Fundus Examination
      (Ophthalmoscopy) Fundus Photography Optical Coherence Tomography: RNFL and Macular OCT

      Neurologic Assessments: Must be performed no more than 60 days prior to screening/assessment
      Day 0 Ophthalmic Assessments
