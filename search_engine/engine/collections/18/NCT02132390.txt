      with standard Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide Followed by Docetaxel (AC-T).

      Chemotherapy begins within 4 weeks after surgery for patients randomized to arm I-IV. Arm I:
      patients who didn't have CIA receive oral toremifene daily. Treatment continues for 5 years
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: patients who had CIA
      receive toremifene as in arm I. Arm III: patients without CIA receive oral toremifene and
      goserelin for ovarian function suppression. Arm IV: patients with CIA receive oral toremifene
      and goserelin for ovarian function suppression. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5
      years and annually thereafter.
