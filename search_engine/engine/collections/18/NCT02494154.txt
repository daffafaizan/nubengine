      of acute respiratory failure. In hospitalised hypoxemic patients, recent clinical evidence
      showed that HFOT can reduce endotracheal intubation and reduce mortality. Physiologically,
      the HFOT causes a decrease in respiratory rate and minute-ventilation and may be associated
      with a decrease in PaCO2. It is possible that these effects are associated with decreased
      work of breathing, which could explain some of the benefits in terms of comfort and
      efficiency.

      The objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of a wash-out of anatomical dead
      space by high flow nasal cannulas on respiratory parameters and on the work of breathing.

      The investigators will evaluate the baseline status with conventional oxygen therapy methods
      (low flows), and then compare it with three different levels of high flow oxygen therapy in a
      randomised order. The primary endpoint will be the work of breathing.
