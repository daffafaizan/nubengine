      part of the study will include two separate groups of participants. Group A will include
      participants who will have cutaneous/subcutaneous tumors injected, and group B will include
      participants who will have visceral tumors injected. The study will consist of the following
      periods: screening, initial treatment period (two 28 day cycles), optional extended treatment
      period (continued 28 day cycles) and a follow up period (safety and survival follow up).
