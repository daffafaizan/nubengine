    
      This is a non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center (conducted in more than one center) study
      to explore response to treatment and safety of flexible dose of paliperidone extended-release
      (ER) in participants with schizophrenia. During the study period, dose of paliperidone ER
      will remain within the range of 3 to 12 milligram per day and will be administered for 12
      months. Both hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants may be included in the study.
      Participants may switch to any effective dose of paliperidone ER from any oral antipsychotic
      medication without dose adjustment or if required, cross-dose adjustment may be done. Maximum
      4 weeks of switching period is allowed. Use of anticholinergic (opposing the actions of the
      acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter) drugs will not be restricted. Response to treatment will
      be evaluated primarily through total Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
