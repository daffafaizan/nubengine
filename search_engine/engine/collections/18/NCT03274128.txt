      Swieradow-Zdroj. The treatment included a comprehensive therapy: radon therapeutic baths and
      inhalations, kinesiotherapy.

      The study group consisted of patients with degenerative joints and disc disease participating
      in therapy. On the day of admission to the SPA the patients were subjected to subjective and
      objective examination. Laboratory tests (lipids profile, CRP, smear blood morphology, TAS-
      total antioxidative potential, metalloproteinase 8) were performed before treatment on day 5
      and after 18 days. In addition, before and after treatment, standard scales were used to
      assess pain intensity: MCGill scale and VAS scale and anxiety and depression levels - HADS
      scale.

      The control group was selected by the spa workers, also suffering from a degenerative disease
      of the movement organs not using the spa's treatment base. In this group also made the same
      study.
