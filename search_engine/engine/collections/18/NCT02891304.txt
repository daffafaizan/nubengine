      demonstrating readiness for independent practice as medical training transitions from an
      apprenticeship model to competency based medical education (CBME). The Accreditation Council
      for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) replaced their long-standing reporting system in 2014
      with the Next Accreditation System (NAS). For Gastroenterology (GI) fellowship programs
      (GIFPs), this includes assessing and documenting competence in basic endoscopic procedures
      [esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)] in a continuous fashion. For colonoscopy, the prior
      minimum threshold of 140 procedures after which competence can be assessed was based on
      surrogates of competence such as cecal intubation rate, with limited assessment of technical
      and cognitive skills required to perform high-quality endoscopic examination. Recent data has
      demonstrated wide variability in trainee learning curves, hence emphasis needs to be shifted
      away from the volume of procedures performed to independent performance of well-defined
      metrics. Tools with comprehensive assessment of motor and cognitive abilities have been
      developed. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) endorsed the assessment
      of competence in endoscopy tool (ACE) designed to help GIFPs facilitate implementation of the
      NAS requirements. While the ACE tool for EGD has yet to be validated, Sedlack and colleagues
      recently validated the ACE tool in colonoscopy. Multicenter prospective data are needed to
      help guide development of CBME that define learning curves in colonoscopy and EGD and
      generate a centralized database which will allow programs to provide individualized feedback
      and follow trainee performance longitudinally throughout training.
