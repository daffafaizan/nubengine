      infections in healthy adults. The investigators will be conducted a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study at the onset of the influenza season. A total of 100 subjects 30-70
      years of age with a history of at least 2 colds in the previous year will be recruited from
      the general population in jeollabuk-do, South Korea. The subjects will be instructed to take
      9 capsules per day of either the Korean red ginseng extract or a placebo for a period of
      12weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the number of Jackson-verified colds. Secondary
      outcome measures will be included symptom severity, total number of days of symptoms and
      duration of all colds. Cold symptoms will be scored by subjects.
