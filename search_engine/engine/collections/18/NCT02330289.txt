      Academic medical centers that employ physicians-in-training may find it particularly
      challenging to reduce low value testing due to a historical emphasis on extensive workups by
      trainees. Despite the increased emphasis on cost-consciousness in medical education, there is
      little existing research evaluating ways to optimize ordering behaviors of
      physicians-in-training. This study will evaluate a normative feedback intervention for
      internal medicine physicians-in-training to reduce overuse of routine laboratory tests for
      hospitalized patients. Physicians-in-training will be cluster-randomized into two arms: (1)
      those who receive report cards (intervention group), (2) those who will not receive report
      cards (control group). We will study the use of routine laboratory tests over a
      pre-intervention period of 1 week and a post-randomization period of 1 week. We will study
      physician attitudes about the real-time feedback dashboard with qualitative assessments in
      focus groups after the completion of the intervention.
