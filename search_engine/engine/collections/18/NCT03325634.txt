      3 fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for abdominopelvic recurrences of
      ovarian cancer (OC) and uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC). This is a dose escalation
      study that employs a 3+3 design to determine the MTD. Patients are then monitored closely to
      determine side effects and adverse events, as well as success rates and tumor response to the
      radiation therapy.
