      progesterone 800 mg daily for luteal phase support in hormone replacement therapy frozen
      embryo transfer cycles. Patients will undergo an embryo transfer in a hormone replacement
      therapy cycle using Progynova 2 mg three times daily until an endometrium thickness of at
      least 7 mm is reached. Afterwards two different luteal phase supplementation methods will be
      compared. The primary outcome of the study is ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation. We
      will also investigate other prenatal and neonatal outcome factors as well as patients
      satisfaction and safety of dydrogesterone.
