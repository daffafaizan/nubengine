      thoracotomy and extracorporeal circulation and definite mid- and long-term efficacy, has been
      recognized as an effective alternative replacing valve replacement through conventional
      thoracotomy for senile aortic valve stenosis. However, there are still a large number of
      patients whose left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly declines due to the
      long history of disease and long-term heart injury, entering the decompensation stage. TAVR
      will still lead to such severe complications as intraoperative hemodynamic collapse and
      malignant arrhythmia in these patients, greatly increasing the mortality rate. It is pointed
      out in the American Heart Association Guideline (2017) that TAVR is not recommended as a
      treatment means for patients with very poor cardiac function under EF <20%. After
      conservative medication, the prognosis of patients with aortic valve stenosis under very low
      EF is poor with a 3-year mortality rate above 85%, and the prognosis after heart
      transplantation remains controversial. According to the pathological basis of patients and
      preoperative results of dobutamine test, the cardiac systolic function of some patients is
      expected to be significantly improved after removal of aortic valve stenosis. Therefore,
      applying extracorporeal life support system, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPBï¼‰ in the guarantee of cardiopulmonary function during
      perioperative period of TAVR is considered as the optimal surgical strategy for such
      patients.
