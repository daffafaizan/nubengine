    
      To determine the difference of myocardial injury upon using different anesthesia regimens:
      remifentanil-based regimen versus sevoflurane-sufentanil balanced regimen.

      Patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery are randomly allocated to
      get remifentanil (0.75 mcg/kg/min) and propofol (TCI effect-site concentration 0.8-1.5
      mcg/ml) (Group -RP), remifentanil (0.75 mcg/kg/min) and sevoflurane (end-tidal 0.8 vol%)
      (Group-RS), or sevoflurane (end-tidal 1.2-2.8 vol%)-sufentanil (TCI effect site
      concentration0.35-0.75 ng/ml) (Group-SS).

      Intergroup difference in the level of Troponin I (c-TnI) and creatine kinase-MB is determined
      before surgery (control), during vascular graft harvesting (harvesting), after completing
      graft construction (postgrafting), 1 day after surgery (postoperative).
