      mechanical strain imposed on the airways in vivo using continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) results in a dramatic reduction in airway reactivity in vivo in mice, ferrets and
      rabbits1-3. Lungs, airways and airway smooth muscle (ASM) tissues isolated from CPAP-treated
      animals studied in vitro exhibited lower responsiveness to bronchoconstrictors1-3. We also
      observed this suppression of airway responsiveness by chronic mechanical strain in a rabbit
      model of allergic asthma5. These animal studies led to a small clinical trial in which adults
      with asthma were treated with nocturnal CPAP for 1 week. CPAP caused a significant reduction
      in airway reactivity in these patients6. This novel approach for treating airway
      hyper-reactivity is currently being evaluated in a NIH multi-center Phase II clinical trial
      of adults with mild to moderate asthma (U01 HL108730).
