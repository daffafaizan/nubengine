    
      This trial is a single-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Trial of Nam
      versus placebo in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. After screening and
      enrollment, patients will be stratified according to CKD status (eGFR<45 ml/min/m2) and
      surgical site and randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive either Nam 3 grams or placebo on the
      day of surgery and post-surgical days one and two.

      The overall trial duration is planned for 42 months, consisting of 39 months of active
      recruitment and treatment period and three months of follow-up from the last patient
      enrolled.
