      also the leading cause of irreversible visual impairment. The aim of the study is to Improve
      treatment strategy of the disease as well as to reduce blindness.

      Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized antibody against IL-6 receptor, clinical trials on
      non-infectious uveitis and retrospective study on BDU has obtained expected results.

      This single-center prospective study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ in the
      treatment of refractory BDU, to verify its effects on decreasing the dose of corticosteroids,
      and to determine whether it can reduce BDU recurrence.The investigators aim to enroll nine
      refractory BDU patients with acute onset uveitis, with difficulty tapering corticosteroids
      while being treated with at least one of the commonly used immunosuppressants. All
      participants will receive TCZ , oral corticosteroids and immunosuppressants will remain
      unchanged, intraocular injection will be avoided. During monthly follow-up, the investigators
      will measure and record intraocular inflammation status，as well as extraocular manifestations
      and the acute-phase reactants. The participants will continue to receive TCZ for six months,
      the primary end point is the efficacy four weeks after first dose of TCZ, secondary end
      points other than intraocular inflammation will be achieved on each follow-up visit, as
      quality of life improvements, side effects, recurrence of uveitis, and
      corticosteroids-tapering effects.

      On statistical analysis, the self-control treatment efficiency and recurrence rate difference
      will be determined using T-test of paired samples at a significance level of 0.05(2-sided).

      To ensure the interest of the participants, the study has been reviewed by the PUMCH ethics
      committee, and drug clinical research liability insurance was prepared.
