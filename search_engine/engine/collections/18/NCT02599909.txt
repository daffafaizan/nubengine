      The human gut microbiota consists of approximately 100 trillion microbial cells whose
      disruption leads to many diseases including inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer
      to name a few. Recent studies have shown that cancer patients have an altered gut microbiota
      when compared to healthy controls. Intestinal microbiota has been proposed to contribute to
      the start and progression of a number of liver diseases, such as alcoholic liver disease
      (ALD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We plan to investigate the relationship between the gut
      microbiota and the immune system in patients with HCC. In recent years, immune regulation at
      the level of the tumor microenvironment has become very important in different types of
      cancer.

      Objectives:

      To collect blood/stool/urine/tumor samples and rectal swabs from HCC patients undergoing
      resection of primary liver tumors at the Mount Sinai Medical Center and to perform an
      analysis of the interaction of tumors, immune responses and the gut microbiome.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 18 years of age and older

        -  Patients undergoing liver resection for primary liver cancer

        -  Patients must be willing to provide informed consent

      Design

        -  Blood, stool, rectal swabs, urine and/or tumor samples may be collected from consenting
           subjects seen at Mount Sinai Medical Center at the initial visit and/or at follow-up
           visits.

        -  Tumor samples will only be obtained from patients undergoing surgery.

        -  Patients will be asked to answer a questionnaire.
