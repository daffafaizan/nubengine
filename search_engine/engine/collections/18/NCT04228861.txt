      sample volume, it was calculated that at least 46 babies should be sampled for 6 months to
      have an average amount of S. mutans change of 1.87 units. Considering the losses that may
      occur during the follow-up, the study was started by taking samples from 60 systemically
      healthy newborns.

      The study commenced with 60 newborns and was completed with 47 infants due to losses during
      the follow-up. Oral swab samples were taken from 47 healthy infants within the first 24 hours
      after birth, at 1 month old and during the first tooth eruption. Saliva samples were taken
      from the mothers of all the infants and from the fathers of 20 of the infants in the last
      meeting.

      Last interview with the parents, their oral examinations were performed, and their findings
      were processed as decayed (D), filled (F) and missing (M) teeth in accordance with the World
      Health Organization criteria, with the DMF (decayed, missing and filled) index being
      calculated. Furthermore, saliva samples were taken from the parents at the last interview. A
      questionnaire form including the sex of the infant, type of delivery, birth weight, and
      nutritional habits of the infant during the follow-up was filled in by gaining information
      from the parents on the first day and during the follow-ups.

      Swab samples taken from infants with sterile swabs were transferred to the laboratory by
      placing sterile saline solution into dispensed 2 ml screw cap tubes. Sterile urine collection
      containers of 50 ml were used to collect saliva samples from the parents.
