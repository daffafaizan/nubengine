      immune system-mediated inflammation of The bowel mucosa . The reported global incidence and
      prevalence rates for ulcerative colitis vary between 1.2-20.3 and 6-246 per 100000 persons,
      respectively, and the corresponding figures for Crohns disease are 0.03-15.6 and 3.6-214 [2
      In a population based cohort study involving 1160 patients with ulcerative colitis, the
      complication-related mortality rate was 9.6% during follow-up period of 35 years, in another
      study, 221 patients with Crohns disease were followed up for 33 years, with an overall
      complication-related mortality rate of Of the extra-intestinal manifestations of inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD), thromboembolic events represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      with a 3.6 times increased risk in comparison with the general population .

      Although clinical observations suggest an incidence rate between 1 and 8% for thromboembolic
      events in subjects with IBD, postmortem studies point out to a much higher occurrence rate
      around 41% . As a matter of fact, these and similar findings have led to an increased
      interest in the search for the association between IBD and hypercoagulable states as a
      potential cause of increased morbidity and mortality due to thromboembolic events in IBD .
      For instance, the existence of documentable prothrombotic abnormalities and a positive
      history for thromboembolic complications were demonstrated in at least one third of the
      subjects with IBD in a study by Solem et al Inflammation and coagulation are two crucial
      systems that are in balance and constantly influence each other. The impact of inflammation
      on coagulation has been confirmed by several experimental studies showing that inflammatory
      mechanism shift the hemostatic balance to favor the activation of coagulation which, in turn,
      can also sustain inflammation promoting a vicious circle between chronic inflammation and
      thrombosis
