      pandemic, and a year later more than 120 000 000 people are confirmed with the disease. The
      disease has caused more than 2 700 000 deaths globally. Norway has a low mortality rate
      compared to rest of the world. However, a large proportion (10-33%) of the patients worldwide
      have reported persistent symptoms, such as dyspnea, reduced exercise capacity, loss of
      taste/smell and fatigue months after the infection. Persistent symptoms are also found in
      younger populations and in persons with an initially mild disease.

      The intervention will take place at "Helse i Hardanger" (HiH)(Health center in Hardanger,
      Norway). The participants will stay for a 3 -day rehabilitation intervention, if needed,
      another 1 or 2-day stay will be offered about a month later. The concentrated treatment will
      be given by an interdisciplinary team, including doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists,
      pharmacists, psychologists/psychiatrists, and nurses. The intervention is an individualized
      group treatment based on behavioural change.
