      subtypes of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Lauren's classification), on the frequency of gastric
      greater curvature nodal stations and on the clinical relevance, in terms of prognosis and
      survival, of these parameters, a Siewert type II case series of Siewert type II
      adenocarcinomas, submitted to primary (no neoadjuvant therapy) surgical, studied, operated
      upon and followed up, were analysed. According to histologic patterns, cases were ordered in
      intestinal and diffuse adenocarcinoma sub types (Lauren's classification)and distinguished in
      Barret's, cardiopyloric, gastric types.
