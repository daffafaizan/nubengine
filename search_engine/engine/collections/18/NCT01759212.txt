      debilitating problem. The ultimate therapeutic goal in such cases is cardiac transplantation
      which is restricted by donor availability. Alternatively, left ventricular assist devices
      (LVAD) are increasingly used as bridge to transplantation or more recently as destination
      therapy in non-transplant candidates. Widely used second- and third-generation
      continuous-flow LVAD offer symptomatic relief and prolong life. However, LV unloading rarely
      improves native heart function in ischemic hearts. We aim to increase myocardial viability
      and improve native cardiac function in patients with end-stage ICM by injecting allogeneic
      bone marrow stem cells at the time of LVAD implantation.
