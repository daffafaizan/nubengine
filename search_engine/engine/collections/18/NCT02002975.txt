    
      This is a special drug use surveillance on long-term use of pioglitazone (Actos Tablets) in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, designed to determine the onset of new cerebral and
      cardiovascular events and changes in metabolic syndrome parameters, and to analyze the
      association between patient baseline characteristics, including any metabolic
      syndrome-related risk factors, and the onset of new cerebral and cardiovascular events in an
      exploratory setting.

      Participants will be patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The planned sample size is
      20000.

      The usual adult dosage is 15 to 30 mg of pioglitazone administered orally once daily before
      or after breakfast.
