      intervention on the self-esteem of patients diagnosed with an advanced cancer. The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the effects of the Revie ⊕ intervention on spiritual well-being,
      personal development, life satisfaction, and the perception of the interaction with the
      nurses. A pragmatic, two-arm parallel-group, waitlist randomized controlled trial (WLRCT) is
      conducted in which participants are randomized into (i) intervention, or (ii) waitlist
      control groups. The intervention group (IG) receive the Revie ⊕ intervention early on and the
      control group (CG) the same intervention but later on (i.e., after eight weeks).This
      monocentric study takes place in the oncology department of the University Hospitals of
      Geneva (HUG) at two outpatient units. The required sample size is 102 participants (51 per
      group).
