      the bladder that is estimated to affect 3-8 million women in the United States. The
      pathophysiology of the disease is poorly understood, and thus treatment modalities and
      treatment efficacy vary widely. Lately, much attention has shifted toward investigating how
      the bladder 'environment' differs amongst women with IC compared to those who do not suffer
      from IC.

      Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a complementary alternative medicine (CAM)-based
      therapy, is a standardized program including components of meditation and yoga. Recent
      studies show that MBSR improves symptoms in the IC patient population.

      The purpose of this study is to compare measurable differences in the urinary microbiome
      among women with IC before and after MBSR treatment.
