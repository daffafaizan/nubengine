    
      The purpose of this study is to see how using "treat and extend," a method of determining how
      often a patient with NVAMD should visit the retina clinic and receive treatments, affects
      vision in patients with this condition after treatment. The treatment the investigators are
      using in this study is an eye injection of a drug called aflibercept (also called EYLEA).
      Eylea is FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved for treatment of wet age related macular
      degeneration.

      The investigators hope that "treat and extend" strikes the right balance between making sure
      patients get all of the treatments needed, but not giving patients too many treatments (so
      that the side effects of treatments are minimized and so that patients don't have to make
      more visits than they need to maintain maximum visual gain). The experimental part of this
      study is determining this "right balance" of eye injections.
