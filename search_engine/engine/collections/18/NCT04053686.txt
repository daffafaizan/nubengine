      and type 2 diabetes. A large proportion of daily sedentary time (sitting) occurs in the
      workplace. On average, full time office workers spend upwards of 70% of their working day
      seated with the majority of this time accumulated in sitting bouts â‰¥ 20 minutes. A recent
      cross-sectional investigation into the occupational characteristics of over 5,000 British
      police force employees reported at least 30% identifying as having mainly office-based
      duties. When trying to reduce prolonged sitting in the workplace, one of the most effective
      strategies is the use of multi-component interventions. At the present time, sedentary
      workplace intervention studies in the police are limited.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of an intervention to reduce and
      break up prolonged sitting time at work in full-time police staff. The secondary aims of this
      study are to assess preliminary effects on sedentary behaviour, cardiometabolic risk markers,
      physiological stress, physical health, psychological wellbeing and mood, work stress, and
      work performance.

      This has a single-arm, pre-post study design. Participants will receive a multi-component
      intervention to break up and reduce prolonged sitting including: a presentation/workshop,
      electronic support, minor environmental modifications, organisational support, and team
      competition. Assessments will take place at baseline and post-intervention (week 10).
