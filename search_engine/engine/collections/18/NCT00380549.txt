      which forms the socket in the pelvis; a head that forms a new ball for the top of the thigh
      bone; and a stem which is placed into the thigh bone. Typically, the socket is made out of
      metal and plastic, and the ball and stem are made out of metal.

      Recently, new metal-on-metal hip replacement systems have been developed where both the
      socket and the shell are made out of metal. This can cause metal ions to be released into the
      body. The CONSERVE® A-Class Total Hip with BFH technology is a new metal-on-metal total hip
      system which utilizes a large diameter femoral head (36-54 mm) more similar to the size of
      the original head (i.e., your original bone). Further, this system utilizes an advanced metal
      design which wears at a slower rate than typical metal-on-metal implants. Therefore, the
      primary purpose of the current study is to investigate if the CONSERVE® A-Class Total Hip
      with BFH technology will lead to lower blood ion levels in patients, as compared to patients
      in a recent study who received the CONSERVE® Plus Total Resurfacing Hip System, another
      metal-on-metal device. We are also comparing functional and radiographic (x-rays) outcomes
      between patients who receive the CONSERVE® A-Class Total Hip compared to those who have
      received the CONSERVE® Plus Total Resurfacing Hip System.
