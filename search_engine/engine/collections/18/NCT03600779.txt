      remyelination) represents a major clinical need to be able to monitor the demyelination
      processes as well as the effect of remyelinating therapies in multiple sclerosis. The
      investigators recently proposed a technique, derived from the conventional magnetisation
      transfer (MT): inhomogeneous Magnetisation Transfer (ihMT). In preliminary studies, this
      simple-to-implement and robust technique has shown great sensitivity for evaluating the
      demyelination processes. The goal of the project is to evaluate the ability of ihMT to
      measure and describe the spontaneous demyelination and remyelination processes involved in
      active lesions in a population of patients with MS at the the disease onset.
