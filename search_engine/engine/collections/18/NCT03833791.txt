      total body weight and body mass index (BMI), despite the fact that body fat and fat-free mass
      are the indicators that represent the greatest risk in the comorbidity associated with
      obesity. Body weight per se cannot be considered to be reliable; however, its quality can be
      justified, when measured together with the loss in body fat and the maintenance or increase
      in fat-free mass.

      The purpose of the study is compare the effect of different physical programs (FA) on the
      body composition (BC) of adult women with a total body fat percentage ≥ 30 % and adult men
      with a BMI ≥25 at the beginning of the test.

      Participants (n=220, women = 110, men = 110) will be recruited through outpatient from
      private clinics in Cádiz, Andalucía, Spain, as well as through community presentations.
      Overweight or obese and sedentary women and men will be randomly assigned into three groups
      according to different levels of AF. 21 of the participants will be assigned to the sedentary
      control group (METs <2.9), 20 in a group of moderate AF (METs 3-5.9), and 19 will be assigned
      to the group of intense AF (METs >6).

      For 6 months, all of the women shall follow the same diet with an identical distribution of
      macronutrients. There will be a weekly check up of weight, fat, body water and muscle mass
      for all of them.
