      viability in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and dysfunctional myocardium because
      it can accurately predict which myocardial segments will show contractile recovery after
      successful revascularization. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) offers the potential
      to evaluate tissue perfusion at the level where oxygen transfer to the myocytes occurs. MCE,
      therefore, can provide information regarding the functional status of the myocardial
      microvasculature which has a close relationship with myocellular integrity. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the accuracy of MCE compared to dobutamine echocardiography to
      detect myocardial viability in patients with CAD and resting wall motion abnormalities.
