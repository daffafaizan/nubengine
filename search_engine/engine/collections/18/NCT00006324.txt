      about 90% of HIV infections in women. Hormonal contraceptives including COCs and injectables
      are among the most widely used contraceptives in the world. Understanding the impact of
      hormonal contraception on HIV transmission is a critical unanswered public health question.
      Because of the critical nature of this issue to women of reproductive age worldwide, a
      methodologically sound study must be undertaken. It must be determined if hormonal
      contraceptive use increases the risk of HIV infection and the magnitude of the association,
      if it exists.

      This study takes place in Thailand, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. HIV-seronegative women continue
      using their current birth control method (low dose COC, DMPA injections, or non-hormonal
      contraceptive methods [condoms, sterilization, or no modern contraception method]) for the
      duration of the study. They are followed every 12 weeks for a minimum of 15 months and a
      maximum of 24 months, or until seroconversion. Pelvic exams, including Pap smears, are done,
      blood samples are drawn, and vaginal and cervical specimens are tested for any sexually
      transmitted diseases (STDs). Women are provided with free treatment for any STDs that are
      diagnosed. They complete a questionnaire on sexual behavior and contraceptive history;
      counseling on contraceptive use and reducing HIV risk is provided.
