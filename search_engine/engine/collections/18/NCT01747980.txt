      delivery of prGCD after oral administration of PRX-112 in Gaucher subjects. Subjects will
      receive an oral dose of PRX-112 in a single administration and followed by 3 consecutive
      daily administrations at the same dose. prGCD levels in plasma will be determined at selected
      time points. Safety parameters will also be assessed at selected time points. Enrollment will
      proceed into the next dosage cohort after the pharmacokinetic and safety data of the previous
      cohort have been reviewed. A different dosage may be selected based on the pharmacokinetic
      results of the first cohort.
