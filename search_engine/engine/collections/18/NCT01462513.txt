      undergone a complete resection of their primary tumor and recent resection of their liver
      metastases (R0 or R1) with curative intent. No generally accepted standard care is available
      following curative-intent resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients.
      L-BLP25 is a cancer vaccine that targets MUC1, a well known tumor-associated antigen.
      Recently, it has been shown that MUC1 is associated with cellular transformation as
      demonstrated by tumorigenicity and can confer resistance to genotoxic agents. High levels of
      MUC1 cell surface expression, reported immunosuppressive activities of its released
      ectodomain, and anti-adhesive properties all contribute to the ability of the MUC1 antigen to
      protect and promote tumor cell growth and survival, and make MUC1 an attractive target for
      cancer immunotherapy.

      Based on these results, L BLP25 may have potential as adjuvant therapy after curative
      resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients.
