      doesn't contain any Pennsaid. The investigators use placebos in research to see if the
      results are due to the study drug or to other reasons. At some time during the study the
      investigators will give the patient Pennsaid. At another time, the investigators will give
      the patient placebo. The investigators are using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), which is
      temperature testing before and after using the study drug to see if Pennsaid is helpful in
      reducing people's nerve pain.

      In this test, a small metal plate, about the size of a matchbox, is put on the area where the
      patient has pain. The plate is connected to a computer that can warm or cool the plate. The
      patient will use a computer mouse button to tell us when the plate feels warm. The QST
      machine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is often used by nerve
      doctors to see if a person has neuropathy (pain caused by damage to a nerve).
