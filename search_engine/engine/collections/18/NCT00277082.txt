    
      TREATMENT PLAN (25-28) Patients will be admitted to the GCRC for 25 hours.

      Admission will be prior to the daily DLPC-9NC administration

      Upon admission, patients will be asked to empty their bladder. Urine will be collected for 24
      hours, and refrigerated. Upon completion of the collection, urine will be mixed, and a 20 ml
      aliquot frozen and preserved for further analysis.

      A catheter will be placed in a peripheral vein, and in a peripheral artery, and appropriately
      heparinized.

      Venous and arterial blood samples (7 ml per samples) will be drawn in heparinized green tops
      prior to DLPC-9NC administration, and at the following time points: 2, 5, 8, 12, and 24
      hours. An additional 2 samples may be drawn at the PI discretion. (Total blood drawn: 84 ml +
      14 ml)

      During the GCRG hospitalization, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be done according to
      standard practice once per patients. Patients will be divided in cohort of 6 (3 females and 3
      males). Each cohort will undergo the BAL at a specific time point: within 30 minutes of the
      end of DLPC-9NC treatment, at 3 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours.

      In responding patients that may become surgical candidate for a curative resection, one
      DLPC-9NC treatment will be administered prior to surgery (within 5 hours). Surgery will
      proceed as per standard of care and patients will sign a regular surgical consent for
      surgical procedure. Along with the tumor removal, one sample of venous blood and of arterial
      blood will be drawn for comparison (total volume: 14 ml). Once the tumor specimen is removed,
      a piece will be kept in liquid nitrogen, along with a piece of normal lung tissue, for
      further analysis. Patients will need to sign the attached consent form to authorize the
      collection of specimens.
