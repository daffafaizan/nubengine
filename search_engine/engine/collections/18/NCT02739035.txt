      variety of factors have been cited as possible causes, such as component malrotation or
      improper soft-tissue balancing, however, an etiology is not always appreciated. Histologic
      and arthroscopic evidence of fibrosis suggests that an inflammatory process may contribute to
      loss of knee range of motion following surgery. Manipulation under anesthesia remains
      standard of care for stiffness following TKA. Manipulation shows improved range of motion for
      stiffness after total knee arthroplasty, however, patients do not always achieve full range
      of motion. Furthermore, repeat manipulation and manipulation greater than 8 weeks
      post-surgically have shown limited improvements. Given a possible role of the host
      inflammatory response and the importance of early gains in knee range of motion following
      total knee arthroplasty, limiting the inflammatory response at the time of manipulation may
      improve outcomes. Investigators would like to assess the role of anti-inflammatory
      medications to optimize range of motion and outcome for manipulation under anesthesia for
      stiffness following TKA.
