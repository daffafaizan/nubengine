      infusion on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9 for Cycles 1-6. You will then have a Rituximab infusion on
      Days 2 and 9. Each cycles lasts 21 days. After completing Cycle 6 and if you are eligible,
      there will be a 2 month break before the maintenance phase is started. During this break, you
      will have a study visit with a physical exam, blood tests, and a bone marrow biopsy. If you
      continue to the maintenance phase, you will receive Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone on Days 1
      and 2 and Rituximab on Day 2 of Cycles 1-8. Each cycle will continue to last 21 days, but
      will take place every 2 months. Infusions will last between 2-6 hours.

      During all cycles you will have a physical exam and you will be asked questions about your
      general health and specific questions about any problems that you might be having and any
      medications you may be taking. Blood tests will also be done at each Cycle visit, and you
      will complete a questionnaire. Bone marrow and CT scan will only be repeated at physician
      discretion when appropriate and in order to ensure your response to treatment.
