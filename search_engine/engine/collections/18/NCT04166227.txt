      investigators aim to:

        1. estimate the proportion of eligible patients providing consent,

        2. estimate the magnitude of the between-groups difference in the primary outcome (Hip
           Dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score - HOOS) to aid in sample size calculation
           for the full study,

        3. estimate the compliance in completing the proposed outcome measures to determine the
           burden of questionnaire completion.
