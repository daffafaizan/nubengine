      using measurements of the three perpendicular diameters, comparison of inter and intra
      variability of 3D US measurements with inter and intra variability of 3D CT or MRI
      measurements, calculation of 3D and 2D volume measurements during contrast-enhanced US
      examination when the injection is performed for clinical routine purposes such as vascular
      and extension staging, during interventional procedures such as US guided biopsy targeting
      the non-necrotic tumour parenchyma. Concordance between 2D and 3D US acquisitions will be
      compared to CT and MRI measurements. Comparison of volume measurements between non-contrast
      and contrast-enhanced methods (US, CT and MRI) will be performed. The results will be
      compared to renal function before and after tumour treatment.
