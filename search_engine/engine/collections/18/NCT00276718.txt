        -  Determine the toxic effects of etoposide, carboplatin, and bleomycin in young patients
           with malignant germ cell tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two treatment arms based on their tumor type
      (testicular vs ovarian, uterine, vaginal, sacrococcygeal, retroperitoneal, or thoracic).

        -  Group 1 (testicular tumors): Patients undergo radical orchiectomy. Patients with stage I
           tumors and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) decreasing at the expected rate receive no further
           treatment unless there is a subsequent rise in the AFP or a clinical recurrence.
           Patients with stage II-IV tumors receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3,
           carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2, and bleomycin IV over 15 minutes on day 3.
           Treatment repeats every 21- 28 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Residual teratoma may be removed, if indicated,
           after completion of chemotherapy.

        -  Group 2 (ovarian, uterine, vaginal, sacrococcygeal, retroperitoneal, or thoracic germ
           cell tumors): Patients undergo surgical removal or biopsy of the tumor. Patients then
           receive etoposide, carboplatin, and bleomycin as above. Patients may then undergo
           further surgery at the discretion of the principal investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
