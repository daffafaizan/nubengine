      vaginal vault prolapse repair are available. During the last few years robot-assisted surgery
      has been introduced in many surgical specialties and experiences in gynecologic surgery are
      very limited.

      Several aspects like the wider range of motion of robot-instruments leading to more precision
      in surgery, the 3 dimensional optical system and the ergonomically designed console may offer
      some advantages. For better judgment these possible benefits as well as safety and outcome
      need to be evaluated and compared with conventional laparoscopic sacropexy techniques.

      This prospective clinical study evaluates robot-assisted laparoscopic sacropexy (da
      VinciÂ®-System) focusing on peri-operative data, objective anatomical results and
      postoperative quality of life and compares the results with conventional laparoscopic
      sacropexy. Pre- peri- and post-operative data are collected using the prolapse quantification
      system (POP-Q) and the German Pelvic Floor questionnaire. The objective of the study will be
      to investigate if the robot assisted procedure shows significant advantages for the patient
      considering duration of surgery, complications, hospitalization, quality of life and costs.
