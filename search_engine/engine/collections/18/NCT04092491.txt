      aspects. They can thus, depending on the situation, prove to be capable of triggering either
      a protective inflammatory response or, on the contrary, anti-inflammatory and inducing
      tolerance. Similarly, and for reasons that remain very poorly understood, they can be
      involved in pathologies where the immune system is itself an aggressor of the body and
      responsible for immunopathological lesions.

      the investigator formulates the hypothesis that an inappropriate response of the mucosal
      immune system to one or more antigens leads to a synthesis of IgA of bad affinity favoring a
      deposit at the level of the mesangium. It seems important to verify this point by analyzing
      the IgA repertory of patients with N-IgA and comparing it to that of a control population.
