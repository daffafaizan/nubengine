      regularly scheduled clinic visit. These questionnaires will measure pain and other symptoms,
      such as your mood and quality of life. You will also be asked to give a tissue sample by
      inserting a swab into your mouth and rubbing firmly against the inside of your cheek or
      underneath your lower or upper lip for about a minute at most. Completing the 5
      questionnaires and the swab sample collection takes about 30 minutes in total.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 500 patients will take part in the cross-sectional phase of this study. All will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.
