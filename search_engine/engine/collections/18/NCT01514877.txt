      one of the primary reasons resulting in treatment failure and the death. Whole-brain
      radiation therapy (WBRT) is the standard approach to the treatment of multiple brain
      metastases from NSCLC. Regardless of the treatment of brain metastases by WBRT combined with
      systemic chemotherapy,outcomes of NSCLC with brain metastases are still very poor. Epidermal
      growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) can pass through the
      blood-brain barrier and show promising antitumor activity against brain metastases from
      NSCLC. Icotinib shows nearly the same effect as gefitinib in advanced NSCLC patients failed
      with chemotherapy.
