      quantify regional increases in cerebral blood flow. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate in humans the role of prostaglandins in the regulation of cerebral blood flow
      during hypercapnia and functional activation. For this investigation the increase in cerebral
      blood flow associated with either hypercapnia or functional activation will be measured
      before and after the administration of pharmacological agents that inhibit the production of
      prostaglandins. In the hypercapnia study cerebral blood flow will be increased by inhalation
      of an air mixture containing 6% CO2. For the functional activation study cerebral blood flow
      will be increased by a sensory motor task.
