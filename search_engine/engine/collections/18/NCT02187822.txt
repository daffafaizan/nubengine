      surgically removable, is radiation therapy to the brain lesions. This treatment is called
      Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) and is given without chemotherapy and usually
      over 5 days.

      Researchers of this study want to find out if adding an investigational drug, called TPI 287,
      to standard radiation therapy (FSRT) can help people with brain metastases from cancer. TPI
      287 is a drug that is being tested and is not approved for sale in the United States by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
