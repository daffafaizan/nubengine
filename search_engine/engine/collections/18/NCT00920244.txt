      of 15-20%. Key factors determining outcome include the presenting cardiac rhythm, aetiology,
      and early initiation of resuscitation. Some cardiac rhythms benefit from defibrillation
      (shockable rhythms). During resuscitation patients may switch between shockable and
      non-shockable rhythms, and may show signs of spontaneous circulation temporarily. Depending
      on rhythm and according to guidelines, patients receive direct current (DC) shocks
      (defibrillator) and/or i.v. adrenaline, atropine and amiodarone, which may affect
      state-transitions. We wish to make statistical analysis (time-series analysis, Markov
      modelling) of these state-transitions and variations in hemodynamic variables during
      resuscitation, related to CPR interventions and the cause of arrest. The cause of arrest will
      be determined based on chart records, interview with staff and autopsy if appropriate. One
      hypothesis is that differences in the patterns of state-transitions may reflect underlying
      aetiology, which may guide in future decision-making during resuscitation.
