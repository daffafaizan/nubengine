      related to arteriolar vasodilation and myocardial depression are the mainstays of septic
      shock pathology.

      At the level of the micro-circulation, there is insufficient delivery of oxygen to organs and
      tissues which results in organ dysfunction and potential organ necrosis.One key factor
      leading to vascular dysfunction is the inappropriately increased production of nitric oxide
      within the blood vessel endothelium. Elevated levels of nitric oxide results in the blood
      vessel endothelium receiving direct vasodilator input, as well as the inability to respond to
      norepinephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. Nitric oxide activates the soluble isoform of the
      enzyme guanylatecyclase, which in turn increases production of cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate. Nitric oxide has other beneficial effects which are mediated via other
      pathways than guanylatecyclase; therefore, administration of a guanylate cyclase inhibitor
      such as methylene blue could be a safer therapeutic option than the inhibition of nitric
      oxide production.

      These effects of methylene blue could be related to vasoconstriction and positive inotropic
      effects as well to an increase in blood volume, itself related to a decrease in vascular
      permeability. The use of methylene blue has been recently advocated as a potential adjunct in
      the treatment of shock states. However, the effect of MB at the level of the capillary bed,
      where vital exchange of oxygen and nutrients occurs, is unknown. Thus in this study, the
      investigators will investigate the effect of methylene blue in combination with NE at the
      microvascular level in septic shock.
