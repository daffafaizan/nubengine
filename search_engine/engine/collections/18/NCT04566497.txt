      with coronary artery disease (CAD).

      In the following years after revascularization, the current guidelines recommend evaluation
      with stress tests when patients are symptomatic. Due to the lack of randomized trials, the
      evaluation of asymptomatic patients is controversial and accordingly there is a wide
      variation in routine follow-up strategies in these patients. A systematic screening of silent
      myocardial ischemia may help prevent a major acute cardiac event. However, systematic
      screening strategy is costly and there is currently no evidence that repeated
      revascularization improve survival We hypothesized that clinical follow-up alone would be
      non-inferior to systematic stress testing screening strategy during follow-up of asymptomatic
      CAD patients with prior coronary revascularization.

      The primary objective of ARCACHON trial is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a strategy
      of clinical follow-up (without non-invasive stress testing) in asymptomatic patients with a
      history of coronary revascularization compared to a strategy of systematic screening for
      myocardial ischemia using non-invasive stress testing by the primary endpoint as the
      composite of: all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke or any cardiovascular event
      leading to unplanned hospitalization.
