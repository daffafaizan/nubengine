    
      This current study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned drug) study to evaluate the safety
      and effectiveness of different doses of JNJ-42160443 compared with placebo in the treatment
      of patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip or the knee who have moderate to
      severe pain that is not controlled by standard pain medications.Osteoarthritis is a chronic
      disease that affects the joints, and is characterized by degeneration of cartilage and bone.
      The duration of the study is approximately 133 weeks (3-week screening phase, 12-week
      double-blind efficacy phase, 92-week double-blind extension phase, and 26-week post treatment
      phase).JNJ-42160443 (10 mg/mL) or matching placebo given as an subcutaneous (injection under
      the skin) (SC) once every 4 weeks will be administered in the study as 1 of 5 JNJ-42160443
      dosages:1 mg every 4 weeks, 3 mg every 4 weeks, 3 mg every 8 weeks, 6 mg every 8 weeks; or 10
      mg every 8 weeks, or matching placebo for up to approximately 104 weeks (12-week double-blind
      efficacy phase + 92-week double-blind extension phase).
