      general health. In 2000, 18.1% of all US deaths were related to tobacco use. Multiple trials
      have proven that providing nicotine-replacement therapies to help smoking cessation were
      efficacious with various types of populations. However, smoking has not been eradicated in
      North America and was associated with a 3.1 million YPLL (years of potential life lost),
      along with 96.8 billion in productivity losses in the US4.

      We are carrying out a study of 200 inpatients on a general medicine ward to attempt to
      improve prescription rates of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and smoking cessation. Our
      goal is to use a patient centred approach to determine which patients would benefit from NRT
      and which patients would be in the contemplative stage of smoking cessation. We will want to
      look at whether a simple, short survey taken by patients can encourage the health care
      provider (HCP) to provide more NRT and more referrals to a smoking cessation clinic. We hope
      that this tool will improve the ability of HCP to provide optimal, comprehensive care. The
      study's findings should help to guide future practices for hospitalized smokers.

      Currently, standard treatment involves NRT being prescribed completely at the discretion of
      the physician. This occasionally involves a discussion with the patient regarding their
      preferences, but more often is a unilateral decision made by the health care provider.
      Additionally, we believe that this method misses a lot of potential patients who may benefit
      from this therapy but are otherwise not identified. We will not be using a placebo.
