      cluster randomized controlled trial among up to 86 NH physicians working in one of 4 UPMC
      Health System nursing homes (NHs) in Southwestern Pennsylvania for a period of 12 months. Our
      hypotheses are that NH patients managed by physicians who receive active medication
      monitoring alerts will have more ADEs detected, will have a faster ADE management response
      time, and will result in cost-savings from a societal perspective compared to usual care.
      This application by an early stage investigator is responsive to PA-09-070 AHRQ Health
      Services Research Projects and several of its research portfolio priority areas (health
      information technology, patient safety, and value) by addressing how medication management
      systems can be used to improve the quality and safety of medication management, as well as
      improve healthcare decision making. This study represents the first large, well-controlled,
      comprehensive examination of an active medication monitoring system in the NH.
