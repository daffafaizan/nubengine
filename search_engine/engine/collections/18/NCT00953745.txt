      disorder (MDD) augmentation. Subjects will undergo exposure to an existing antidepressant
      (Lexapro 10-20mg) for 10 weeks; subjects failing to completely respond to the monotherapy
      antidepressant treatment will receive augmentation with ARP for six weeks. Two placebo phases
      are included in which the subjects will receive one placebo along with the Lexapro for the
      first 6 weeks and a second placebo along with Lexapro for the next two weeks. A baseline
      brain imaging series (MRI and 2 PET/CT scans) will be obtained at week 10, prior to starting
      the aripiprazole, on subjects not responding to Lexapro. A second series of images will be
      obtained at the end of the six weeks of ARP augmentation. The neuroimaging will consist of
      fMRI, a raclopride PET scan, and a fluoro-dopa PET scan.

      Ten normal control subjects will not receive any treatment. They will be age and gender
      matched to study subjects and undergo one set of scans (fMRI,raclopride and FOPA PET scans)
      to use as comparison group for quality control on a non-depressed population and not for data
      analysis.
