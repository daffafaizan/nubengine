      currently unknown. Recent civilian data on TBI show the prevalence of any pituitary hormone
      deficiency is as high as 80% after 12 months. While the military prevalence of
      hypopituitarism can be extrapolated from civilian data, a major limitation is the notably
      different mechanism of injury (i.e., blast) for military personnel compared to civilians
      (i.e., assaults, traffic accidents and falls). Little is known about the effect of shockwaves
      from a blast injury on central nervous system tissue, and due to the unique nature of
      blast-related TBI, the prevalence of pituitary dysfunction in affected service members may
      significantly differ from nonmilitary subjects in prior studies.
