      impaired insulin signaling (insulin resistance) and is associated with several comorbidities
      including neuropathy, retinopathy, kidney disease, and elevated risk for heart attack and
      stroke. Lifestyle interventions targeted towards prevention of type 2 diabetes include:
      maintaining and achieving healthy bodyweight, physical activity, avoiding tobacco use, and
      reducing sugar and saturated fat intake. The International Scientific Consensus Summit from
      the International Carbohydrate Quality Consortium indicated that diets low in glycemic index
      and glycemic load were important in the prevention and management of diabetes. Health
      supplements that can lower the glycemic index and glycemic load of food have potential to
      support the prevention of diabetes and improve blood glucose management by reducing post
      prandial glycemia and insulinemia. This project will test a unique botanical formula designed
      to inhibit alpha amylase (the primary starch degrading digestive enzyme) and inhibit sucrase
      (the primary sucrose degrading digestive enzyme) in order to reduce acute post prandial
      glycemia regardless of nutritive carbohydrate source. This proposal will fill a void in the
      literature by testing for the first time the effect of a combination of mulberry leaf, white
      kidney bean extract and cinnamon on postprandial carbohydrate absorption and glucose control
      in overweight, insulin resistant men and women. This project will provide pilot data to
      support larger studies, and studies to investigate long-term effects.
