      the metabolomic changes in response to six months of positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment
      among OSA patients. Newly diagnosed OSA patients (AHI>5) will undergo additional measurements
      including: accelerometer x one week (to inform the metabolomics), Type 2 home sleep test (to
      assist with OSA subtyping), next morning blood draw, 24-hour diet recall (to inform the
      metabolomics), questionnaires and PVT.
