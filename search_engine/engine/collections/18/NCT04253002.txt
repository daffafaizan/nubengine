      (A-CWS) and test hypotheses pertaining to the mechanism of change by which the A-CWS reduces
      suicide risk. Additionally, this study is expected to augment current theoretical models of
      adolescent suicidality. This effectiveness trial will inform procedures for scaling up
      efficacious, high quality, and culturally-grounded suicide prevention programs for
      low-resourced, urban African American youth; as such, this study is practice relevant and
      expected to inform best practices for the prevention of suicide among African American
      adolescents. The specific aims are:

        1. To examine the effectiveness of the A-CWS intervention, as delivered by social workers
           who are indigenous to the school system, to reduce active suicidal ideation, within a
           sample of low-resourced, urban African American adolescents.

        2. To understand the mechanism by which the A-CWS intervention reduces suicide risk for
           low-resourced, urban African American adolescents.

        3. To establish the fidelity of an evidence-based, culturally-grounded coping with stress
           intervention (i.e., the A-CWS), developed for low-resourced, urban African American
           adolescents, delivered by social workers indigenous to the school system.

        4. To understand the extent that thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and
           socio-ecological factors influence the development of active suicidal ideation.
