      individuals in the U.S. Currently, there is no approved treatment.

      There is a critical knowledge gap regarding the best ways to intervene to increase aerobic
      capacity (VO2max on exercise testing) in FA. Exercise is the most potent known stimulus for
      increasing muscle mass and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity,
      increasing VO2max, and increasing insulin sensitivity (Si), however, it has not been studied
      in FA. One adaptation seen in exercised muscles is an increase in muscle nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide (NAD+), a cofactor required for glycolytic and mitochondrial adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) production. In skeletal- and cardiac muscle-specific frataxin (FXN)
      knock-out animals, NAD+ precursors rescued cardiac function to near-normal, additionally
      highlighting its translational potential in FA. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a NAD+
      precursor currently available as a dietary supplement (Tru Niagen Â®, ChromaDex, Irvine CA)
      that is expected to be safe and well-tolerated in adults and children. The central hypothesis
      is that exercise + NR will increase skeletal muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS and increase muscle
      mass to increase VO2max in FA. The investigators expect that exercise + NR will also increase
      Si in this cohort.
