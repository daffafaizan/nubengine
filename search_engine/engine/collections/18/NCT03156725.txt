      age women and children. Primarily, inorganic iron salts are being used as iron
      supplementation to treat IDA and are added to food to improve the nutritional value of the
      daily diet, however side effects and/or low absorption with diets are a result, limiting the
      impact on IDA. Sixteen female subject, who were 18-35 years, non-pregnancy, non-anemia with
      marginal lower iron status (ferritin cut-off value <30ug/L) were recruited in this study.
      Subjects were randomized to orally consume test meal with stable iron isotopes Fe57 (10mg) in
      sulfate form and Fe58 (2mg) and 8 mg natural abundance iron in Aspiron, in two visits. Blood
      samples were collected at baseline and two weeks to assess isotope enrichment and iron status
      indicators, such as hepcidin and ferritin were measured.
