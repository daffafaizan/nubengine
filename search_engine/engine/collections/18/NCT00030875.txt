        -  Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate, in patients with
           previously untreated or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate suppression of 20S proteasome levels with toxicity of and response to this
           drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and response duration in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      complete response (CR) receive 2 courses beyond documentation of CR. Patients with stable
      disease receive a maximum of 4 courses. Patients with partial response (PR) continue therapy
      until disease progression or for 2 courses beyond documentation of stable PR.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
