      response to three different doses of Mitoglitazone as compared to placebo following
      once-daily dosing for 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) in patients with Type 2 diabetes and to
      investigate the safety and tolerability of three different doses of Mitoglitazone following
      once-daily dosing for 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
