      terms of response rate and progression free survival in patients with stage IIIB or IV
      non-small cell lung cancer. II. Evaluate this treatment regimen in terms of toxicity and
      quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no disease progression following 6 courses of therapy
      receive an additional 6 courses of therapy. Quality of life is assessed prior to each course
      and then every 3 months. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37-83 patients will be accrued for this study.
