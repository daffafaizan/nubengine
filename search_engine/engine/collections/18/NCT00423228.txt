    
      This is a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, oral donepezil controlled
      study on the safety and efficacy of repeated monthly s.c. injections of a sustained-release
      implant of ZT 1 in patients with moderate Alzheimer's Disease.

      The study enrolls patients aged >50 years, with moderate AD with a MMSE score at study
      screening ≥14 and ≤22. The study aims to recruit 128 patients.

      The study is divided into 3 periods:

        1. A screening period

        2. A 6-month treatment period, consisting of one month of titration with an oral medication
           and 5 months of treatment with an implant administered under the skin every 4 weeks.
           Oral treatment will be maintained throughout the treatment phase

        3. A 2 week follow-up period.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 groups: the ZT-1 (investigational
      product) treatment group or the donepezil (active comparator) treatment group.

      The study comprises a total of 11 visits including screening and follow-up. An additional
      visit for PK/PD assessment is scheduled in about 10% of patients.
