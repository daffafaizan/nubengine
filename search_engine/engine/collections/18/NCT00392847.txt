      support and attachment amongst at-risk young women and their family. 440 primigravida
      (pregnant women) will be randomised into two groups. The first group will receive routine
      follow-up as currently provided by national community health and social services. The second
      group will receive home visits by community workers. These visits will start during pregnancy
      and will continue up to the child's second birthday.
