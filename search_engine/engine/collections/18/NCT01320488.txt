      a 3-year period, we aim to identify a total of 600 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer,
      of those 300 women age 40 and younger and 300 older women from academic and community health
      care institutions across the Riyadh area. It is anticipated at least 400 of these women will
      agree to participate in the study. The comparable control group of older patients with breast
      cancer will be used for study comparison. Patient surveys, medical record review, and blood
      and tissue collection will be utilized. Women will be surveyed every 6 months after
      diagnosis. The study will investigate short and long-term disease and treatment issues, and
      psychosocial concerns. We will also collect tumor and blood samples to characterize the
      pathological and molecular aspects of tumors, and establish tumor bank for future studies.
