    
      This is a multi-phase prospective cohort study. In the first phase the investigators will
      interview parents and consult the Family Research Advisory Committee (FRAC) to determine
      their attitudes toward day of surgery research consent. The investigators will use the
      participants' responses and instruments already found in the literature to develop the
      questionnaire. In the second phase, the investigators will interview parents and consult FRAC
      about the questionnaire to determine which items to add, remove, or modify. In the third
      phase, the investigators will distribute the adapted questionnaire to clarify parents'
      attitudes surrounding day of surgery consent. The investigators will use the results of the
      third phase to develop a table of guidelines for day of surgery consent. In the final phase,
      the investigators will interview parents, healthcare professionals, and consult FRAC for
      feedback and modification of the table of guidelines.
