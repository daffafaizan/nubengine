      I. To estimate overall survival in elderly subjects treated with bevacizumab and temozolomide
      for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate 12-months survival. II. To estimate progression free survival for 2 years or
      until progression is detected.

      III. To investigate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab/temozolomide in elderly
      patient with glioblastoma.

      IV. To isolate DNA, RNA, and protein isolated from frozen and paraffinized archival tumor
      samples for evaluations such as immunohistochemical pathway profiling of VEGF-dependent
      angiogenic pathways, gene expression microarray, and MGMT promoter methylation status to
      define important molecule features of treatment response and especially age-related molecular
      expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks and oral temozolomide on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 4 months.
