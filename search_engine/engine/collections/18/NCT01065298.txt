      pancreas of patients with T2DM, aged 30 - 70 years with triple oral hypoglycemic agent
      failure and on insulin(>0.4 U/ kg body weight/day) will lead to abolition or reduction of
      insulin requirement by more than or equal to 50% in these patients over a period of 6 months.
      It is assumed that ABMSCT in these patients leads to increased angiogenesis, secretion of
      various cytokines and upregulation of pancreatic transcription factors and Vascular
      endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and creates a microenvironment which supports beta
      cell/resident stem cell activation and survival.
