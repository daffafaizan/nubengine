      I. To determine the safety of the treatment combination consisting of brachytherapy and
      tremelimumab. (Safety lead-in) II. To determine the median progression-free survival with
      brachytherapy and checkpoint inhibition with either durvalumab or tremelimumab. (Dose
      expansion)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy of brachytherapy and durvalumab or brachytherapy and tremelimumab
      in terms of:

      Ia. Local control of the irradiated tumor. Ib. Overall response rate. Ic. Response at
      non-irradiated lesions in subjects with multiple sites of disease subjects.

      Id. Duration of response. Ie. Disease specific survival. If. Overall survival. II. To further
      determine the safety and tolerability of brachytherapy with durvalumab and brachytherapy with
      tremelimumab (expansion cohorts).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore the immunologic changes associated with the combination of brachytherapy with
      durvalumab and brachytherapy with tremelimumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then undergo brachytherapy on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 fractions in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive tremelimumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2-4
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo
      brachytherapy on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 fractions in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.
