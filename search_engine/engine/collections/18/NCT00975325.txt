      Primary Objectives:

        -  Characterisation of relative bioavailability of Test 1 in comparison to Reference after
           single dose administration under fasting conditions

        -  Assessment of bioequivalence of Test 1 vs. Reference after single dose administration
           under fasting conditions, determined by use of area under the concentration time curve
           AUC0-tlast and maximal concentration Cmax obtained for yohimbine

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Descriptive characterisation of safety and tolerability of the investigational products
           in the study population

        -  Descriptive characterisation of blood pressure and pulse rate around Cmax of the
           investigational products in the study population

      Analytical methodology:

      Yohimbine in plasma samples will be analysed by use of a validated HPLC-MS/MS; intended LLOQ
      for yohimbine is 0.5 ng/ml
