    
      This clinical trial will recruit eligible patients diagnosed with unresectable
      liver-predominant colorectal cancer metastases who have experience progression of their
      disease following standard of care treatment.

      Unless patients already dispose of a hepatic arterial catheter, they will undergo placement
      of a permanent hepatic artery catheter (by laparoscopic surgery). During this surgical
      procedure a biopsy will be made of the colorectal cancer liver metastasis.

      Decitabine will be administered as a daily 1-hour IV infusion on 5 consecutive days, every
      4weeks.

      Two weeks after the first day of administration of decitabine, a CT-guided biopsy a liver
      metastasis will be performed in order to obtain tumor tissue for histopathological analysis
      and DNA/RNA extraction for the purposes of methylation specific Polymerase Chain Reaction
      (PCR) and reverse transcriptase PCR for assessment of demethylation and expression of
      cancer-testis antigen encoding genes.

      Blood samples for collection of "cell-free DNA" and White Blood Cell (WBC ) for the purpose
      of DNA/RNA extraction and analysis by methylation specific PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR
      for assessment of demethylation and expression of cancer-testis antigen encoding genes will
      be obtained weekly after decitabine treatment.

      The dose of decitabine will be escalated in subsequent patient cohorts enrolled to this phase
      I trial (see rules for dose escalation).

      Study treatment will be continued until unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease or patient
      refusal.
