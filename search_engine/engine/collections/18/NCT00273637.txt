      support groups for PPCM e.g. www.AMothersHeart.org (www.amothersheart.org/index.html). The
      directors of these websites will facilitate contact between our research staff and the
      several hundred members of these web sites.

      An introductory letter will be posted on the website introducing the cardiovascular research
      team and describing the purpose, basic methods, and goals of our study. Website members who
      desire to participate can respond to a dedicated e-mail address we have set up and provide
      contact information so that we may get informed consent via telephone or mailed written
      consent. A telephone number will also be provided for participants so that they may call with
      questions regarding the study. Patients will then receive a questionnaire addressing our
      study goals. Questions will focus on obtaining family and social history, characterizing
      presenting symptoms, initial management, and clinical course following delivery of the fetus
      including extent of cardiovascular follow-up, date of echocardiograms performed, medications,
      and psychosocial support, if provided.
