      brachytherapy using the Novoste beta-emitting catheter for recurrent stenosis after treatment
      with multiple drug-eluting stents. While intracoronary brachytherapy has been used for this
      purpose by clinicians for some time, data supporting this clinical decision-making is
      lacking.

      Currently, when cardiologists find restenosis after implanting a drug-eluting stent, they
      often place a stent that elutes a different drug within that stent. If a patient presents
      with restenosis in the segment that has already been treated with both sirolimus and
      paclitaxel-eluting stents, further options are limited. Intracoronary brachytherapy is often
      used in this scenario, but the efficacy of this approach has not been well studied. The
      investigators recently reviewed the clinical outcomes of five patients who underwent
      intracoronary radiation after drug-eluting stents. They discovered only one episode of target
      vessel revascularization and no episodes of stent thrombosis. While this sample is small,
      investigators believe that a prospective study will provide important information regarding
      this approach.
