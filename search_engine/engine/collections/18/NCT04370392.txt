      better cosmetic results, lesser post-operative pain, and shorter recovery time, leading to
      shorter hospital stay and less expenditure.One of most common bariatric surgery is
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Pain after laparoscopic surgery may be due to stretching of
      the intra-abdominal cavity, peritoneal inflammation, and diaphragmatic irritation caused by
      residual carbon-dioxide in the peritoneal cavity.

      Multimodal efforts like parenteral opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or local
      wound infiltration have been done to reduce overall pain and benefit post-operative
      conditions of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries. Despite their efficacy, with all
      parenteral medications, there are associated adverse effects.

      Intraperitoneal local anesthetic is a safe and effective analgesic approach which used to
      control pain after laparoscopic surgery. Many authors have evaluated the role of IP local
      anesthetic administration in laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery, laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy and laparoscopic hysterectomy.

      Dexmedetomidine (alpha-2 adrenergic agonists) has become one of the frequently used drugs in
      anesthesia as it has been reported to provide analgesia, anxiolysis, and an
      anesthetic-sparing action with minimal respiratory depression plus its sedative effect that
      mimics natural sleep. Dexmedetomidine can used safely both intravenous and plus bupivacaine
      in different nerve block.
