      purinergic signaling to endothelial nitrous oxide synthase (eNOS) and this pathway will be
      evaluated in primary arterial ECs obtained from older adult (> 60 years) and adult (18-30
      years) subjects before and following rhythmic handgrip exercise that elevates brachial artery
      shear-rate similarly in both groups. ECs will be used to quantify markers of EC autophagy,
      eNOS activation, and NO generation. The study will also determine whether exercise-training
      attenuates the aging-associated decline in EC autophagy, and whether intact autophagy is
      required for training-induced vascular improvements. To evaluate this potential, it will be
      determined whether one-limb rhythmic handgrip exercise training by older adult (> 60 y) human
      subjects is sufficient to elevate basal and shear-induced EC autophagy initiation, eNOS
      activation, and NO generation vs. the contralateral sedentary limb. Results from this work
      have tremendous potential to reveal a new therapeutic target and approach for restoring /
      maintaining vascular function in the aging population.
