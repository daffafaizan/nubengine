    
      A Phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, and controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of
      MEDI7510 in approximately 1,900 adult participants, globally, 60 years or older. Participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular dose of each of 2 study
      vaccines in contralateral arms: MEDI7510 + IIV or placebo + IIV in Season 1.

      Participants who receive MEDI7510 in the Northern Hemisphere will be re-randomized and
      blinded in Season 2 to receive either MEDI7510 + IIV or placebo + IIV in a 1:1 ratio.
      Clinical efficacy will not be assessed in Season 2; however the safety of revaccination will
      be assessed in Season 2.
