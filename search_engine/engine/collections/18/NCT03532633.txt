    
      Collection of:

        1. cord plasma in preterm and term infants.

        2. remnants of clinically indicated blood samples of mothers 24 hours before or after
           birth.

        3. remnants of clinically indicated blood samples of preterm and term infants during
           neonatal care.

        4. breast milk once a weak during neonatal care of the infant.

      Determination concentrations of micronutrients by mass spectrometry.

      Aim is to compare cord plasma concentrations with postnatal plasma concentrations and to
      measure concentrations in breast milk to determine the actual supply.

      Update September 2020:

      The results obtained according to the original protocol revealed a serious sample instability
      when using remnants of clinical blood samples. Remnants can not be used and therefore the
      protocol had to be changed. A new approval of the Ethics Committee was obtained and is
      available to the study team. The following changes for sample collection were implemented: an
      additional blood sample (2.7ml EDTA blood) is taken from the mothers after approval.The blood
      samples of premature and newborns (max. 3x 0.2 ml) are obtained when a clinically indicated
      blood sample is taken. In both cases the serum is frozen immediately within one hour after
      collection.

      Due to these changes, the expected end of the study is postponed to 2021.
