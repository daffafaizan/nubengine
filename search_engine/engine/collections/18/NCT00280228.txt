    
      In this study phase, 36 patients with a disruptive behavior disorder (DBD - i.e., attention
      deficit-hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder) and use or
      abuse of one or more substances will be randomly assigned to treatment using either a
      standard treatment for DBDs in this age group or the newly developed HBT treatment. Treatment
      outcomes for the 24 patients assigned to receive HBT will then be compared to outcomes for
      the 12 patients assigned to receive standard DBD treatment.

      Specific aims of Phase II include:

        1. finalizing the HBT treatment manual and measures of treatment fidelity, therapist
           competence, and treatment satisfaction;

        2. generating estimates of treatment effect sizes for substance use, disruptive behavior,
           and functional status outcomes, as pilot data for a larger efficacy study, and

        3. comparing treatment satisfaction for the two treatment groups.

      We hypothesize that HBT will lead to significantly lower rates of disruptive behaviors,
      substance use, and SUDs than with standard treatment, as well as greater concomitant
      improvements in impairment.
