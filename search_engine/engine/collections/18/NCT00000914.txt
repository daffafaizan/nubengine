      reduction of plasma HIV levels. It has been shown that a combination of 2 nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and a PI is the most effective barriers to disease
      progression. This study attempts to demonstrate these data.

      Two options are available for patients whose initial PI-containing regimen has failed to
      suppress viral replication.

      Option 1 consists of immediate versus deferred use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NNRTI). Patients who choose Option 1 are randomized to 1 of 2 groups:

        1. Ritonavir (RTV) plus soft gelatin capsule saquinavir (SQV-SGC) plus efavirenz (EFV).

        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC.

      Option 2 consists of treatment with a single PI versus double PI. Patients who choose Option
      2 are randomized to 1 of 2 groups:

        1. Nelfinavir (NFV) plus EFV.

        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC plus EFV.

      Patients failing NFV in Option 2 are randomized to one of two groups:

        1. Indinavir (IDV) plus EFV.

        2. RTV plus SQV-SGC plus EFV. Patients remain on study treatment regimens for 8 weeks.
           Follow-up visits, including history and physical evaluations, take place at specified
           intervals during the next 12 months.
