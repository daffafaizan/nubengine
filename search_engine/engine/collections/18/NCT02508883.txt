    
      Background: Cancer incidence is rising worldwide, therefore complications of this condition,
      such as bleeding, are also expected to be more frequently seen.

      Tumoral bleeding is usually difficult to control and the bleeding episode may represent the
      end stage of the malignant disease. In this context, it is relevant to study the performance
      of prognostic scores to prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with cancer.

      Objective: To evaluate and compare the performance of prognostic scores to predict clinical
      outcomes in a group of patients with cancer of any site that has presented a recent episode
      of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

      Design: Prospective and observational study. Setting: Cancer Institute of São Paulo;
      University of são Paulo. Patients: All patients with cancer referred to the Endoscopy Unit
      because of upper gastrointestinal bleeding will be included consecutively.

      Main Outcome Measurements: need and amount of blood transfusions administered, need for
      endoscopic therapy, surgery, rebleeding, and mortality at 30 days.
