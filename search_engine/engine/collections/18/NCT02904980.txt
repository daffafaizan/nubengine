      The TT group will be given movement-related instructions via video, relating to the throw and
      catch phases, while the QET group will also be taught to fixate a target location on the wall
      prior to the throw (QE1) and to track the ball prior to the catch (QE2). Each group will take
      part in a 4- week, group therapy intervention and measurements of QE duration obtained from a
      mobile eye tracking system and catching performance are to be taken before and after
      training, and at a 6-week delayed retention test. Parental feedback on psychosocial and motor
      skill outcomes will also be collected at delayed retention.
