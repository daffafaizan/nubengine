      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance which contains no drug) that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), multicenter
      (when more than one hospital or study team work on a medical research study) study. Study
      will enroll participants with suicidal ideation who are assessed to be at imminent risk for
      suicide. The study will consist of a screening evaluation performed within 48 hours prior to
      the Day 1 intranasal dose immediately followed by a 25-day double-blind treatment phase (Day
      1 to 25), and a 65 day follow-up phase (Day 26 to Day 90). The total study duration for each
      subject will be approximately 13 weeks. Participants' safety will be evaluated throughout the
      study. If you or a loved one are having thoughts of suicide, please seek immediate medical
      help. Go to the emergency room or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at
