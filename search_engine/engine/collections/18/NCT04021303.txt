      months. Although the introduction of gluten in this window was linked to a posible preventive
      effect on celiac disease, the truth is that it has not been demonstrated. In any case, high
      exposures to gluten since the 4 months have been associated with a higher incidence of celiac
      disease and current recommendations propose moderate and progressive exposure to gluten
      between 4 and 6 months old.
