      current smokers (n = 1000) and not current smokers (n=1000). The study team will randomly
      assign participants to a condition in which they will be exposed to either culturally
      tailored anti-smoking messages or non-tailored. Participants will receive these messages at
      baseline and 1, 2, and 3 weeks post baseline. They will be asked to complete a follow-up
      survey one month post baseline. Intentions to quit smoking as well as intention (among
      current smokers) and intention to purchase cigarettes (among current nonsmokers) will be
      measured at baseline and one-month post baseline.
