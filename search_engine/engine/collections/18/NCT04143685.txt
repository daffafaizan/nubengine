    
      Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin analogue commonly used for labor induction. It
      causes uterine contractions and ripening of the cervix. Oxytocin sold under the brand name
      Pitocin among others, is a medication made from the peptide oxytocin and is used to cause
      contraction of the uterus to start labor.

      This randomized controlled trial will compare induction of labor in women with term premature
      rupture of the membranes and unripe cervix using misoprostol versus oxytocin. The primary
      outcome is the rate of vaginal delivery. Secondary outcomes will include cesarean section
      rate, time interval from induction of labor to delivery, neonatal morbidity, patient
      satisfaction and side effects, as well as chorioamnionitis.
