      I. Determine the overall response rate of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with sunitinib malate.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the feasibility of
      administering this drug to patients with ECOG performance status 2 (cohort B).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, cohort study.

      Patients are assigned to one of two cohorts according to ECOG performance status (ECOG 0-1
      [cohort A] vs ECOG 2 [cohort B]). Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year.
