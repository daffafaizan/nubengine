      capability allows clinicians to make prudent decisions regarding antepartum care, delivery
      site, and postnatal therapy. Three-dimensional ultrasound is a recent technology that
      provides a new way to evaluate the fetus. This technique allows one to scan through a digital
      ultrasound volume dataset, visualize organs from different perspectives, measure volumes, and
      render anatomical features through computer processing. However, the accurate
      characterization of fetal anomalies by this technique must be interpreted in relation to
      normal fetal anatomy at different stages of pregnancy.

      We are continuing to develop an image reference library of fetal anatomy by identifying key
      diagnostic features by three-dimensional ultrasound. A cross-sectional observational study of
      up to 7,000 fetuses will catalog a broad spectrum of congenital malformations at various
      gestational ages. A subset of the fetuses enrolled in this protocol will also be examined by
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify potential advantages and limitations of this
      imaging modality when compared to 3DUS for the diagnosis of congenital anomalies. The
      protocol will include up to 400 examples of normal fetal anatomy by three-dimensional
      ultrasonography.

      All cases will be placed into a digital image database. For each anomaly category, volume
      data will be acquired at specific gestational ages. Key diagnostic features will be
      documented and correlated with postnatal outcome. Postnatal correlative studies may include
      ultrasound, MRI, X-ray, computerized tomography (CT), and photography. We anticipate that our
      results will permit improved diagnostic interpretation of congenital defects throughout
      pregnancy.
