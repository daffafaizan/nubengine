        -  Compare disease-specific, generic, and global quality of life measures in
           African-American survivors of breast cancer with Caucasian survivors of breast cancer.

        -  Compare these quality of life measures in African-American survivors of breast cancer
           with control group of African-American women with no history of breast cancer.
