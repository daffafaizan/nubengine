      subsequent risk of developing type 2 diabetes and this during 25 years. There is at present
      no formal recommendation of the High Authority for Health (HAS) as an organization of a long
      term screening for those women. However the recommendations of CNGOF (French Council of
      Gynaecologists and Obstetricians) and SFD (French society of diabetes) recommend screening
      for type 2 diabetes after a gestational diabetes in the postnatal consultation. But today how
      many women views due to a gestational diabetes have realized their screening? It is likely
      that the rate of occurrence of type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes is underestimated
      today. Otherwise it is possible that the occurrence of type 2 diabetes is associated with
      some risk factors such as high BMI, insulin therapy during pregnancy. Another interrogation
      is the role of the doctor to reduce the number of women who do not realize their screening at
      3 months postpartum. Better awareness of the importance of long term monitoring would reduce
      the proportion of women who do not realize their screening.
