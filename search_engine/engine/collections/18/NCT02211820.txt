      in the brains of patients with history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suspected chronic
      traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

      Study population: The proposed study will include 40 subjects. Twenty will be patients with
      history of TBI and suspected CTE and 20 will be healthy cognitively normal volunteers without
      history of TBI.

      Design: Subjects will undergo medical screening and have brain MRI and neuropsychological
      testing performed. Subjects will undergo one brain PET scan with [11C]PBB3 to detect
      aggregates of tau protein. Subjects will also have one brain PET scan with [11C]Pittsburgh
      compound B (PIB) to detect amyloid plaques. Subjects will be asked to have a lumbar puncture
      to measure CSF tau concentrations.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be the amount of [11C]PBB3 binding in the
      brain. We will quantify the radioligand s brain uptake, washout, plasma clearance, and
      distribution volume using compartmental modeling. Distribution volume of [11C]PBB3 is
      proportional to the density of insoluble paired helical filaments of tau and is equal to the
      ratio at equilibrium of uptake in brain to the concentration of parent radiotracer in plasma.
      As an exploratory measure, we will determine if there is a relationship between [11C]PBB3
      binding in brain and gray matter loss on MRI. We will also measure the amount of [11C]PIB
      binding in the brain using the Logan reference tissue method with cerebellum as reference.
