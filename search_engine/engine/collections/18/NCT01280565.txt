      membrane domain of c-Kit. Masitinib is also thought to promote survival via modulation of
      immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor microenvironment.
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of masitinib with respect
      to dacarbazine in the treatment of non-resectable or metastatic stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma
      carrying a mutation in the juxta membrane domain of c-Kit. Following a protocol amendment,
      the dacarbarzine treatment group was closed and recruitment restricted to masitinib treatment
      of chemo-na√Øve (first-line) patients.
