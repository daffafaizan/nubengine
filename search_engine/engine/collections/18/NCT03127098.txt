      escalation of ALT-803 unless de-escalation is required. The proposed phase 2 expansion study
      will give additional safety data for the MTD as well as preliminary efficacy data. Subjects
      will receive treatments unless they experience progressive disease, dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLT), withdraw consent, or if the investigator determines it is no longer in their best
      medical interest to continue treatment.
