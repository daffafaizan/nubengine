      sensitivity as well as tissue biopsies are performed in overweight untrained healthy
      participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes. During the study, an individual exercise
      training at 80% VO2max is performed for 9 weeks. Before and after the training intervention,
      acute tissue biopsies after a standardized bout of exercise are obtained.
