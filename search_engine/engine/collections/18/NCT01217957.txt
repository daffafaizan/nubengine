      people who had newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had not previously received systemic
      treatment. This study was conducted in two Phases. Phase 1 looked at side effects and lab
      results in people who took ixazomib to determine the MTD and RP2D. Phase 2 looked at overall
      response rates and side effects in people who took ixazomib.

      The study enrolled 15 patients in Phase 1 and 50 patients in Phase 2. Participants in Phase 1
      were assigned to cohorts and received ixazomib 1.68, 2.23, 2.97, or 3.95 mg/m^2 in addition
      to dexamethasone 40 mg and lenalidomide 25 mg. Participants in Phase 2 received ixazomib 4.0
      mg fixed dose in addition to dexamethasone 40 mg and lenalidomide 25 mg. In both Phases study
      treatment was administered in 28-day Cycles as follows: ixazomib Days 1, 8 and 15,
      dexamethasone Days 1, 8, 15 and 22, and lenalidomide 25 mg Days 1 through 21.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was 12, 28-day cycles with the option to continue into a maintenance portion in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants made multiple
      visits to the clinic and a final visit 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
