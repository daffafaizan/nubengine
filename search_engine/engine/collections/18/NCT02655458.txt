      reconstitution with auto-SCT consolidation therapy and lenalidomide maintenance. Fifteen
      patients will be enrolled in this study.

      This study is based on the hypothesis that the addition of Elotuzumab and autologous PBMC
      reconstitution to standard-of-care auto-SCT and lenalidomide maintenance will be safe and
      feasible. Furthermore, we hypothesize that Elotuzumab and PBMC reconstitution will target
      residual myeloma cells, enhance NK cell activation and ADCC, and promote tumor-specific
      humoral and cellular immune responses against myeloma cells, resulting in long-term
      maintenance of the minimal residual disease state.
