      implications. To a considerable extent these challenges grow out of the stigmatized nature of
      severe mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia. The social and self-stigma surrounding
      SMI can have major effects on those affected including decreased self-esteem,
      self-deprecation, and the development of a self-concept defined by the illness. When
      stigmatized interpretations of mental illness are internalized, those affected can find it
      very challenging to sustain non-illness identities and can ultimately result in the loss of
      non-illness related aspects of self-concept. Inpatient contexts are particularly challenging
      in this regard, with non-illness oriented identities very difficult to sustain given
      considerations of power differentials with providers, the reduction of autonomy and choice,
      and the removal of the individual from environments that are demonstrative of non-illness
      aspects of self.

      Accordingly, a randomized controlled trial design will be used to consider the question: Does
      having a DPF in psychiatric inpatient unit rooms lead to improvements in interactions with
      the clinical team, perceptions of enhanced quality of physical space, and an improvement in
      the sustaining of non-illness aspects of self-concept? While the promising feasibility study
      findings might suggest hypotheses of improvement in these domains, we will consider this
      study exploratory given the complex environments inpatient units represent in the study of
      care quality and outcomes and the modest scope of this intervention. Finally, we will
      continue to collect feasibility data qualitatively, to inform further refinement of metrics
      and otherwise consider enhancements in intervention and research design.
