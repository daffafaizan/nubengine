    
      In the field of soft tissue sarcomas, breast sarcomas are a truly peculiar family of rare
      tumors for both their clinical history and biology of disease.

      Surgery (if feasible) is the main therapeutic approach for all the patients with localized
      disease, while a pharmacological (chemotherapeutic) and/or radiotherapeutic treatment is
      reserved to those with high-risk/recurrent-relapsing/metastatic disease.

      Unfortunately, there is a lack of specific prospective trials in breast sarcoma to guide the
      clinical decision-making and breast sarcoma patients are often sent to sarcoma referral
      centers only after surgery Due to sarcoma-specific clinical features, it is clear that both
      diagnostic and clinical strategies mandate a different approach compared to epithelial
      tumors. This is of key importance to reach the correct diagnosis, design the best therapeutic
      decision-making and subsequent follow-up.

      Even if retrospective data limitations and biases, in the lack of prospective data
      collection, these data may be a unique and precious source of information For this reasons
      this multi-institutional retrospective study is aimed to identify the most relevant clinical
      characteristics, treatment strategies, to explore the impact on principal clinical outcomes
      and finally, to suggest some principles for management and treatment of breast sarcomas.
