      purposes to improve patient satisfaction, reduce complications and shorten the hospital stay.
      Chronic diseases, nutrition, and any volume depletion are corrected prior to surgery and less
      invasive surgical techniques are utilized to this end The impact of ERAS protocols in
      decreasing length of stay (LOS), reducing postoperative pain, improving early ambulation and
      decreasing the rate of potentially serious medical complications have been studied in
      patients undergoing colorectal, urologic, gastric and pancreatic surgery previously. However,
      data regarding the role of ERAS protocol in improving postoperative outcomes and
      postoperative compliance in patients undergoing urogynecological surgery is limited.

      The present study purposes to clarify the role of the ERAS protocol on postoperative outcomes
      in patients undergoing urogynecologic surgery.
