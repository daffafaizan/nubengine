      within a pressure chamber, a room-like chamber in which the air pressure can be varied much
      like in an airplane or submarine. Middle ear pressure will be measured in each ear by
      tympanometry, a test done by inserting a small probe (an earplug attached to a rubber or
      plastic tube that measures ear pressure) half-way into the ear canal and changing the
      pressure in the probe. Then, microphones will be placed in the ear canals and a sound source
      placed into one nostril. The chamber pressure is then decreased and increased to various
      pressures and middle ear pressure is measured at these various pressures.
