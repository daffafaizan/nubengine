    
      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed schedule study of the
      effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec®) pharmacokinetics.
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such that twelve subjects
      (6 men / 6 women) will complete the study. Gleevec® pharmacokinetics will be assessed after
      oral administration of Gleevec® and after oral administration of Gleevec® with concomitant
      administration of PPI (Prilosec® Delayed-Release Capsules). Gleevec® will be administered at
      a dose of 400 mg, and the PPI (Prilosec®) at a dose level of 40 mg daily for 6 consecutive
      days. Half of the subjects will receive Prilosec® starting 5 days before Day 1 through Day 1
      along with Gleevec® on Day 1, and Gleevec® alone on Day 15. The other half will receive
      Prilosec® on Days 10-15, along with Gleevec® on Day 15, and Gleevec® alone on Day 1. On days
      that both drugs are administered, the Prilosec® will be administered 15 minutes before the
      Gleevec® dose.
