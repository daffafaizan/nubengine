      unresectable locally advanced previously treated soft tissue sarcoma. II. Assess the clinical
      and laboratory toxic effects and patient tolerance of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 2
      weeks of rest. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first two years, then
      every 6 months for the next two years, and every 12 months thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study in 18-36 months.
