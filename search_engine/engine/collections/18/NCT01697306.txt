      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), representing the first-line option in the
      management of carcinoma in situ (CIS) and high-risk disease. In intermediate-risk NMIBC,
      however, both BCG and intravesical chemotherapy are accepted alternative adjuvant options
      since the superiority of BCG has been only established for disease recurrence but not
      progression and it needs to be balanced against higher toxicity. According to current
      evidence, BCG is considered less tolerable than intravesical chemotherapy such as mitomycin-C
      or doxorubicin, based on reported side effects. Among chemotherapeutic agents, gemcitabine
      has an excellent toxicity profile and promising efficacy in NMIBC patients, including those
      at high-risk of disease recurrence, even if its role on the management of NMIBC has not been
      well-defined yet. To our knowledge, there are no comparative studies on BCG and intravesical
      chemotherapy addressing quality of life (QoL) issues. The aim of this study was to
      prospectively evaluate and compare the QoL of intermediate-risk NMIBC patients treated with
      BCG or gemcitabine.
