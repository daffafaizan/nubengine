      reduce labour pain. The findings so far are contradictory, which may reflect methodological
      limitations. The present study will take issues into account, such as sufficiently large
      sample to allow detection of possible differences between study groups; optimal timing of the
      intervention; controlling for intensity of the treatment; qualified training of persons
      giving the treatment; biological markers of pain and stress; possible effects on mother and
      infant; women's experiences such as overall birth experience and memory of pain.
