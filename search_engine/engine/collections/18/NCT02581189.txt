      interferon-free ABBVIE REGIMEN Â± RBV in Canada. The prescription of a treatment regimen was
      at the discretion of the physician in accordance with local clinical practice and label, was
      made independently from this observational study and preceded the decision to offer the
      participant the opportunity to participate in this study. Adults chronically infected with
      HCV, receiving the interferon-free ABBVIE REGIMEN, were offered the opportunity to
      participate in this study during a routine clinical visit at the participating sites.
      Follow-up visits, treatment, procedures, and diagnostic methods followed physicians' routine
      clinical practice. Data were collected at the following time windows: baseline, early
      on-treatment visit, mid-treatment visit (for participants with a treatment duration of 24
      weeks), end of treatment (EoT), early post-treatment and 12 and 24 weeks after the end of
      treatment (representing sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment
      [SVR12] and sustained virologic response 24 weeks after the end of treatment [SVR24]).
