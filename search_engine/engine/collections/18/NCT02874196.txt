      lifetime of total hip prosthesis is approximately 15 years. Some complications are
      inevitable. Total hip prosthesis imaging, performed to search for a complication or wear, is
      difficult and depends on many techniques. Subtracted arthrography is a good technique but its
      access is limited because it needs an angiography room.

      In this study patients undergo standard arthrography, dual energy arthrography,
      arthro-tomosynthesis and arthro-tomography.
