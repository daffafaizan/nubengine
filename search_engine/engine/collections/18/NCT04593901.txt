    
      This project includes two of three original aims. The first aim (Aim 1), already completed,
      created scripts based on real-world scenarios regarding speaking with clients and families
      about health and safety hazards in their homes.

      Based on the data from Aim 1, the research team has prepared scripts describing each
      scenario. Each scenario includes two to three different approaches that represent successful,
      less successful, and/or unsuccessful examples of communicating about solving difficult or
      complex health and safety challenges. Each scenario includes a short introductory statement
      about the context of the scenario and two to three subsequent scripts and/or recordings that
      demonstrate the different communication approaches. Scenarios with successful communication
      strategies present the approach and outcomes that are consistent with best practices for
      HHW's in a given situation.

      In Aims 2 and 3, participants will participate in either an individual or group interview
      using Zoom, Teams, or similar. They will review scripted scenarios and, as they are
      developed, video recordings based on the scripted scenarios. They will answer questions about
      the relevance of the information, how realistic the dialogue is, the usefulness of the
      information, and changes/improvements they would make. In addition, participants will review
      an app designed to allow users to select the videos they wish to view, and view successful,
      less successful, and unsuccessful communication approaches and outcomes.
