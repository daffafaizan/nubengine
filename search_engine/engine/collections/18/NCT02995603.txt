      will last less than one hour. Patients will be asked to complete validated psychometric
      surveys assessing 1) their level of claustrophobia, 2) their level of anxiety and 3) their
      (baseline) motion sickness, before and after each session. They will then be rotated 3-4
      times on the Nano-X patient rotation system, at varying speeds ranging from 6°/sec to
      45°/sec. Each rotation will be designed to simulate a typical radiotherapy treatment; that is
      9 angles, pausing for around 30 seconds at each angle. Straight after each rotation, patients
      will again complete the questionnaire assessing their anxiety levels and motion sickness.
