      colorectal cancer (CRC) were included in the present study. Intra-Surgery complications,
      Previous surgery, Readmission Post Intervention, Location of surgery, Duration of Surgery,
      Re-intervention (yes), Clearance, and CRM were collected. Subjects commonly shared overweight
      or obesity. The investigators aimed to define any difference between the two different groups
      (open vs laparoscopic-assisted surgery) and a series of outcomes, i.e. hospitalization, Lymph
      nodes number, Intra-Surgery complications, and Clavien Dindo score.
