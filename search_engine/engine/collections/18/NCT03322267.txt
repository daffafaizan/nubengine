      diagnosed locally advanced ESCC patients (clinically staged at least T3 and/or any N and M0
      by endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS] and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography
      [FDG-PET]) who have received preoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by
      surgery, and exhibit high risk (closed or involved resection margin or extranodal invasion of
      involved lymph nodes) of tumor recurrence. Eligible patients will receive adjuvant
      cisplatin-based CRT followed by pembrolizumab for 18 cycles.The study will enroll 46 patients
      in Taiwan. The estimated enrollment period is 2 years.
