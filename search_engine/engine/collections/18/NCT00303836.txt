    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the ability of gp100 and MART-1 peptide vaccines with or without a high-dose
      interleukin-2 (IL-2), when administered after a nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative
      regimen and reinfusion of autologous CD25+ T-regulatory-depleted lymphocytes, to mediate
      tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the generation of antitumor lymphocytes and the rate of repopulation of CD25+
      T-regulatory cells in patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo apheresis and in-vitro depletion of T-regulatory cells. Patients then
      receive a nonmyeloablative, lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen comprising
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -8 and -7 and fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes on
      days -6 to -2 followed by autologous T-regulatory-depleted lymphocytes IV over 20-30 minutes
      on day 0. Patients receive vaccination with gp100:209-217 (210M) and MART-1:27-35 peptides
      emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-3, 20-23, 41-44, and 62-65.
      Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood
      counts recover.

      ARM II: Patients receive treatment as in arm I. Patients also receive high-dose IL-2 IV over
      15 minutes every 8 hours on days 0-4, beginning after the lymphocyte infusion. IL-2 treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 1-3 months.
