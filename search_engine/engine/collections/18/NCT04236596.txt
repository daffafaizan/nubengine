      stimulation of this nerve can help with bladder problems and pelvic pain. Researchers do not
      understand how the nerve anatomy is different between people. Successfully mapping the
      pudendal nerve may help improve the medical care for future patients with bladder problems,
      pelvic pain, bowel problems, and sexual problems.
