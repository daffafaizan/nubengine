      desflurane on tissue microcirculation in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass
      surgery. Eligible patients are going to be randomized to receive sevoflurane or desflurane,
      as a maintenance anesthetic, during the surgery. Tissue oxygen saturation and
      microcirculatory changes, such as an occlusion and recovery slope, during vascular occlusion
      test will be recorded during the surgery. The primary end point of the study is the
      difference in tissue oxygen saturation between the groups.
