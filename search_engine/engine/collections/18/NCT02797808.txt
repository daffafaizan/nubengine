      functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging
      (HARDI), in 25 medication-free adolescents youths with OCD (ages 8-17) in comparison with 25
      matched healthy controls.

      Hypotheses: (A) Based on the pilot data, adolescents youths with OCD will show lower
      functional connectivity in FSTC at baseline when compared with controls, and , lower
      functional connectivity in FSTC will correlate with greater severity on CY-BOCS. (B)
      Adolescents Youths with OCD will also show abnormalities in structural connectivity in FSTC
      at baseline when compared with controls, and structural and functional connectivity will be
      related. (C) The investigators will explore relations between OCD dimensions and functional
      connectivity measures, and predict that the repeating/ordering dimension will correlate with
      orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) connections, hoarding will correlate with rostral anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) connections, and forbidden thoughts will correlate with caudal ACC
      connections.

      To investigate how sertraline impacts functional connectivity in FSTC in adolescents with
      OCD.

      Hypothesis: After 12 weeks of sertraline treatment, functional connectivity measures within
      FSTC for the OCD group will (on average) increase compared to baseline and will no longer be
      significantly different when compared with controls. Non-responders may show a different
      pattern (i.e. failure to show these changes).
