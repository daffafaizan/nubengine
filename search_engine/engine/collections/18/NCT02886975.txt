      disease(CKD), by reducing the accumulation of nitrogen catabolic substances, and by delaying
      the progress of CKD and proteinuria, but the effects of the low protein diet on renal failure
      progression rate remain to be determined.The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      low protein diet and Î±-keto acid tablet in retard the progress of CKD. This is a prospective
      study, 100 patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included. The changes
      of glomerular filtration rate in CKD and time to renal replacement will be evaluated after 1
      year treatment.
