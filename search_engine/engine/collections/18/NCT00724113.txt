      distension and intensive mobilisation at 2, 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. It is a bicentric

      trial using 2 groups in parallel. The number of patients to be included is 66. The treatment
      that is evaluated associates ARTHRO distension followed by mobilisation of the shoulder 6
      hours per day during 5 days, and then sessions of physiotherapy for 4 weeks. The control
