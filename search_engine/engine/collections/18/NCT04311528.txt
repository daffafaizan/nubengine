      in a study involving the 9-valent HPV vaccine. For clarification, women who are pregnant are
      eligible to sign consent, but the first vaccine will not occur until after delivery. Vaccine
      # 1 must occur within seven days of delivery.

      The main objective of the study is to determine the immunogenicity of the vaccine in
      postpartum women. The immunogenicity results will be compared to that of non-postpartum women
      of the same age, 16-45.

      Women will participate for approximately 12 months and will complete a total of 4 visits
      during that time frame.
