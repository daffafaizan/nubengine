      enrolled in the study. The study will look at the changes in the participants body
      composition post cancer treatment using the SOZO device. The SOZO device is intended to
      estimate the following body composition parameters: Fluid status (TBW, ECF, ICF), Total body
      composition (fat free mass, fat mass, % of weight), Metabolic report (active tissue mass,
      extracellular mass, basal metabolic rate), Skeletal muscle mass, Phase angle, Body mass index
      (BMI), Weight, and Hydration index (Hy-Dex) analysis. Participants will have 5 study visits
      during 12 weeks where SOZO measurements will be taken as well as other study measurements.
