      The limitation of these blocks is the incomplete analgesia they provide of the knee joint
      subjecting the patient to posterior knee pain. As a result, some of these patients receive
      rescue sciatic blocks in the postoperative care unit to cover posterior knee pain. The
      sciatic block provides excellent analgesia for the posterior knee; however its blockade
      invariably affects other territories of the sciatic nerve such as the lower leg and foot. For
      ACL surgery, the loss of sensation and/or motor strength to this area is unnecessary and may
      make ambulation more difficult. The ability to ambulate with minimal assistance may be more
      important for a patient undergoing an outpatient surgery when compared to an inpatient
      surgery.

      At the posterior knee, the sciatic nerve branches off into the tibial and common peroneal
      nerves which give rise to sensory fibers that innervate the posterior knee. We propose
      targeting these terminal fibers in the popliteal fossa by infiltrating local anesthetic
      between the distal femoral shaft and popliteal artery thereby providing posterior knee
      analgesia without affecting the lower leg.This application of this block has not been studied
      in patients having ACL surgery. A single interim analysis is scheduled after the data for 50
      cases are available.
