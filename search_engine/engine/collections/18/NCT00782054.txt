      during wound healing. Damaged nerve endings, substance P, mast cells releasing histamines,
      and presence of inflammatory prostaglandins can induce neuropathic and peripheral
      pruritoceptive itching. Absence of oil glands leading to dry skin and itching further
      aggravate the itching.

      Swiss-American Products, Inc, has developed new non-prescription skin products containing a
      blend of endopeptidase enzymes in a moisturizer base to aid the body during recovery from
      injury and inflammation. In Stage II and III pressure ulcers, an amorphous hydrogel
      containing the enzymes was observed to help resolve inflammation and enhance healing.
      Anecdotal reports indicate a fast release cream with the enzymes, applied to insect stings
      and bites on intact skin resolved the itching and reduced, sometimes even preventing, edema.
      In a case study of chronic persistent contact dermatitis, one product was successfully used
      for immediate relief of pruritus and the slow release version was used for relief at night.
      Several centers have independently reported the resolution of pruritus associated with
      cellulitis in subjects with chronic wounds.

      The hypothesis that itching can be reduced through the use of endopeptidase enzyme containing
      product in the post burn population will be tested. The use of the product has not been
      previously evaluated in burn subjects with pruritus. The primary objective of the
      preliminarily study would be to detect reduction of post burn itching through the use of the
      endopeptidase enzyme containing product.
