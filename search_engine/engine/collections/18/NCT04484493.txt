    
      This study willbe submitted on patients who recently recovered from proven COVID-19 infection
      and complaining of anosmia or hyposmia.The proven COVID-19 infection will be relied on a
      positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with samples
      obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab. The recovery is defined as 2 consecutives negative
      (rRT-PCR) samples.

      Complete medical history will be taken, and essential clinical assessment with appropriate
      protective measures will be performed in all patients.The patients in the study will be
      randomly divided into two groups: - Group I: -who will receive topical corticosteroid nasal
      spray (mometasone furoate nasal spray) beside olfactory training Group II: -who will not
      receive topical corticosteroid nasal spray but only olfactory training.

      As regards the assessment of smell,the patient will assess his smell sensation using familiar
      substances with distinctive odor. A jar of coffee, a branch of mint and garlic are some used
      substances. The patient will report the degree of anosmia subjectively with score on a scale
      from 0 to 10.The assessment of smell will be done initially after recovery/discharge, after 1
      week, 2 weeks and after 3 weeks for all patients. The duration of smell loss will be recorded
      from the onset of anosmia till full recovery of the sensation.
