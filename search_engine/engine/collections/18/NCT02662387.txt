    
      Acute respiratory failure secondary to bronchiolitis is one of the most common diagnoses in
      children admitted to pediatric intensive care unit.

      Objectives: The primary outcome of the study is to compare the respiratory parameters between
      patients on high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and HFNC with an external nasal dilator (END).

      Methods: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. All children admitted to Loma
      Linda University Children's Hospital between July 2015 and May 2017 for approximately 22
      months due to acute respiratory failure secondary to bronchiolitis are eligible for inclusion
      in the study. Two arms will be studied, one with HFNC and the other with HFNC and ENDS.
      Modified Bronchiolitis Severity Score will be used to assess respiratory parameters as part
      of the study. The investigators anticipate that use of END will have a positive impact on the
      respiratory status of children with acute respiratory failure. Appropriate statistical
      analysis of the data will occur after the data has been de-identified.
