      Columbia Canada who have treatment refractory severe depressive illness. This study will
      report on the outcome of patients who have received this intervention. BAC is achieved by
      stereotactic radiofrequency lesioning. To date 8 patients have received BAC. For all patients
      there is follow-up data of at least 24 months. The purpose of this retrospective study is to
      report on the surgical protocol and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of BAC in severe
      depression.
