      angina and non-ST-elevation ACS and history of AF will be included in this study. After PCI
      and DES implantation TEE will be performed for assessing LAA anatomy and size eligible for
      left atrial appendage closure device implantation. After screening all patients will be
      randomized in two groups. The first (control) group will receive standard antiplatelet and
      anticoagulation therapy according to the guidelines (2), the second group of patients will
      undergo left atrial appendage closure device implantation. After the PCI the first group will
      take Triple therapy (warfarin + clopidogrel+aspirin) during 45 days and after combination of
      warfarin+clopidogrel to 6 months after procedure and then only warfarin. The second group
      will take Triple therapy (warfarin+clopidogrel+aspirin) during 45 days following PCI and
      after control TEE, warfarin will be discontinued. Then patients from the second group will
      take DAPT combination (clopidogrel+aspirin) to 6 months after procedure and then only
      aspirin. Patients will be followed at 45 day, and every 3 months during 12 months of follow
      up (Figure 1). At each follow-up visits the data regarding clinical events and healthcare
      utilization will be collected.
