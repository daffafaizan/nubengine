      sample consists of 90 free-living participants aged 20-35 years. The participants will
      undergo a series of assessments in the domains of diet, physiological factors, and behavioral
      factors at baseline and every 12 months for 2 years.

      OBJECTIVES

        1. Identify dietary, physiological, genetic and behavioral determinants of unhealthy weight
           gain in healthy, young, ethnically-mixed men and women.

        2. Identify relationships between genetic measures of taste perception and the determinants
           of unhealthy weight gain in the said population.

        3. Identify relationships among the determinants of unhealthy weight gain that contribute
           to an individual's susceptibility to obesity.
