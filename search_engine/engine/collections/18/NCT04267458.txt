      acting antiviral treatment. Most case reports and retrospective studies reported the presence
      of an intrinsic cause of renal injury, with most of the available biopsies showing acute
      tubular necrosis (ATN) and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Most of these patients had
      returned to baseline renal function on cessation of sofosbuvir combination therapy.

      Recently it was found that a notable percentage of patients experienced a transient increase
      in creatinine during therapy, which could occasionally lead to a more than 50% decrease in
      patients' eGFR. Previous studies had also shown that the co-use of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and recurrent ascites were at increased risk for AKI during
      sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to investigate the occurrence of AKI in Egyptian
      patients during antiviral therapy and to highlight its reasons and time of incidence in
      addition to the mechanism of this injury.
