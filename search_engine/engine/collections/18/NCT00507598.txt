      the time of diagnosis and during the course of treatment, using patient tissue and serum
      samples. Samples of serum (1 ml) and tissue specimens (50 mg each) from colorectal cancer
      patients (stages I-IV) and serum samples from an equal number of age and gender-matched
      healthy controls will be obtained under identical (8-hour overnight fasting) conditions.
      Metabolic profiles will be identified using the NMR and MS instruments located in Purdue's
      on-campus NMR and MS facilities. Multivariate statistical analyses will be used to monitor
      changing metabolite profiles that indicate changes in disease status. We anticipate that
      putative biomarkers will be easier to identify in the cancerous tissue, and the
      concentrations of these metabolites will then be quantified in the patients' serum, that
      ultimately would allow for easier detection of colon cancer.
