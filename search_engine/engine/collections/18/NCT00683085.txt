      from HLA-A2/Kd transgenic murine model.

      HLA-A*02:01-restricted VEGFR1-specific CTL clones were also obtained from peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells of healthy volunteer donors.

      These CTL clones showed potent anti-tumor CTL responses in HLA class â… -restricted manner in
      vitro.

      Vaccination of HLA-A*02:01-restricted VEGFR1-specific peptide to A2/Kd transgenic mice
      markedly suppress the tumor-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo.
