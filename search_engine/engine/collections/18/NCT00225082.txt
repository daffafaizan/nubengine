      lamivudine) for greater than 6 years through the Abbott M97-720 protocol with be evaluated
      for clinical lipoatrophy and mitochondrial function prior to switching nucleoside analogues
      from stavudine (d4T) to tenofovir and after 48 weeks or tenofovir treatment.

      Subjects with or without lipoatrophy are eligible for the study. Adipose tissue biopsies to
      measure mitochondrial function, metabolic laboratory tests, and DAXA scans and clinical
      evaluations of lipodystrophy will be performed at Entry and after 48 weeks of tenofovir
