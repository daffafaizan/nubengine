    
      This is prospective, comparative clinical evaluation to investigate whether there is a
      reduction in the skin-to-skin time of the first surgical debridement with VERSAJET™, compared
      to conventional debridement techniques. Skin-to-skin time is defined as the time of incision
      to the end time of debridement (wound ready for dressing application). Conventional
      debridement is defined as scalpel plus pulse lavage.

      The purpose of this comparison is to demonstrate the resource savings which VERSAJET™ may
      provide in terms of operating room (OR) and personnel time, in addition to the potential to
      reduce the procedure, and possibly anaesthetic, time for the patient. It is envisaged that
      this information, combined with the costs associated with the procedure, will also provide
      valuable economic data to help justify the use of VERSAJET™ from a financial perspective and
      support the future commercial success of the device.
