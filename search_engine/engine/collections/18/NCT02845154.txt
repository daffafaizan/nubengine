      ischemia time is minimal and the graft contents of preservative solution are less than
      cadaveric grafts. The investigators in the current research use HTC as a preservative
      solution. These factors justified the possibility of purging the graft and portal blood
      contents into the patient systemic circulation. The exposure to these fluids in this trial
      will be in an intermittent manner: the portal vein will be declamped for 5 seconds followed
      by 30 seconds of portal clamping. This will be repeated twice. The primary outcome objective
      in this trial will be the incidence of post-reperfusion syndrome. Secondary objectives
      include the severity of PRS, the incidence and severity of ischemia-reperfusion injury, graft
      and patient's survival.
