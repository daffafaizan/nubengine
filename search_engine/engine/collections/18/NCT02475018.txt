      cholesterol (TC) level above 5.18mmol/L and triglyceride (TG) level lower than 2.25mmol/L
      were assigned to 500ml of low lactose milk enriched with 1.58g plant sterol esters or 500ml
      plain milk without plant sterols (placebo) or without any dairy product consumption (control)
      for 60 days. Subjects were instructed to maintain stable diet pattern and physical activity.
      Plasma concentrations of TC,TG,LDL cholesterol(LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol(HDL-C) were
      measured at initial visits, after 30days and after 60 days. The primary measurement was the
      change in TC. Secondary measurements were changes in TG,LDL-C and HDL-C.
