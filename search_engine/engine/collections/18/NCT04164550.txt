      rates, quality of life outcomes, and nasal function after interpolated flap repair of
      post-Mohs surgical defects of the nose. Our primary outcome is the incidence of short-term
      complications(within 4 weeks of surgery) defined by the American College of Mohs Surgery as:
      death, bleeding requiring additional intervention, functional loss attributable to surgery,
      hospitalization for an operative complication, and surgical site infection. Secondary
      outcomes will include incidence of flap necrosis and evaluation of quality of life at 1, 4
      and 16 weeks after repair. Quality of life will be investigated using the Skin Cancer Index
      (SCI)- a skin cancer specific quality of life instrument and the Nasal Appearance and
      Functional Evaluation Questionnaire (NAFEQ). Previous literature has demonstrated that Mohs
      surgery in the outpatient setting has a very low complication rate but this literature is
      generally limited to single-institution studies or studies examining smaller repairs.
      Furthermore, it has been proven that receiving a skin cancer diagnosis is stressful and
      patient satisfaction with skin cancer surgery is related to their appearance and scarring or
      changes in appearance can decrease quality of life. Our study serves to fill the current
      literature knowledge gaps by examining repair of large defects and looking at both
      complications and quality of life outcomes. Data collection will begin pre-operatively on
      patients 18 and older who require an interpolated flap repair of a post-Mohs surgical defect.
      These patients will then be followed and asked to complete SCI and NAFEQ surveys as well as
      complication questionnaires at prescribed intervals. All data will be stored via a secure
      RedCap database.
