      of OPC in HIV and/or AIDS patients. We will aim to establish the resistance pattern for
      azoles but also for Flucytosine and amphotericin of these isolates.

      This study will serve as a support to previously published articles that have suggested
      intrinsic azole-resistance within this particular species of candida and we will try to
      postulate its possible correlation with clinical failure.
