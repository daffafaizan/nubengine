      the antibody blocks signal transduction through the receptor with a subsequent inhibition of
      tumor cell proliferation and MMP expression. We hypothesize that peri-operative weekly
      administration of Cetuximab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to EGF receptor (EGFR), for 3
      weeks immediately prior to surgery and for 3 weeks immediately after colon cancer surgery is
      safe. This drug has been demonstrated to be effective in Stage 4 colon cancer patients and is
      approved for use in colorectal cancer patients. Cetuximab has never been administered in the
      month immediately before or after colon surgery. Establishing the safety of Cetuximab in the
      perioperative setting is the primary objective of this study.
