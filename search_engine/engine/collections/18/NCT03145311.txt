      stimulation (rTMS) on drug induced tardive syndromes.

      the effect of rTMS compare. Twenty patients with drug induced tardive syndromes were
      recruited from the outpatient clinic of Aswan University Hospital. The patients were
      classified into two equal groups, 1st group received real 20 Hz-rTMS at 100% RMT (a total of
      2000 pulses to each hand area consisting of 10 trains of 200 pulses with intertrain interval
      30 s), and the 2nd group received sham stimulation with the same pulse delivery as the 1st
      group but with the coil placed perpendicular to the scalp. For each patient 10 sessions were
      administered once per day for 5 consecutive days each week for two weeks. All patients were
      assessed before rTMS and immediately after the end of the 10 sessions. The patients did not
      know which type of stimulation they received and to ensure that, the study was double blinded
      the doctor who assessed the patients didn't know which type of stimulation the patients
      received. None of the patients had had rTMS before and were unaware of the type of
      stimulation.The AIMS scale and different parameters of cortical excitability were assessed
      before and after the end of session treatment.
