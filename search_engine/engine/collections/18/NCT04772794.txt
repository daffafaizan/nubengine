      oxygen concentrations, however, vary between 30% - 100% and oxygen is often administered in a
      seemingly random manner.A striking conundrum is evident immediately when one review studies
      on the effects of oxygen on cytokines synthesis. Most investigators have found that hyperoxia
      enhances proinflammtory cytokines transcription and translations (11). In contrast,
      hyperparic oxygen has generally been shown to suppress stimulus induced porinflammtory
      cytokine production (12). Other studies have demonstrated that supplemental oxygen improves
      inflammatory and immune function (13), and it is not associated with clinically important
      side effect (14). We therefor undertook the current prospective randomized study to
      investigate whether perioperative supplemental oxygen (30% versus 80%) on pro and
      anti-inflammatory response in patients undergoing major abdominal cancer surgeries as our
      primary outcome.
