      concerning both efficacity and tolerance. Pharmacokinetic is poorly known.

      A knowledge of individual susceptibility factors would allow to better adapt therapy in each
      case.

      Drugs evaluated here are used in routine care in children and will be prescribed according to
      department practices concerning treated disease. Medical checks will be done during usual
      follow-up. Several features will be collected: reason of treatment, drug chosen and
      prescription modalities, observance, concomitant treatments, side effects, clinical
      examination, photography, scoreâ€¦ Blood samples will be performed at different interval during
      usual biological follow-up. Three samples per patient will be required for pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacogenetic.

      170 children under prednisone/prednisolone and 130 under methylprednisolone will be recruited
      in three pediatric medical departments: immuno-hematology, nephrology and dermatology.
