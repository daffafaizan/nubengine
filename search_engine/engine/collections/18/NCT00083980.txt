      disorders. Several studies suggest that KAV may be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms;
      however, trial data are limited. This study will compare KAV, the drug venlafaxine-XR (VEN),
      and placebo for the treatment of GAD.

      This study will last 10 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive KAV, VEN, or
      placebo for 8 weeks. Participants will then undergo a 1-week tapering of their medication
      followed by an additional week of observation. Self-report scales and questionnaires will be
      used to assess the anxiety, depression, and functional impairment of participants. Side
      effects, vital signs, and laboratory measures will be monitored throughout the study.
