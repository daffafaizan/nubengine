      of PWMLs and CGs. The primary outcome in PWML will be self-rated quality of life (Quality of
      Life in Alzheimer's Disease, QOL-AD). Secondary outcomes will include: a) self-reported
      emotional well-being; b) self-reported social isolation; c) self-reported mobility; and d)
      directly assess cognitive performance. In CGs, the primary outcome will be self-rated quality
      of life (SF-12). Secondary outcomes in CGs will include: a) healthy days; b) self-efficacy;
      c) burden; d) social isolation; e) ability to self-regulate; f) positive affect; and g) sleep
      quality. In addition, the investigators will ask CGs to report sleep quality, mobility, and
      cognitive function for PWML. Additional exploratory outcomes will include health services
      utilization (hospitalizations, emergency department visits) and falls.

      In addition to the RCT, the investigators propose to compare health utilization outcomes in
      study participants to a matched 'no contact' comparison sample of patients with dementia
      diagnoses who receive care in the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Health
      system.
