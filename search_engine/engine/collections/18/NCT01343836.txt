      pain is unclear, the term tendinopathy is preferred. Most accepted treatment at this moment
      is an eccentric exercise programme, according to the Dutch guidelines. However, a recent
      systematic review on the effectiveness of eccentric exercises to treat lower extremity
      tendinoses concluded that it is unclear whether eccentric exercises are more effective than
      other forms of treatment. Recent studies described new treatment strategies in
      tendinopathies, such as the use autologous Tenocyte Implantation (ATI). This treatment option
      can participate actively in tissue repair processes on cell level. The only published
      clinical pilot study in tendon research reported 60% improvement in all scores after 6 months
      follow-up.
