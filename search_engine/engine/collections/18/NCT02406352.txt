      mounted on a custom-made colposcope that acquires a sequence of fluorescence images. This
      version of the MDC incorporates an upgraded light source, and updates the firmware and the
      user interface. This results in shorter acquisition times and improved image and spectrum
      quality control. The MDC also consists of a point probe that is used to take detailed light
      measurements (call spectroscopy) from smaller regions of the cervix. The goal of the study is
      to see whether the MDC can perform better than standard methods in detecting cancerous or
      pre-cancerous abnormalities of the cervix.

      Study subjects will be swabbed for detection and typing of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).
      After vinegar is applied on the cervix as per usual colposcopy practice, the MDC will then be
      used to take a sequence of images of the cervix. Next 2-4 readings will be taken from the
      cervix using the point probe.

      This data will be used to train, test and validate an algorithm specific to the MDC. The
      ability of the algorithm to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia will be compared to
      standard clinical care (colposcopy).

      The MDC images and pathology results will be compared to the spectroscopy data from the MDC
      probe. The investigators will determine if spectroscopy has equal sensitivity to colposcopy
      for detecting high grade lesions.
