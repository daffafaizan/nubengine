      consensus on minimizing the use of analgesic drugs in patients undergoing total
      thyroidectomy. Therefore, alternative methods need to be investigated in order to reduce
      postoperative pain. Although the clinical importance of music has been recognised in other
      pathological situations, further research is needed to investigate the effect of music on
      postoperative pain.
