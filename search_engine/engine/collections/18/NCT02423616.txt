      maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) in healthy individuals. All individuals underwent
      assessment of inspiratory muscle strength by maximum inspiratory pressure, and evaluation of
      hand grip strength. MIP was measured using a U-type water manometer calibrated in centimetre
      of water (cmH2O), while the HGS was measured with hydraulic hand dynamometer calibrated in
      Kg.
