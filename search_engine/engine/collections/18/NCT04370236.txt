    
      The trial is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of INB03
      in participants with pulmonary complications due to COVID-19 infection.

      Patients with COVID-19 infection and low blood oxygen levels with at least one high risk
      factor (see below) are eligible to participate in a 40-day study to determine whether INB03
      can prevent the progression of pulmonary complications.

      Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either INB03 + standard of care
      (SOC) or Placebo + SOC. Participants randomized to INB03 + SOC will receive a 1mg/kg
      injection of INB03 after randomization. Patients that remain in the hospital 7 days after the
      first dose will receive a second dose. A final safety visit will occur on Day 70.
