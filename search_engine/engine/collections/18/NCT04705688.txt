    
      This is an open-label observational prospective registry. The aim is to develop a better
      understanding of coagulation, platelet reactivity and prothrombotic factors in the first
      months after left atrial appendage occlusion, as occurrence of device-related thrombus and
      optimal postprocedural management remain a challenge after LAAO.

      The study population will consist of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) at
      risk for cardio-embolic stroke scheduled for left atrial appendage occlusion. In these
      patients, blood samples for coagulation and platelet reactivity testing will be taken, which
      will be gathered prior to the procedure and 1 day, 14 days, 3 months and 6 months after the
      procedure. Data will be analyzed longitudinally and between groups based on patient
      characteristics.
