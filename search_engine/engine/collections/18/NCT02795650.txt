      Patients with metastatic disease will be randomised to the experimental or control arms.
      Those in the experimental arm will undergone a tumoral biopsy in order to perform exome
      sequencing, bioinformatic report, and avatar mouse models for drug testing. This information
      will allow the expertise panel to elaborate a treatment recommendation as second or third
      lines of treatment. Patients in the control arm will receive treatment as per investigatorÂ´s
