      hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver
      disease, etc.) to cirrhosis and an important link that affects the prognosis of chronic liver
      disease. Fibrosis is histologically reversible, and early liver fibrosis can still be
      reversed to restore liver tissue to normal. However, due to the lack of specific initial
      symptoms and accurate non-invasive diagnostic methods, the onset of liver fibrosis is
      insidious. Most patients have developed liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma when
      they are diagnosed, and some even require liver transplantation. If liver fibrosis can be
      diagnosed accurately and treated early, the prognosis of chronic liver disease can be
      improved.

      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis and staging of
      liver fibrosis. Activation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is a key link in the
      pathophysiological development of liver fibrosis. In human liver tissue, fibroblast
      activation protein (FAP) was only expressed in active HSCs and fibroblasts, but not in static
      HSCs. Therefore, FAP has become an excellent target for diagnosis and treatment of liver
      fibrosis. Recently, radionuclide-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) as a
      new novel positron tracer has shown to be effective to detect various cancers. In this
      prospective study, the investigators will use the most advanced imaging equipments,
      integrated PET/MR, and PET/CT with gallium-68 (68Ga) -FAPI to image patients with or
      suspected of liver fibrosis, the aim is to explore the value of 68Ga-FAPI hybrid PET/MR and
      PET/CT in liver fibrosis.
