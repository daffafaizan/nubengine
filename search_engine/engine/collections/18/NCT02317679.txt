      the outcomes are highly variable due to the new angiogenesis occurring after laser
      irradiation. Studies suggest that endothelin is involved in the neoangiogenesis that occurred
      after treatment of port-wine stains by PDL . The main objective of this pilot clinical trial
      is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an inhibitor of endothelin orally taken, the
      Bosentan, following PDL treatment. Four patients with facial port-wine stain resistant to the
      PDL treatment will be included. The treatment by Bosentan (2 mg/kg twice daily, maximum 62,5
      mg twice daily) will be given one day before the PDL irradiation (maximum surface 100 cmÂ²)
      and continued for 14 days. Only one test area of PWS will be treated with PDL. The primary
      outcome measure will be an important or complete improvement (Investigator Global Assessment
      3 or 4) between treated area and non treated one, 14 days after the end of the treatment
      which corresponds to one month after the laser PDL session. The evaluation will been
      performed on standardized pictures by 2 independent physicians blinded to the region treated
      or not.
