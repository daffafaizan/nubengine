      Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system,
      motor function, balance and quality of life in chronic stroke patients. It is a prospective,
      single-blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of Research of the courses of
      Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of SÃ£o Paulo University. Forty
      chronic stroke patients are randomly in control and experimental group, 20 each one. Both
      groups conduct 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session will consist
      a 30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and axial mobility
      exercises. After this, both groups will performed more 30 minutes of balance training: the
      control group will performed balance exercises without external cues, visual or auditory
      feedbacks or cognitive stimulations; the experimental group will performed the balance
      training with 8 Wii Fit games which stimulate motor and cognitive functions. The main outcome
      measures will be: (1) the lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE); (2);
      Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest);(3) the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL);
      (4) 6- minute walk test (6MWT) and (5) The limits of stability (LOS).
