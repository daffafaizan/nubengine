      ergometer to assess maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and peak power output (PPO), which was
      used to determine workload for the subsequent 2 bouts. They returned at least 48 h later at
      the same time of day to complete high intensity interval training (HIIT consisting of
      repeated 1 min bouts at 85 %PPO) or moderate intensity continuous training (MICT consisting
      of 25 min at 40 %PPO). During exercise, heart rate, oxygen uptake, perceived exertion,
      pleasure:displeasure, and blood lactate concentration were continuously assessed. Ten minutes
      post-exercise, physical activity enjoyment was measured. Data showed that despite higher
      oxygen uptake, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and perceived exertion in HIIT,
      enjoyment was higher in HIIT versus MICT.
