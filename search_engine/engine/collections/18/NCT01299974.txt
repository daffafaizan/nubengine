    
      A specific patient and family centered care module will be implemented in the context of an
      existing training rotation. This module includes a meeting between resident physicians
      (trainees) and parents of previously hospitalized children (members of the Family Faculty in
      our institution), monitored by a senior faculty member. Patient and family centered care will
      be discussed using predefined, manual-driven guidance. This meeting is followed by a
      discussion with the faculty member to identify core components of family-centered care as
      exemplified in the parent interview.
