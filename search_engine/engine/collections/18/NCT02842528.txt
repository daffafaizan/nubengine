      has a rather high degree of heritability (estimates range between 40% and 60%), vulnerability
      to alcohol dependence is broadly recognised as a complex polygenic phenotype. To clarify the
      risk factors involved in alcohol dependence, attempts have been made to identify
      endophenotypes in alcohol dependent patients and their relatives. Endophenotypes are defined
      as heritable traits associated with an increased risk for developing a disorder; they must be
      found in probands and their unaffected relatives at a higher rate than in the general
      population and must be associated with a specific genetic pattern. In the present study the
      investigators investigate the cognitive performance of alcohol dependent patients in
      comparison with a group of adult non-alcoholic offspring of alcohol-dependent patients and a
      group of participants without family history of alcohol dependence. The investigators also
      explore the relation between familial density of alcoholism and cognitive performance,
      particularly mental flexibility and inhibition. Genetic analysis will also be conducted to
      investigate the relationship between cognitive performance and genetic patterns (single
      nucleotide polymorphisms).
