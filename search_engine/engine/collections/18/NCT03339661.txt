      treatment predicts the absence of virological and clinical relapses. This is a pilot study
      that will be conducted in the transplant center of Bordeaux and Lyon. After the curative
      treatment of CMV infection until a negative CMV ADNemia, secondary prophylaxis with
      valganciclovir will be established based on the results of γδ T cells immunomonitoring:

      (I) Secondary prophylaxis will not be started in patients with γδ T cell expansion at the end
      of curative treatment (group 1) (II) Secondary prophylaxis will be initiated in patients who
      have not γδ T cell expansion and will continue for 3 months maximum. The occurrence of γδ T
      cells expansion during or at the end of secondary prophylaxis will define the group 2A.
      Patients who still not had γδ T cells expansion during or at the end of secondary prophylaxis
      will compose the group 2B.

      The primary outcome of this study will be to evaluate the occurrence of virological relapse,
      assessed by monitoring CMV ADNemia, at one year of a first CMV disease, in kidney transplant
      patients, with secondary prophylaxis based on the monitoring of γδ T cells.
