      biology-environment interactions, which may have important implications for treatment, and
      for our understanding of the etiology of ADHD. Although impulsivity is highly heritable,
      long-term changes in biological systems implicated in impulsive behavior can be effected
      through intervention as shown by a 61% increase in electrodermal activity 6-8 years later in
      at-risk preschool children who were randomized to the intervention condition compared with
      controls randomized to no treatment condition. Early intervention may therefore be essential
      if dysregulated trajectories in responding within these systems are to be prevented and/or
      altered.

      Atomoxetine (ATMX) blocks the NE transporter (NET), and increases extracellular levels of NE
      throughout the brain. It is the first nonstimulant drug approved by the FDA for the treatment
      of ADHD. Recent clinical studies have shown that ATMX significantly reduces symptoms of ADHD
      as observed by parents and teachers. ATMX has been shown to improve response inhibition in
      ADHD.

      In the proposed research, pre- and post-treatment bio-behavioral and autonomic markers of
      impulsivity will be assessed in preschool children with ADHD who participate in a double
      blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover treatment with a selective NET inhibitor,
      atomoxetine, and placebo.
