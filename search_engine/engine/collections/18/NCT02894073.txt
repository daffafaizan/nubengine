      anaesthesia and perhaps even in the field of medicine as a whole. This procedure may be
      challenging in the obese patient - even for the most experienced healthcare professionals.

      In a study, PVC placement was considered to be difficult in 46% of obese patients but only
      13% of non-obese patients.

      Placement of a central venous catheter is an option when PVC placement is impossible,
      although central access is associated with a non-negligible risk of complications
      (pneumothorax, infection, arterial puncture, etc.).

      Facilitating peripheral venous access in obese patients should shorten the time required for
      PVC placement, decrease the number of perfusion attempts (a source of dissatisfaction and
      discomfort for the patients) and limit the use of a central venous catheter.

      Although a number of novel vein visualisation devices (such as the VeinViewerÂ®Vision from
      Christie Medical) have been developed to guide PVC placement, there are no literature data on
      the value of these devices in the management of difficult venous access in obese patients.
