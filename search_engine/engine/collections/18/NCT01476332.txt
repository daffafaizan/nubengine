    
      This is a Phase I single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose
      study to evaluate safety, ocular tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 0.5% and 2.5% cis-UCA
      eye drops in healthy volunteers for up to 15 days. After the single day dose (three times) on
      day 1 and the subsequent 7 (± 1) days wash-out period, a multidose phase with three times a
      day administration for 14 days will start

      Primary objectives:

        -  Part 1: To evaluate the safety and ocular tolerability of 0.5% and 2.5% cis-UCA eye
           drops and placebo for cis-UCA eye drops when administered on a randomized eye three
           times during a single day, assessed up to 7 (± 1) days following dosing in healthy
           volunteers

        -  Part 2: To evaluate the safety and ocular tolerability of 0.5% and 2.5% cis-UCA eye
           drops and placebo for cis-UCA eye drops when administered on both eyes three times a day
           for 14 days, assessed up to 7 days following the last dosing in healthy volunteers

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate single dose pharmacokinetics of 0.5% and 2.5% cis-UCA eye drops when
           administered on a randomized eye in adult healthy volunteers

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 0.5% and 2.5% cis-UCA eye drops when administered on
           both eyes three times a day for 14 days in adult healthy volunteers

      Healthy male or female volunteer, 18-65 years of age, with no history of significant eye
      disease or any current eye disease that would affect the pharmacokinetics of cis-UCA.
      Subjects without any treatment-emergent adverse events during Part 1 may continue to Part 2
      of the study.
