      Egyptians is estimated around 8 million. HCV incidence is high as well, and a typical
      hepatology department in Cairo diagnoses between 5 and 10 acute hepatitis C per month. The
      HCV genotype circulating in Egypt is genotype 4. This genotype has the reputation to respond
      poorly to treatment at the chronic hepatitis stage. It would therefore be interesting to
      assess the treatment efficacy at the acute stage. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      pegylated interferon (peg-IFNα-2a) alone in Egyptian patients with acute hepatitis C.

      The study primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of pegylated interferon
      (peg-IFNα-2a) alone in Egyptian patients with acute hepatitis C.

      Methods: One arm clinical trial. Follow-up duration: 36 to 48 weeks depending on response to
      treatment.

      Main inclusion criteria: ALT> 3*N; HCV RNA positive by PCR and negative HCV serology at first
      presentation or positive HCV serology with a clear and unique exposure within 2 months prior
      the acute hepatitis episode; no prior treatment with IFNα, peg-IFNα and ribavirin; signed
      informed consent.

      Main exclusion criteria : Liver disease other than hepatitis C. Treatment strategy:
      Peg-IFNα-2a 180microg/week (subcutaneous injection) for 12 weeks. Patients with positive HCV
      RNA by qualitative PCR at the end of the 12 weeks treatment period will be offered to
      continue on the same regimen up to 24 weeks.
