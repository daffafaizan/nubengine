      microbiological contamination disease of the outer ear canal. It causes severe pains and
      accumulation of fluids in the ear. In some cases it may compromise the hearing. Swimming in
      contaminated water or cleaning the ear with a hard subject are only two examples of what may
      cause AOE. The main Pathogenes causing the disease are Gram negative of which Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa is the most abundant. Occasionally it is a fungoid contamination with Aspergillus
      Niger being the most abundant.
