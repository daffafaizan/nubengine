      standard-of-care temperature management with blood cooling CRRT. We will recruit
      approximately 140 patients (70 in each group) from the Medical Surgical Intensive Care Unit
      at University Hospital and The Critical Care Trauma Center at Victoria Hospital in London,
      Ontario.

      The study team will randomize patients with acute kidney injury requiring continuous dialysis
      therapy into one of two groups; either to standard of care continuous dialysis therapy or to
      cool blood continuous dialysis therapy. All therapy will be delivered using the Baxter
      PrisMaxTM CRRT machine with TherMaxTM blood warmer.

      All participants will undergo a series of echocardiograms (ultrasound of your heart) prior to
      continuous dialysis therapy initiation, 4-12 hours into therapy, for up to 7 days after
      therapy initiation, and at discharge from the intensive care unit. Blood work will be
      collected at 4 time points, prior to continuous dialysis therapy initiation, 4-12 hours into
      therapy, 24 hours into therapy, and at ICU discharge.

      Hourly nasopharyngeal and skin temperatures will be collected. Oral temperature will be
      collected every four hours.
