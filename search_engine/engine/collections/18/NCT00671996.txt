      chelator recently (2006) suggested for cancer treatment in an Editorial in Journal of the
      National Cancer Institute. Preclinical research has shown that mangafodipir protects normal
      tissues without loss of anti-tumour activity during chemotherapy. Other advantages are that
      mangafodipir is already approved for use in patients as a contrast agent for magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of liver, and that the experience for more than a decade reveals high
      safety with mainly minor and tolerable side-effects.

      The present study will include 14 patients who will be followed throughout 3 treatment
      cycles. Each cycle will be preceded by infusion of mangafodipir or placebo in two groups,
      each consisting of 7 patients. The primary endpoints will be the most frequent manifestation
      of FOLFOX6, namely neutropenia and neurosensory toxicity. The secondary endpoints will be the
      frequency and severity of other FOLFOX6-related adverse events and quality of life.
