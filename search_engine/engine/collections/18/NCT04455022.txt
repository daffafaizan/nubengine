      culture in neonates from participating neonatal units will be examined for the period of six
      months. The culture vials will be pre-weighted using precision scale before delivery to the
      units. After collecting the sample the vials will be weighted again at the time of admission
      to microbiology laboratory. At the end of the first phase, the results will be revealed to
      clinical teams and discussed. The sample volume control by using bedside precision scale will
      be introduced to the participating units along with educational actions to raise the
      awareness of importance of collecting adequate volume of blood for culture. The minimum
      volume of blood will be defined as at minimum 1 ml. The paramount role of blood culture in
      process of ruling out newborn sepsis will be emphasized. In the second phase of the study
      clinicians in participating centres will have an opportunity of measuring the volume of
      samples just after collecting. The volumes will also be independently controlled in the
      microbiology laboratory. The second phase will also last six months. Collected volumes will
      be compared to results from pre-intervention period. Clinical outcome measured by frequency
      of antibiotic treatment in newborn patients with negative blood culture will be compared
      before and after implemented changes. We hypothesize that introducing routine bedside control
      of the blood volume submitted for culture will result in increase confidence in negative
      blood culture results and decrease of antibiotic use in newborn population.
