      being done to reach higher control rates of CINV with different drugs. In this scenario, in a
      randomized phase II placebo-controlled trial Cruz et. al. demonstrated that Gabapentin raises
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting control when associated with Dexametason and
      Ondasetron, suggesting that it could be a cost-effective alternative to neurokinin 1 receptor
      antagonists9, although, as we know, there aren't comparative studies with gabapentin and
      aprepitant. Guttuso et al demonstrated in an open clinical study the antiemetic effect of
      gabapentin in chemotherapy-induced acute (within 24hs) and delayed onset (days 2-5) nausea
      and vomiting in breast cancer patients with refractory emesis10.

      Tan e cols showed higher complete and delayed nausea and vomiting control rates for
      olanzapine vs. aprepitant, in association with palonosetron and dexametason in highly and
      moderately emetogenic potential chemotherapy11. Navari e cols haven't found similar results
      although this comparison may not be done, since maintenance anti-emetic treatment was
      different between these studies12.

      In a case report, Strohscheer I. & Borasio GD showed complete control of refractory nausea
      and vomiting in one patient with meningeal carcinomatosis treated with Carbamazepine13.

      Carbamazepine is an available anticonvulsant largely used in Brazil. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the role of Carbamazepine for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by
      moderate and highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
