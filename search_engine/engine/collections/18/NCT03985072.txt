      carcinoma; cervical carcinoma; gastric carcinoma; and pancreatic carcinoma) will enter stage
      1. These patients will receive a dose of 400 mg of Andes-1537 five times per week for
      continuous cycles of 4 weeks that will be repeated until the patients presents drug toxicity
      requiring treatment discontinuation or disease progression with no noted clinical benefit as
      assessed by the investigator. The safety and tolerability evaluation will be continuous
      during the study. The efficacy evaluation will be done by analysis of the clinical objective
      response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria
      after patients complete the first two cycles (8 weeks). Thereafter, clinical ORR will be
      assessed every 8 weeks. Additionally, tumor-cell activity assessment will be performed in
      biopsy samples after the patients complete the first 2 cycles (8 weeks). Tumor markers
      assessment according to the type of tumor will be evaluated every 2 cycles and at the end of
      study (EOS) visit. Analysis of the tumor metabolic activity through the PET-CT scan and
      quality of life of patients through questionnaire will be evaluated every 2 cycles. As
      predefined and according with the decision of the Study Safety and Steering Committee, in
      those cohorts where minimal clinical response criteria were met, 15 additional patients will
      be recruited (total of 24 patients per cohort) for stage 2 of the study. Patients included in
      stage 2 will receive the same treatment regimen described for stage 1 and will be followed
      until the patients present disease progression or drug toxicity requiring treatment
      discontinuation. Patients included in stage 2 will receive the same follow-up as patients in
      stage 1.
