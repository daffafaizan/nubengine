      exercise weight loss groups. Measurements of blood glucose and insulin, oral glucose
      tolerance, and matched glucose infusion will be done at baseline and after weight loss of 6%
      of body weight. Other tests include maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), strength tests, blood
      pressure, blood lipids, serum inflammatory markers, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for bone
      density and body composition, physical activity levels, dietary intakes, and measures of
      arterial stiffness.
