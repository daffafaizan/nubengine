      involves implantation of a pacemaker to improve the coordination of heart function. However,
      approximately 30-40% of patients fail to respond to this therapy with current selection
      criteria. We hypothesize that patients with echocardiographic and MRI measures of a high
      degree of LV mechanical dyssynchrony are more likely to benefit from CRT than patients with
      less baseline dyssynchrony. Severe LV remodeling as measured by MRI may also predict patients
      less likely to benefit from therapy. In addition, myocardial fibrosis/scarring as measured by
      MRI delayed enhancement imaging may predict segments or subjects less likely to respond to
      CRT even in patients without ischemic heart disease. In this study, patients with New York
      Heart Association class III - IV heart failure will undergo imaging and stress testing prior
      to CRT pacemaker implantation and 6 months later to determine predictors of response.
      Considering the complexity of the protocol and novelty of some aspects of the MRI
      examination, we consider this an exploratory observational protocol.
