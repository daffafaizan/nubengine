    
      Patients clinically suspected of NASH will be invited for a screening programme for inclusion
      in the study. Patients will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Clinical evaluation will be conducted for baseline characteristics and anthropometry
      measurements such as body weight and height.

      After clinical evaluations, all baseline safety and efficacy parameters will be recorded as
      per Visit Schedule. All laboratory collections will be performed following overnight fasting
      (at least 8 hrs).

      Following confirmation of all clinical and laboratory inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      patients will continue into the screening period. During the screening period liver biopsy
      will be performed. However, if a biopsy was performed within 6 months the slides and biopsy
      material, or block, must be made available for baseline documentation. Such Patients, whose
      historical biopsy report is available, should not use medication suspected of having an
      effect on NASH from the 3 months prior to the screening.

      Liver biopsy will be performed to confirm the diagnosis of NASH and record a baseline NAFLD
      Activity Score. The histological evidence of NASH is defined as NAS â‰¥ 4 with a minimum score
      of 1 for all of its three components [steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and lobular
      inflammation].

      Following confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria and upon histological confirmation of
      NASH by liver biopsy, patients will be enrolled into the study.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive Saroglitazar Magnesium 2 mg or 4 mg or
      placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio for 24 weeks.

      Upon completion of 24 weeks of treatment, liver biopsy will be performed and the NAFLD
      Activity Score recorded.
