      Syndrome (ARDS) and its predictable sequelae. These patients often require intubation and
      ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is
      intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in
      order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and
      improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians
      treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many
      cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival.

      PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in
      the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting
      and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one
      of the safest ways to increase partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and is used on almost all
      modern ventilator settings.

      The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a
      bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of
      the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save
      lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially
      ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to
      improve oxygenation and avoid intubation.
