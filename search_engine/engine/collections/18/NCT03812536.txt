      be randomly assigned to a control (spontaneous void) or experimental (no void group). The
      spontaneous void group will include 50 patients who will be required to void spontaneously
      after anorectal surgeries. The no void group will be 50 patients who will be discharged home
      from the PACU once they meet ambulatory surgery center discharge criteria per hospital
      guidelines. Patients requiring anorectal surgeries will be consented to take part in the
      study during the preoperative outpatient office visit. A post-operative phone call will be
      made by designated study personnel to participants on post-op day 30 using a study
      questionnaire to assess re-admission and emergency room visits.
