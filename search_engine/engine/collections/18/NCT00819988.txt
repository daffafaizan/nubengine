      during their hospital stay. Elderly patients undergoing major surgical procedures are at
      highest risk. While many risk factors for delirium are known, the specific pathophysiology of
      postoperative delirium remains unclear and is likely multifactorial. The most common inciting
      agents and events include metabolic causes, medications, blood loss, hypoxemia and pain. Pain
      and its management are intimately related to the likelihood of developing postoperative
      delirium. As a class, gabapentinoids, such as pregabalin, have proven to reduce postoperative
      pain and narcotic consumption and therefore may have a role to play in the prevention of
      postoperative delirium.
