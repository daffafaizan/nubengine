      -CT scan of the breast that had the cancer removed to help plan the radiation therapy. This
      is referred to as a CT-simulation. This scan is done routinely as part of the regular
      treatment.

      PBI Study Treatment: You will be given PBI once daily over 10 treatment days (Mon-Fri) over a
      2 week period. During this time you will have a weekly interview, physical examination, and
      your skin will be assessed for any side effects of the radiation.

      PBI will begin between 4 weeks to 3 months after breast surgery or 2-6 weeks after
      chemotherapy (if you have been given chemotherapy).

      After the final dose of the study:

      You will have the following scheduled follow-up visits: one at the completion of the
      radiation, once or twice during weeks 3-9 after the completion of radiation, once every 6
      months for five years, and then once every year for the following five years after the
      completion of radiation therapy.
