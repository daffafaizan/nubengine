    
      This will be a single site retrospective (non-experimental) study utilizing the electronic
      medical record, both descriptive and correlational methods.

      There will be two outcomes:

        1. The outcomes associated with the management of Central Venous Catheter(CVC),
           Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC), and Hemodialysis (HD) Catheter in
           adherence with hospital approved Evidence-based Practice guidelines for Central Venous
           Catheter(CVC), Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC), and Hemodialysis (HD)
           Catheter.

        2. The mechanical/technical, thrombotic, and other adverse outcomes (Heparin induced
           coagulopathy) associated with central venous catheters due to variation in insertion and
           management practices of Central Venous Catheter(CVC), Peripherally Inserted Central
           Catheter (PICC), and Hemodialysis (HD) Catheter.
