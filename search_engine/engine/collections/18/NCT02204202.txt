      measure lung inflammation. FDG-PET imaging is a clinically accepted and FDA-approved method
      that is commonly used in the diagnosis and management of cancer. PET is a machine that
      detects radiation and generates pictures using a donut shaped scanner similar in appearance
      to an x-ray "CAT" computerized axial tomography or computed tomography (CT) scan. FDG stands
      for [18F] (flourine 18) fluorodeoxyglucose, a radiolabeled sugar that is used to identify
      areas of inflammation with the PET scanner. A CT scan takes a picture of what the lungs and
      airways look like.

      T cells are the primary cause of acute rejection of lung transplants. Because T cells must
      divide in order to be activated and cause rejection, imaging them while they are dividing is
      another way that we can determine whether acute rejection is occurring. A new PET tracer
      called [18F]ISO-1 (18F-labeled Ïƒ2-receptor ligand for PET,
      N-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,-4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)-5-methylbe
      nzamide (18F-3c), binds to dividing cells. Therefore, [18F]ISO-1 may help us measure acute
      rejection more accurately. [18F]ISO-1 is an investigational drug.
