      of treatment, no one antiepileptic drug (AED) provides satisfactory relief for all or most
      patients with LGS and a combination of treatments is often required. Many patients with LGS
      are refractory to standard AED treatment.

      More effective and better tolerated treatment options are needed for this population of
      medically intractable epilepsy patients. Clobazam is unique in that it is the only non-1,
      4-benzodiazepine used in the treatment of epilepsy.
