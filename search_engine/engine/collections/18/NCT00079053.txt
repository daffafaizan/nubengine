      Primary

        -  Determine the recommended dose of adjuvant erlotinib after the completion of
           chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III, IVA, or IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the
           head and neck.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on plasma and urinary angiogenic factors
           (specifically vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR], VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and
           basic fibroblast growth factor levels) in these patients.

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients treated with this drug after
           chemoradiotherapy vs historical control patients treated with chemoradiotherapy alone.

        -  Correlate levels of angiogenic factors with initial blood vessel concentration in the
           tumor and the presence or absence of EGFRvIII mutation in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 8 patients are
      treated at that dose level.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 12 weeks for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-20 patients will be accrued for this study.
