      period during which patients received either one of three doses of dexmecamylamine or placebo
      twice daily, randomized in a ratio of 2:1:1:1 (placebo, low dose, mid dose, high dose), with
      a two-week follow-up period. A total of 768 subjects with overactive bladder were randomized
      into the double-blind treatment period of the study.
