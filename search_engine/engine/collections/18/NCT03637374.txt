      Debranching Stent Graft System to repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. While surgery
      remains a standard treatment for complex abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAA), the
      tolerance of some patients to recover from such extensive and invasive open aortic
      reconstructions is poor. Endovascular repair may offer the opportunity to reduce patient risk
      with less invasive approaches, improve quality of life, and serve to reduce the cost burden.
      The primary technical safety endpoint is freedom from major adverse events (MAE) at 30 days
      or during hospitalization if this exceeds 30 days. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the
      proportion of study subjects with treatment success at 1 year.
