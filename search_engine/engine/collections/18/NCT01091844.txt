      clinic for surgical preoperative evaluation. After surgery, each woman will undergo a voiding
      trial to assess for urinary retention after surgery. This is currently performed on all
      patients undergoing surgery involving prolapse or incontinence. At UNC this is usually
      performed by allowing the bladder to spontaneously fill, then allowing the patient to void
      and afterward catheterizing the patient to check a postvoid residual ("spontaneous fill"
      technique). In this study, we will also assess bladder emptying separately by filling the
      bladder retrograde through the catheter already in place with 300 mL of saline and then
      removing the catheter and allowing the patient to void ("retrograde-fill" technique). We will
      determine postvoid residual indirectly by subtracting voided volume from the 300 mL infused
      volume. No catheterization will be performed with this technique. Both of these techniques
      will be performed. The order in which the two techniques will be performed will be
      randomized. We will then compare the outcomes of these two techniques of voiding trials to
      see if they are equivalent in assessing urinary retention. Of note, the retrograde fill
      technique is standard at other institutions and is not considered experimental.
