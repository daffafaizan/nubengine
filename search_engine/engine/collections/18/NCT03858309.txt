      intervention on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation among healthy participants using a
      non-invasive real-time phase-contrast magnetic imaging (RT-PCMRI) technique. This aim will be
      examined by studying the changes in each participant's pre- and post-intervention CSF flow
      dynamics using the non-invasive RT-PCMRI technique during two MRI scans (one before and one
      after the 8-week intervention).

      The study protocol consists of 20 healthy participants (two groups; 10 in each group with
      different breathing practices) undergoing an 8-week intervention, and pre-and
      post-intervention outcome measures.

      The two 8-week interventions will be guided by two separate certified experienced yoga
      teachers. Both interventions will consist of 60-minute weekly group on-site sessions
      (1day/week) with a 20-minute daily home sessions (in between on-site sessions; 6 days/week)
      using home-aid practice materials. Participants' respiration data will be objectively tracked
      using a wearable respiration tracker device.
