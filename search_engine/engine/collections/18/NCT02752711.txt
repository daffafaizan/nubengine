      mild head injury defined by a Glasgow score greater than or equal to 13. In October 2009, the
      Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network has published a rule clinical decision
      support of mild head injury of the child with the aim to identify children at very low risk
      for clinically severe intracranial lesions in order to avoid the use of CT and unnecessary
      exposure to radiation ionizing. This clinical decision rule constructed from a multicenter
      prospective cohort 42,412 American children allows on anamnestic and clinical elements to
      guide medical decision for conducting brain imaging, hospital monitoring or discharge home
      placing the child in three levels of risk of clinically severe intracranial lesions.

      Since March 2012, the French Emergency Medicine Society recommends for the treatment of mild
      head trauma the child's use of the clinical decision rule provided that it is the subject of
      a validation study externally. Indeed, after the construction phase and before its daily
      application, a clinical decision rule must be subject to an broad validation process so that
      its predictive performance can be definitively established.

      The investigators' work aims to conduct this broad validation study prospective multicenter
      way in a French pediatric population, as recommended by the French Emergency Medicine
      Society, in order to confirm or deny its predictive performance and allow its application and
      generalization. The investigators will check and if the clinical decision rule is adapted or
      not to the management of mild head injuries in the French pediatric population.
