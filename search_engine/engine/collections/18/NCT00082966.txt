      I. To evaluate the efficacy of bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's
      lymphoma using overall response rate as the primary efficacy endpoint.

      II. To assess time to progression and 2-year overall survival after bortezomib therapy.

      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of bortezomib in patients with
      relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of rapid disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.
