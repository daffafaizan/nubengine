    
      A multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, dose-exploration study evaluating two new
      formulations of oprozomib plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed
      refractory multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will evaluate
      the formulations of oprozomib in combination with dexamethasone only. Part 2 will evaluate

      combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.
