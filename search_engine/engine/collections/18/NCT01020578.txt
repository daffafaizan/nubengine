      with the natural onset of diabetes mellitus type 2, could possibly explain the high
      susceptibility of the glucose intolerance to cardiovascular disease. Dyslipidemia commonly
      linked to glucose intolerance is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-C and in
      spite of the LDL-C being apparently normal or slightly elevated, there is presence of small
      dense LDL. Formulated in the laboratory, an artificial lipid nanoemulsion marked with both
      14C-cholesterol ester and 3H-cholesterol with lipid composition similar to LDL allows study
      the plasma kinetics of the two forms of cholesterol (free and esterified. The nanoemulsion
      mimics the natural LDL, but is prepared without protein. In contact with the bloodstream, the
      nanoemulsion acquires apolipoproteins, apo E preferentially, allowing it to be recognized and
      removed from plasma by LDL receptor. The application of this nanoemulsion was shown to be
      technically safe, appropriate and simple to be used in humans in order to understand the role
      of dyslipidemia in the atherogenic process.
