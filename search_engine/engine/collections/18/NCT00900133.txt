        -  Determine circulating levels of calgranulin A and calgranulin B in patients with
           estrogen receptor negative or estrogen receptor positive, newly diagnosed, primary stage
           I-III adenocarcinoma of the breast.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo a blood draw following diagnosis of breast cancer to assess levels of
      circulating tumor markers, calgranulin A and calgranulin B. Serum samples are evaluated by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for tumor marker expression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
