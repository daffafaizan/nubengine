      continuously track heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, activity and sleep are growing in
      everyday popularity and beginning to enter the sphere of clinical relevance. However, their
      accuracy and utility for clinical use is largely unstudied. As these consumer devices, some
      of which are FDA approved, become more commonplace, it is paramount to understand their
      function, know their limitations, and be able to interpret results appropriately before
      incorporating them into our clinical practice. The AHA/ACC 2017 guideline makes a 1A
      recommendation for clinical use of out of office BP measurements(1). This recommendation is
      based on evidence that out of office BP and frequent and longitudinal BP measurements are
      important in predicting cardiovascular risk and monitoring treatment efficacy(2-5). This
      trend towards consumer driven digital health monitoring and the new AHA/ACC guideline are
      essentially advancing a consumer based precision medicine strategy for diagnosis and
      monitoring of hypertension. As this becomes commonplace in our patient population, we need
      rigorous clinical study of wrist base BP monitoring to better understand its role patient
      care.
