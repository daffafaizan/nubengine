      cardiovascular and infectious disease and increased risk of all-cause mortality which is
      mainly attributed to the disturbed immune response. More and more evident indicated that T
      cell dysfunction was universal in ESRD. Recent evidence suggests uremia-related immune
      changes resemble to aging immune system, increasing immunological age of T cells by 20-30
      years. As compared to an age-matched healthy control, ESRD patients present a lower thymic
      output of na√Øve T cells, a decline in the T-cell telomere length and an increase in the
      differentiation status towards the terminal differentiated memory phenotype with a large
      number of CD28-negative T cells. More importantly, these changes are strongly associated with
      a history of cardiovascular diseases and the occurrence of severe infectious episodes in this
      population, supporting the idea that T cell dysfunction is a critical feature in this
      population and will impact clinical outcomes profoundly. This study prospectively researched
      the predictive value of T cell dysfunction for all-cause mortality and clinical complication
      in hemodialysis (HD) patients.
