      Stem Cell (ADRC) injection into partial thickness rotator cuff tears as indicated through
      adverse event rate and efficacy of pain and function through Rand short form-36 questionnaire
      and ASES Shoulder Score health questionnaires.

      The secondary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of adult ADRC injection into
      partial thickness rotator cuff tears through MRIs pre-and post-injection for the therapeutics
      intent to treat a rotator cuff injury.

      Patients enrolled on this study received either ADRC (i.e., investigational treatment group)
      or TAU (i.e., control group). The investigational treatment group underwent a small
      liposuction procedure and received rotator cuff repair treatment with an ultrasound-guided
      injection of 5cc ADRCs into the point of injury. The control group received a 5cc cortisone
      injection. All patients, regardless of treatment, were followed up as indicated on the
      schedule of events table in the clinical study protocol.

      Two clinical trial sites (Sioux Falls, SD and Fargo ND) enrolled subjects in this study.
