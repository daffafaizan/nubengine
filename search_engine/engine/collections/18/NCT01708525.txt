    
      This study is a prospective, single-center, blinded, non-randomized clinical trial. Two
      subjects who have chosen to have a surgical facelift procedure and agree to drink heavy water
      for tissue labeling, will be enrolled. Subjects will consume heavy water and collect saliva
      specimens over the course of the study period, following a specific heavy water labeling
      protocol. Two weeks after starting the heavy water protocol, subjects will return to the
      study site to receive one Ultherapy® treatment to the pre-auricular region on one side of the
      face. The contra-lateral pre-auricular region will serve as a control. Following Ultherapy®
      treatment, subjects will continue to follow the heavy water protocol for 4 more weeks.
      Subjects will then return to the study site to undergo resection of the treated and control
      tissue for analysis during their planned rhytidectomy procedure. Subjects will send in saliva
      samples on a weekly basis to allow for confirmation that they are drinking the heavy water.
