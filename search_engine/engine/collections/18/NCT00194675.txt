      combination of testosterone and dutasteride spares subjects from increases in prostate size
      and symptoms of BPH which may be associated with T alone.

      We will also determine the effects of changes in serum T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on
      both the hormonal milieu and genetic program within the prostate gland itself. The technology
      employed will allow us to determine which genes are androgen responsive within each prostate
      tissue compartment. Together, these data may determine whether the combination of
      testosterone and dutasteride safely corrects the symptoms of BPH and hypogonadism and
      minimizes growth stimulus to the prostate at the genetic level. We will also assess the
      effects of the combination of T and dutasteride on cognitive function.

      This is a six-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-site study of older
      hypogonadal men with mild to moderate BPH.

      Within each treatment group, a sub-group of subjects will undergo additional procedures as
      part of a Prostate Biopsy sub-study to obtain prostate tissue for hormonal and genetic
      analyses. Selection of subjects will be based on clinical indication and/or willingness to
      undergo prostate biopsies.
