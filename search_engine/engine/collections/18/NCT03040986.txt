      I. Determine the objective response rate to selumetinib sulfate (selumetinib) administered as
      75 mg orally twice daily on a continuous schedule in patients with advanced pancreas cancer
      harboring Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) G12R mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable
      and stage IV pancreas cancer treated with selumetinib monotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the safety of selumetinib in patients with advanced pancreas cancer.

      III. To determine the impact of additional genetic alterations on the response to selumetinib
      in pancreas cancer harboring KRAS G12R mutations.

      IV. To develop a clinically applicable biomarker predicting response to selumetinib in
      pancreas cancer harboring KRAS G12R mutations.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 27 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 52 weeks.
