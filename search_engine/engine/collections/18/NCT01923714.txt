      open-label study aiming at assessing a change in visual-related quality of life of glaucoma
      patients that switch therapy to preservative-free DTFC. As a non-interventional study, the
      decision for the to switch was at the discretion of the physician. Patients scheduled to
      switch therapy to preservative free DTFC will be asked to fill in the 10 item, linkert-type
      GSS questionnaire at baseline, at week 4 and at week 8 of therapy switch.

      The study data will be collected at a baseline and at 2 follow-up visits occurring 4 weeks
      +/- 1 week and 8 weeks +/- 1 week. If no visit was scheduled, the patient was asked to send
      the completed documents to the physician.
