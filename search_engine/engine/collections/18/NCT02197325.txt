      primary PCI in patients with anterior non ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction or
      ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction, in patients with a culprit lesion in the LAD on
      Infarct Size and myocardial function. There will be 2 phases in this study.

        1. Phase 1: only NSTEMI patients will be recruited.

        2. Phase 2: only STEMI patients will be recruited.

      Phase 1 During Phase 1 of the study only NSTEMI patients will be recruited. After having
      given informed consent the patient will be scheduled for pPCI and stent placement. On the day
      of the procedure the PICSO catheter will be placed as described below (refer to PICSO Impulse
      catheter placement). After the PICSO therapy is started the standard pPCI and stent placement
      is performed. PICSO is continued at a minimum of 30 minutes or as long as the standard pPCI
      and stent placement takes.

      Phase 2 During Phase 2 of the study only STEMI patients will be recruited. Immediately after
      successful restoration of the blood flow the PICSO Impulse catheter is introduced and placed
      as described below (Refer to PICSO Impulse catheter placement).

      After correct positioning of the PICSO Impulse catheter, the 0,032" guide wire is removed.
      PICSO therapy is initiated and continued until a PICSO Quantity of 1000 mmHg is reached or a
      maximum of 60 minutes active treatment whatever comes first. With PICSO in treatment mode,
      the stent is deployed.

      The clinical outcome data collected will be based on the site standards of care for NSTEMI
      and acute STEMI. Examinations include but are not limited to physical assessments, cardiac
      markers, ECG, laboratory results, x-rays, angiograms, cMRI and echocardiography.
