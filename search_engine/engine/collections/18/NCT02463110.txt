      40% of patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) present depressive symptoms.
      The increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality at 6 months (hazard ratio = 3.5) could
      partly be explained by an alteration of the platelet parameters in patients with depression.

      Sertraline is a potent inhibitor of the selective serotonin reuptake (SSRI). At the platelet
      level, it decreases the secretion induced by collagen and causes the inhibition of serotonin
      reuptake and platelet activation, wider than the simple anti-serotonergic effect. Its
      efficacy on depression of patients with ACS has been demonstrated (-20% of ischemic events at
      24 weeks vs placebo), partly independent of the correction of depressive symptoms, and with a
      wide safety action. Antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory and endothelial function effects of
      sertraline are demonstrated in healthy volunteers, in stable patients and in patients with
      heart failure, but have never been explored in ACS .

      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing SSRI and placebo in
      depressive patients with ACS.

      A control (non depressive) ACS group will also do the clinical and laboratory follow-up at
      the same time (without drug administration), to constitute a reference for platelet
      parameters and to allow a comparison with the depressive ACS group treated with placebo.

      Randomization and initiation of the treatment at the end of the hospitalization for ACS
      (possibly after reperfusion and stabilization of cardiac medication)
