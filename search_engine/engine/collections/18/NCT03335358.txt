      support couples after stroke are largely lacking. Depressive symptoms post-stroke occur in
      30-50% of survivors and partner caregivers, and have significant consequences on function and
      quality of life. Further, mood and psychosocial well-being are reciprocal in couples, meaning
      if one partner is depressed, the other is more likely to be depressed. Sustaining well-being
      in both partners is important for continued engagement in rehabilitation and re-integration
      into the community, yet existing interventions are aimed at the individual rather than the
      couple. This study will address this gap by testing an innovative dyadic (couples-based)
      intervention using a new approach based on positive psychology that focuses on the strengths
      in the relationship in order to foster resilience in the couple. Using a randomized waitlist
      control design, this pilot study aims to determine whether an 8-week dyadic positive
      psychology-based intervention (PPI) can improve mood and subjective well-being as assessed by
      established outcome measures in 24 couples coping with stroke. The intervention consists of
      self-administered PPI activities, such as expressing gratitude and practicing acts of
      kindness, which participants complete individually and as a couple. Two potential pathways
      will be explored for the PPI: (a) enhanced quality of interactions as couples deal with daily
      life demands and (b) improvements in mood that are "contagious" among couples. If found
      effective, couples with greater well-being may be better emotionally equipped to cope with
      the sequelae of stroke by reducing stress and depressive symptoms, and increasing
      participation in meaningful activities and quality of life.
