      expertise with scientific methods to conduct research on health disparities with a specific
      emphasis on obesity in NHs and PPs. Recognizing that recent advances in medicine such as the
      reduction of cardiovascular disease mortality and the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      have not translated into benefits for all sectors of the U.S. population, especially ethnic
      and racial minority populations, the PILI 'Ohana Program aims to address this gap through
      community-academic partnerships focused on interventions to promote change in obesity-related
      disparities in NH and PP communities. One of the scientific goals of the PILI 'Ohana Program
      focused on designing and implementing research activities aimed at completing a pilot
      intervention study to provide the basis for a more definitive, hypothesis-driven 5-year
      research study in the future.
