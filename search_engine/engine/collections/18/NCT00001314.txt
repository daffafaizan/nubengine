      echocardiography in patients with aortic regurgitation and in patients with mitral
      regurgitation in order to assess myocardial contractile reserve. The purpose of the study is
      to determine whether the contractile reserve of the myocardium measured during dobutamine
      stress echocardiography is a predictor of the development of subsequent left ventricular
      dysfunction and left ventricular dilatation, as well as recovery of left ventricular function
      after surgery, in these patients.
