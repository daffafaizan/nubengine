    
      This is a randomized pilot study on the effect of oesophageal temperature monitoring on the
      esophageal thermal injury after left atrial ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation
      (AF).

      Sixty patients with paroxysmal AF or persistent and without previous AF ablation with
      indication of AF ablation will be selected to be included at the study.

      After informed consent, these patients will be randomized in 3 groups with different
      strategies of esophageal protection for radiofrequency application in the posterior wall of
      the left atrium, by randomization in a ratio of 1: 1: 1 between groups.

      Group I: no esophageal temperature monitoring technique. Group II: monitoring of esophageal
      temperature during radiofrequency applications in the posterior wall of the left atrium, with
      unipolar thermometer.

      Group III: oesophageal temperature monitoring during radiofrequency applications in the
      posterior wall of the left atrium, with a multipolar and self expandable thermometer.

      The primary end point will be the incidence of esophageal lesions assessed by upper endoscopy
      that will be done in all patients.
