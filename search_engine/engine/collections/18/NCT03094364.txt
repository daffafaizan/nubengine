      other group will receive treatment following a three-week delay (50%). Group 1 will be
      assessed by physical/occupational therapists and rehabilitation psychologists (blinded to
      treatment phase) before and after the virtual gaming treatment. Group 2 will receive two
      baseline assessments (baseline followed by three weeks of usual and customary care and then
      another baseline before starting the gaming treatment), and again after three weeks of
      virtual gaming treatment.
