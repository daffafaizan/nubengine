      multichannel, touch-free electronic stethoscope with disposable elements designed to protect
      HCPs from exposure to infection diseases by allowing them to auscultate patients from a safe
      distance (10 feet away). The sensors can stay in place and enable providers to listen
      on-demand to a patient's heart and lungs over an extended period of time. This practice of
      distancing in the workplace is a key CDC and PHAC recommendation to protect the frontline HCP
      from exposure risk to the highly contagious COVID- 19 virus and other communicable diseases.
      The Auscul-X not only has the potential to better protect HCPs from infection, but also
      eliminates the potential transmission of pathogens through the use of conventional
      stethoscopes. In addition, the Auscul-X allows multiple HCPs to listen to the patient's heart
      and lung sounds simultaneously
