      (SREBP-1) were found in gefitinib-resistance NSCLC cells. Berberine, an effective suppressor
      of SREBP1 and lipogenesis regulated through ROS/AMPK pathway, selectively inhibited the
      growth of gefitinib-resistance NSCLC cells but not that of normal cells. It effectively
      caused mitochondrial dysfunction, activated reactive oxygen species (ROS)/AMPK pathway and
      finally suppressed cellular lipogenesis and cell proliferation. Addition of ROS blocker, AMPK
      inhibitor and palmitic acid significantly reduced the effect of Berberine. In in vivo study,
      treatment of Berberine led to significant inhibition of mouse tumor xenograft growth.
