    
      200 clinical stage 2 OSMF patients selected randomly by simple random technique with
      clinically & histopathologically confirmed diagnosis are divided into 4 groups with 50
      patients each.

      In Group 1 patients are given 10% of curcumin mucoadhesive gel and are instructed to use it
      topically twice daily making it a daily dose of 1gm.

      In Group 2 patients are given 500mg of curcumin capsules and are instructed to take 2
      capsules twice daily making a daily dose of 1gm.

      In Group 3 patients will be given 5% of curcumin mucoadhesive gel and will be instructed to
      use it topically twice daily & 250mg of curcumin capsules to be taken twice daily making it a
      daily dose of 1gm.

      Group 4 is considered as control group and provided with formulations without the active
      drug.

      The mean scores of 4 groups will be statistically tested using Anova technique.

      The differences in clinical parameters at 15 days, 1 month, 3 months & clinical &
      histopathological paramerters at 6 months will be compared between groups 1, 2, 3 & 4 by
      using students 't' test & correlation is also used for knowing the association of variables.

      For all tests, a 'p' value of 0.05 or less will be utilized for statistical significance.

      Other non parametric tests can also be applied where ever necessary for data analysis.
