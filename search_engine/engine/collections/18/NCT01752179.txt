      condition of the piriformis muscle. Some investigators consider it as a form of Myofacial
      pain syndrome which defined as the presence of exquisite tenderness at a nodule in a palpable
      taut band of muscle. Trigger points are able to produce referred pain, either spontaneously
      or on digital compression. Although myofascial trigger points are a widely recognized
      phenomenon in clinical practice, there remains much to be elucidated with regards to their
      pathophysiology. Conservative pharmacotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAID), muscle relaxants, and physical therapy modalities such as heat therapy, cold
      therapy, ultrasound, electrical current and stretching were traditionally used in the
      treatment of trigger points.

      The utilization of Kinesio taping regarding to the proposed mechanisms including 1) restoring
      correct muscle function by supporting weakened muscles, (2) reducing congestion by improving
      the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing pain by stimulating neurological
      system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm (5) enhancing
      proprioception through increased stimulation to cutaneous mechanoreceptors can be helpful in
      restoring muscle function in patients with Myofacial trigger points . However, there are not
      many controlled studies that have analyzed the effects of the Kinesio taping in their
      treatment. Therefore, the purpose of study was to determine the efficacy of KT application as
      an easy and appropriate method on trigger point of piriformis muscle.
