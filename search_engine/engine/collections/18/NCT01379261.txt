      today. Although reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium is a prerequisite for myocardial
      salvage, it has been described that the reperfusion in itself may cause additional damage to
      the myocardium (reperfusion injury). In the safety & feasibility trial RAPID MI-ICE we
      demonstrated that treatment of patients suffering from STEMI with 1-2 liters of cold saline
      and central venous catheter cooling with Philips InnerCool RTx Endovascular System prior to
      PCI was feasible, safe and resulted in a 38% reduction in infarct size/myocardium at risk.
      The aim of the present study is to confirm this finding in a larger multicenter trial.

      The study is a randomized, controlled, evaluator blinded, multicenter trial enrolling 120
      patients at ten sites.
