    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTDs) of BMN673 (talazoparib) and AT13387 (HSP90
      Inhibitor AT13387) administered in combination in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with BMN673
      and AT13387 administered in combination as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.0.

      II. To determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of the combination of BMN673 and
      AT13387.

      III. To determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of BMN673 and AT13387. IV. To document
      anti-tumor activity of the combination of BMN673 and AT13387 as assessed by (Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and progression free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 (course 0). Beginning in
      course 1, patients receive talazoparib PO QD on days 1-28 and HSP90 inhibitor AT13387
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 2 years.
