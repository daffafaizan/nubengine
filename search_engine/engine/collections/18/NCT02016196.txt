      cirrhosis and portal hypertension related complications. TIPS proved more effective than
      alternative treatments in controlling or preventing variceal bleeding and refractory ascites.
      The main drawback of the TIPS procedure is progressive overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE).
      Three risk factors for post-TIPS OHE have been identified: age over 65 years, history of
      previous episodes of OHE, and Child-Pugh score equal to or over 10. However, the incidence of
      post-TIPS OHE in patients fulfilling these criteria remains close to 35 %. Furthermore, the
      pathogenesis of HE in general but also in patients treated by TIPS is still not well
      understood. Therefore, there is a real challenge in discovering new molecular mechanisms
      involved in pathogenesis of OHE as well as new treatment to better prevent the risk of OHE in
      patients treated by TIPS. Observational and experimental studies suggest a microbiota's role
      in the mechanism of OHE and recently a non absorbable antibiotic has proven to reduce the
      risk of recurrence of OHE. However, the effect of this drug for the prevention of a first
      episode of OHE in patients treated by TIPS is not known. In addition, the mechanisms of the
      beneficial effect of rifaximin remain poorly understood.
