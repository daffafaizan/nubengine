      has been re-classified from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status in the United
      States. Unlike prescription medications, post-marketing surveillance does not exist for OTC
      medications. The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics of consumers who
      purchase OTC nicotine patches from community pharmacies and to determine the factors
      associated with appropriate use of nicotine patches.

      This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study will include a survey of 600 consumers
      who purchase OTC nicotine patches at a random sample of 30 community retail pharmacies.
      Consumers will be recruited by an ad located in the pharmacy next to the nicotine patch
      product. Participants will fill out a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire at the time
      of OTC nicotine patch purchase at the pharmacy counter. The questionnaire will gather
      information about demographics, medical history, smoking history, attitudes toward the
      nicotine patch, and motivation to quit smoking. No study visits will be required for this
      study.
