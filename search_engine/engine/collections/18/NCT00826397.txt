      complementary therapy to pain medication for joint pain associated with aromatase inhibitors
      for breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer patients are living longer largely due to the
      benefits of hormonal therapy. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a new class of hormonal agents
      which block estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women. However, musculoskeletal pain occurs
      in up to 50% of patients treated with AIs and often does not respond to conventional pain
      medications. AI-induced joint pain interferes with patient compliance and may cause major
      disability. Therefore, safe and effective treatments are needed to alleviate AI-induced
      musculoskeletal pain.

      Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese method of medical treatment and a popular modality for
      treating musculoskeletal pain. Acupuncture involves the use of thin needles to stimulate
      specific points of the body and leads to pain control through the release of endorphin in the
      central nervous system. Clinical trials have found a benefit of acupuncture for the treatment
      of knee and back pain. Given the lack of effective treatments for AI-induced joint pain and
      the safety and efficacy of acupuncture, it is therefore reasonable to evaluate whether
      acupuncture is effective in breast cancer patients who experience musculoskeletal pain
      related to AIs.
