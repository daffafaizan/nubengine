    
      Prospective, interventionist and randomized controlled trial in a 1: 1 ratio, open to the
      multidisciplinary team but blind to surgeons and anaesthesiologists. The aim is to test the
      effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation protocol in patients with diagnosed or
      suspicious gynaecological cancer, who will undergo gynaecological surgery.

      The multidisciplinary prehabilitation program will be applied to the intervention group. For
      the group participating in the prehabilitation and for the control group, the protocol and
      specific recommendations for gynecological cancer defined by the Enhanced Recovery After
      Surgery (ERASÂ®) guidelines will be applied.
