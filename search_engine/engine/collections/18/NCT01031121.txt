      To determine a breath carbon monoxide (CO) cutoff level that optimally discriminates between
      heavy and light smokers and nonsmokers who are and who are not exposed to environmental
      tobacco smoke. Breath CO will be compared against cotinine concentration, which is the gold
      standard in verifying smoking status.

      Study population:

      The study will include four groups: 1) 60 smokers reporting > 10 cigarettes per day, 2) 60
      smokers reporting less than or equal to 10 cigarettes per day, 3) 60 nonsmokers reporting
      regular environmental exposure to tobacco smoke, and 4) 60 nonsmokers reporting limited or no
      environmental exposure to tobacco smoke (total of 120 smokers and 120 nonsmokers).

      Design:

      Parallel groups design.

      Outcome Measures:

      1) breath CO; 2) semiquantitative salivary cotinine; 3) quantitative salivary nicotine,
      cotinine, and 3-hydroxycotinine; 4) semiquantitative urinary cotinine; 5) quantitative
      urinary nicotine, cotinine, norcotinine, and 3-hydroxycotinine; and 6) self-reported smoking
      variables.
