    
      MORAb-009 is a high-affinity monoclonal antibody raised against human mesothelin, a membrane
      glycoprotein thought to be involved in cell adhesion and tightly associated with a range of
      cancers. It has been shown that mesothelin is over-expressed in pancreatic cancers,
      mesotheliomas, and ovarian or mesothelin-expressing ovarian or non-small cell lung cancers,
      while showing little expression in normal tissues. Preclinical experiments indicate that
      MORAb-009 is a potentially useful anti-cancer agent. This clinical trial is being performed
      to determine the safety of MORAb-009 in subjects with mesothelin-expressing tumors, as well
      as to establish serum pharmacokinetics of the antibody, and to assess tumor antigens that may
      serve as predictors of a response to MORAb-009.
