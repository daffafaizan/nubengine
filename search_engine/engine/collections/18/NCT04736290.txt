      changes perioperatively, while in some reports the incidence rises up to 80%. Despite the
      reported high prevalence of perioperative neurocognitive disorders (NCD), their exact
      etiology is still largely unknown.

      Preliminary evidence suggest a possible relationship between Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio
      (NLR) and Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and perioperative neurocognitive disorders (NCD).
      We are going to investigate whether the values of NLR and PLR in patients undergoing elective
      non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia, are related with increased risk of
      perioperative NCD.
