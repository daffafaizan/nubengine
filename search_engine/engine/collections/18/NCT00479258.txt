      recruitment for the pediatric study, A2171083, was placed on hold. Two subjects completed the
      informed consent/assent process and entered the A2171083 study but none received treatment.
      The first subject withdrew consent during the Baseline Run-in period which was prior to
      Randomization. The second subject screen failed at Visit 1. After this time, Nektar, the
      company from which Pfizer licensed Exubera, announced on April 9, 2008 that it had stopped
      its search for a new marketing partner. Accordingly, there will be no commercial availability
      of Exubera. As a result, study A2171083 was terminated and no further recruitment took place.
