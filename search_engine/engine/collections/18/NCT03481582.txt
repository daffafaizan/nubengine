    
      90 female patients will be divided into 2 equal groups:

        -  Group I: 30 female patients with unexplained infertility.

        -  Group II: 30 female patients with unexplained infertility will receive nitroglycerin
           trans-dermal patch.

      All subjects will be subjected to the following:

        -  Proper history taking on past medical history, menstrual history and infertility workup.

        -  Proper examination (general, abdominal and local examinations)

        -  Investigations to diagnose unexplained infertility ( male partner's semen analysis as
           well as documented ovulation and a patent uterine cavity and Fallopian tubes in the
           female partner).

        -  Group II (30 patients with unexplained infertility)will receive: (nitrodermal®) 5 mg
           (patch)as a source of Nitric oxide from 2nd day of cycle till maturation of the
           follicles ≥ 18 mm just for one cycle

        -  All women included in each group will be subjected to trans-vaginal ultrasound for
           folliculometry till maturation of the follicle ≥18mm.

        -  Once the follicle reached ≥18 mm 3D power Doppler will be used to assess the uterine and
           sub-endometrial blood flow.

        -  All women in each group will be subjected to urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) assay. The
           urinary LH assay will be started on cycle day 11, and repeated daily till detection of
           the LH surge.

        -  Six days after detection of the LH surge, 3D power Doppler will be repeated to assess
           the uterine and sub-endometrial blood flow.
