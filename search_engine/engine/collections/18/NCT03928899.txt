      affect fetal growth. Optimal delivery timing in women with GDM remains controversial. This
      decision process involves balancing the potential for complications that are caused by
      increased interventions with the benefit of avoidance of future adverse outcomes. Thus, the
      aim of the present trial is to explore the best management on the timing of delivery of
      pregnant women with GDM that controlled with only diet and exercise, which can both decrease
      the risk of macrosomia and the risk of cesarean delivery.
