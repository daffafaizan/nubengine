    
      This study is composed of Phase 1 part (the dose-evaluation part and the expansion part) and
      Phase 2 part.

      In the dose-evaluation part of Phase 1 part, at least 3 subjects will receive ASP2215 at each
      dose (low, middle, and high) for determination of MTD and/or RED. Treatment of AML in Phase 1
      part is composed of 3 periods of therapy: remission induction, consolidation, and
      maintenance. The decision of whether or not to proceed to the next dose will be made based on
      the occurrence of DLT during Cycle 1 of the induction period.

      In the expansion part of Phase 1 part, a maximum of 3 subjects will receive ASP2215 at RED
      that has been recommended in the dose-evaluation part and the safety will be assessed based
      on the onset of DLTs during Cycle 1 of the induction and consolidation periods.

      In Phase 2 part, Subjects will receive ASP2215 at the recommended dose established in Phase 1
      part. The target population will be limited to newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML.

      New locations for Phase 2 part will be selected and added, while locations for Phase 1 part
      are shown as 'Completed'.
