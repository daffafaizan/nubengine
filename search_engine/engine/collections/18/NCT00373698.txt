    
      3CM consists of (1) a prepared practice, (2) care management, and (3) enhanced mental health
      support. A prepared practice refers to education for primary care clinicians and office staff
      about practice guidelines and evidence-based care, the skills needed for use of assessment
      measures, and the use of communication forms and routines. The education plan consists of
      predisposing activities, including active teaching and learning, and enabling and reinforcing
      activities in order to help clinicians use newly acquired skills and to reinforce the
      continued use of these skills in practice. Care management is accomplished by telephone,
      usually by a centrally located care manager during acute phase treatment and follow up to
      answer patient questions, promote adherence to the clinician's management plan, and help
      patients overcome barriers to adherence. Enhanced mental health support is provided by a
      psychiatrist who supervises care managers by telephone, provides informal consultation to
      primary care clinicians, and helps to increase the quantity or quality of mental health
      referral resources.
