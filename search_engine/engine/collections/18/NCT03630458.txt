      referred to as millet couscous, is highly satiating in populations living in the West African
      Sahel. Results from a previous human study conducted the investigators indicated that
      traditional West African foods made from pearl millet and sorghum (millet couscous, millet
      thick porridge, and sorghum thick porridge) exhibit markedly delayed rates of gastric
      emptying compared to Western foods (pasta, boiled potatoes, and white rice) in a population
      from Mali, Africa. The delayed gastric emptying rate of the thick porridges can be attributed
      at least partially to the impact of viscosity, while the cause of the delayed gastric
      emptying rate of the millet couscous remains unclear. The overall aim of this research is to
      determine why millet couscous exhibits a delayed rate of gastric emptying, while also
      assessing other digestive properties to gain a better understanding of the factors that could
      be contributing to this outcome. Therefore, gastric emptying rate, glycemic response,
      fermentation, and appetitive response are all being assessed for West African and Western
      foods in a population residing in the United States.
