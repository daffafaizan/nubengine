    
      GC-FLC is a cooperative consortium of principal investigators from academic institutions and
      community-based sites treating patients with NAFLD and NASH. The investigators will leverage
      the multidisciplinary expertise within this network in bio-banking, high-throughput
      technologies, and biomedical informatics to give investigators the power to analyze
      effectiveness data at many different levels of resolution, ranging from subsets of patients
      to very large populations.

      GC-FLC will use standardized data collection practices, study data monitoring, and an
      comprehensive observational protocol in order to increase the efficiency and minimize costs
      associated with performing clinical research while ensuring collection of detailed critical
      safety and effectiveness data on prescribed NASH therapies. GC-FLC engages community and
      academic practice providers as partners in the research to ensure rapid translation of
      research findings into improvement in healthcare quality and outcomes and to help engage
      scientists at the interfaces between clinical research and the community. Furthermore, GC-FLC
      provides the opportunity to pair-comparison between liver biopsy and non-invasive biomarkers
      in differential low-risk and high-risk population for treatment in real world settings.
