      Any patient who has not experienced unacceptable toxicity and who is deemed to be responding
      to the study drug (no evidence of disease progression) is permitted to continue receiving
      SU5416 in 4-week treatment cycles (up to a maximum of 1 year of therapy) until that patient
      experiences either unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression, as defined in the protocol.
