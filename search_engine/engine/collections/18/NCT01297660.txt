      completeness and the level of the lesion. Patients with suprasacral injury usually suffer
      from neurogenic detrusor overactivity mostly combined with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia.
      Without adequate treatment, this adverse combination puts the upper urinary tract at risk due
      to high intravesical pressure often causing vesico-ureteral reflux. Based on improved
      therapeutic options in the last decades, life expectancy and quality of life constantly
      increased in spinal cord injury patients. The investigators aim to evaluate the bladder
      function in the long-term after spinal cord injury.
