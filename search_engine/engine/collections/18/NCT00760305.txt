      Control Program is a 6 week psychoeducational intervention that was shown to improve pain
      management in oncology outpatients with pain from bone metastasis. However, this promising
      intervention requires replication in samples of oncology patients with cancer pain outside of
      the United States.

      The purpose of the study was to test the effectiveness of The PRO-SELF Pain Control Program
      in Norwegian cancer patients and their family caregivers. Only data on patient outcomes will
      be presented.

      The theoretical framework for this study incorporated elements of Orem's self-care theory, as
      well as the principles of academic detailing and nurse coaching to change patients' self-care
      behaviors regarding cancer pain management.

      Two hundred adult cancer patients with pain from skeletal metastasis and their caregivers
      participated in this study. Patients were randomized to either the PRO-SELF program or
      standard care. Patients completed questionnaires about pain, physical functioning, quality of
      life, anxiety, and depression at the time of enrollment and after 6 weeks. Data on analgesics
      were collected through chart reviews and patient diaries. Both groups received home visits
      and telephone calls by an oncology nurse over a period of six weeks. Participants in the
      intervention group received education about pain management and were coached to improve their
      pain management behaviors. Two-way repeated measures analyses of variance will be done to
      determine differences in pain intensity scores and to evaluate the differences over time in
      the total amount of opioid analgesics taken by the patients.
