      have been documented to support care transitions in other clinical populations (e.g.,
      Coleman, 2003 on persons with continuous complex needs; Viggiano, et al., 2012 on persons
      with mental health issues), along with novel package elements based on the investigators'
      experience working with persons with dementia and BPSD. The investigators propose to conduct
      a preliminary analysis of patient and staff outcomes comparing an enhanced care transition
      process with a control group receiving usual care. The investigators' proposed enhanced care
      transition process will contain 5 elements: 1. Unified transfer care document adapted to the
      post-care transition location 2. Videos of BPSD management to better communicate care
      provision, 3. Provision to -the post-care transition location a patient specific briefcase
      containing activities that help to reduce BPSD, 4. In-person care transition meeting between
      sites, including the family, to transfer knowledge, 5. In person care demonstration (when
      possible), and 6. Follow-up visits post transition with a transition team (a service already
      in existence but not consistently used). The investigators hope that with improved
      communication, discharge locations will be better equipped to manage BPSD, and reduce the
      likelihood of adverse events for both patients and staff.
