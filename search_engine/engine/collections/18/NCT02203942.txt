      causative organisms. One of these commercial tests has undergone validation published in a
      scientific journal, only in an STD clinic population. The primary outcome of this study is to
      compare NAAT diagnostic methods to traditional gold-standard tests for BV, VVC and TV in
      symptomatic and asymptomatic women in the general gynecology office as well as in a
      vulvovaginitis referral office. Addressing incorrect evaluation and diagnosis will lead to
      correct treatment for women suffering from vaginitis.
