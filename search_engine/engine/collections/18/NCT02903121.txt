      or prolonged bleeding while using the ENG contraceptive implant. The first phase will consist
      of a randomized, controlled, double blind placebo-controlled clinical trial over a 90-day
      reference period and the second phase will allow both study arms to receive open-label
      treatment over an additional 90-day reference period. The primary outcome of the study will
      be the total number of consecutive bleeding-free days in first 30 days from Day 1 of first
      treatment (TX1).
