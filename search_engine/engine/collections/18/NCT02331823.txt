      the retreatment TB patients may develop multi-drug resistant. The resistant rate of any of
      the anti-TB drug is 35.9%, and the multi-drug resistant rate is 15.4%. Retreatment TB becomes
      one of the factors which inhibit the decrease of morbidity and mortality of TB. It is also a
      tuff work in TB control. At present the standardized regimen for retreatment TB is
      2SHREZ/6HRE or 3HREZ/6HRE. The drugs in the regimen are all first-line anti-TB drugs which
      are unsuitable for the high drug resistance prevalence, because the cure rate of this regimen
      is low and the adverse reaction is severe.

      Our study is a national multi-center, prospective trail to investigate the efficacy of a new
      super-short regimen for retreatment TB patients. The new regimen consists of 5 drugs lasting
      5 months. The cure rate and success rate of the new regimen is compared with standardized
      regimen usually 8-9 months in order to obtain the optimized regimen.
