      breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Factors examined include: Hormonal
      and growth factor status (follicle stimulating hormone, total, bound, and free estradiol,
      androgens, sex hormone binding globulin, thyroid hormones, prolactin, insulin-like growth
      factors I and II, and plasma leptin) Factors affecting energy intake or expenditure (oral
      intake, physical activity, and resting metabolic rate) Psychological factors (depression and
      quality of life) II. Evaluate the effect of chemotherapy on hormonal and growth factor status
      in these patients.

      III. Assess the impact of chemotherapy on bone marrow density in these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Data is collected from women diagnosed with primary breast cancer at 3 points (5 visits): (i)
      after breast cancer surgery, but before chemotherapy begins (2 visits to NIH day hospital 1
      week apart); (ii) 2-3 weeks after chemotherapy has ended (2 visits, 1 week apart); and (iii)
      6 months after chemotherapy has ended (1 visit). Tests conducted during these visits include
      evaluation of blood for hormones, growth factors, and leptin; body composition by DXA;
      visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue by an axial CT scan; and evaluation of
      resting metabolic rate and daily energy expenditure by a single administration of doubly
      labeled water at visits "a" and "b" during data collection timepoints 1 and 2. Questionnaires
      assessing epidemiologic risk factors for breast cancer, dietary intake, physical activity,
      depression, and quality of life are also administered at the three timepoints.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 140 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
