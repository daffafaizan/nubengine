      Patients dying before 1989 were identified using the VA's Beneficiary Identification Records
      Location Subsystem and the National Death Index (NDI). Using NDI information to locate them,
      death certificates were obtained on all dead patients. Arrangements were made to collect data
      on the VA hospitalizations occurring after antihypertensive treatment had begun, and
      application was made to match patients against the USRDS Dialysis and Transplant Registry.
      The basic clinical data were collected in 32 VA Hypertension Screening and Treatment Program
      (HSTP) clinics during the 40 month period beginning in 1974. Approximately 30,000 completed
      Screening and Evaluation Forms and 75,000 Treatment Visit Forms were completed during the 40
      months of data collection. The collected information was entered into the HSTP Master File at
      the VA Computer Center in Austin, Texas. Predictors were sought for (1) all-cause mortality,
      (2) cause-specific mortality (obtained from death certificates and hospitalization and clinic
      records), (3) endstage renal disease (obtained from the USRDS Dialysis and Transplant
      Registry), (4) VA hospital usage combined with other data related to cost care.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
