      curative resection. Establishing an effective prognostic evaluation method is able to not
      only assess patients' prognosis but also guide the treatment. At the same time, it helps us
      to gain knowledge of the mechanism underlying recurrence and metastasis of liver cancer and
      to provide the basis for the search for new effective intervention method.

      In order to establish an effective prognostic evaluation method, we select liver cancer
      patients undergoing curative resection in our hospital. We plan to employ various
      technologies such as gene chip, methylation chip and flow cytometry to carry out
      comprehensive researches on liver cancer cell genetics, epigenetics, stem cells and tumor
      microenvironment changes. By analyzing clinical information including pathological features,
      patients' response to treatment, relapse, metastasis and survival, we aim to obtain the
      important factors affecting liver cancer prognosis, survival, recurrence and metastasis in
      order to be able to find and establish the effective prognostic evaluation method.
