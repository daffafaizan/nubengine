      (WHO III) adequately. This group includes women with premature ovarian failure (POF),
      incipient ovarian failure (IOF), poor response after ovarian hyperstimulation, early
      menopause and hypergonadotropic primary amenorrhea. The standardized phenotyping consists of
      a questionnaire focusing on reproductive, medical, and family history; ultrasonography to
      assess ovarian reserve and/or antral follicle count and obtaining an extra blood sampling
      during routine endocrine screening for genotyping.

      Phenotyping of patients presenting with ovarian dysfunction is of crucial importance when
      genotyping will be performed. The goal of this genotyping will be the identification of
      genetic factors associated with the (premature) depletion of the stock of ovarian follicles.
      It will be performed for isolated WHO III patients in an association (case-control) study for
      known candidate genes. In familial WHO III cases, genome wide linkage analysis will be
      performed.
