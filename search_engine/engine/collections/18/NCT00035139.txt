      on some days and methylphenidate on others. During this phase of the study the effects of the
      medication on children's performance on a computerized test of attention will be assessed.
      Individuals who do not have significant methylphenidate side effects during the first phase
      of the study will then participate in the second phase of the study. During the second phase
      subjects will receive either methylphenidate or placebo for 8 weeks. Neuropsychological
      measures of attention, memory, behavioral inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and motor
      performance will be obtained at baseline and after the 8 week medication trial in order to
      assess methylphenidate effects on the rate of recovery. Recovery will also be assessed using
      an interview measure of adaptive behavior and cognitive functioning. A stimulant medication
      side effect rating scale will be used to monitor for common methylphenidate adverse effects
      throughout both phases of the study
