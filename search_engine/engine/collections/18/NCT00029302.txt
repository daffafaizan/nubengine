    
      OBJECTIVE: The present study is aimed to clarify which structure or network of structures are
      responsible for the temporal linkage in bimanual co-ordination in healthy humans.

      STUDY POPULATION: Healthy normal volunteers.

      DESIGN:

      fMRI: Anatomical MRI and fMRI sequences are performed to obtain blood-oxygenation
      level-dependent (BOLD) imaging of brain activation during which movement performance will be
      measured with respect to movement synchrony, movement speed and amplitude.

      Multi-channel EEG recording performed while motor performance is monitored.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      fMRI: BOLD will be obtained using baseline correction.

      EEG: band-power and inter-regional coherence will be calculated using baseline correction.
