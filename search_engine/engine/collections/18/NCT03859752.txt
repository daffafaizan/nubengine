    
      First-in-human, Phase 1, multiple dose-dose escalation study designed to determine safety,
      tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase 2 dose of TR1801-ADC in patients
      with select solid tumors that express c-Met. This study will also assess pharmacokinetics
      (PK), anti-tumor activity, and correlation between clinical outcomes (safety, anti-tumor
      activity, and PK) and c-Met expression.
