    
      The first-in-human dose (FHD) trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      dose-escalation trial assessing safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and
      multiple oral doses of PA in healthy male subjects.

      The study consists of two stages: single dose administration and multiple dose
      administration.

      The single dose administration stage includes 5 cohorts, multiple dose administration stage
      includes at least 4 cohorts (groups). Each cohort includes 8 subjects (6 active drugs and 2
      placebos). Cohorts intake ascending doses of study drug. The dose of 1st cohort is 1,0 mg/ml,
      the doses for the following cohorts will be estimated by the Data Monitoring Committee based
      on pharmacokinetics and safety results of previous group.

      For each subject study includes screening period, one baseline period on Day -1, a treatment
      period (1 day - at single dose stage; 14 days - at multiple dose stage), followed by safety,
      PK, assessments up to 72-96 hours post dose. Follow-up visits will take place on Day 7 ; 30;
      60 (single dose stage) and 30; 60; 90 (multiple dose stage).
