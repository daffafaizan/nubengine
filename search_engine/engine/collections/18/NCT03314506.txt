      many different types of cells, such as immune cells, endothelial cells, and fat precursor
      cells. Differences or changes in the number of immune cells, endothelial cells, and fat
      precursor cells in fat tissue can have a great impact on metabolic health. The abundance of
      all immune cells, endothelial cells, and fat precursor cell types are known to change when a
      person loses or gains weight. For example, the abundance of inflammatory cells is often found
      to decrease markedly with weight loss - and this change has been linked to the profound
      improvements in metabolic health that occur with weight loss. In contrast, the effects of
      exercise on immune cells, endothelial cells, and fat precursor cells in fat tissue is not
      known. Determining the effects of exercise on changes in the cellular composition within fat
      tissue will provide important information for optimizing lifestyle interventions aimed at
      improving metabolic health.
