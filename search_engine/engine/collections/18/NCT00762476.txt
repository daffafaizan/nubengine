      rhinovirus season. While viral upper respiratory infections are generally mild and
      self-limited, they are associated with an enormous economic burden both in lost productivity
      and in expenditures for treatment. Rhinovirus infection is frequently associated with medical
      complications that have substantial morbidity such as acute otitis media and exacerbation of
      asthma.

      Marketed treatment options for rhinovirus consist primarily of symptomatic cold remedies have
      only modest effects on specific cold symptoms. 3804-250A is under investigation for the
      prevention of rhinovirus infection by interruption of person-to-person transmission appears
      to be technologically and economically feasible.

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, Placebo controlled, multi-site, parallel design
      clinical trial conducted in the natural setting. The study will be conducted during a 10-week
      period during the fall rhinovirus epidemic season. Healthy, normal subjects will be recruited
      and randomly assigned to the AV Lotion or Placebo control group. Subjects will use the
      assigned test product on a defined schedule and will record the presence of cold illness
      symptoms daily. Subjects will return to the study site every week during the study for review
      and clarification of study diary entries, for review and assessment of compliance, for
      specimen collection for rhinovirus PCR.
