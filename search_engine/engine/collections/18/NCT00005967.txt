      I. Determine the relationship between tipifarnib dose and inhibition of farnesylation in
      malignant cells of patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.

      II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine the
      clinical activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 dose levels.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily for 21 days. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 1 course of therapy, patients
      may receive subsequent therapy at the maximum tolerated dose at the investigator's
      discretion.
