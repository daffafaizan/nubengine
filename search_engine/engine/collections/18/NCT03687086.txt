      healthcare systems using a three-step screening process that minimizes time and travel burden
      to participants. Step 1 (identification of participants): Investigators will identify
      participants aged >= 55 years who have current prescriptions for lorazepam, temazepam,
      alprazolam, and/or zolpidem for >= 3 months. Investigators will use three sources to identify
      these patients: medication lists from electronic health records/administrative data, consults
      to insomnia clinic, and referrals from providers. The research team will mail a recruitment
      letter (with opt-out card) to patients identified from these sources. Step 2 (phone screening
      for current or prior insomnia and current hypnotic use); Patients who endorse a history of
      insomnia symptoms and current hypnotic use will be invited for an in-person screening. Step 3
      (in-person screening for remaining eligibility criteria (and baseline assessments): After
      written consent, the in-person screening visit consists of a comprehensive sleep, mental
      health, and brief physical health assessment. Individuals who meet study criteria and agree
      to continue will be randomized to receive either the Program A (N=94) or Program B (N=94).
      The interventions are approximately 2 months. Following intention-to-treat principles, all
      randomized participants will complete an assessment immediately after the intervention ends
      and 6 months after completing treatment. Participants will be compensated monetarily for
      assessment visits. Investigators will measure hypnotic expectancies, hypnotic
      discontinuation, and insomnia severity post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up.
