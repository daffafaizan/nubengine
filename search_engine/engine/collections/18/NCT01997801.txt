      Despite small incisions, robot thyroidectomy did not offer satisfactory reduction in
      postoperative pain compared to open thyroidectomy. Ketamine is a non-competitive
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker and takes some attractive advantages in terms of
      pain control. When low dose ketamine is perioperatively administrated, opioid sparing effect
      during postoperative period is reported in various surgical procedures such as spine,
      thoracic, and gynecologic surgery. Ketamine's beneficial effect on postoperative pain has not
      been investigated in patients undergoing robot thyroidectomy. The investigators hypothesized
      that perioperative ketamine administration can reduce acute postoperative pain after robot
      thyroidectomy and the incidence of chronic pain hypoesthesia on anterior chest at 3 months
      after surgery.
