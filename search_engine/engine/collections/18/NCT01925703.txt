      safety of an accelerated intravenous iron regimen in patients with heart failure and iron
      deficiency. Recent investigations have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with the use
      of intravenous iron therapy in this patient population, but a weekly regimen administered to
      ambulatory patients may be inconvenient, impractical, and associated with less than optimal
      adherence rates for many patients, especially those with reduced functional capacity. The
      heart failure population is characterized by frequent hospitalizations, which would make an
      accelerated inpatient regimen a convenient and attractive option for improving heart failure
      symptoms, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. Accelerated regimens have been
      demonstrated as being both safe and effective in other patient populations, but no studies to
      date have evaluated this strategy in hospitalized patients with heart failure.
