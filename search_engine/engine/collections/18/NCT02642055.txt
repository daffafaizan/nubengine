      cognitive deficits which are assumed to mediate attention pathways. Targeting those
      underlying areas could reduce ADHD symptoms and potentially lead to greater transfer and
      generalization to functioning in the classroom and every day life.

      Neuro+ combines neurofeedback, biofeedback, and go/no-go training protocols embedded in a
      training video game to help develop and improve attention skills. The protocols function as
      follows:

      Neurofeedback: Users wear a dry, wireless, easy-to-use EEG headset that interfaces with
      computer software to provide feedback on their level of brain activation, or focus. Users
      must focus in order to advance through the training game.

      Motion-biofeedback: Accelerometers in the headset send data on users' movement to the
      training game, such that users must maintain complete control of their bodies and remain
      absolutely still in order to advance through the game and avoid costly point penalties.

      Go/no-go training: To practice impulse control, users will be challenged with adaptive
      "go/no-go tasks," requiring them to quickly and accurately respond to target stimuli and
      ignore distractions, with the tasks becoming more difficult as the user improves.
