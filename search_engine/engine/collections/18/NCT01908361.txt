      rehabilitation and conventional rehabilitations (CR) on motor function, daily functions,
      mobility, quality of life, and kinematic variables. We hypothesize that patients receiving
      hybrid rehabilitation will gain more recovery than patients receiving CR in proximal (e.g.,
      motor function) and in distal outcomes (e.g., quality of life) and that patients in the
      hybrid rehabilitation groups will show more genuine upper extremity motor recovery than those
      in conventional rehabilitation groups, as indicated by kinematic measures.

      The second aim will be to examine the comparative treatment effects between unilateral hybrid
      and bilateral hybrid rehabilitation on various aspects of outcomes. We hypothesize that the
      unilateral group will improve more on outcomes associated with distal upper limb (UL) control
      and that the bilateral rehabilitation group will improve more on outcomes associated with
      proximal UL control.

      Third, we will collect biomarker indexes before and after the interventions to monitor the
      changes of oxidative stress and inflammatory levels.
