      hypotension can lead to perioperative myocardial injury. It has been reported that a systolic
      pressure of less than 50-55mmHg or greater than 40% decrease can lead to cardiac
      complications. The mechanism of hypotension leading to postoperative myocardial injury is due
      to hypoperfusion and ischemic reperfusion injury.

      In this randomized controlled study, the blood pressure for participants in the standardized
      group is maintained as follows: mean blood pressure greater than 65mmHg and systolic blood
      pressure less than 160mmHg. The individualized group participants' blood pressure is
      maintained at a target of 20% within the preoperative ward blood pressure. Anesthesia and
      intraoperative management are the same in both groups to target a bispectral index level of
      50. In order to quantitatively measure the myocardial injury, high sensitive cardiac troponin
      T (hs-cTnT) will be measured pre- and postoperatively. A level greater than 14ng/dl has been
      reported to be associated with myocardial injury and mortality. The objective of this study
      is to show that the standardized protocol of maintaining a mean pressure greater than 65mmHg
      is non inferior to the individualized management in terms of postoperative myocardial injury.
