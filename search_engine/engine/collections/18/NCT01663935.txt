      dopamine, and vision improvement will occur as a result of improved retinal function in
      response to the deficient neurotransmitter dopamine. This study has a pretest-posttest design
      in order to determine if improvement in vision is in response to replacement of deficiency
      (dopamine). The electroretinography (ERG) testing and optical coherence tomography (OCT) will
      be critical determinants to confirm vision improvement as a result of improved retinal
      function, but are not primary outcome data. Main outcome measures will be collected at
      pre-treatment, 1 month, 3 months, and 4 months. Change in visual acuity as measured in logMAR
      by Snellen or sweep visual evoked potential (SVEP) after 3 months of treatment is the primary
      outcome. Patients include OCA1a patients, OCA1b, OCA2, and unclassified Oculocutaneous
      albinism (OCA). OCA1a patients clinically are known to have the worst vision, and
      physiologically have the lowest (or absent) levels of tyrosinase function (Dopamine
      Production). All patients will be treated with Levodopa/carbidopa 4mg/kg/day in three divided
      doses.
