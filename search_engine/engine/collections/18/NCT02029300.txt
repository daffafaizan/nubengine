      intubation versus oral fiberoptic intubation in children less than 2 years of age. Other
      factors that will be assesed include operator experience, the ease and time for fiberoptic
      grade of laryngeal view, time for fiberoptic tracheal intubation, and complications.

      This study is looking to explore whether or not the nasal route significantly improves the
      ease and time for successful fiberoptic intubation compared to the oral route in children
      less than or equal to 2 years of age. While also asking, will operator experience influence
      time to tracheal intubation with either route?

      The investigators hypothesize that the nasal route fiberoptic intubation will be faster than
      the oral route, for both the trainee and the expert, and that there will be minimal
      differences between experts and trainees with nasal fiberoptic intubation.
