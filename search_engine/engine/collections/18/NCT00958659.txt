      I. Establish a robust messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene expression classifier for
      improved outcome prediction in children with neuroblastoma by using real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) to quantify mRNA levels from genes that have been shown in at least 2
      independent studies to have predictive power.

      II. Identify microRNA (miRNA) patterns that have prognostic significance in neuroblastoma
      (NB) as accumulating evidence indicates that alterations in miRNA expression play a critical
      role in tumorigenesis and can be used in prognostic evaluation.

      III. To perform an integrated analysis of the established microRNA classifier with our mRNA
      signature to determine whether it results in even better classification of NB tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected samples are analyzed for 59 prognostic genes by real-time quantitative
      PCR-based gene expression profiling.
