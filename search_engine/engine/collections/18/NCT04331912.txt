    
      This is a retrospective study. The analysis includes patients with advanced neuroendocrine
      cancer (NEN) treated with systemic therapy, because of inoperable primary tumor or/and
      metastasis, clinical, imaging, biochemical disease progression and no standard method of
      treatment hormone overproduction symptoms. Systemic treatment including: somatostatin
      receptor analogues, molecular targeted therapy (sunitinib and everolimus), chemotherapy and
      peptide radioisotope therapy (Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy). The data of patients
      with advanced NEN with histopathological or/and clinical or/and biochemical confirmation is
      collected from medical records. Neuroendocrine cancer from digestive system, respiratory
      system and another rarely occurring cancer including cancer connected with genetic syndromes
      like: MEN1, MEN2, VHL, NF1, SDHx will be included. The progression-free survival (PFS),
      overall survival (OS) and influence of various factors on survival will be estimated.
      Analyzed factors: age, sex, ethnicity, specific symptoms at the time of diagnosis, carcinoid
      heart disease, level of 5HIAA in DZM, level of CgA, liver test, size of tumor, cell
      differentiation of tumor based on Ki-67 index, liver metastases. The research will be
      conducted for above 3 years since July 2019 till December 2022 on planned group 1500
      patients. The aim of the study is to estimate median OS and PFS in advanced NEN patients
      treated with different schedule of systemic treatment. The second goal is to create clinical
      practice recommendation based on potential prognostic factors of OS and PFS due to type of
      therapy in different NEN subgroups.
