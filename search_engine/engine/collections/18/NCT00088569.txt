      painless means of altering the activity of cortical neurons and their response to exogenous
      stimulation. This has been demonstrated in the human motor cortex where local anodal
      polarization increases, and cathodal decreases, the motor evoked potential from TMS. Recent
      experiments from our lab suggest that polarization may have analogous effects on the
      prefrontal cortex, where anodal current enhances functions including verbal fluency and
      psychomotor speed and cathodal current produces slight performance decrements. We are
      interested in the potential of DC current to enhance function in patients with frontal lobe
      disorders and to reduce frontal overactivation in conditions such as drug craving. Treatments
      that alter frontal activity may also have mood altering properties. In order to establish the
      principle that DC polarization is able to alter frontal lobe activity we propose to combine
      DC polarization with a variably loaded frontal activation task and measure regional cerebral
      blood flow (rCBF with H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.

      Study population: Twenty healthy individuals will be studied.

      Design: On three different days, participants will receive right dorsolateral prefrontal
      anodal, cathodal, or sham treatment. On each day, rCBF will be measured during rest without
      and then with treatment. Then subjects will perform the N-back task (a test of working
      memory) during treatment with the working memory load (N) varied between 0 and 3 items from
      scan to scan.

      Outcome measures: Resting rCBF and the relationship between cognitive load and rCBF at the
      treatment site will be compared between treatments in order to look for effects on
      task-related activation and performance.
