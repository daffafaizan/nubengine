      Methodology

        1. Subjects are recruited;

        2. History taking, physical examination and SGPT are done by M.D.;

        3. 100 subjects are distributed randomly to numbers 1-100;

        4. Factory provides 2 groups of capsules in randomized packets numbered 1 -100; each
           package contains 3 sub-packages; each sub-package contains 2 capsules of either placebo
           or 370 mg glutathione capsules. All the three sub-packages will be all placebo or all
           glutathione. 50 packages are placebo and 50 packages are glutathione;

        5. Subjects are examined as follows:

             -  Hour 0: 3 ml of blood taken for blood alcohol and blood acetaldehyde;

             -  Hour 0- 1: consume Thai Whisky (40% alcohol) 60 ml with snacks;

             -  Hour 1: ml of blood taken for blood alcohol and blood acetaldehyde;

             -  Hour 1.30: ml of blood taken for blood alcohol and blood acetaldehyde;

             -  Hour 2.30: ml of blood taken for blood alcohol and blood acetaldehyde;

             -  Hour 3.30: ml of blood taken for blood alcohol and blood acetaldehyde;

             -  Hour 12: ml of blood taken for blood alcohol and blood acetaldehyde, and Alcohol
                Hangover Symptom evaluation of each subject is done individually.

      Using Wendy S. Slutske et al Scale 0-4:

      0= no symptom

        1. minimal

        2. some

        3. much

        4. most
