      visit, subjects will return to be fitted with a definitive rigid carbon fiber socket. At this
      time, a questionnaire and physical assessments will determine subjects comfort and safety.
      The physical assessment consists of a ten minute walk on a treadmill, at a self-selected
      pace. A balancing test on a SMART Balance Master will also be used to assess subject safety,
      by utilizing the limits of stability protocol. Subjects' will be required to wear the
      prosthesis given to them for one week before returning for a follow-up appointment. On the
      third visit, the subjects' will return the first prosthesis to the investigators of the
      study, where an additional socket will be given to the subject for the second portion of this
      study. Subjects will be evaluated with a questionnaire and physical assessments to determine
      comfort and safety. Participants will be required to wear the prosthesis given to them for
      one week before returning for a follow-up appointment. During the final appointment, the
      subjects will return all devices given to them to an investigator of the study.
