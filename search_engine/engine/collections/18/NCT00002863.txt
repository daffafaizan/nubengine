      patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity.

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo 1 session of cryoablation. Patients with high-grade sarcoma
      receive systemic chemotherapy 10-14 days after cryoablation at the discretion of the
      consulting medical oncologist, and undergo surgery 2-3 weeks following chemotherapy. Patients
      with low-grade sarcoma and those with high-grade sarcoma who do not receive chemotherapy
      undergo surgery 4-6 weeks after cryoablation. Surgery for all patients consists of en bloc
      resection or amputation, with limb salvage attempted when feasible. Patients are followed
      weekly for 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients (approximately 6 patients with low-grade, high-risk
      sarcoma and 6 with high-grade sarcoma) will be entered over approximately 6 months. The study
      will be suspended for the following: vascular complication that requires surgical
      intervention for correction in 2 patients; any neuropraxia that shows no evidence of
      resolution after 3 months in 2 patients; any wound complication that requires surgical
      correction in 4 patients; or any deep wound infection that requires surgical drainage in 4
      patients.
