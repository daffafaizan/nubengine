    
      This study is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation, and cohort expansion study designed to
      characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary
      antitumor activity of the combination of MGD009 and MGA012, each of which is administered by
      IV infusion.The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase to determine the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) (if no MTD is defined) of the combination,
      followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase to further define the safety and initial antitumor
      activity of the combination with the doses established in the Dose Escalation Phase. Patients
      with B7-H3-expressing unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors of any
      histology will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase. Following the establishment of an
      MTD, additional patients with specific tumor types will enroll in the Cohort Expansion Phase.
