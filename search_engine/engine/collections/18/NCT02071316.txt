      To evaluate the efficacy of using hexacapron in treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding

        -  Primary outcome: Prevention of rebleeding manifested as hematemesis, melena and drop in
           hemoglobin level by 2g% within 24 hours after therapeutic endoscopy

        -  Secondary outcomes: rebleeding, need for surgery , 30 day mortality

      Expected Significance- The sample size needed to detect a 10% absolute difference in the
      proportion of rebleeding, drop in hemoglobin by 2g% between the hexacapron treated group and
      standard of care group groups with 80% power and 0.05 significant levels(alpha).

      Research methods:

        -  Prospective , randomized controlled trial , double blinded , single center

        -  Duration : 2 years

        -  ~ 300≤ participants ,18≤ years of age

        -  Patients 18≤ years of age admitted to emergency department in Shaare Zedek Medical
           Center with clinical signs and symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding will receive
           initial resuscitation and stabilization maintaining blood pressure and intravascular
           volume.

      Patients will be randomized to 3 groups:

        1. Treatment group - receive I.V. Esomeprazole 80 mg once and then 8mg/h continuously with
           concurrent hexacapron I.V. every 6 hours until 72 hours and then the patient continue
           oral treatment 6 g /day for 7 days.

        2. Standard of care group - receive I.V. Esomeprazole 80 mg once and then 8mg/h
           continuously

             -  Every patient will undergo upper endoscopy within 12 hours of admission to
                emergency department and receive treatment according to the endoscopic findings

             -  If no reason for bleeding will be found in upper endoscopy , treatment will be
                stopped and patient will be excluded

             -  Every participant will fill a questionnaire with informed consent which will have
                to be signed.

                  -  If cannot sign due to his medical condition or disability his guardian will
                     sign or first degree relative

      Study population:

      Patients 18≤ years of age admitted to emergency department in Shaare Zedek MedicalCenter with
      clinical signs and symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding including hematemesis, melena
      and drop in hemoglobin level by 2g%

           laboratory of upper gastrointestinal bleeding • Patients , guardian or family member who
           can sign on informed consent

      Excluded:

        -  Pregnancy, lactation

        -  History of thromboembolic event

        -  Allergic reaction to the drug

        -  Lower gastrointestinal bleeding

        -  Patient receive anticoagulation treatment

        -  Receive drug with interaction to hexacapron
