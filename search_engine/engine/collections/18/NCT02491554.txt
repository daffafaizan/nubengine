      feasibility trial patients suffering from therapy resistant essential tremor (ET) will be
      treated with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).

      After screening (e.g. obtaining informed consent, assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria
      etc.) patients will be randomized to one of the following groups:

      Group 1 (conventional):

      Conventional AC-PC based DBS implantation in the thalamic/subthalamic region (Vim-cZI)
      starting as awake surgery with a brief general anesthesia for stimulator implantation at the
      end of surgery.

      Group 2 (tractographic):

      Magnetic resonance (MR)-tractography guided DBS implantation in the dentato-rubro-thalamic
      bundle (DRT) in general anesthesia

      At the baseline/neurosurgery visit Quality of Life (QoL) and other parameters will assessed.
      Medtronic's Activa INS DBS will be implanted according to randomization. DBS will be started
      approximately one month after surgery and will be applied as per routine.

      Patients will have their routine visits. For this trial data of the (routine) visits six and
      twelve months after neurosurgery will be collected.

      Patients receive DBS after the end of the trial according to local standards.
