      insufficiency (PEI) diagnosis and dietician education. This assessment will be performed as
      an outpatient in parallel with the medical oncology team, by the research dietician. This
      study will be performed in two steps (summarized in Figure 2);

      Step-1 | A prospective cross-sectional assessment of the prevalence of PEI-related symptoms
      in up to n=150 patients with pancreatic malignancy (this will be termed 'the demographic
      cohort'). A sub-set of these patients (n=50) will be tested to elucidate the most efficient
      diagnostic panel for PEI in pancreatic malignancy (this will be termed 'the diagnosis
      cohort').

      Step-2 | A prospective longitudinal validation of the diagnostic panel designed and tested in
      Step-1 and evaluation of dietician intervention (including PERT) and its impact in weight
      loss, symptom evolution, chemotherapy receiving rate, Quality of Life and overall survival
      (this will be termed 'the follow-up cohort' and will include up to n=50 patients).

      All patients included in both steps will have a full nutritional assessment at baseline, and
      PERT treatment (as per standard of care if considered appropriate). Patients in the follow-up
      cohort will be reviewed (at least every 3 months for a maximum of 6 months since study entry)
      by dietician for further intervention and assessment.
