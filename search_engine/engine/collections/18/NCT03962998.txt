    
      This study is a single center, randomized, open label, cross-over study evaluating MB-102
      versus dual sugar testing using lactulose and rhamnose for the assessment of gut
      permeability. Participants will be screened within 30 days of Day 1, and eligible
      participants will be randomized to receive either an oral dose of MB-102 or the dual sugar
      test on Day 1. At a second study visit occurring between 3 to 7 days after completion of the
      first test, participants will return to the study center for the second test. Following
      completion of the second test, participants will return to the study center 7 Â±3 days for a
      follow-up visit to evaluate safety.
