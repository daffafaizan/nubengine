    
      Objective: To analyze the plasma and intracellular concentrations of RAL and ETV
      administrated as 800 and 400 mg once daily respectively compared with standard doses of 400
      and 200 mg/12h, respectively, and if they support its once daily administration.

      Method: Phase IV, prospective, open labelled clinical trial with a planned duration of 24
      weeks in which 16 patients from Hospitales Universitarios Virgen del Roc√≠o will be enrolled.
      A 12 hours pharmacokinetic profile (immediately before and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12
      h) will be obtained after a supervised drug intake while taking RAL or ETV bid.
      Afterwards,the patients will take RAL or ETV once a day for 7 - 10 days. Subsequently, a new
      pharmacokinetic profile (predose and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h after a
      supervised drug intake) will be obtained.
