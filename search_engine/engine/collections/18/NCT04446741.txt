      be conducted at 7 central laboratories (Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe, Hospital
      Universitario de Salamanca, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío,
      Hospital Dr. Negrín de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Hospital Reina Sofía de Córdoba and
      Clínica Universidad de Navarra) belonging to the Spanish PETHEMA Group. The laboratories will
      receive and process bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of patients with AML at the time
      of the initial diagnosis or at relapse or resistance (first or subsequent
      relapse/resistance). The demographic data and clinical characteristics of the patients and of
      the AML, morphological and molecular response will be collected in case report forms (CRFs).
      Since the aim of this study is the molecular diagnosis of AML, all patients with AML will be
      included, regardless of the treatment (or no treatment at all) they receive.

      The physicians will receive the report about the molecular diagnosis for FLT3, NPM1, CBF and
      PML/RARa quickly (<48-96 hours), in order to provide them with knowledge of the mutational
      status, that may cause changes to be made during the initial management of the disease.

      The aim of this project is to set up this rapid screening and diagnostic platform for AML by
      having specimens sent to 7 centralized reference laboratories across the country, where the
      molecular characteristics of leukemic cells will be analyzed by qRT-PCR and NGS technologies
      with high quality standards. This platform will provide homogeneous criteria for assessing
      the biological characteristics of the different entities that make up the disease.

      It is expected that samples of marrow and/or blood of 700 patients with AML will be analyzed
      per year.
