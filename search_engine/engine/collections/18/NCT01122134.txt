      artemisinin derivatives as an alternative. Intravenous artesunate, a water soluble
      artemisinin derivative is more effective than quinine with faster schizonticidal action and
      improved clinical outcome. It is generally well tolerated and safe. This study aims is to
      assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of IV artesunate in treatment of
      severe malaria in adults admitted to Mulago National Referral and Teaching hospital, Uganda.
