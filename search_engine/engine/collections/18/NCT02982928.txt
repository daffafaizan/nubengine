      department. The patient population will include obese patients scheduled for robot-assisted
      or laparoscopic bariatric surgery. There will be no change in our usual anesthetic care for
      these patients. Volume of distribution and elimination half-life of acetaminophen in serum
      samples are the primary measurements of the study. If detected, a significant reduction in
      opioid requirements may lead to improved patient satisfaction and decreased opiate side
      effects.
