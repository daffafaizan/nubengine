      Despite the evidence supporting the importance of smoking cessation, there is a
      well-documented practice gap in the rates at which smoking cessation is being addressed by
      practitioners. The primary objectives of this research study are to determine whether adjunct
      telephone-based smoking cessation follow-up counselling when delivered as part of a
      multi-component intervention:

        1. Increases the rate at which evidence-based smoking cessation interventions are delivered
           to smokers identified in family doctors offices, compared to providing only practice
           supports.

        2. Increases smoking abstinence as measured three months after the estimated target quit
           date (i.e.16 weeks) compared to providing only practice supports.

        3. Is more cost-effective (cost/quit) than providing only practice supports to family
           doctors offices.

      A two-arm before-after matched-pair cluster randomized trial, will test the effectiveness of
      two strategies for integrating smoking cessation treatments into primary care practice
      routines and enhancing cessation. Six to eight family doctors offices will be randomized to
      either a practice support (PS) group, or a follow-up counseling (FC) group. From each of the
      intervention practices a cross-sectional sample of 50 eligible smokers will be recruited pre-
      and post-intervention to assess 5A's delivery and smoking abstinence.
