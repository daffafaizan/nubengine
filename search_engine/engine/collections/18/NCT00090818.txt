    
      The purpose of this clinical research protocol is twofold: 1) to screen patients for protocol
      eligibility for those sponsored primarily by the Craniofacial Genetics Section, the Clinical
      Research Core and other Branches located within the National Institute of Dental and
      Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) as appropriate and 2) to evaluate patients with diseases or
      abnormalities of the oral cavity and/or craniofacial complex for future protocol development.
      Patients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated and treated according to standard
      procedures and therapeutic modalities. No procedures will be done for research only. Standard
      or experimental biochemical, genetic and proteomic tests may be conducted on tissue or blood
      samples collected for diagnosis. Eligible patients will be referred to appropriate NIDCR
      clinical research protocols for further protocol-driven diagnostic workup and therapy.
