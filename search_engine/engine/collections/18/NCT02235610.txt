      but fit into the study inclusion criteria will be retrieved from the donor using current
      donor lung retrieval techniques. These lungs will be brought to the study transplant centre
      to be perfused in our system by the transplant team. Perfusion of these lungs will be
      performed using evaluation solution with addition of red blood cells cross matched with the
      recipient, heparin and antibiotics. Those lungs that after perfusion in our system meet the
      normal transplantation criteria will be considered for transplantation. Lungs will be
      excluded for transplantation if the organs don't meet the normal transplantation criteria.
