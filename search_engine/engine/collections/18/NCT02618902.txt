      manner to determine safety and tolerability, and to enable selection of a suitable dose
      regimen for phase II trials. The primary objective of the phase I study will be to determine
      whether tolDC-based therapy is safe and well tolerated and to establish the dose-response,
      with clinical relapse rates, neurological disability (assessed using various scales) and MRI
      endpoints, measured over 12 months. Patients will serve as their own controls pre- and
      post-vaccination. Completion of screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility
      criteria should take no longer than 6 weeks. First-line treatments will be stopped 6 weeks
      before baseline at the latest.
