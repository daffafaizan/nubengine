      how quickly HCV virus declines. Pegylated interferon and ribavirin are not provided by the
      study, but will be obtained as part of standard of care treatment for hepatitis C.
      Participants must be willing to spend 48 hours in the hospital for frequent blood draws. They
      will be compensated for their time.

      All patients must be HCV genotype 1. All patients must have a liver biopsy prior to
      enrollment into study. (This is not provided by the study).

      HIV-infected patients must have a CD4 cell count>300. If HIV-infected and on antiretroviral
      therapy for HIV, they must be on a stable regimen for 12 weeks. The HIV regimen can not
      include didanosine (Videx).
