      schematically at two levels:

        1. first, at the constitutional level with germline alterations. Family history is found in
           20% of PC patients. Different clinical entities associated with different modes of
           inheritance, susceptibility mutations or polymorphisms, define different evolutionary
           patterns. Also, studies suggested that some genetic polymorphisms alter the response to
           some treatments (such as recurrence after prostatectomy or radiotherapy) or adverse
           effects of those above (such as toxicity of radiation therapy).

        2. secondly, PC is characterized by the accumulation of genetic alterations (somatic
           alterations or acquired mutations). These changes contribute in varying degrees to the
           aggressiveness of the disease (such as early metastatic potential) and treatment failure
           (such as resistance to radiation or hormone resistance).

      The purpose of this study is to establish a register, with a follow up of cohort type and a
      collection of biological samples:

        -  For men with known prostate cancer.

        -  For men with no prostate cancer after a screening procedure for this disease, so that
           their biological samples can be compared to those of men with prostate cancer.

      The registry data and collected biological samples are used to identify genetic and molecular
      factors involved in susceptibility, genesis and evolution of prostate cancers.
