      in approximately 80% of migraine sufferers. After systemic administration GTN is transformed
      to nitric oxide (NO). Treatment of spontaneous migraine attacks with an inhibitor of NO is
      effective in 60% of patients. These data show that NO is involved in both initiation and
      maintenance of migraine attack.

      The importance of migraine genes is disputed. Evidence from FHM patients with known mutations
      indicates that migraine pathways in FHM may be different from normal migraine. The aim of the
      present study is to examine whether this difference also exists in FHM patients without known
      mutations. The project will improve our understanding of the neurobiology of migraine and
      stimulate development of new treatment targets.
