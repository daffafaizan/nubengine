      arthroscopic surgery are decreased blood loss due to minimal incision for scope, a reduced
      operation time, minimization of surgical stress, and rapid recovery time after surgery.
      During shoulder arthroscopic surgery, extravasation of irrigation fluid can occur around the
      shoulder and trachea, compressing the upper airway. Although the extravasation is generally
      reabsorbed asymptomatically within 12 hours, there are cases that lead to reintubation or
      life-threatening complications. Furthermore, the soft tissue edema around the shoulder may
      extend to the thoracic cage, compress the chest and induce the respiratory distress
      immediately after surgery. From these facts, the mechanism of respiratory discomfort after
      shoulder arthroscopic surgery may be because the upper airway obstruction or restrictive
      pathology due to direct compression of thoracic cage by the soft tissue edema. There have
      been no studies on the respiratory effect of shoulder arthroscopic surgery. We have observed
      frequent and severe respiratory discomfort after the shoulder arthroscopic surgery.
      Therefore, in this study we attempt to determine the effect of shoulder arthroscopic surgery
      on respiratory mechanics. Changes in respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases were
      measured and compared before and after the shoulder arthroscopic surgery.
