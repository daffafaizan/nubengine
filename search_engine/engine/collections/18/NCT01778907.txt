      centers participate in the Netherlands. Deviating genotypes are expected to be found in ~30%
      of the population, therefore the study consist out of two parts. First a basic study in which
      ~750 patients, starting with nortriptyline or venlafaxine will be genotyped to identify
      patients with deviating genotypes (Poor, Intermediate or Ultrarapid Metabolizers). Second in
      the main study 150 patients with a deviating genotype are randomly allocated to two study
      arms one with and one without information on the genotype. From the extensive
      metabolizers('normal'genotype) 75 patients are allocated to a third arm as an external
      control.
