    
      Patients will be recruited during the exploration visit (v0) or the confirmation/typing visit
      (v1) according to their follow-up.

        -  Exploration visit (v0): inclusion of patients without prior platelet exploration, and
           study of their dense platelet granules.

        -  Confirmation/typing visit (v1): verification of the persistence of anomalies detected in
           patients with an abnormality identified during v0 (no later than 6 months after v0) and
           in patients for whom a dense granules anomaly has already been identified during their
           standard management prior to the start of the study. Completion of complementary
           examinations to complement the typing of the granular anomaly and molecular analysis for
           family cases
