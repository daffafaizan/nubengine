      individuals with bipolar disorder. However, weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance remain
      significant concerns associated with olanzapine. Exenatide is an anti-diabetic medication
      that is associated with weight loss and improved glucose regulation. Therefore, the overall
      goal of the proposed study is to conduct a 16-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of
      exenatide for the treatment of weight gain associated with olanzapine in 60 obese adults with
      bipolar disorder treated with olanzapine. We propose to conduct the study over the course of
      24 months, with an expected enrollment of approximately 3 patients per month. The primary
      outcome measure will be change from baseline to endpoint in weight. The secondary outcome
      measures will include changes from baseline to endpoint, in body mass index (BMI), abdominal
      circumference, metabolic parameters, clinical global improvement of psychiatric symptoms, and
      change in manic, depressive and psychotic symptoms. Rates of adverse events also will be
      assessed.
