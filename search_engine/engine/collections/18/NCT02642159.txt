      treatment period, a screening period of up to 3 weeks, and an 8 week safety observation
      period.

      For the purpose of scientific communication, a first-step analysis (both efficacy and safety)
      was performed at the Week 24 cut-off date. A second-step analysis was performed once all
      participants had completed the study to include a final update of the safety analysis.
