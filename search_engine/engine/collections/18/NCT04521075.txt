    
      This study is a Phase I single-center adaptive design study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of FMT in combination with Nivolumab for adult subjects with treatment-refractory or
      inoperable melanoma or NSCLC. FMT will be conducted with fecal capsules, originating from
      metastatic melanoma patients that have achieved a durable complete response with immune
      checkpoint inhibitors. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      FMT with Nivolumab, a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-1
      (anti PD-1) treatment and explore different biomarkers.
