      following induction treatment. Oral ganciclovir is a likely candidate for maintenance because
      of its possible therapeutic value and ease of administration, but an optimum dose has not
      been determined. Since oral ganciclovir has a low bioavailability and is more soluble in an
      acid pH environment, the addition of glutamic acid hydrochloride may enhance gastrointestinal
      absorption of this drug.

      All patients receive an induction regimen of IV ganciclovir administered twice daily for 21
      to 42 (Per Amendment 3/4/95) days. A permanent venous catheter is implanted for the induction
      therapy. If clinically improved following induction, patients are then randomized to receive
      one of three doses of oral ganciclovir, given first without and then with oral glutamic acid
      hydrochloride, every 8 hours until they reach a steady state. PER AMENDMENT 3/14/95: After
      subjects have reached steady state with oral ganciclovir and glutamic acid hydrochloride then
      PK samples will be taken. Subjects will continue the dosing regimen they were assigned to
      (glutamic acid hydrochloride will be added if it resulted in at least 33% increased
      bioavailability) for up to 12 months or until relapse of CMV GI disease is documented.
      Subjects will be followed at monthly intervals for safety evaluation and for evidence of CMV
      GI relapse. Subjects who have clinical symptoms of relapse will undergo repeat endoscopy or
      colonoscopy to document the relapse.
