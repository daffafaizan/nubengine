      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when used in combination
      with mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC) in patients with relapsed or
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of this combination in this patient
      population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the combination of lenalidomide priming prior to re-induction
      chemotherapy with MEC has clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      LENALIDOMIDE PRIMING: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) for 5 or 7 days.

      RE-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive etoposide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour,
      cytarabine IV over 3 hours, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5.
      Patients failing to achieve blast count < 5% at 21 days may receive a second course of
      induction therapy. Patients achieving complete remission proceed to lenalidomide priming.

      LENALIDOMIDE PRIMING: Within 4-6 weeks, patients receive lenalidomide PO for 5 or 7 days and
      then proceed to consolidation therapy.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour, cytarabine IV over 3
      hours, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-4. Treatment repeats
      every 28-35 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
