      of an innovative family-based economic empowerment intervention for AIDS-orphaned children.
      This will be accomplished via a three-group cluster randomized control trial (RCT). The three
      groups are: Bridges, Bridges PLUS, and usual care for AIDS-orphaned children. There will be
      five assessment points: baseline (pretest), 12, 24, 36, and 48-months post-intervention
      initiation.

      The intervention, "Bridges to the Future" (Bridges) will be guided by asset-theory and both
      Bridges and Bridges PLUS will include the following intervention components tested in the two
      earlier pilot studies, SEED-Uganda and SUUBI-Uganda: 1) workshops focused on asset building,
      future planning, and protection from risks; 2) mentors to reinforce learning and build
      optimism; 3) a Child Development Account (CDA) that can be used for secondary education by
      the AIDS-orphaned child; and 4) a family income generating/micro-enterprise promotion
      component for children enrolled in Bridges and Bridges PLUS, and their families.
