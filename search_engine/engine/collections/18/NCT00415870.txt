      on diet behaviors (e.g., food intake, weight). Interventions aimed at dietary change are
      missing a comparable, portable tool. Mobile technologies can help fill this gap by providing
      portable connectivity to expert systems that create specific tailored diet goals based on
      participant profiles. The expert system can 'push' intervention messages throughout the day
      during critical point-of-decision moments to aid in decision making among users. The portable
      device can 'pull' information through prompts and easy-to-use recording. This ecological
      momentary assessment + ecological momentary intervention format may further encourage healthy
      behaviors by prompting at critical decision points to improve dietary behaviors.
