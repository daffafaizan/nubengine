      Cognitive impairments feature frontal cognitive dysfunction. Many experts believe that
      executive functions are better predictors of functional level than psychiatric diagnoses.

      Frontal cognitive impairment and changes in neuroimaging are seen in individuals depleted of
      tryptophan, a serotonin precursor. These cognitive changes do not improve following
      serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor treatment and at least one study has found that
      executive dysfunction predicts non-response to fluoxetine. In many patients, remission of
      mood symptoms in depression requires medications to target non-serotonergic neurotransmitter
      systems. Brain areas mediating executive functions receive rich noradrenergic inputs, and
      norepinephrine is known to be intimately involved in many of the executive functions.

      A better understanding of serotonergic and catecholaminergic interactions would enable
      evidence-based treatment of depression which maximizes executive cognitive functions. This
      study examines the hypothesis that individuals treated with Wellbutrin will have higher
      scores on tests of executive functions and lower scores on depression indices.
