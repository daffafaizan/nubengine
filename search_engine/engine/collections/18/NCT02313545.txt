    
      This will be a Phase IB study comprised of three study groups:

        -  Group 1: Women who are naturally or surgically menopausal and symptomatic for AV, but
           who decline treatment with topical or systemic estrogen.

        -  Group 2: Women rendered menopausal as a result of pharmacologic treatment (including,
           but not limited to, aromatase inhibitor treatment, selective estrogen receptor modifiers
           (SERMs), and GnRH analog treatment), who decline treatment with topical or systemic
           estrogen.

        -  Group 3: Pre-menopausal women diagnosed with DIV.

      The study will evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of IZN-6NVS vaginal cream, in the
      treatment of atrophic vaginitis (AV) and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (DIV).

      20 eligible women of groups 1 and 2 and up to 10 eligible women of group 3 will be assigned
      to receive 2.5 g of cream/day for the first 14 days, followed by 3 applications per week for
      the next 4 weeks. Clinical assessment of the severity of vaginitis will be performed at
      baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment, which will be the end of the study. Patient
      reported symptom severity will be assessed by questionnaire at baseline and after 2 and 6
      weeks of treatment, and at follow-up.
