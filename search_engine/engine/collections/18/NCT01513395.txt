      Fetal Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. We will offer enrollment to any
      pregnant woman at gestational weeks 14+0/7 through 31+6/7 presenting for obstetric ultrasound
      where cervical assessment and/or placental location determination is indicated. Patient
      positioning and image acquisition will follow a standard protocol and will be performed by
      the co-investigators. Outcome ascertainment will be performed by two co-investigators blinded
      to participant allocation upon completion of data collection. Demographic and obstetrical
      outcome data will be collected via review of the medical record. Analysis of primary and
      secondary outcomes will yield incidence data, and comparisons will be made between groups.
