        1. To determine the increase in Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immune
           response from pre-zoster vaccination to 3 weeks post-vaccination in nursing home
           residents after 4 months of high dose vs. standard dose vitamin D3 supplementation.

        2. In the same participants as Aim 1, to measure the association between pre-zoster
           vaccination 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the increase in VZV-specific
           cell-mediated immune response from pre- vaccination to 3 weeks post-vaccination.

        3. Characterize the phenotypic and functional VZV-specific T cell responses to Zostavax,
           including memory, effector, Th1/Th2, and homing receptor-bearing T cells in the high
           compared to low ELISPOT responders.

      Hypotheses

        1. At baseline, higher serum 25(OH)D levels will be associated with higher levels of
           VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity (cross-sectional).

        2. At baseline, higher serum 25(OH)D levels, independent of vitamin D supplementation dose,
           will be associated with greater increases in VZV-specific cell-mediated immune responses
           to Zostavax, as measured by the interferon (IFN)-Î³ ELISPOT assay.

        3. Compared to standard dose, high dose vitamin D3 supplementation will enhance
           VZV-specific cell-mediated immune response to vaccination independent of baseline serum
           25(OH)D levels.
