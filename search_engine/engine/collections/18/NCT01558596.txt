    
      The proposed investigation has a single blind, randomized design and plans to enroll 180-205
      patients who are scheduled to have major, elective vascular surgery for occlusive carotid
      disease, expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), occlusive lower extremity disease and/or
      critical limb ischemia at the Minneapolis VA Health Care Center. 24 hours prior to the
      patient's scheduled vascular operation, RIPC therapy will be applied to one of the
      participant's upper arms to cause forearm ischemia. Clinically collected, pre-operative
      troponins, creatine kinase MBs (CK-MBs), EKGs along with troponins, CK-MBs and EKGs collected
      on day 1, 2, 3 and day 7 (if still hospitalized) will be utilized to evaluate the occurrence
      of perioperative, adverse cardiac events.
