      participatory health trials online (any randomized trial that uses the internet for a health
      or wellness intervention). Tools to develop methods to run quality online trials protocols
      are needed. Also, help for adapting guidance to include the public and patients as partners
      in research for online trials is limited. The purpose of this work is to facilitate improved
      practice within protocol writing for participatory online trials.

      Public and patient involvement (PPI), is one method used to conduct participatory research.
      PPI actively engages communities or individuals and moves beyond educating, engaging or doing
      interviews with research participants and does the research with them as partners. There is
      growing consensus that PPI is of value to researchers, industry, regulators, and members of
      the public.

      There is an active discussion that is without substantial evidence for when the optimal time
      in the research process is to start PPI and whether patients and the public should join the
      research team, act as advisors, or have everyone contribute perspectives and work with their
      roles or peer groups.

      The embedded study within the Delphi explores how working with stakeholder feedback in
      different ways may influence decision ranking as well choice similarities and differences
