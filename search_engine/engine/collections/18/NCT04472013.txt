      in pathogenesis and brain stem dysfunction in critically ill patients. A microglia-focused,
      brain-specific 50+ marker CODEX panel is used to assess the neuroinflammatory
      microenvironment in specific brain regions of deceased COVID-19 patients. The peripheral
      (cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood) cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 is investigated in
      regard to CNS affection and consecutive blood brain barrier disruption leading to
      braininherent neuroinflammatory reactions. Primary endpoints of this project are the
      multidimensional integration of the analysis from the procedures described above and
      assessment of the correlation between the gained clinical data (MRI, mental/neurological
      state), the body fluid proteomic and mass-cytometric analysis (CSF and Plasma proteomics,
      peripheral blood mass cytometry) and the CODEX analysis of defined brain regions on autopsy
      specimens.

      Non-critically ill COVID-19 patients and critically ill COVID-19 patients needing mechanical
      ventilation at the ICU are included. Autopsy specimens from medulla oblongata, cortex,
      cerebellum and olfactory bulb are investigated, including only tissue samples, which have
      been submitted to the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel.
