    
      Rationale: Currently, hyaluronic acid (HA) soft tissue fillers are widely employed in
      cosmetic medical practice for facial contouring and rejuvenation. Among these procedures,
      especially the lip augmentation has become common. To this end various products have become
      commercially available, however to date no robust evidence is available to support the
      safety, longevity or patient satisfaction propensity superiority of one product over the
      others.

      Objective: To assess whether superiority in safety, longevity and patient satisfaction
      propensity can be shown of one of four most frequently used FDA-approved and/or CE marked HA
      fillers worldwide, used to augment the lip, over the others.

      Study design: Multi-center, randomized, controlled, four group, parallel, triple-blind
      clinical trial of 160 adult participants.

      Study population: Consecutive healthy individuals with no history of previous lip treatment
      and a self-reported wish for lip augmentation, who present at one of the private cosmetic
      medicine clinics in the Netherlands, will be recruited.

      Intervention (if applicable): After giving informed consent, participants will be randomized
      to receive a protocoled lip augmentation procedure by the injection of either 1 mL of brand
      A, B, C or D.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure will be the absolute lip volume
      augmentation as measured by the Lemperle Lip Index from baseline to 3-months follow-up.
      Secondary outcomes will include the incidence of serious adverse reactions and side effects
      related to the procedure, the absolute volume augmentation from baseline to 2-weeks follow-up
      and self-reported quality of life and satisfaction with aesthetic results from baseline to
      2-weeks follow-up as measured by validated FACE-Q questionnaire scores.
