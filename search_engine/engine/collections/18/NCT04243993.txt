      University, Thailand. Each treatment was provided following the standard protocol. The
      calcium silicate based material (Bio-MA or ProRoot MTA) was randomly selected and used in the
      treatment. The patients were periodically recalled at 6 to 12 months. The outcome of the
      three treatments based on the clinical and radiographic criteria was assessed by the
      calibrated examiners and interpreted as ''healed/healing" or ''disease.''
