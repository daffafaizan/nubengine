    
      This is a single-center single-arm translational study where patients with prostate cancer
      who are about to receive definitive treatments will be invited to participate the study.
      After signing the approved informed consent, eligible and consenting subjects will donate
      their fresh urine samples for subsequent untargeted metabolomics and proteomics study to
      identify potential metabolite and protein markers that are able to predict responses
      (including efficacy and side effects) to definitive treatments. All subjects who have
      received varied treatment before the study can NOT be recruited.
