    
      To accomplish these aims, an online survey-based experiment using a population-based sample
      of U.S. adults (anticipated N=1,800) will be conducted. At 2 time points across a 28-day
      period, participants will be exposed to news stories and social media posts about 6 health
      topics: mammography screening, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, Vitamin D
      supplementation, carbohydrate consumption, alcohol consumption, and breastfeeding.
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups that differ only in the amount of
      conflict presented in these news and social media posts (conflict, no conflict). At a third
      time point, after the exposure to conflict period, all participants will be exposed to 3 (out
      of a possible 9) messages from existing health campaigns about 3 behaviors for which there is
      scientific consensus: fruit and vegetable consumption, colorectal cancer screening, and
      physical activity. To assess carryover effects (Primary Aim), participants' receptivity to
      these messages-as measured through several affective and cognitive responses (e.g.,
      confidence in the evidence presented)-will be measured. Message receptivity is expected to be
      lower among those who were randomized to receive conflicting health information.
      Individual-level differences in message receptivity are possible; thus exploratory analyses
      (Secondary Aim) will be conducted to assess whether carryover effects of exposure to conflict
      may be more pronounced among certain groups (e.g., those with greater trust in media sources,
      those of lower socioeconomic position).
