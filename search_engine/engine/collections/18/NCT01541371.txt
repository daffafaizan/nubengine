      following participants forward in time), non-randomized (the study drug is not assigned by
      chance, participants may choose which group they want to be in, or they may be assigned to
      the groups by the researchers), single-arm (getting one dose of medicine) and multi-center
      (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study
      designed to determine the efficacy, tolerability and safety of flexible dosage of
      paliperidone ER tablets in treatment of participants with schizophrenia not satisfied with
      other prior antipsychotics. The duration of the study will be 12 weeks. All participants will
      be given paliperidone ER 3 milligram (mg) or 6 mg or 9 mg or 12 mg oral (by mouth) tablets
      depending on Investigator's discretion once daily for 12 weeks; initial dose for paliperidone
      ER will be 6 mg/day. The primary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with
      paliperidone ER using Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) total scores. Participants
      safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study.
