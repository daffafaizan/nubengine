      increase in local circulation due to vasodilatation, the induction of the proliferation of
      glandular cells and cell respiration/ATP (adenosine triphosphate) synthesis as well as the
      release of growth factors and cytokines to stimulate protein exocytosis. With regard to an
      increase in salivary IgA, low-level laser intensifies the activation of B lymphocytes, which
      differentiate into plasma cells, thereby contributing to the increase in immunoglobulin
      levels.

      The study of salivary aspects in malnourished children and possible treatments that can be
      used to improve salivary quality and quantity in these children has significant social
      relevance, as saliva is one of the main mechanisms against infection and participates in
      essential functions of life, such as swallowing and the maintenance of oral health.

      An experimental cross-sectional study is proposed, which will be conducted at the Center for
      Educational and Nutrition Recovery in the city of Macei√≥, state of Alagoas, Brazil, and
      University Nove de Julho (UNINOVE) in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This project has been
      approved by CESMAC ethics committee (CAAE 71961317.1.0000.0039).
