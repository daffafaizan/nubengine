      incontinence. The location of the stimulating electrode is considered to be essential for
      treatment success. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the position of SNM electrodes
      after using the conventional implantation technique and to compare our results with those of
      the preliminary study, where the standardised fluoroscopy-guided implantation technique was
      used.

      However, to date no studies exist comparing different surgical techniques. The present
      cadaver study was designed to assess the distance between lead and sacral nerves by comparing
      two different surgical techniques: the new fluoroscopy guided "H" technique and the commonly
      conducted non radiological lead implantation using anatomical landmarks.

      In this cadaver study, SNM electrodes will be implanted bilaterally in 5 lower body
      specimens.Afterwards the cadaver will be dissected and the exact location to the nerve, as
      well as a perforation of the sacral fascia will be noted.

      The results will be compared to the preliminary study of Mueller et al., where they used the
      new fluoroscopy guided "H" technique in five cadavers.
