      patients with prostate cancer, in the phase of resistance to castration, with symptomatic
      bone metastases. Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in men
      internationally, and more than 90% of patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer will
      have bone metastases.

      They frequently give rise to "bone events" that include spinal cord compressions and
      pathological fractures requiring surgery or external radiotherapy.

      Bone metastases are an important cause of death, disability, quality of life degradation and
      increase the cost of treatment.

      There is therefore a need for bone-targeting therapeutic agents that provide a benefit in
      terms of survival.

      Xofigo is indicated in patients with bone metastases symptomatic of hormone-resistant
      prostate cancer and without known visceral metastases.

      This treatment appears to have fewer side effects than chemotherapy (and does not call into
      question subsequent chemotherapy) or that the currently available metabolic bone radiotherapy
      as well as better pain control and survival gain than the latter do not
