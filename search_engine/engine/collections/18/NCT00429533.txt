      needed. The steroid dose was the lowest dose at which the patient's disease was controlled
      before the last flare (see eligibility criteria). The patients were randomized to receive
      either Dapsone or placebo. Treatment was to be started at a dose of 50 mg and increased by 25
      mg increments each week once the hemoglobin was shown not to have dropped by more than 2
      gm/dl. The target dose was 150 mg and patients who did not respond could be advanced to 200
      mg daily. After beginning treatment, a standardized steroid taper was commenced. A
      standardized steroid taper was suggested with tapering by 10 mg/wk for doses above 40 mg/day
      or more slowly if warranted. A slower taper thereafter or an every other day dosing schedule
      would be elected according to the individual investigator's preference. Flares were treated
      by increasing the dose of steroids - in the case of a mild flare to the last dose preceding
      the flare, in the case of a moderate flare by 20 mg/day and in the case of a severe flare by
      40 mg/day. Tapering was to be resumed once the disease had stabilized. Disease activity was
      assessed by a simple scoring system for skin, mucosa, and sites involved. Laboratory
      assessments initially weekly became monthly once the study medication dosage was stabilized.
