      myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) and 4.5% in patients with STEMI treated with percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI).

      Diagnosis of AF in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is important because it
      increases the risk of cardiovascular event and associated with increased in-hospital and long
      term rates . Atrial ischemia/infarction translates into P Q segment depression or elevation
      on the electrocardiogram and often associates with atrial tachyarrhythmias .

      Side-branch obstruction is one of the adverse effects of PCI the location of the culprit
      vessel also affects the occurrence of AF in AMI Atrial arteries arise from the right coronary
      artery (RCA) and circumflex coronary artery (CX) and extend through the atrial myocardium to
      supply both chambers It is therefore conceivable that PCI of lesions located at the RCA and
      CX could lead to an accidental atrial branch occlusion .

      Atrial myocardial ischemia secondary to atrial branches occlusion (ABO) might lead to
      mechanical atrial dysfunction, increased electrical vulnerability to atrial arrhythmias, and
      late structural remodeling .

      The sino nodal (SN) artery originates from the proximal portion of the RCA in about 60% of
      humans Side branch occlusion of the SN artery occurring accidentally during PCI for proximal
      RCA lesions would provide an opportunity to produces SN dysfunction in humans. Uptill now ,
      there have been no systematic studies concerning SN dysfunction caused by side-branch
      occlusion of the SN artery during PCI .

      Left atrial volume seems to be a strong predictor of incident of AF , with increase in left
      atrial filling pressures, atrial stretch and enlargement of the chamber occur, leading to
      remodeling of the structure, physiologic properties, and electrical milieu of the left
      atrium, culminating in the development of AF
