    
      Thirty two patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (including both stable angina
      and acute coronary syndrome), who have at least one severe obstructive lesion (>70% diameter
      stenosis) that is considered suitable for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), will be
      included in the study.

      Structural/biochemical characteristics of coronary culprit plaque (with or without mild to
      moderate stenotic non-culprit plaque) will be assessed comprehensively using OCT-FLIM dual
      modal intravascular imaging.

      After coronary revascularization with PCI, subjects will undergo serial 18F-FDG-PET/CT
      molecular imaging at baseline admission and 6-month follow-up to measure PET signal
      activities at target tissues including amygdala, carotid artery, aorta, bone marrow, and
      spleen.

      Correlation between OCT-FLIM parameters and baseline PET signals will be assessed to provide
      insight into the mechanistic linkage between multi-system metabolic activities and coronary
      plaque instability. Serial PET/CT imaging after 6 month will enable estimation of natural
      course of multi-system PET signal activities according to different levels of coronary plaque
      instability.
