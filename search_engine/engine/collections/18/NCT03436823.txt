      depressive illness. This non-invasive technique is designed to stimulate certain areas of the
      cerebral cortex involved in this pathology. The Food & Drug Administration - FDA - approved
      this treatment in routine for depressive illness. R.TMS still remains in assessment. Due to
      the heterogeneity of methods and the weakness of the cohorts therapeutic superiority can not
      concluded . Stimulation parameters remain numerous even if a consensus is beginning to
      emerge. The therapeutic target is the left dorso - lateral prefrontal cortex. The lack of
      efficacy is probably due of the inaccuracy. The empirically location of the target does not
      take into account the inter-individual anatomical differences. The neuronavigation is
      becoming widespread in routine clinical practice.

      The referent nurse stays with the patient all along the rTMS sessions. His role is to set up
      treatment, to ensure the safety and the well-being of the patient. An rTMS session is an
      average of 30 minutes and is a very special moment to create a specific therapeutic
      relationship. To our knowledge, no study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic
      relationship. The assumption is made that rTMS with a semi - structured interview provides a
      qualitative and quantitative clinical response greater than a semi - structured rTMS without
      this nursing care. The investigators, therefore propose to patients not receiving a
      semi-structured interview to listen to music with eyes closed.
