    
      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To evaluate how successfully SHARE-S can be implemented into clinical care as characterized
      by rates of enrollment. Investigators hypothesize >30% of patients e-referred to SHARE-S will
      enroll.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess additional implementation outcomes that evaluate preliminary implementation
           success (i.e., further assessment of adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, further
           assessment of feasibility, and fidelity).

        -  To describe service outcome variability to inform future studies. Investigators will
           assess service outcomes relevant to Commission on Cancer requirements by reporting
           annual estimates for: (1) the estimated number of patients impacted by SHARE-S; (2) the
           cancer sites impacted by SHARE-S; and the (3) resources/processes utilized to enhance
           each of the chosen services if barriers were encountered. We will also assess safety and
           perceived patient-centeredness of care.

        -  To describe patient health outcome variability to inform future studies (i.e., social
           role, physical functioning, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain,
           cancer-specific quality of life, health behaviors, patient autonomy, self-efficacy for
           managing cancer, engagement with the survivorship care plan document, and satisfaction
           with care).

        -  To evaluate the Implementation Program we will assess key milestones and processes for
           this pilot study of the Implementation Stage measured at the clinic level.

        -  To qualitatively assess implementation barriers and facilitators using semi-structured
           interviews that will be audio-recorded.

        -  To examine how study results vary by cancer type.
