      interferons have shown antiviral and antitumor effect on Kaposi's sarcoma. It is reasonable
      to assume that a synergism and an enhanced antitumor response may be seen with combination
      therapy. A study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZT in the combination with
      IFN-A2A is warranted.

      Patients are randomized to receive IFN-A or IFN-A2A by intramuscular injection and combined
      with AZT orally daily for 8 weeks. Two cohorts of 4 patients enter each dose level. Patients
      do not enter into the next dose level until all patients have completed 3 weeks of treatment.
      AZT escalates only if there is no unacceptable toxicity (grade 2 in = or > 3 patients or >
      grade 2 in any patients); subsequent increase in IFN-A or IFN-A2A will be permitted, but the
      AZT dose will remain fixed. The MTD for a given IFN-A or IFN-A2A dose level is defined as
      grade 3 toxicity for hemoglobin or grade 2 toxicity for other parameters in 3 of the 6
      patients. Once the MTD is reached, there will be no further enrollment at higher dose level.
      Patients are followed every week for vital signs and hematologic studies. Patients tolerating
      the combination may be continued on therapy for 1 year at the same dose as the end of 8th
      week.
