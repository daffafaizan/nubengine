      but permanently above 60%. A study conducted in 2015 in Tours Adult Emergencies showed a
      prevalence of pain of 66.5% with an average waiting time of 2h28 before receiving an
      analgesic.

      The pain management protocol at the Tours emergency department includes paracetamol for a
      numerical evaluation scale (EN) < 3 and tramadol for an EN between 4 and 6. But these
      therapies have a delay of action too long or are given too late. An improvement in the
      management of pain in emergency is therefore necessary.

      Methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) is a volatile fluoridated analgesic; it offers several benefits:
      fast over a long period, well tolerated, effective and without interference with other drugs.
      Despite a misuse in the 70s, it has been used for more than 20 years in Australia and New
      Zealand. It was granted marketing authorization in 2016 and has been marketed in France since
      2017.

      It should be noted that this analgesic treatment is already adopted in several hospitals in
      the region and also in the SAMU 37.

      A similar study was conducted in Grenoble but on a different population. The investigators
      plan to highlight the interest of Penthrox® in the management of monotraumatic pains in the
      Adult Emergencies of Tours with the intention of modifying the antalgic protocol accordingly
      to the reception of emergencies.
