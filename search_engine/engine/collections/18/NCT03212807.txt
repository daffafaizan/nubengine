      Lenalidomide for treatment of relapsed/refractory EBV associated DLBCL subtypes, primary
      testicular lymphoma and primary CNS lymphoma using a Simon's Two-stage Minimax design.
      Simon's two-stage Minimax design will be used to investigate if the overall response rate
      (ORR) is at least 45% against a no-interest ORR of 20%.

      In the first stage, 13 patients will be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer responses in these
      13 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 8 additional patients will be accrued for
      a total of 21 patients.This design yields a type I error rate of 5% and power of 80% when the
      true response rate is 45%.
