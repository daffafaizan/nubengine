      erlotinib. The purpose of the research is to determine the effects erlotinib has on the
      breast cancer tumors in women with metastatic hormone receptor negative and HER2-negative
      breast cancer. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has approved erlotinib, also known as
      Tarceva, for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      To qualify for the trial, subjects must have histologically confirmed, incurable, locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is ER-negative, PR-negative, Her2/neu-negative and
      EGFR-positive. Subjects must have measurable disease. They must have received less than or
      equal to 1 chemotherapeutic agent in the metastatic setting. The target accrual is 43
      subjects. Initially, 18 subjects will be accrued. If at least 3 subjects are progression-free
      at 4 months, accrual will continue to a maximum of 43 subjects. Subject eligibility will be
      evaluated during a screening period of 4 weeks. During the treatment period, subjects will
      receive single agent erlotinib, 150mg/day. Subjects will receive the first dose of erlotinib
      on Day 0, within 7 days of registration. Efficacy will be assessed by radiographic tumor
      assessment or photographic documentation. Safety will be assessed by the recording of adverse
      events and laboratory test results. Subjects with documented progressive disease will be
      discontinued from treatment and will be followed for survival information every 2 months
      until death, lost to follow-up or study termination.
