      (RC) is the pathological TNM staging (ypTNM) after chemo-radiotherapy (Ch-RT).Tumor
      regression grading (TRG) after Ch-RT has been correlated with DFS , 86% for TRG 4, 75% for
      grouped TRG 2 + 3, and 63% for grouped TRG 0 + 1 but this is not as good as ypTNM to predict
      pts outcome.

      Standard 5-FU or capecitabine Ch-RT achieves 15% of ypCR with diarrhea and proctitis as the
      main grade 3 toxicities in the range of 10-15% . With the combination of oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine pCR rates are the same but the toxicity is the range of 25%. IMRT studies
      reported 30% ypCR but with 30-40% grade 3 toxicities Last years strategies have explored ways
      to integrate additional chemotherapeutic agents as capecitabine , oxaliplatin, irinotecan,
      bevacizumab and cetuximab in Ch-RT regimens and to find biomarkers of their effectiveness ,
      but always in a retrospective way.

      Our hypothesis is that with the actual knowledge and technology, a prospective tailored
      chemotherapy selection in combination with IMRT is feasible and could improve the outcome of
      patients with rectal cancer.
