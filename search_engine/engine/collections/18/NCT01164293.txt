      demand for reliable evaluation of patients with suspected food-related gastrointestinal
      symptoms. Little is known about the diagnostic accuracy of atopy patch tests(APT) in the
      clinical practice. APT seems to have a better specificity than the IgE methods and seems to
      reflect late-phase clinical reactions.The aims of this study were to evaluate:

      (i) The prevalence of positive reaction of APTs for food allergy-related gastrointestinal
      diseases. (ii)Positive reaction of APT compare with skin prick test. (iii)Positive reaction
      of APT using lyophilized food vs commercially available food extracts. (iv)Side effect or
      adverse events of APT
