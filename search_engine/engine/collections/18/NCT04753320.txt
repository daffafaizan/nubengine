      and digital health technology to remotely monitor patients with possible or probable PSP.

      Secondary objectives are to measure PSP progression using sensor-derived motor and
      tablet-derived speech and cognitive measures.

      In brief, 40-50 individuals with possible or probable PSP will be enrolled at 4-5 sites in
      the U.S. and followed for one year. During the monitoring period (1 year), a wearable pendant
      sensor (PAMSys, BioSensics) will be used to monitor falls and physical activity (step counts)
      of all participants during activities of daily living (ADL). On a monthly basis, participants
      will have televideo conferences with the sites to perform supervised gait and balance tasks
      while wearing 3 LEGSys (BioSensics) sensors. Using a study-supplied tablet, participants will
      also perform cognitive tests including fluency, color trails and go-no-go tapping tests.
      Participants will undergo more extensive testing every 3 months including the PSPRS, MoCA,
      quality of life questionnaires and functional rating scales which will be performed remotely
      (virtually). Approximately 6 months participants will undergo an in-person PSPRS (to coincide
      with their clinic appointments).
