      dose of the study medication.

      Pharmacokinetic Population The pharmacokinetic population will include all subjects
      completing at least 2 periods and for whom the pharmacokinetic profile can be adequately
      characterised.

      Any subject with pre-dose concentrations for mesalamine will be excluded from the
      pharmacokinetic population for this analyte if the pre-dose concentration is greater than 5%
      of the Cmax value of that period for this subject.

      Data from subjects who experienced emesis during the sampling interval and who were not
      withdrawn as per criterion established under section 9.10 may be evaluated after completion
      of the pharmacokinetic analysis. Any subject who experienced emesis within 2 times median
      Tmax of the current study (based on the Reference product) will be excluded from the
      statistical analysis. Data (concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters) from subjects
      excluded due to a pre dose concentration greater than 5% of their Cmax or from subjects
      withdrawn due to adverse events or vomiting episodes will be presented but excluded from
      descriptive statistics.
