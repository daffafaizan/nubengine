      histological features. In addition, the yield of microbiological/histological test (AFB
      stain, caseating granuloma) is not high in clinical setting. Therefore, distinguishing CD
      from ITB especially in highly endemic areas for TB is challenging. The aim of this study is
      to develop and to validate a scoring system and a prediction model for differential diagnosis
      between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease
