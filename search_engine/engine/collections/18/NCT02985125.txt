      at 8 weeks (PFS8week) of the combination of LEE-011 plus everolimus, in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer refractory to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and gemcitabine-based
      chemotherapy. Previous studies of third-line therapy in mPAC are limited but reveal stable
      disease in 25-31% of patients with no partial or complete responses (31% of patients in the
      GVAX/CRS-207 combination vaccine study had stable disease but only 52% of these patients were
      treated in the third-line setting). It is hoped that the combination of LEE-011 plus
      everolimus can increase the PFS8weeks to at least 50%, though early stopping rules are in
      place for lack of efficacy.
