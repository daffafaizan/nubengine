      assigned to the BMBI group will complete a number of cognitive assessments and questionnaires
      at Time 1. They will then receive a 45 minute mindfulness intervention. Following this, they
      will be asked to practice mindfulness for 30 minutes per day for 7 days a week in their own
      homes. After 7 days, participants in the BMBI group will be invited to complete a paired set
      of cognitive assessments and questionnaires (Time 2). Participants in the WLC group will
      complete the same number of cognitive assessments and questionnaires as the BMBI group at
      Time 1. However, they will not receive the 45 minute mindfulness intervention nor will they
      be asked to practice it at home for 7 days. After 7 days, participants in the WLC group will
      be invited to complete a paired set of cognitive assessments and questionnaires (Time 2).
      After completion of the measures at Time 2, the WLC participants will then receive the 45
      minute mindfulness intervention. All assessments, questionnaires and the intervention will be
      carried out either in a SLaM memory clinic or at participants own homes depending on level of
      mobility.
