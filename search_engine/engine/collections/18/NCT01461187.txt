      Aleitamento Materno - CIAMA) in S찾o Sebasti찾o, S찾o Paulo, Brazil. The 66 primigravidas were
      allocated to two groups: a control group, with 29 pregnant women who had not performed any
      kind of physical activity during pregnancy, and another group, the exercise group, with 37
      pregnant women who performed supervised aerobic physical exercises twice a week. These
      volunteers needed to attend at least 20 sessions to be included in the research. No pregnant
      women in the control group or the exercise group had performed regular physical activity in
      the year prior to the pregnancy. All participants received verbal information on how the
      research would be conducted, and after agreeing to participate they signed a free and
      informed consent term. The physical activity was prescribed by a physical therapist who
      remained available to address any doubts about the physical activity and about the research.
      The study followed the baselines of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      (ACOG), where the environment temperature hasn't exceeded 28 째C. The pregnant women were told
      to wear comfortable clothes and to drink water before and during the activity, and not to
      perform physical activity while fasting. They were also instructed to interrupt the activity
      in case they felt dizziness, breathlessness, pain, muscle weakness, dyspnea prior to effort
      or in case they presented calf swelling or pain, bleeding or signs of labor, or, still, if
      they noticed decrease in fetal movements. Two weeks after birth the volunteers were contacted
      by phone to collect information on the type of birth.
