      of 50 % of total blood volume during the first 2 postnatal weeks and a transfused volume of
      100 % of total blood volume with donor blood during the corresponding time period. The
      resulting decrease in the proportion of fetal hemoglobin is strongly associated with
      morbidity outcome, especially broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD), in the EPT infant.

      This randomized trial evaluates if a reduction in sample-related blood volume loss by 50%
      during the first two postnatal weeks leads to a reduced rate of BPD in EPT infants. Half of
      the included infants will be subjected to clinical blood sampling using micromethods during
      the first two postnatal weeks whereas blood sampling in the other half of infants will be
      performed using standard clinical methods.
