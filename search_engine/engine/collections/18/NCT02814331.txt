    
      This study is designed to evaluate the contribution of multimodal high-resolution EEG-NIRS
      electrical and local haemodynamic analysis (HR-EEG, HR-NIRS) to spatial localization of
      epileptogenic foci in order to perform multimodal mapping and localization of interictal
      spikes (by HR-EEG source reconstruction) with the clinical prospects of guiding the SEEG
      electrode implantation strategy prior to surgery in children with drug-refractory partial
      epilepsy.
