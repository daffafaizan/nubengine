    
      This is a European, prospective, multicentre, double-blind randomised study evaluating
      lanreotide (120 mg every 28 days until disease progression) versus placebo in patients with
      metastatic/locally advanced, non-resectable, duodeno-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.

      Depending on the phase II results, the study may be continued into phase III. The treatment
      and follow-up of patients will be the same in phase II and phase III.

      After the first-line treatment, patients will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either lanreotide or placebo. The study treatment should be initiated within 6 weeks
      following the confirmation date of stable disease or objective response.

      Treatment period:

      For each patient, the investigational products (lanreotide or placebo) will be provided
      according to a double-blind procedure until disease progression or toxicity, in accordance
      with the protocol.

      The estimated average treatment duration for all patients is 12 months.

      Follow-up period:

      To evaluate overall survival, patients in phase II will have a minimum follow-up period of 12
      months; if the study continues to phase III, these patients will have a maximum follow-up
      period of 10 years. Phase III patients will have a minimum follow-up period of 5 years.
