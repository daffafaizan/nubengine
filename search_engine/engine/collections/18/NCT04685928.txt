      subjects randomized in 1:1 manner to either MRI-arm or TP-arm. In the MRI-arm,
      multiparametric MRI is performed for all subjects. If MRI is abnormal (PI-RADS score 3-5),
      3-4 core targeted followed by 12-core systematic transperineal biopsies under local
      anaesthesia will be performed. If MRI is normal, no biopsy is performed. A 12-core systematic
      biopsy is also included in MRI-targeted biopsy as it has been shown in the Trio study that
      adding systematic biopsy increased the detection of csPCa.

      In the TP-arm, no MRI will be performed, and all subjects will receive 24-core transperineal
      prostate biopsy under local anaesthesia. Patient will be followed up in clinic about 30 days
      after biopsy to review pathology result and complication.
