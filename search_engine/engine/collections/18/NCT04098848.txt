      risk factors alters the regulatory properties of the endothelium, which progresses toward a
      pro-inflammatory pattern, senescence, and apoptosis. Endothelial cell integrity and function
      are critical to the prevention of atherosclerosis, and therefore endothelial cell injury and
      dysfunction are major steps in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.
      Endothelial dysfunction may be the landmark of active disease process through the course of
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and a significant risk factor for future
      cardiovascular events.

      Several studies had reported that not only medical treatment but also exercise could improve
      physical and vascular functions, dialytic efficiency, quality of sleep, fatigue and
      depression et al. Exercise could be classified to aerobic, Anaerobic exercise and resistance
      et. Several studies have shown that regular cycling exercise in hemodialysis patients could
      improve physical activity, sleep quality, and reduce fatigability. Therefore, exercise plays
      an important role in hemodialysis patients. According to these benefits, the investigator's
      study was designed to explore the effects of intradialytic cycling exercise on sleep quality
      and fatigability, adipokines and myokinins levels in hemodialysis patients.
