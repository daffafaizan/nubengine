      have a posterior fossa decompression done with or without duraplasty. The participant will
      then return to the neurosurgeon's office at the following time points which are consistent
      with standard of care practice: < 6 weeks, 3-6 months, and 12 months. At these visits, the
      clinician will complete a physical exam and the participant will report on the prognosis of
      symptoms and complete two quality of life questionnaires. A brain and cervical spine MRI will
      be performed 12 months after the decompression.
