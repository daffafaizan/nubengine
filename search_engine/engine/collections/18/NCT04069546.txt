      ischemia-reperfusion of the arm or leg, may potentially confer systemic protection against
      prolonged ischemia in a distant organ. Numerous reports have confirmed its strongest
      endogenous neuroprotection against brain injury after stroke, of which the immune mechanisms
      are majorly involved in RIC. At the same time, the inflammation response plays a great role
      in stroke development, which may expand the infarct area. Stroke-induced immunodeficiency can
      potentiate stroke-associated pneumonia, which is an important cause of death after strokes.
      In this study, the investigators will assess the effect of RIC on stroke-induced
      immunodeficiency and inflammation response in AIS patients.
