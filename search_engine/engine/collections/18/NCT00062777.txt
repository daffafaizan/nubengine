      disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), peripheral vascular disease, as well as all-cause
      mortality. Twin studies have shown that HCT variation is largely determined by genetic
      factors with heritability estimated as 40% - 65%. So far, no linkage analysis in humans
      between HCT and DNA markers have been reported. The purpose of this protocol is to identify
      chromosome regions that contain quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in controlling HCT
      levels. In the Framingham Study, a 10cM genome scan (about 400 markers) has been conducted in
      330 families. HCT was measured in the original cohort and Framingham offspring. These data
      provide us the opportunity to undertake linkage analyses using variance component method to
      map quantitative trait loci (QTL) of HCT.
