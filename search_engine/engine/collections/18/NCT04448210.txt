      youth assent will be sought. Participants will be randomized into one of two study arms:
      intervention and wait-list control. All participants will complete a web-based pre-test
      questionnaire. Youth in the intervention group will then receive access to DigiKnowIt News:
      Teen for one week. Approximately one week after completing the pre-test questionnaire, all
      participants will complete a web-based post-test questionnaire (the post-test for youth in
      the intervention group will also include Consumer Satisfaction Questions). Youth in the
      wait-list control group will then receive access to DigiKnowIt News: Teen for one week. After
      one week, they will complete a Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire.
