      most commonly craniopharyngiomas. Hypothalamic dysfunction can be due to tumor infiltration
      and as a consequence of surgery or radiation therapy. Survivors who develop obesity have
      greater morbidity and mortality than normal weight survivors. Prevention and treatment of
      obesity in this population is vital in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality from
      diabetes, stroke and myocardial infarction.

      Exenatide (ByettaÂ®) is a GLP-1 homologue that was FDA approved for treatment of type 2
      diabetes in 2005. It also decreases the rate of gastric emptying and increases satiety and
      has been shown to cause weight loss in some people. Exenatide may improve insulin sensitivity
      and satiety in patients with hypothalamic obesity but without the risks of bariatric surgery.
      The investigators hypothesize that treatment with exenatide will lead to weight loss in
      patients with hypothalamic obesity.
