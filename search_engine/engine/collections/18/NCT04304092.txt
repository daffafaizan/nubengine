      Primary objective: Determine whether alterations in exercise amount and intensity improves
      the rate of clinically meaningful improvements in aerobic exercise capacity as measured by
      cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF, VO2peak) among adults.

      Secondary objective: Determine whether common cardiometabolic risk factors segregate with
      respect to variation in CRF to first line therapy in adults, and, whether clinically
      meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors segregate with associated improvement
      in CRF.

      Tertiary objective: Identify whether biological sex and/or phenotype are determinants of
      variation in CRF and cardiometabolic risk factors in response to first line therapy, and,
      whether they predict variability in CRF response to alterations in exercise dose.
