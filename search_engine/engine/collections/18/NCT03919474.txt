      our university hospital starting June 2016 and prospectively until december 31th 2018.

      Plasma sampling and biomarkers quantification : After a 48-hours diet excluding serotonin-
      and tryptophan-rich food, fasting blood samples were collected into vacuum tubes containing
      109 mM sodium citrate (Becton-Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France) with a 9:1
      blood-to-anticoagulant ratio. After removing 0.5 mL of whole blood for serotonin
      measurements, the remainder was centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant
      was then centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 15 minutes to isolate platelets and obtain
      platelet-poor plasma. Importantly, the time between blood sampling and platelet/plasma
      isolation was less than one hour. Aliquots of whole blood, platelets, and plasma were kept
      frozen (-20Â°C) until serotonin and homocysteine measurements performed within one week after
      congelation. Whole blood, platelet and plasma 5-HT as well as plasma homocysteine (Hcy)
      levels were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to fluorimetric
      detections .

      Thrombophilia screening included measurements of antithrombin , protein C, protein S, factor
      V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T,
      antiphospholipid antibodies anticardiolipin IgG and IgM and anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 IgG),
      dilute Russell viper venom time , Rosner index, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor (vWF)
      activity and antigen. Tests were performed on citrated plasma, serum or DNA as appropriate
      and as previously described
