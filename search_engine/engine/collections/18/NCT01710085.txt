      genital tract. Although, surgical resection is the treatment of choice for both, adjuvant or
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy and curative radiotherapy are alternative treatment
      options depending on the stage.

      Identification of recurrent disease in early phases carries a primary importance on the
      prognosis.

      Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), a new technique recently started to be performed in body
      imaging has potential ability to distinguish recurrent disease from normal tissue or
      fibrosis. Our aim in this study is to investigate the diagnostic impact of DWI in detection
      of recurrence rate in patients treated with curative surgery in endometrial and cervical
      cancer.

      All patients who had curative surgery due to endometrial or cervical cancer will be included
      to the study. Patients will be examined with DWI in addition to routine sequences including
      contrast enhanced dynamic studies. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy as well as positive
      and negative predictive values of the study will be investigated from the data derived from
      DWI studies and will be correlated with data obtained by conventional radiologic, nuclear
      imaging studies including PET-CT, as well as pathologic verifications during follow-up
      period.
