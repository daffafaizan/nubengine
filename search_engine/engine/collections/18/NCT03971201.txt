      Surgery + sorafenib vs. sorafenib 100 patients per arm Centralized randomization by CRO Need
      to call CRO for treatment allocation Primary end-point - OS Secondary end-point Progression
      free survival (PFS) Randomized 1:1 Stratification Vp1-2 vs. Vp3 AFP â‰¤400 vs AFP >400
      Intention to treat Surgery aborted or R1-2 resection will remain in surgical arm No cross
      over CT scan chest/abdomen 4 weeks after surgery as post-operative baseline Will not alter
      treatment allocation Will allow for PFS measurement in surgical arm CT scan chest/abdomen
      pelvis Q 12 weeks after initiation sorafenib Patients progressing on sorafenib allowed 2nd
      line treatment Regorafenib or lenvatinib - if approved in China Dose reduction sorafenib as
      per protocol
