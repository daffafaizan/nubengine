      urgent surgery at the main operating rooms of the University of New Mexico Hospital.

      It is planned to test the efficacy of the novel bag mask ventilation augmentation technique
      of placing a large perforated TegadermÂ® over the mouth of bearded male patients in order to
      improve seal after induction of general anesthesia. The perforation is a diamond-shaped hole
      to be aligned with the patient's mouth. Patients will either start with Tegaderm application
      or without Tegaderm, and will then cross over to the other condition in order to be their own
      controls. The primary endpoint is to measure inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes.

      If shown efficacious this intervention would be an easy and cost-effective intervention to
      improve bag mask ventilation for bearded patients in the operating room and non-operating
      room environments alike.
