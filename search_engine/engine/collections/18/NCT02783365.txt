    
      This is a multi-site study occurring between the University of Missouri, and the American
      Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network (NRN). The University of Missouri will
      be responsible for the following:

        -  Coordinating the approval of initial protocol as well as subsequent amendments.

        -  Ensure that each site is using the correct version of the protocol.

        -  Serve as the study contact.

        -  Participate in the selection of qualified sites for participation (the NRN will be
           responsible for recruitment and randomization. This process will be overseen by MU).

        -  Monitor progress and oversee all conduct of the study at participating sites.

        -  Responsible for the data analysis, reporting, integrity, and accuracy of data.

      There will be one protocol document, and each site will utilize this document. The lead site
      (MU) will develop the informed consent, which includes language that data will be shared with
      the NRN.

      The NRN will be the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of record for the 18 practices recruited
      to participate within the NRN, and will provide a letter of authorization and final IRB
      approval to the lead PI (MU).

      The study will test if a photo elicitation intervention combined with access to online
      community support and a chronic pain guideline can improve a 3-item measure of chronic pain
      [the PEG score: Pain intensity (P), Enjoyment of Life (E), and General Activity (G)] and a
      patient-identified area of function, compared to a group who receive the guideline alone.
