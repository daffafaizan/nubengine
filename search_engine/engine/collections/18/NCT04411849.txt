      I. Determine the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing cervical cancer screening.

      II. Assess the fidelity, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      III. Determine satisfaction with the intervention at the patient- and provider-levels.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: During year 2, participants receive the HPV self-testing intervention consisting of
      mailed HPV self-test devices. Participants also receive an information about cervical cancer.
      Participants who do not return their self-test within a few weeks receive telephone-based
      patient navigation. Participants then complete a satisfaction survey and have their medical
      record reviewed. During years 3-5, this intervention is repeated among women who remain
      unscreened/underscreened.

      GROUP II: During year 2, participants receive usual care consisting of a reminder letter to
      get a clinic-based cervical cancer screening test and information about cervical cancer.
      During years 3-5, participants receive the HPV self-testing intervention described for Group
      I.
