      trial will explore effectiveness and safety using the combination therapy of camrelizumab and
      hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients with massive tumor including non-small cell lung
      cancer, soft tissue sarcoma or urothelial carcinoma. All enrolled patients will receive the
      following treatments: camrelizumab 200mg every 2 weeks until disease progression (as
      determined by RECIST 1.1), intolerance, or patient/physician decision to stop treatment. One
      week following completion of the first immunotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy(SABR)
      with tumor center dose of 24-32Gy/8Gy/3-4f and surrounding important organs at risk â‰¤3.0Gy
      will be performed. And the routine radiotherapy will be started with reaching a radical cure
      dose for the tumor margin. Generally, the radiotherapy will end before the fourth
      immunotherapy.

      During treatment participants will be assessed for curative effects and the occurrence of
      adverse events. Following treatment, participants will be assessed at a clinic visit every 3
      months to collect survival information and follow-up treatment information. The planned
      sample size is 60 study participants.
