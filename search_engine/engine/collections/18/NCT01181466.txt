      as a result of inflammation caused by exposure to noxious inhaled agents for extended
      periods. The most common cause of this condition is cigarette smoking, although genetic,
      occupational, and environmental causes account for up to 10% of cases. Despite aggressive
      public health initiatives aimed at discouraging the use of cigarettes, smoking-related lung
      diseases remain a significant cause of disability and death worldwide. Due to the number of
      current and new smokers, emphysema is expected to remain a leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality for years to come.

      The AeriSeal System is a novel device system being developed for the treatment of advanced
      emphysema. The AeriSeal System is administered bronchoscopically, and designed to provide the
      physiological benefits of lung volume reduction without the risks and cost of major surgery.
