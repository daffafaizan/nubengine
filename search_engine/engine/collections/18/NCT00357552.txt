      combinations of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with either a PI or
      an NNRTI. However, three-drug regimens may not be ideal in resource-limited settings, where
      viral load and resistance testing may not be readily available. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the PI LPV/r alone in treatment-experienced, PI-naive
      HIV infected individuals who are experiencing virologic failure on three-drug regimens.

      This study will last 104 weeks. All participants will receive LPV/r twice daily for up to 104
      weeks. Participants who experience virologic failure will receive emtricitabine/tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate once daily in addition to LPV/r twice daily for the remainder of the
      study.

      There will be 16 study visits for participants on LPV/r monotherapy and 12 study visits for
      participants who have intensified LPV/r with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
      Blood collection and clinical assessment will occur at all visits; urine collection and
      resistance testing will occur at selected visits.
