      lower cost than molecular tests. Because antigen tests do not incorporate an amplification
      step, they are intrinsically less sensitive than PCR molecular tests. Nevertheless, several
      investigators have examined the feasibility of screening populations of individuals in a low
      SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence situation, such as the workplace or schools, with rapid
      antigen tests in place of the molecular tests. Using viral kinetics, knowledge of what level
      of viral load is required for transmission of culture-competent virus, test sensitivity and
      modeling, they have come to the conclusion that more frequent testing with a test with lower
      sensitivity that has a quick turn-around time is better than a test with high sensitivity
      with a longer turn-around time. Therefore, the goal of this study is to test the hypothesis
      that frequent testing with a relatively sensitive lateral flow antigen test performed at home
      using self-collected anterior nasal swabs will be superior to once a week or less PCR testing
      and non-inferior to three times a week PCR testing in an employment screening setting with a
      relatively low incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 infections. This study aims to assess how an
      at-home COVID-19 frequent testing regimen using a Rapid Antigen Screening Test (RAST) and a
      phone application to help interpret the test result compares to once-a-week or
      three-times-a-week PCR (molecular) testing to identify a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We expect to
      recruit up to 4,400 employees and cast members of Media and Entertainment Company and its
      affiliates to test whether frequent use of the RAST will perform as well or better than
      weekly molecular testing and at least as well as three-times-a-week molecular testing.
      Recruitment and the study will continue until at least 31 or at most 148 true positive
      SARS-CoV-2 molecular results are reached.
