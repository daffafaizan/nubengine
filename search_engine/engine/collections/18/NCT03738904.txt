      pain is common and can have profound implications Most patients who undergo surgical
      procedures experience acute postoperative pain, but evidence suggests that less than half
      report adequate postoperative pain relief. Many preoperative, intraoperative, and
      postoperative interventions and management strategies are available for reducing and managing
      postoperative pain. Mostly, pain is treated with opioids which are narcotics. medically they
      are primarily used for pain relief and these are historically considered "safe" drugs as they
      do not impose an increased risk of bleeding, kidney, or stomach problems. However, many
      patients taking high dose opioids have a higher risk of constipation. Unrelieved
      postoperative pain may result in economic and medical implications such as extended lengths
      of stay, readmissions, and patient dissatisfaction with medical care. With the rising concern
      over narcotic use, physicians are increasingly seeking alternative ways to help patients
      manage pain throughout their hospital stay and beyond However, few studies in anorectal
      surgery have shown that using an aggressive postoperative non-narcotic pain regimen (ERAS)
      can help reduce postoperative pain and decreased returns to emergency care.
