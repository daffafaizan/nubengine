      Faculty of Medicine on patients admitted to The Poison Control Unit (Emergency Hospital,
      Tanta University and Emergency Hospital, Mansoura University) with acute phosphide poisoning
      in the period from January 2016 to January 2018. A written informed consent will be taken
      from each patient or his/her guardians (if the patient was unable to participate in the
      consent process). Confidentiality of the data will be maintained by making code numbers for
      each patient. The investigators plan to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of ALA as an adjuvant in treatment of patients with acute phosphide
      poisoning. Fifty patients will be randomized to ALA or a non ALA in a 1:1 ratio (25 patients
      in each group). ALA will be given IV, as a dose of 600 mg/12 hours. Patients will be
      monitored and a detailed documentation of any adverse effect due to ALA therapy will be
      recorded.

      This intervention represents an added treatment to the existing standard of care. All
      patients will continue to receive standard treatment, which is determined by the attending
      physician who maintains clinical responsibility for all patients. It consists of patient
      resuscitation, gastric decontamination (with sodium bicarbonate, and activated charcoal [1
      g/Kg, orally] in the first 6 hours after onset of poisoning), adequate hydration and
      supportive treatment. All the patients will be followed up until discharge or death. All
      patients will be subjected to:

      I. History. II. Clinical examination. III. Laboratory investigations: At admission and
      repeated before discharge.
