      patients may develop severe complications with a mortality between 10%-20% It remains a
      difficulty to find an effective method for prediction of severity of AP at early stage.

      It is well-established that obesity (defined as body mass index[BMI]>30kg/m2 by the World
      Health Organization) is a risk factor for AP and increases the incidence of systemic
      complication, motality. There are a lot of parameters related to saropenic obesity, including
      areas of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), skeletal muscle
      tissue (SMT), and VAT/SMT ratio. it is unclear which parameter is the best predictor of
      severe AP. Thus, this study is aimed to investigate the association between these parameters
      and AP severity and find the best predictor of AP.
