      function was assessed using ultrasound as normal, no movement, or paradoxical. Room air pulse
      oximetry (SpO2) was recorded. Patients were randomized to receive either 0.25% bupivacaine or
      0.125% bupivacaine. ISPNB was performed using a coded syringe of the study drug, so that the
      anesthesiologists performing the nerve block, the patient, and the nurses assessing the
      patient were blinded as to the concentration. Patients were given a general endotracheal
      anesthesia for rotator cuff repair, and opioids were administered at the discretion of the
      attending anesthesiologist. When patients met criteria for PACU discharge, diaphragm function
      was again assessed using ultrasound and room air SpO2 was recorded.
