    
      EryDex System (EDS) is a combination product used to administer dexamethasone sodium
      phosphate (DSP) by ex vivo encapsulation in autologous erythrocytes which are re-infused. DSP
      is dephosphorylated in RBCs to release dexamethasone.

      The 12 subjects who meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned to one of
      the 2 groups, consisting of 6 subjects each, as follows:

        -  Group 1 (active drug arm): 15-20 mg DSP loaded in RBC using the EDS.

        -  Group 2 (sham arm): sham treated autologous RBC using the EDS

      One 50±5mL aliquot of blood collected from each subject will be treated using the EDS process
      (either active drug or sham) and the resultant processed RBCs will be radiolabeled with
      Chromium-51 (51Cr) for the in vivo kinetic study. A second 10±5mL simultaneously collected
      sample will be labeled with Technetium-99m (99mTc) to estimate the subject's blood volume.
      These labeled aliquots will be mixed, and simultaneously infused through a peripheral vein
      via butterfly or similar catheter (total dose 20-40 μCi). Blood samples will be collected
      from the subject's contralateral arm immediately pre-infusion and at 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15,
      20, and 30 minutes (± 3 min), and on Day 1, 24 hours (±2 h) after completion of infusion.
      Vital signs will be assessed after the 30-min sample on Day 0 and again on Day 1 before the
      24-h sample is collected. Additional blood samples will be collected at 48 (±4 h) and 72 (±4
      h) hours and 7 (±1 d) days post-infusion, and then weekly through 49 days post-infusion, with
      a window of ±2 days for each visit.
