      medications are an effective treatment for depression, it can take as long as 6-8 weeks
      before symptoms improve, and 20-35% of individuals who use antidepressants still experience
      depression symptoms.

      New treatments that accelerate response to antidepressants are important to reduce the burden
      of depression. The objectives of the proposed study are (1) to evaluate the effects of
      partial sleep deprivation compared to no sleep deprivation for improving response to 8 weeks
      of fluoxetine 20-40 mg treatment and (2) to examine the underlying sleep mechanisms of
      treatment response.

      Participants who are eligible for the study will be randomly assigned to one of three sleep
      schedules for a 2-week period while taking fluoxetine: no sleep deprivation (8 hours time in
      bed), late bedtime (6 hours time in bed, with 2 hour bedtime delay) or early risetime (6
      hours time in bed, with 2 hour advancement of rise time). Participants will spend a total of
      7 nights in our sleep laboratory and will be followed on fluoxetine for an 8-week period.
