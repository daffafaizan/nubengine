      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the dose limiting toxicity of carmustine
      administered after O6-benzylguanine in children with refractory primary CNS tumors.

      II. Determine a safe and tolerable dose of carmustine administered after O6-benzylguanine to
      be used in phase II studies.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of O6-benzylguanine and its metabolite,
      O6-benzyl-8-oxoguanine, in these patients.

      IV. Seek preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      V. Evaluate the acute and chronic toxicities, and describe cumulative toxicity, in patients
      treated with multiple courses of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of carmustine.

      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, then, 1 hour later, carmustine IV is
      administered over 1 hour. Treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive
      escalating doses of carmustine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is
      defined as the dose level at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT). If myelosuppression is the DLT, stratum 1 is closed and patients are accrued
      to stratum 2. If neutropenia is the DLT in stratum 2, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients are
      followed every 6 months for 4 years, then annually thereafter.
