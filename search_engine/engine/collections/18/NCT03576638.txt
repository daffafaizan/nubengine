    
      An open label, non randomized crossover phase 2 study to assess the PK of AP-CD/LD given at
      dose of 50/500mg three times daily compared to CD/LD immediate release (Sinemet) 1.5 tablets
      of dose of 25/100 given 5 times per day in Parkinson's Disease patients. The study will have
      a screening period followed by an overnight stay in clinic where Immediate release CD/LD
      (Sinemet) will be administered five times, approximately every three hours. At specified
      intervals, blood will be drawn for PK testing. On Days 2-7, subjects will be treated at home
      with AP CD/LD three times/day, approximately every five hours. Day 8 will be overnight stay
      in clinic for PK study. AP CD/LD 500mg TID will be dispensed to subjects with specified
      timelines for PK assessment. Each subject will return to clinic on day 15 for a safety
      followup visit.
