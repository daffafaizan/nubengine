      (MSM).1-3 HIV-positive MSM have a higher prevalence of anal HPV infection than HIV-negative
      MSM and are more likely to have infection with multiple HPV types.1,2 Spontaneous clearance
      of anal HPV infection is less common among HIV- positive compared with HIV-negative MSM.2
      Persistent anal HPV infection, particularly with high-risk HPV types, is an important risk
      factor for the development of anal cancer.4-6 The incidence of anal cancer among HIV-positive
      MSM is very high, ranging from 75 to 137 per 100,000 person-years, and is five times higher
      than that in HIV-negative MSM.7-10 Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) is
      the putative precursor of anal cancer.11-13 Anal squamous intraepithelial lesion has a
      dynamic picture of temporal progression and regression, but HSIL is much less likely to
      regress than low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL).10,14 A recent systematic
      review and meta-analysis showed the pooled prevalence of anal HSIL to be 29.1% in
      HIV-positive MSM and 21.5% in HIV-negative MSM.15 Anal HSIL incidence ranged from 8.5 to
      15.4% per year in HIV-positive MSM and 3.3 to 6.0% per year in HIV-negative MSM. Although
      data are limited, previous studies have shown a 9-15% progression rate from anal HSIL to anal
      cancer during a median follow-up of 3 - 5 years. 11-13 Previous research at the Thai Red
      Cross AIDS Research Centre has demonstrated high rates of HPV infection and anal HSIL among
      Thai MSM, with HIV-positive MSM disproportionately affected. Prevalence of anal infection
      with high-risk HPV types was 57.5% in HIV-positive and 36.6% in HIV-negative MSM (p =
      0.008).16 Prevalence of anal HSIL was 18.9% in HIV-positive MSM and 11.4% in HIV-negative MSM
      (p = 0.1), while incidence of anal HSIL over 12 months was 29% and 8%, respectively
      (p=0.001).17 HIV-positive MSM in that study, however, were mainly na√Øve to antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) at enrollment (87% not on ART) and only 10% had undetectable HIV viral load at
      baseline.

      It is not clear if the higher rates of HPV infection and persistence of infection are due to
      HIV infection or to different risk behavior among HIV-positive MSM. Data are inconclusive on
      whether the use of ART has an effect on anal HPV infection among HIV-positive MSM.18-19
      Furthermore, there is no data on the effect that "early diagnosis" of HIV infection and
      "early treatment" with ART might have on incidence and persistence of HPV infection or on the
      development of anal HSIL.

      We propose a longitudinal, observational study of HPV infection and anal HSIL among
      HIV-positive Thai MSM who initiate ART during acute HIV infection (AHI). The hypothesis is
      that early HIV diagnosis and early ART within the first 4 weeks of infection will mitigate
      immunological and virological factors that increase HPV persistence and anal HSIL incidence
      in HIV-positive MSM such that these measure will be significantly lower when compared to
      historical controls of chronically-infected HIV-positive Thai MSM.
