      doxorubicin) + Bleomycin + Vinblastine + Dacarbazine (ABVD). Studies have shown that patients
      aged over 60 years have a lower tolerance and efficiency during this treatment than younger
      patients. There are particular pulmonary toxicities with bleomycin included in the ABVD
      treatment.

      Alternative treatment strategies have been proposed removing bleomycin in the Prednisone +
      Vinblastine + Adriamycin/Doxorubicin +Gemcitabine (PVAG) protocol evaluated in more than 60
      patients. Compared to ABVD treatment, PVAG treatment presented a more favorable toxicity
      profile. The quality of response between the two treatments is substantially equal.

      Bendamustine was evaluated in four studies in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma in relapse and
      showed higher efficacy than gemcitabine with an acceptable toxicity profile.

      In this study, the Sponsor and the coordinating investigator propose to replace dacarbazine
      in the standard ABVD protocol by bendamustine and to stop using bleomycin.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bendamustine in
      patients treated with prednisone, vinblastine and doxorubicin. This is the PVAB treatment
      with which LYSARC and the coordinating investigator expect better tolerability and quality
      response.
