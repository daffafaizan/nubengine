      smoking at least 5 manufactured or 3 rolled-on-their-own cigarettes per day. They will be
      randomly assigned according to a 1:1 ratio to receive either a financial incentive
      (20â‚¬/visit) to attend the 5 study visits (control group) or receive this show-up incentive
      plus an incentive for being abstinent at visit(s) on a progressive manner (treatment group).
      The incentives will be delivered as vouchers. Two hundred and forty pregnant smokers will be
      randomized into the control and treatment groups, respectively. The study will be run in
      several maternity wards across France all of whom routinely treat pregnant smokers.

      Expected results

        -  Financial incentives rewarding progressive abstinence from smoking will increase
           abstinence rate more than lack of financial incentives.

        -  Forward looking and time consistent women will be more likely to stop smoking.

        -  If the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness are demonstrated, financial incentives
           can be introduced as a standard intervention in helping pregnant smokers quit.
