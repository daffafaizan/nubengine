      tolerability, PK and PD of single and multiple rising doses of TAK-418 in healthy Japanese or
      non-Japanese females.

      The study will enroll approximately 48 participants in 6 cohorts and each cohort will have 8
      participants. The study will include 2 parts: single rising dose (SRD) in Cohort 1 and
      multiple rising dose (MRD) in Cohorts 2 to 6. Cohort 3 will include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      collection. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one
      of the 6 cohorts.

      This two-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in Cohort 1 of this study is approximately 105 days and 98 days in Cohort 2. Participants
      will be contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
