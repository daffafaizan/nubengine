      is to restore normal coronary blood flow with timely reperfusion by percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI), and thereby minimize the extent of cell death and preserving cardiac
      function. The duration of ischemia and timely PCI are major determinants for the size of the
      myocardial infarction and prognosis. Thus, acute PCI should be performed within 12 hours
      after symptom onset. The effect of PCI and timing of PCI are, however, much more uncertain
      for late presenters who contact the health service > 12 hours from symptom. Thus, it is still
      unknown whether late presenters should be treated with acute PCI or medical treatment with
      delayed PCI (24-72 h after first medical contact).

      The study investigates the effect on final salvage index evaluated by magnetic resonance
      imaging of acute PCI of late presenters.

      The overall objective of the study is to investigate whether late presenters may benefit from
      acute PCI, and thus whether to extend the currently recommended time limit of 12 hours for
      acute PCI in patients with STEMI.
