      will taper off without any treatment. If the neck pain symptoms persist for more than two
      months without any improvement, it will be categorized as chronic neck pain causing not only
      pain but also functional impact, even in daily life, working, and sleep quality.

      Fu's subcutaneous needling is utilized in treating disease related with myofascial trigger
      point, including soft tissue pain, joint pain, even some internal problems. Indeed it reduce
      pain immediately with no obvious side effects. There were some clinical articles of
      subjective symptoms description published lacking scientific accessment of efficacy.

      Research team leading by Professor Chang-Zern Hong has already prove that excitability can be
      reduced by distal acupuncture. Needling TE5 and LI11 can reduce pain intensity and average
      amplitude of MTrPs end plate in upper trapezium m., and increase pain pressure threshold.

      Comparing to traditional acupuncture, whether safer and pain-less Fu's subcutaneous needle
      also has the distal treatment effect or not still needs more scientific experiment to prove.
      This is a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of Transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation and Fu's subcutaneous needle on chronic neck pain by using more objective
      assessment tools such as Neck Disability Index, Visual Analog Scales, Pressure Pain Threshold
      and Myotone of MTrPs of Upper Trapezius Muscles, Range of Motion of Stretch of Upper
      Trapezius Muscle, and Pittsburgh sleep quality index.
