      musculoskeletal complaints. The intervention consisted of workplace information meetings
      about musculoskeletal complaint to all employees and peer support. The atWork intervention
      targeting musculoskeletal complaints reduced sick leave and improved health in a randomized
      controlled trial. The atWork intervention has now been further developed with the aim to
      increase effect on sick leave and health. The intervention is now extended to include
      information about mental health complaints, in addition to a management course. The major
      societal costs and the negative consequences common mental health complaints induce underline
      the importance of testing if atWork is an effective way of reducing these consequences.
