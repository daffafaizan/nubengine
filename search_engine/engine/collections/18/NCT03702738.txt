      study. It will enrol drug sensitive TB patients with moderately advanced or far advanced
      pulmonary disease by chest X-ray. Patients providing informed consent will undergo screening
      evaluations to establish eligibility. Patients meeting all the inclusion and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive standard TB treatment (2HRZE/4HR) plus NAC
      1200 mg BID for months 1-4, or standard treatment alone. During the treatment period patients
      will undergo safety, efficacy, and biomarker assessments at specified time points. After a
      final evaluation at 6 months, patients will continue follow-up as a part of the main
      TB-SEQUEL cohort study.
