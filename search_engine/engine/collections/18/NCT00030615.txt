      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of decitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the dose of
      this drug with biologic activity in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of
      this drug in these patients. V. Determine clinical response to this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 weekly for 4 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.
