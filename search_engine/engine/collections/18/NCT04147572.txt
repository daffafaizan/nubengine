    
      This is an open, randomised, multicentre, crossover study with Easyhaler and HandiHaler
      inhalers. The primary objective is to characterise inspiratory flow parameters across placebo
      dry powder inhaler Easyhaler (2 inhaler versions) and placebo Spiriva inhalation powder
      capsule inhaled via HandiHaler in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      and in healthy volunteers. The secondary objective is to calculate correlation of peak
      inspiratory flow (PIF) rate with regards to anthropometric and lung function parameters.

      Substudy: This is an open, randomised, multicentre, crossover study with Easyhaler and
      HandiHaler inhalers.There will be 1 study visit per subject, usually this visit is done at
      the same visit with the main study.
