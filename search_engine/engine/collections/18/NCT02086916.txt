    
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), which is often a consequence of antibiotic therapy, is
      the most common and one of the most serious hospital-acquired illnesses. It causes a range of
      intestinal upset from mild diarrhoea to a life-threatening severe colitis. The incidence,
      recurrence and mortality rates of CDI have increased dramatically in recent years.
      Metronidazole is the recommended first-line antibiotic, with vancomycin and colectomy
      reserved for severe cases.

      Although risk factors for developing CDI are well known, factors that predict outcome and/or
      recurrence of CDI are uncertain and lack specificity for intestinal inflammation. We wish to
      investigate if careful prospective monitoring of standard clinical and biochemical measures
      will be able to identify patients who will go on to fail primary treatment.

      If one or more of these factors proves able to predict outcome, they could ultimately be used
      for early escalation of therapy with the aim of reducing morbidity, mortality and length of
      hospital stay.
