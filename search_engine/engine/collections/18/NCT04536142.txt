      undergoing brain tumor surgery through high-quality, high-resolution structural and
      functional brain imaging and brain connectivity measures. To understand the effects of the
      primary treatment for brain tumors, the investigators will determine changes in brain
      connectivity after surgery and correlate this with neurologic status. The investigators will
      prospectively collect brain imaging (MRI) and clinical data in brain tumor patients before
      and after removal of their tumor. Any adult patient with a brain tumor (primary or
      metastatic) for whom surgery to remove the tumor is planned is eligible. The investigators
      plan for recruitment of 30 subjects. This will include 27 subjects with brain tumors and 3
      healthy controls. Both clinical and imaging data will be collected for tumor and healthy
      subjects. A two-part research scan (diffusion MRI and resting state functional MRI) will be
      performed within 1 week prior to surgery and again 2 weeks after surgery. The healthy
      controls will obtain identical research scans with the second session two weeks following the
      first session. Subjects will be also administered Neurocognitive and Qualitative Assessments
      at two time intervals, pre- and post-surgery (2 weeks).
