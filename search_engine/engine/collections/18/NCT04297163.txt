      risk factor for various entities and that, in addition, its treatment clearly improves
      others; its control must be optimized in an effective and cost-effective manner. The use of
      information and communication technologies (ICT) in this context can be very beneficial.

      The design of the study is prospective, randomized, controlled, open and parallel.

      A ICT-based out of hospital management of OSA is implemented to be compared with the
      classical in-hospital management.

      The main objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of of two OSA management programs: the
      in-hospital classic management versus a telemedicine program based on the use of ICTs in the
      recovery of patients with OSA who who do not meet the minimum treatment (4 hours) or in those
      who do not comply with the optimal use (5.5 hours).

      This is a 4-weeks management randomized, with parallel groups study. Participants will be
      patients from the Sleep Unit of Hospital Clinic Barcelona with OSA diagnosis and CPAP
      treatment indication, who after a follow-up between 3-months and up to 5 years have a CPAP
      compliance below 5,5 hours/night.

      Two management programs will be compared:

        -  In-hospital classic management: Patients are followed regularly in the hospital with a
           face-to-face visit by the Sleep unit nurse.

        -  Telemedicine management: telemedicine support with mobile app, voicemail and CPAP remote
           monitoring.
