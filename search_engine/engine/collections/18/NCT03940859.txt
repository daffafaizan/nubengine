      in young and middle-aged adults. Intramural hematoma, one of the typical imaging findings of
      IDA, can grow continuously in untreated IDA. Due to relatively high complication rate
      associated with surgical procedures, endovascular treatments have become the first-line
      therapy for such lesions. According to whether the parent artery was maintained, endovascular
      treatment was divided into deconstructive (proximal arterial occlusion and internal trapping)
      and reconstructive (stent implantation with or without coiling) techniques . However,
      recanalization of IDA was a great challenge for endovascular treatment and influenced the
      prognosis of patients.

      The formation of an IMH is a critical event in the progress of IDA and IDA may grow because
      of recurrent IMH even after deconstructive endovascular treatment. Increased IMH size could
      result in severe compression symptoms or even death. At present, the mechanism of the
      continuous growth of intramural hematoma after endovascular treatment of IDA is still
      unclear. Some authors believe that the continuous hemorrhage of the vasa vasorum in the IMH
      results in the continuous enlargement of the IMH. However, this theory has not been proved by
      imaging in vivo.

      Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging analysis for prognosis of intracranial
      dissecting aneurysm with intramural hematoma after endovascular treatment (DEMAT) is a
      prospective trial designed to collect a large series of patients with IDAs treated
      endovascularly to predict the prognosis of IDA with IMH by DCE-MRI and provide theoretical
      basis for the prognosis and intervention of the disease.
