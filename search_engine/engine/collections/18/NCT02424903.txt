      on patients admitted for a septic or aseptic revision of the hip, knee or shoulder
      prosthesis. The decision whether the implant will be retained or removed or antimicrobial
      treatment is based on criteria of each participating center specialists.The success of
      different treatment algorithms will be measured in terms of infection free interval,
      functional outcome and quality of life. All consecutive patients who need a revision surgery
      to the hip, knee or shoulder will be included. Furthermore the study will investigate
      different diagnostic tests (microbiological and histological) for the diagnosis and the
      discrimination of septic and aseptic causes in prosthesis failures. Pathogens (microorganisms
      isolated from puncture of the joint, tissue samples sonication fluid and blood) will be
      collected to establish a biobank.The samples are obtained preoperatively and intraoperatively
      as part of routine care practice. The study is not randomized.
