      participation. The screening includes a physical exam, anthropometry, chemical and lipid
      profiles, as well as measures of liver and renal function. The subjects are assigned to one
      of two groups based upon age.

      Subjects participate in five experimental trials, one for each of the five beverages. The
      beverages are commercially-available and contain ingredients that are generally recognized as
      safe (GRAS). The order of the beverages is randomized. The list of ingredients on the bottle
      containing the beverage is obscured. The trials are identical and separated by at least five
      days. For each experiment, baseline measurements are conducted. Then the subjects consume one
      liter of the test beverage over thirty minutes. Additional measurements are performed thirty
      minutes post ingestion and then every hour for four hours post ingestion.

      This study yields two BHI numbers for each beverage, one number for each study-group. The BHI
      numbers are indicative of the amount of fluid remaining in the body four hours after
      consumption of the beverage. The BHI number is inversely related to the amount of urine
      produced over the four hours. A greater BHI number indicates better fluid retention and
      maintenance of plasma volume.
