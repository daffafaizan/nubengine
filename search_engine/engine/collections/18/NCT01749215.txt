      alcohol use and PTSD symptoms in veterans with these co-occurring disorders.

      This is a prospective randomized double-blind controlled parallel groups clinical trial of
      topiramate or or placebo up to 300 mg per day, combined with weekly alcohol counseling, over
      a 12-week treatment period with a week 16 follow-up. The study population consists of 150
      male and female veterans between the ages of 18-69 who have concurrent diagnoses of alcohol
      use disorder and PTSD. Subjects meet with research staff weekly to receive study medication,
      manualized alcohol counseling, and research assessments. The primary treatment outcome is the
      percent of days of drinking; the secondary outcome is PTSD symptom severity. Exploratory
      measures include assessments of impulsivity and decision-making.
