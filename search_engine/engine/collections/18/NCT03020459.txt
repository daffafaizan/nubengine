      idiopathic macular holes will be equally randomized to internal limiting membrane (ILM)
      peeling-reposition group or ILM peeling group through computer-aided random allocation.

      A standard 3-port pars plana vitrectomy was performed by a single surgeon using the
      Constellation 23 gauge vitrectomy system (Alcon Laboratories Inc, Fort Worth, Texas,
      USA).After posterior vitreous detachment was achieved, peeling of the ILM was performed by an
      end gripping forceps with the assistance of Brilliant Blue G. In ILM peeling-reposition
      group, the peeled ILM flap is flatten back to peeled area with assistance of
      perfluoro-n-octane. In ILM peeling group, a round shape with 2.5 to 3.5 disc diameter of ILM
      is peeled. This is followed by a complete fluid-gas exchange. Patients are encouraged to
      maintain a face-down position for two weeks postoperatively in two groups.

      Postoperative measurements of BCVA and spectral domain optical coherence tomography(SD-OCT)
      are conducted at 1,3 and 6-month follow-up visits by independent masked observers. Macular
      light sensitivity and fixation stability are determined with microperimetry at 1,3, and 6
      months of follow-up. Mf-ERG, M-score chart and VFQ-25 chart are performed 1,3, and 6 months
      of follow-up.

      Comparison of BCVA, anatomical closure were primarily performed between the two groups. Then,
      the morphologic changes of inner retina and the functional parameters measured from
      microperimetry, Mf-ERG, M-score chart, VFQ-25 chart were analyzed.
