      and dietary counseling to increase dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acid in individuals with
      COPD.

      This hypothesis is based on a number of recent observations. Studies have investigated the
      impact of omega-3 fatty acids, especially Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA), alfa-linolenic acid (ALA) intake in chronic diseases and show a link with decreased
      systemic inflammation measured by cytokines including interleukin 1 (IL-1B), interleukin 6
      (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), tumoral necrosis factor alfa (TNF-α) and eicosanoids; and
      improved outcomes. In a large cross-sectional study of individuals with COPD, a diet rich in
      the omega-3 ALA was associated with lower serum TNF-α levels while a diet rich in the
      omega-6's LA and arachidonic acid (AA) had higher systemic inflammatory markers IL-6 and
      c-reactive protein (CRP). Other recent nutritional epidemiological study showed the
      association of greater intakes of omega-3 fatty acids with better lung function profile, but
      also a slower forced expiratory volume at the 1 second (FEV1) decline in the same smoker
      cohort.

      Preliminary cross-sectional data (n=59), from the CLEAN Air study, reported that at baseline,
      a higher omega 3 dietary intake was linked with reduced systemic inflammation (IL-1B) and
      improved respiratory outcomes (a 28% decrease in the odds of COPD symptoms in moderate-severe
      COPD and conversely, higher omega-6 levels associated with worse outcomes, including
      increased dyspnea and lower lung function. These findings support the importance of
      implementing an intervention program to confirm there is a beneficial association between
      fatty acid dietary intake and reduced COPD symptoms.

      To this end, the investigators propose a pilot intervention study in 20 subjects to see if
      the investigators can increase omega-3 dietary intake over a 4 week period. The investigators
      will measure self-report dietary intake of omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, as well as measure,
      fasting plasma fatty acid levels, before and after the intervention.
