    
      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to estimate the 1-week change in the proportion
      of HCV-infected hepatocytes in participants with HCV monoinfection and HIV/HCV coinfection on
      therapy with two or three DAAs with different mechanisms of action using single cell laser
      microdissection (scLCM).

      Secondary Objectives:

      Estimate the change over the first week in plasma HCV RNA in subjects with HCV monoinfected
      and HIV/HCV coinfected participants on therapy with two or three DAAs

      Estimate the 1 week change in the amount of HCV RNA per infected hepatocyte using scLCM on
      liver biopsy specimens, obtained just prior to treatment initiation (pre-treatment), and
      after the first week of DAA therapy.

      Estimate the change in the proportion of HCV-infected hepatocytes that express
      interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) within the first week of DAA therapy using scLCM.

      Measure the change in expression of ISGs in non-parenchymal intrahepatic immune cells
      (Kupffer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells) within the first week of DAA therapy using
      scLCM.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      Estimate the 1 week change in expression of ISGs from peripheral blood mononucleated cells
      (PBMCs) within the first week of DAA+ribavirin (RBV) therapy using scLCM.

      Compare sequence(s) of HCV protease, nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A), and nonstructural
      protein 5B (NS5B) depending on the peripheral sequence) of intrahepatic HCV RNA in single
      cells and bulk tissue, before and during week 1 of DAA+RBV therapy.

      Estimate the week 1 change in the sizes and numbers of HCV-infected clusters on DAA therapy
      to test whether clearance of HCV-infected hepatocytes occurs in spatially random patterns or
      within specific clusters.
