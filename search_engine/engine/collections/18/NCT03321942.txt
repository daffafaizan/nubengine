      mesenchymal stem cells(AMSCs) and its effect on oxidative stress, inflammation and
      mitochondrial damage.We intend to use blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance
      imaging(BOLD-MRI), emission computed tomography(ECT) and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
      to monitor renal oxygenation, tissue perfusion and renal function.Ultimately, we evaluate the
      treatment effects of AMSCs on chronic renal failure through these observations mentioned
      above.We hope to delay the progression of renal function in patients with chronic renal
      failure, and save huge social cost for dialysis by these research.
