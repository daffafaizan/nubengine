      injection of OSTENIL PLUS or of SYNVISC-ONE in the most painful knee. The study involved a
      preselection visit at D-7 and five further visits: at D0 (baseline, evaluation before
      intra-articular injection), at D2 ± 2 days (injection), at D30 ± 15 days, at D90 ± 15 days
      and C5 at D180 ± 15 days.

      To enrol the patients as quickly as possible, 129 sites, i.e. general medical or rheumatology
      practices, were open. After verifying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the evaluating
      investigators assigned a randomisation number based on the chronological order of inclusion
      of patients at their site. The patient was then sent to the injecting investigator so that
      he/she could give the injection of the product corresponding to the randomisation number.
