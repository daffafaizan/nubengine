    
      Design: Single centre, open label, randomized controlled trial.

        -  Population: Patients with indication of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) with the following
           criteria:

        -  Protocol: All patients are tested on day 3-5 of cycle for total Testosterone (Te),
           Dehydroepiandrosetnodione sulphate (DHEAS) and Androstenodione (Δ4). Samples are frozen
           and stored at -20ºC for later analysis. FSH, LH, E2, PRL and TSH are also determined.
           All patients follow Controlled Ovarian Stimulation for IVF with a GnRH agonist long
           protocol. They are randomized to receive recombinant (r) FSH alone (225 IU/day) or r-FSH
           + r-LH (225+75 IU/day).

        -  Sample size calculation: To detect a difference from 40 to 60% (Relative risk: 1.50) on
           pregnancy rate (PR) between patients with low and high androgen levels with respect to
           the mean of each COS protocol, with a confidence level of 95% (error α=0.05) and 80% of
           power (error β=0.2), 97 patients per arm were needed. (n=388 patients). Rounding up, 400
           patients are to be recruited.
