      stroke. The HOH is a light-weight, non-invasive, portable hand robot that provides physical
      assistance when a patient activates the muscles that open and close the hand. The HOH works
      by detecting surface EMG muscle activity and therefore requires active participation from the
      patient throughout the session. Video games linked to the HOH device are specifically
      designed to work on opening and closing the hand facilitating mass practice and high
      repetition needed for improving strength and range of motion of muscles.
