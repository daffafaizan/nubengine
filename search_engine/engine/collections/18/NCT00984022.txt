      resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has produced a corresponding increase in the number of
      ED patients presenting with abscesses that require incision and drainage. This study compares
      Aquacel against routine Iodoform packing for packing abscess cavities after incision and
      drainage. It is hypothesized that Aquacel will produce speedier healing of the abscess. More
      effective abscess healing will reduce the need for oral antibiotic coverage, which will in
      turn reduce the potential for drug resistance caused by indiscriminate use of oral
      antibiotics.
