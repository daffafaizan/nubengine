      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS), to regulate homeostatic plasticity prior to rTMS delivery at two
      different frequencies (1Hz and 10Hz). Homeostatic plasticity, the initial activation state of
      a targeted circuit, is a theoretical determinant of whether rTMS induces long term
      potentiation (LTP) or long term depression (LTD).Yet, homeostatic plasticity is rarely
      measured or controlled in rTMS studies. In a physiological investigation of health subjects,
      we aim to control homeostatic plasticity by preconditioning the targeted circuits with tDCS
      prior to rTMS delivery. The justification for this study is that controlling homeostatic
      plasticity can reduce subject variability and the knowledge gained can be used to optimize
      rTMS delivery. What is needed to move the field forward is a method for combining tDCS and
      rTMS and for measuring neuronal responses directly which we aim to establish in this study.
      The pilot study project will examine the targeted effects of neuromodulation in normal
      subjects. The brain regions targeted for intervention include auditory areas in the temporal
      cortex (TC) that process sounds and functionally connected regions of the dorsolateral
      frontal cortex (DLFC) that mediate sensory habituation. Due to funding limitations, only the
      1 Hz rTMS condition could be initiated.
