      I. To determine the safety, feasibility of administration, response rates and progression
      free survival among chemotherapy na√Øve patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with
      FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab and cetuximab (FBC).

      II. To determine the survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with FBC.

      III. To determine the safety of the current regimen in selected patients who have had prior
      MoAb therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1 in weeks 1-8. Patients also
      receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, and leucovorin
      calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours on days 1
      and 2 of weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-67 patients will be accrued for this study.
