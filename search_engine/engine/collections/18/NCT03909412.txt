    
      This study will be conducted as an open-label Phase I, single-center study in which subjects
      will receive carfilzomib, in combination cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, for mobilization
      of peripheral blood stem cells. Study treatment will be administered in sequential cohorts,
      with three to six subjects in each cohort.

      Following induction therapy, eligible patients will complete screening procedures. Treatment
      will consist of Dexamethasone 40mg IV/PO to be administered as a premedication. Carfilzomib
      dosed at each respective cohort level to be administered over 30 minutes followed by
      Cyclophosphamide dosed at 2gm/m2 administered over 1 hour.

      For patients who are na√Øve to carfilzomib based therapy a priming dose of Carfilzomib
      (20mg/m2) will be administered 1 week prior to the cohort dosing.

      On day 7 subjects will initiate high dose G-CSF injections at 14mcg/kg daily (with a cap of
      1440mcg daily). On day 12 peripheral blood stem cell collection will begin per institutional
      protocol.

      After successful peripheral blood stem cell mobilization, patients will proceed to a
      melphalan based autologous stem cell transplant.

      Patients will have disease parameters assessed monthly after the transplant.
