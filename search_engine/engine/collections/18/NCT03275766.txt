      disorders or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It refers to slowing of fine motor skills,
      motor planning and gross motor behavior. In major depression and schizophrenia, psychomotor
      slowing is associated with alterations of premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and

      depression.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to one of four arms:
