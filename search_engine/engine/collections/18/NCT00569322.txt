    
      This prospective, observational study was performed in the medical-surgical ICU of a single
      hospital within a large multi-specialty healthcare system.

      It was determined that it was not standard care to do glucose testing on all patients
      admitted to medical/surgical ICU's who did not have diagnosed diabetes and varied widely with
      the admitting service.

      The primary objective of the study was to assess the availability and clinical value of blood
      glucose testing at the time of ICU admission after testing was implemented as routine care in
      the ICU.
