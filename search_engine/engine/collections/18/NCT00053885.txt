        -  Determine the efficacy of PTK787/ZK 222584, in terms of 3-month progression-free
           survival, in patients with malignant mesothelioma.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall and failure-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate pretreatment circulating serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor
           (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and VEGF mRNA isoforms with response in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral PTK787/ZK 222584 daily. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 1 year.
