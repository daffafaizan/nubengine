      adult men and less than 12 g/dL in women.

      The cause of these anemias is most often deficient with 17% iron deficiency. This deficiency
      is related to age, inflammatory diseases, blood loss, and absorption disorders mainly. Anemia
      must be diagnosed preoperatively and treated.

      To reduce transfusion in the perioperative period there are various possibilities: increase
      of the preoperative erythrocyte mass, reduction of losses, use of the blood that has been
      applied.

      The impact of these preoperative strategies can be considerable. In their work, Beattie and
      al demonstrates that transfusion is associated with an increase in mortality at 90 days,
      proportional to the volume transfused, with certainly a higher risk in fragile subjects. More
      recently, an American registry of more than 220,000 patients showed that 30% had preoperative
      anemia. This anemia not only significantly increased mortality, but all causes of comorbidity
      were aggravated in an anemic patient.

      However, the complexity of these recommendations leads to low compliance and to unnecessary
      and harmful per- and postoperative blood transfusion.

      In order to improve practices and regarding the complexity of the guidelines, the latest
      European Consensus Conference recommends the use of decision support systems for the
      management of preoperative anemia.
