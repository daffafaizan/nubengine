      suggested that patient-driven self-management of blood pressure medications can be effective
      in achieving hypertension control, but questions remain as to how to apply these findings to
      a US population. The VA Healthcare System is an ideal system in which to test and customize
      this strategy for blood pressure treatment.

      Project question:

      Is patient-initiated self-management of blood pressure medication using a pre-specified,
      generalizable dose escalation scheme clinically effective, safe, and acceptable to patients
      and clinicians, compared to usual care in controlling blood pressure in hypertensive
      Veterans? Project methods: The investigators propose a 12-month randomized, controlled,
      non-blinded, single-center study of patient-initiated self-management of blood pressure
      medication vs. usual care with planned post study cohort follow-up via medical records.
      Participants in the intervention arm will be provided with home blood pressure monitoring
      tools and a self-management algorithm for changing their blood pressure medications as
      needed. Participants in the usual care arm will receive home monitoring tools and typical
      hypertension care from the primary care provider. The primary blood pressure outcome measure
      for the study will be between-group change in in-clinic blood pressure. Acceptability,
      safety, patient-centered outcomes and adherence will be key secondary outcomes
