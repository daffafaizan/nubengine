      ablation treatments will be invited to participate in this study. The participation in this
      research is entirely voluntary.

      A. Each patient is given a code number instead of ID(identification) in the chart. Eligible
      patients according to their vein size are divided into following groups using a
      computer-generated randomization list:

        1. Vein diameter between 5.5 and 6.7 mm, Post-op compression 1 day;

        2. Vein diameter between 5.5 and 6.7 mm, Post-op compression 7 days;

        3. Vein diameter between 6.8 and 8.5 mm, Post-op compression 3 days;

        4. Vein diameter between 6.8 and 8.5 mm, Post-op compression 7 days.

      B. Researchers: Data collectors and ultrasound technicians are blinded to the type of
      intervention, using code instead of patient's ID. The operating surgeon will not be the one
      who collects data. Performing physicians master these endovenous procedure techniques
      equally, have performed a minimum of 20 procedures independently.

      C. Device: Graduated medical compression hosiery, 15-20mmHg. BrightLife Direct, Washington,
      DC. Endovenous ablation device: 1. Radiofrequency Ablation- FDA approval 1999, VNUS RFG2, San
      Jose, CA; 2. Endovenous Laser ablation- FDA approval Jan 2002, TVS 1470 by Total Vein System.
      Wavelength 1470nm, Nano Laser System device, Houston, TX. These two procedures are standard
      care under current guideline.

      D. The research takes place over 12 months in total. During that time, it will be necessary
      for each patient to come to the clinic 6 times, for 1 hour each. The investigators would like
      to meet with every patient 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 12 months after the procedure respectively for
      a check-up.
