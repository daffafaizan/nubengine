      aeruginosa colonization with P. aeruginosa is itself a prognostic factor, but the impact of
      the route of infection on the evolution of the history and future of the infectious patient
      is not established.

      A second factor that may influence the evolution infectious is the degree of genetic
      heterogeneity of the bacterial population. Multiple exposure pathways could also influence
      the genetic diversity.
