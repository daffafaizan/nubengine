      Adolescent Medicine Trials Units (AMTUs) participating in the ATN and to enroll all
      participating patients followed at each site. This approach will allow for the examination of
      the broad spectrum of youth participating in the ATN, including those newly entered into
      care.

      Psychosocial and risk-taking behavioral data will be collected using Audio Compute-Assisted
      Self-Interview (ACASI); biomedical information will be collected through medical chart
      abstraction.
