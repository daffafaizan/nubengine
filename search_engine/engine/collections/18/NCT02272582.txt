      technique. Once harvested, the SV will be divided into segments and these vein segments from
      each patient to be immersed in one of two blinded solutions: SOMVC001 or heparin dosed
      saline. The patients will then be randomized and SVG segment allocations will be defined and
      grafted to the assigned target regions. Imaging, using 64-slice or better MDCT, will be
      completed 4-6 weeks and 3 months post surgery (CABG) procedure.
