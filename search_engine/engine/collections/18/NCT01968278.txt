      sensitive UM-reactive patients) can tolerate BM . Those successful will be randomized to a
      treated BM-OIT group (group A) and an observational control group (group B). In the second
      aim, the fraction of patients in Group A who successfully progress in BM-OIT (tolerate ≥ 360
      mg BM) over a 6 month period will be determined and compared to the fraction of patients in
      Group B who can tolerate 360mg. The results will also be compared to the progression of
      highly sensitive IgE-CMA patients on UM-OIT (Group C, reactive to ≤21 mg of UM ). In aim-3,
      the fraction of BM-OIT patients able to tolerate minimally ≥ 12.5 mg of UM or higher than
      their initially eliciting dose. will be assessed.

      Methods: Severe patients (>4 years) with a positive clinical history, SPT and a positive
      DBPCFC to CMP will be first tested for their ability to tolerate BM. The treatment group will
      undergo three rounds of oral induction, each consisting of 4 days and performed every 4
      weeks. On day #1, the patient will be rapidly desensitized up to their threshold. On days
      2-3, the maximum tolerable dose and interval is determined. Day #4 mimics the home treatment.
      Home treatment will then continue until the next induction. After 6 months of treatment
      patients will be evaluated for reactivity to UM.
