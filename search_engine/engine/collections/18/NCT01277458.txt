    
      HIV Doctors will be identified at each of the London HIV treatment centres and details of the
      project will be communicated to them via email.

      These doctors will then be sent paper copies of the patient information sheets (PIS), patient
      questionnaires and clinician questionnaires.

      Eligible patients (i.e. men having sex with men with HIV from non-white ethnic groups) will
      be identified by their doctors and will be asked to read the PIS and complete the
      questionnaire. This will be a single questionnaire and no follow up for the patient will be
      required. No personal information (e.g. date of birth, hospital number) will be recorded.
      Eligible patients will be all those coming to clinic for HIV care between 1st June and 31st
      of July 2011. Based on estimates from 2009 data held by the HPA, each doctor will on average
      be asked to recruit 30 patients over the two month period.

      The questionnaire will ask questions regarding self description of ethnicity, sexuality,
      parents' ethnicity, country of birth and other countries of residency (if relevant). It is
      anticipated that to read the PIS and complete the questionnaire should take no longer than 15
      minutes.

      The doctor will then return the paper questionnaire (in an addressed envelope supplied) to Dr
      Williams. Dr Williams will then bring together and analyse the data from the questionnaires
      and write up her findings for publication and presentation at a national conference.
