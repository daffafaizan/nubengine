      commonly used agents for conscious sedation in pediatrics. Its widespread use stems for its
      abrupt onset of action and brief duration of sedation. There is limited ketamine
      pharmacokinetic data in children and none to our knowledge in infants and young children who
      will be given an intravenous bolus dose before a surgical procedure that includes
      cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Ketamine is marketed as a racemic mixture (50:50 mixture of S- and R-ketamine enantiomers).

      Ketamine undergoes N-demethylation (CYP3B6, 2C9, and 3A4) to its primary active
      metabolite,norketamine, with minor inactive metabolites, dehydroxynorketamine, generated
      secondary to direct oxidation. Ketamine exhibits a high intrinsic clearance with hepatic
      clearance dependent on hepatic blood flow under normal circumstances. One inherent
      disadvantage associated with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is the potential for
      organ dysfunction post-operatively.

      We propose an open-label controlled study describing the disposition of ketamine in 28
      infants and children who will be undergoing cardiac surgery with (n=16) and without (n=12)
      CPB. We anticipate that cardiopulmonary bypass alters the pharmacokinetics of ketamine.
