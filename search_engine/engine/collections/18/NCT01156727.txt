      program modifications and facilitate future dissemination efforts, 2) assess whether the B2B
      program increases mental health and substance use treatment initiation and treatment
      retention among returning National Guard soldiers, and 3) explore whether the B2B program
      improves mental health symptoms, deceases hazardous alcohol use, and improves soldier
      well-being.

      The study had three components which addressed each of the three specific aims. The first
      component assessed B2B implementation using an embedded mixed methods design. This evaluation
      included real-time assessment and adaptation of the program, as well as retrospective
      evaluation of implementation process, sustainability, and potential for spread. The second
      component addressed the impact of B2B on treatment initiation and retention. Preliminary
      analyses were completed using regression analyses. Pending additional data from the DoD, an
      interrupted time series design to assess Michigan National Guard soldiers' VA and non-VA
      services use in multiple time periods before and after the date of B2B implementation will be
      conducted.. The third study component assessed the impact of B2B on MI ARNG soldiers'
      outcomes using longitudinal survey data and adjusting for baseline mental health status using
      data from the Post Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA).
