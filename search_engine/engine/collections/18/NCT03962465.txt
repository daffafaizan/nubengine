      the relapsed setting, inotuzumab ozogamicin has been shown to achieve complete remission (CR)
      in 81% of patients and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in 78% of patients who
      achieve CR. In the proposed study, escalating doses of inotuzumab ozogamicin will be added to
      a standard pediatric inspired re-induction regimen and administered to younger adults with
      relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. Two re-induction regimens will be tested. The first
      regimen is a 3-drug regimen comprised of prednisone, vincristine, and daunorubicin. The
      second is a 4-drug regimen comprised of prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and
      pegaspargase. Intrathecal methotrexate (IT-methotrexate) and intrathecal cytarabine
      (IT-ARA-C) will be included for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with both the 3-drug
      and 4-drug regimens. We hypothesize that combining inotuzumab ozogamicin with these regimens
      is safe and will improve CR rates, successful transition to allo HCT, and overall survival in
      younger adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.
