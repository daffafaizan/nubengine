      either the Hot Dog resistive heating system or the Bair Hugger forced air heating system.
      Core temperature will be measured using a distal esophagus and mean skin temperature. Warming
      will continue until the subjects' core temperature reaches 37°C. Subsequent temperature will
      be adjusted as clinically necessary. Data will be recorded at 15 minute intervals. Core
      temperature will be first measured after intubation when the esophageal temperature probe is
      inserted. The primary outcome will be the rate of core rewarming over the range of 35°C to
      37°C.
