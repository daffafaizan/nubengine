        -  Determine the relevance of common and uncommon interphase cytogenetic abnormalities
           related to baseline clinical features, complete response (CR), prolonged
           progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with previously
           untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the significance of the absence of IgV_H gene mutational status as related to
           the ability to predict CR, PFS, and OS in these patients.

        -  Correlate IgV_H gene mutational status with CD38 expression, ZAP-70 expression,
           over-expression of Mcl-1, BAK-1, high Mcl-1:Bax ratio, p53 mutations or dysfunction,
           high-risk karyotype abnormalities, and other molecular features associated with poor
           outcome in these patients.

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of over-expression of Mcl-1, BAK-1, high Mcl-1:Bax
           ratio, p53 mutations or dysfunction, ATM mutation, ATM expression, and other factors
           that disrupt apoptosis with respect to CR, prolonged PFS, and OS.

        -  Determine if clonal evolution occurs in these biological markers at partial response or
           disease relapse.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood and bone marrow is collected at baseline, 3 months after completion of induction
      therapy, 2 months after completion of consolidation therapy, 1 year after completion of study
      treatment, and at disease relapse. Samples are analyzed by FISH for interphase cytogenetics,
      PCR for IgV_H mutational status, flow cytometry for surface expression of CD38 cells, western
      blot to assess Mcl-1, Bcl-2, BAK-1, ATM, ZAP-70, and Bar expression, and sequencing for p53
      and ATM function.
