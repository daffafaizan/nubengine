      coronary syndrome (ACS). In the EROSION study, we reported that antithrombotic therapy
      without stenting achieved a reduction in thrombus volume greater than 50% in over 70% of
      patients diagnosed with ACS caused by plaque erosion. This result suggests that the
      conservative approach of anti-thrombotic therapy without stenting may be an option for
      patients diagnosed with ACS caused by plaque erosion, which may be the paradigm shift in
      treatment of ACS patients. However, at present, the only way to make an in vivo diagnosis of
      plaque erosion is intra-coronary optical coherence tomography (OCT). If we can identify
      clinical factors associated with plaque erosion, we may be able to narrow down a
      sub-population of patients with a higher likelihood of plaque erosion. This group of patients
      may be stabilized with pharmacologic therapy and avoid invasive procedures, thereby
      preventing related complications and reducing health care burden. However, specific
      demographic characteristics of the ACS patients with plaque erosion are not known. Our group
      has the world's largest dataset of patients with plaque erosion and several published reports
      on plaque erosion. However, the study population of each study is still small and unbalanced
      to identify the demographic characteristics associated with plaque erosion. Therefore, we
      propose to pool data from a large number of institutions around the world. This will provide
      an opportunity to identify factors associated with plaque erosion.
