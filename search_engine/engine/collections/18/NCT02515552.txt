      Tool) Log program for symptom management and health promotion in FM and evaluate its efficacy
      in a large web-based trial that will closely emulate its planned application in Phase III.
      The SMARTLog program is an interactive web-based self-monitoring and feedback intervention
      that employs proprietary statistical analysis procedures to give the user personally
      optimized guidance on behavioral, lifestyle and coping strategies that yield effective
      symptom reduction for that individual. The program incorporates longitudinal collection and
      analysis of the individual's self-monitoring data followed by delivery of personalized
      feedback derived from those same personal data. The program helps FM sufferers discover and
      monitor linkages between specific personal health-related behaviors and management strategies
      and their symptom levels over time. Feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I by very high
      retention rates, ratings of satisfaction and perceived relevance, evidence of impact of
      utilization on improved well-being over the use period, and qualitative data indicating
      strong interest in continuation with the program.
