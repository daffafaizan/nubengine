      do not, citing a high prevalence of streptococcal carriers and only moderate sensitivity of
      rapid antigen tests [1]. Indeed, to fully understand when rapid antigen tests should be used,
      we need to know the streptococcal carrier rate for adults in the United States. Although
      there is a fair amount of data in this regard for children [2,3], the only study to report
      this value for adults was from over 20 years ago and was from Sweden [4]. That studied
      reported a Group A Streptococcus (GAS) carrier rate of 2.4-3.7% in healthy adults.

      Given how many patients seek medical care for sore throats that may potentially be
      streptococcal pharyngitis, the investigators believe more data about the GAS carrier rate and
      the rate of false positive rapid antigen tests is necessary. Thus, the investigators propose
      a prospective study to evaluate the rate of positive rapid antigen tests in healthy adult
      patients in our community.

      The investigators will perform rapid antigen tests for GAS on healthy adult subjects without
      any symptoms. Consenting patients will fill out a brief data collection form about their
      medical history, and an investigator will perform a rapid antigen throat swab to assess for
      GAS. The results of the rapid antigen test will be recorded, and a logistic regression
      analysis will be performed to determine if certain factors within the subject's medical
      history are predictive of positive rapid strep tests.
