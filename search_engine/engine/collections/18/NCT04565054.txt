      individualization of (neo)-adjuvant decision-making in early breast cancer (EBC) in a
      subtype-specific manner. The first WSG ADAPT umbrella trial (NCT01779206) aimed to establish
      early predictive molecular surrogate markers for response after a short 3-week induction
      treatment.

      The goals of the WSG ADAPT trial program - early response assessment and subtype-specific
      therapy tailoring to those patients who are most likely to benefit - have contributed to the
      positive national and international feedback regarding the ADAPT-concept as a whole.

      The aim of this ADAPTlate phase-III-trial is to gain further knowledge of the group of
      patients at high risk for disease recurrence, who have completed definite locoregional
      therapy (with or without neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy). This patient group is
      currently offered an adjuvant chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy. Yet, the high-risk
      population only receives suboptimum benefit from standard ET and often develops resistance
      against ET at time of recurrence. With ADAPTlate it is planned to investigate if the
      high-risk patient group identified during the screening phase derives additional benefit from
      treatment with abemaciclib in combination with ET compared to ET alone.
