      antagonists have become the standard of care (SOC) in the treatment of patients with Crohn's
      disease. However, many patients fail to fully respond to treatment. This study will evaluate
      the efficacy of 10 week add on treatment with JNJ-64304500, compared to placebo, in patients
      taking SOC anti-TNF or anti-IL12/23 biologics. The study consists of a screening phase (up to
      8 weeks); treatment phase (up to 12 weeks and follow-up phase (up to 16 weeks after the last
      administration of study agent). The total study duration will be up to 34 weeks. Key safety
      assessments include adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry),
      vital signs, monitoring for injection-site and hypersensitivity reactions, and early
      detection of active tuberculosis.
