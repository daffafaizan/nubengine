      enrolled at a routine office visit at the family planning clinics of each institution.
      Enrollment will begin in April 2016 and will stop after 6 months to allow for longitudinal
      follow-up and analyses. For this pilot study, a total of 30 long-acting progestin
      contraceptive initiators with 10 subjects in each method group (DMPA, LNG IUD, ESI) and 5
      age-matched, controls seeking tubal sterilization will be selected for longitudinal STI
      screening and vaginal sampling for microbiome analysis.

      After consent is obtained, trained staff will interview subjects using a brief
      sociodemographic/habits questionnaire that includes questions on age, race, body mass index,
      smoking status, history of sexually transmitted infections and yeast vaginitis, weekly
      frequency of coitus, and number of lifetime sexual partners. Subjects will be instructed to
      self-sample the vagina at three timepoints: 1) at method initiation, 2) 2-3 months later, and
      3) 6 months later. Self-collected vaginal swab specimens will be assayed for Trichomonas
      vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using DNA amplification in the
      clinical lab. Microbiome samples collected at each timepoint will be analyzed and compared to
      the initiation sample to detect longitudinal differences.
