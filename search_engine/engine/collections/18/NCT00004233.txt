        -  Assess the 6-month survival rate in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or
           metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction treated with
           triacetyluridine, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium.

        -  Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 30 minutes
      beginning 1 hour into leucovorin calcium infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Patients
      receive oral triacetyluridine every 8 hours on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, 22-24, 29-31, and 36-38
      beginning 8 hours after completion of each fluorouracil infusion. Courses repeat every 8
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 53 patients will be accrued for this study.
