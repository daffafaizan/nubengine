      that was used: a) Monovision Group (MoG), b) Multifocal Lens Group (MfG), c) Hybrid
      Monovision Group (HmG), and, d) Premium Monovision Group (PmG). Patients who have undergone
      one of the above categories of presbyopia correction surgery were selected to compare the
      effectiveness of these techniques by evaluating the uncorrected near, intermediate and
      distant visual acuity as well as the degree of subjective patient satisfaction, contrast
      sensitivity, dysphotopsia symptoms and spectacle independence .
