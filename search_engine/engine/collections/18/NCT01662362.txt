    
      ABBOTT ESA Chagas testing will be performed at a minimum of two blood donor centers. Testing
      will be performed using the FDA-licensed ESA Chagas assay and will be performed in accordance
      with the ESA Chagas package insert. ABBOTT PRISM Chagas repeatedly reactive blood donor
      specimens identified by U.S. blood donor centers, as part of the routine blood donation
      process, will be tested with the FDA-licensed ESA Chagas. Specimens will also be tested with
      radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) for antibody to T. cruzi, a laboratory developed test,
      and the FDA-licensed ORTHO T. cruzi ELISA. The donor centers will contact the donors and
      request the donor to return to complete a questionnaire and provide a follow-up specimen.

      In addition, a minimum of 300 blood donor specimens with ABBOTT PRISM Chagas nonreactive
      results will also be tested with ESA Chagas. These specimens will be unidentified, leftover
      specimens from routine donor testing and not individually identifiable. Specimens that are
      positive or indeterminate with ESA Chagas will be further tested with RIPA.
