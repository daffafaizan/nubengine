    
      Up to 160 eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio between the 4 cohorts (up to
      40 patients in each cohort). Randomization will be in a double blinding fashion which will be
      kept until Day 4 followed by a single blinding until the end of the study.

      Randomization will be stratified by screening Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
      score (2-6 vs. 7-9).

      Patients will be followed over 28 days for efficacy and continue safety follow up of 12
      months from IP administration.

      Patients participating in this study, regardless if hospitalized or discharged, will be
      followed daily through Day 7 (inclusive, short-term follow-up), then on Days 10 (only for
      patients receiving 2nd dose), Day 14, and Day 28 (medium-term follow-up), , and then at 3
      months, 6 months and 12 months (long-term safety follow-up).
