      synoviocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes from tissue samples obtained from patients
      undergoing surgery of endo or arthroplasty for osteoarthritis (Experimental Group) or
      interventions for other causes such as for example periarticular fracture requiring the
      implantation of a prosthesis (Control Group) Deeper analysis of micro Ribo Nucleic Acid (RNA)
      and Non Coding RNA expressed by the synoviocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes will be
      performed in order to understand their possible involvement in pathways of osteogenic
      differentiation, through suitable experimental in vitro models of co-cultures. In particular,
      investigators will focus on the cross-talk between synoviocytes and osteoblasts, cell
      populations involved in the post-surgical articular microenvironment and on which the
      osteointegration process of the joint prosthesis depends.
