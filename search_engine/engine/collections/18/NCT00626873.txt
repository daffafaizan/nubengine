        -  Determine whether use of a contrast agent improves the images of the ovaries during
           ultrasonography.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients may undergo baseline transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasonography, if not already
      done. Patients then undergo contrast-enhanced transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasonography
      using perflutren lipid microspheres (DefinityÂ®) IV.

      Pathology reports from tissue collected during subsequent oophorectomy is analyzed and
      compared with ultrasonography findings.
