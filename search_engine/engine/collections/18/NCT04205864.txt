      involvement in endometrial cancer. Lymphoceles developed after surgery can cause serious
      morbidity, additional costs and delays in chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In this study,
      conventional pelvic lymphadenectomy will be compared with thrombin gel matrix application
      after pelvic lymphadenectomy. Our goal is to prospectively assess the lymphostatic effect of
      thrombin gel matrix in endometrial cancer patients undergoing pelvic lymph node dissection.
