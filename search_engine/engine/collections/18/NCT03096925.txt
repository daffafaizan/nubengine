      chest pain (NCCP) is often followed by persistent distress and reduced quality of life, and
      societal costs are nearly equal to those of cardiac patients. Research suggests that
      face-to-face CBT is effective, but this has not been implemented as standard treatment. We
      plan to test an easily implementable web-based guided self-help intervention for NCCP
      patients.

      Patients will be recruited at the chest pain unit at SÃ¸rlandet Hospital, Kristiansand, and
      will be recruited after they have finished their cardiac examination.

      The intervention group will receive six web-based sessions, comprising information, exposure
      to physical activity, how worry can excess pain, physical reactions to pain and worry,
      consequences of avoidance, and specific panic treatment.
