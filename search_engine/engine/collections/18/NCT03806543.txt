      vancomycin in intensive care unit of Zhongda Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017.
      Vancomycin dose was based on international consensus and adjusted according to estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. vancomycin
      trough level (VTL) was retained at steady state (after the third dose). Linear regression was
      performed to determine the correlation between factors prior to the first vancomycin dose and
      VTL. Distribution of VTL and percentage of patients achieving the target trough level
      (15-20mg/L) was observed in different renal function.
