      (PrCa) risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a means of offering targeted screening
      for PrCa in men at a genetically higher risk. Initially, 300 men were recruited via
      participating General Practices (GPs). The full study aims to recruit an additional 4700
      participants. Men aged 55-69 years who are likely to be eligible for the study will be
      identified by GPs from medical records. Participants will be contacted via invitation letters
      from GPs and if interested in the study will be asked to sign a consent form and complete a
      questionnaire to confirm eligibility to participate. If eligible, men will then be sent a DNA
      collection saliva kit. DNA from saliva will be analysed with SNP profiling for the known ~170
      clinically relevant SNPs. Men with a genetic risk equivalent to the top 10% of the population
      distribution (approximately 470 men in total from the full study) will be invited for an MRI
      and a transperineal (TP) prostate biopsy under local anaesthetic (LA), plus further
      biological samples. Biopsy results will be correlated with the genetic score. The study also
      aims to determine the incidence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer in men within the top
      10% of the genetic score. Furthermore, the association of MRI appearance and biological
      sample biomarker profile with prostate biopsy result in men at genetically higher prostate
      cancer risk undergoing targeted screening will also be determined.
