    
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all the patients. Patients will be randomized
      to either the LINE re-education or control group for colon preparation at the time of
      appointment for colonoscopy by using consecutively numbered envelopes that will contain the
      treatment assignments, which will be generated by a computer-allocated random digit number,
      in a 1:1 ratio. At least two LINE accounts for all patients or their relatives living
      together will be recorded in case of failure to contact. All patients will be instructed not
      to tell colonoscopists, nurses and investigators before, during and after the procedure about
      their preparation method and when they receive instructions.
