    
      Objectives of OPERA

        1. To research numerous chronic diseases (HIV, HCV, HBV currently and IBD and RA in the
           near future, with others as identified for further consideration) utilizing the OPERA®
           longitudinal database that consists of de-identified EHR data from numerous clinical
           practices in a variety of settings (e.g. solo practitioners, small groups, and
           hospitals). Research will be ongoing and yield numerous individual analyses and reports
           that are authored by epidemiologists, practicing physicians, pharmaco-economists, and
           other researchers and will target scientific conferences and peer-reviewed medical
           journals for dissemination.

        2. To use epidemiological, statistical, and data analysis methods and related research
           findings to deliver a sophisticated healthcare analytics reporting solution (CHORUS™) to
           clinicians.†

        3. To enhance patient population management as well as disease management capabilities of
           the practicing physician.

        4. To provide anonymous, nation-wide benchmarking of quality measures and key performance
           indicators (KPI) for medical clinics.

        5. To enhance patient engagement with their physicians to deliver better health outcomes.

        6. To evaluate whether engagement in care by patients with their physicians results in
           better outcomes for patients with chronic illness.
