    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, single-dose, sequential-cohort trial in
      subjects with renal impairment and healthy subjects. The study consists of two phases: A
      Pretreatment Phase and a Treatment Phase. The two periods in the Pretreatment Phase are: (1)
      the Screening Period (lasting up to 29 days), and (2) the Baseline Period (one day). The
      Treatment Period of the Treatment Phase lasts 8 days. The study will enroll a sufficient
      number of subjects so that 24 to 26 subjects complete the study. This will include six
      subjects with mild renal impairment (Group 1), six subjects with moderate renal impairment
      (Group 2), four to six subjects with severe renal impairment (Group 3) and eight subjects
      with normal renal function (Group 4). Subjects determined to be eligible for the protocol
      will receive a single 24-mg oral dose of E7080 on Day 1. Subjects will be discharged from
      clinical site on Day 8.
