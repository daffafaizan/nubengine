    
      One hundred and twenty patients were randomly assigned into three groups (dopamine
      norepinephrine group, restrictive hydration group and liberal hydration group) undergoing
      open abdominal procedures (radical cystectomy and hemi colectomy). In Restrictive group
      (n=40): Ringer's solution was infused at a rate of 1 ml.kg.h-1 until the basic part of the
      surgery (tumor resection) is completed to be followed by 3 ml.kg.h-1 of Ringer's solution
      until the end of surgery. Noradrenaline infusion (0.07mcg.kg.min-1) was combined with fluids
      until the end of surgery. In Liberal group (n=40): the conventional fluid replacement was
      introduced according to maintenance, deficit for the first 3 hours (hours fasting x body
      weight) and 3rd space loss (estimated between 8-10 ml.kg.h-1).

      The outcome to be assessed was serial measurements of serum lactate intraoperatively and
      immediate postoperatively as an index of tissue perfusion, in addition to blood pressure,
      heart rate and oxygen saturation.
