      I. To evaluate efficacy using objective response rate (ORR) using the Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 in subjects with ovarian cancer, pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and colorectal cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the disease control rate (DCR) within and across cohorts. II. Determine the
      duration of response (DOR). III. Determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS). IV. Further characterize the safety profile of adoptive cell therapy (ACT)
      with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) across multiple tumor types.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish duration of TIL persistence. II. Compare the molecular and immunological
      features of tumors before and after TIL therapy.

      III. Prospectively evaluate the existing immunotherapy response criteria (immune-related
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [irRECIST]) as the best response assessment tool
      for TIL therapy among a diverse group of solid tumors.

      IV. Investigate TIL attributes (CD8 %, CD27 and CD28 expression) and correlation with
      response to therapy.

      V. Assess tumor marker (CA19-9; CA-125) response in patients who produce this tumor marker.

      VI. Assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).

      OUTLINE:

      LYMPHODEPLETION REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on
      days -7 and -6, and fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes MDA-TIL IV over
      45 minutes on day 0. Patients then receive IL-2 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4 for up to 6
      doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 18, at 6, 9, 12, 18,
      and 24 months, and then every 3 months for up to 3 years.
