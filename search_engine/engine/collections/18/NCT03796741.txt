      one of the most common clinical presentations of this disease. The objectives of chronic
      stable angina treatment include the reduction of symptoms, the inhibition or slowing of the
      progression of the disease, the prevention of associated cardiovascular events such as
      myocardial infarction, and the possible improvement of survival.The results of COURAGE Study
      and of meta-analysis of more recent studies demonstrate that patients in optimized medical
      therapy (OMT) (aspirin, beta-blocker and statin in association with an ACE-inhibitor and
      strict control of risk factors). ) the percutaneous coronary revascularization procedure
      (PCI) did not lead to an improvement in the cardiovascular prognosis. These data led the
      groups in charge of drafting the guidelines to recommend OMT as an initial treatment of
      stable angina, reserving the revascularization procedure for those patients with symptoms not
      adequately controlled by medical therapy.

      It is therefore considered appropriate to plan a registry in patients with stable coronary
      artery disease that has the ability to describe in the heterogeneity of Italian cardiological
      centers the current characteristics of these patients, their treatment modalities, adherence
      to the current guidelines both as regards invasive therapy that the optimized medical, the
      use and the total cost of the resources needed to manage this pathology, the clinical course
      one year after entering the register.

      Consecutive patients discharged (after an ordinary or day hospital admission) or managed as
      outpatient at Cardiology department participating in the project with a diagnosis of stable
      coronary artery disease will be included in the register. Enrollment will last 3 months in
      each center, starting with the first enrolled patient, or up to 50 patients enrolled.
