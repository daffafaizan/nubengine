        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel in older patients with metastatic breast,
           lung, or prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the response of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the short-term changes in functional status, in terms of activities of daily
           living, independent activities of daily living, and Karnofsky performance status, in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate the number of comorbid conditions at baseline with declines in functional
           status in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
