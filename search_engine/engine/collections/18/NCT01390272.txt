      trial for patients with pharmaceutically treated hypertension for which systolic BP is not
      controlled (>/=140 mmHg for non-diabetic or >/=130 mmHg for diabetic patients). The primary
      aim will be to compare two treatment arms/strategies in terms of impact on systolic BP
      control: Arm 1 - An intervention arm using titrated disease management in which patients'
      hypertension control, assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months, will be used to decide the
      resource intensity of strategies: 1) Medium/level 1 resource intensity strategy: a registered
      nurse will provide monthly tailored behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring;
      2) High/level 2 resource intensity strategy: a pharmacist will provide monthly tailored
      behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring + pharmacist-directed medication
      management; and 3) Booster (low) resource intensity strategy: a license practice nurse (LPN)
      will provide bi-monthly, non-tailored behavioral support telephone calls to patients whose
      systolic BP comes under control. Arm 2 - A control arm, in which an LPN will provide
      bi-monthly non-tailored behavioral support telephone calls (same procedures as the booster
      (low) resource intensity strategy component of the titrated intervention).
