    
      Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained cardiac arrhythmia in medical
      practice and it is often associated with atrial flutter. In patients with the new pacemaker
      generation EVIA, the home-monitoring technology provides specific and clinical relevant
      notifications for detection of atrial arrhythmias. Combined with holters memories, this can
      help to optimize the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmia (SVA) such as atrial
      fibrillation or flutter.

      This study will compare in the two groups the delay to implement for the first time a
      treatment for the supraventricular arrhythmia (antiarrhythmic drugs and/or an antithrombotic
      treatment).
