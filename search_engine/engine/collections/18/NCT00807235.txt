      exogenous surfactant that also allows for the simultaneous delivery of continuous positive
      airway pressure would permit the delivery of surfactant to the distal airways without
      intubation. This approach could reduce the frequency of severity of the adverse events
      relative to endotracheal intubation and surfactant administration via bolus.
