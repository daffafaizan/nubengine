      morbidity and mortality among seriously ill patients. Data from the literature suggest that
      stress ulcer prevention with effective acid suppressive treatment can reduce bleeding events
      and is thus an important therapy in high-risk patients. Esomeprazole has the potential to
      reduce gastric acidity for prolonged periods of time adequate for both preventing mucosal
      damage and facilitating coagulation. This study is to reveal whether intravenous (iv)
      esomeprazole is effective in preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding and if it is
      tolerated by Chinese seriously ill patients.
