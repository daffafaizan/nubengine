      from the alveolar air sacs into the pulmonary capillaries. This newly oxygenated blood is
      carried to the heart in the pulmonary veins, then passes into the systemic circulation to
      provide oxygen to the tissues.

      Patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have abnormal vascular
      connections between pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins in the lung. Blood flowing through
      PAVMs therefore bypasses the oxygenation sites in the pulmonary capillaries. Low blood oxygen
      levels (hypoxemia) is frequent in PAVM patients but breathlessness (dyspnea) is not. The
      investigators have shown that dyspnea was not a common presenting complaint in a large UK
      series, and that there is little correlation between severity of dyspnea in PAVM patients,
      and blood oxygen levels.

      In this study the investigators will address the question "Do PAVM patients have lower
      exercise tolerance if they have concurrent airflow obstruction?" The primary outcome measure
      will be the total body oxygen consumption in mls/min/kg, at peak exercise (the V[dot]O2 peak
      (also known as "VO2 max")).

      The investigators will address this by first performing standardised cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing, as used in the clinic and our previous study (11/H0803/9), on age and sex matched
      patients with PAVMs. 30 will be recruited with airflow obstruction, and 30 without airflow
      obstruction. Physiological parameters will be compared, to test the null hypothesis that the
      impact of exercise on PAVM patients' cardiopulmonary systems does not differ according to the
      presence or absence of airflow obstruction. Cellular and molecular methods will be used to
      dissect mechanistic pathways.
