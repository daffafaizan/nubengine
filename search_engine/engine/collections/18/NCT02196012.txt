    
      A randomized controlled trial design will be employed to investigate the effectiveness,
      feasibility, and acceptability of a technology-based weight loss pilot intervention for the
      reduction of overweight and obesity in college students. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two conditions: (1) 8-week intervention group, or (2) 8-week attention
      control group. Both conditions include 8 weekly lessons over 8 weeks. Undergraduate students
      (n=100) age 18-22 years who are overweight or obese (BMI â‰¥ 25 kg/m2) will be recruited from
      the University of Tennessee Knoxville. Measurements will be taken at baseline and 8 weeks.
      Since the study is a technology-based intervention, research staff will collect height and
      weight measures for BMI through a novel approach, utilizing Skype video conferencing.
