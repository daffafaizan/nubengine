      otorhinolaryngology, gynaecology, urology, plastic surgery, pain therapy), but not in
      cardiology.

      In the cardio-vascular field, only one pilot study on man has shown its utility in the
      prevention of atrial fibrillation by blocking the triggering through the sympathic and
      parasympathic systems. The investigators need to assess its potential benefits to prevent
      postoperative atrial tachyarrhythmia in a randomised multicentre study, with an expected
      impact of approximately 30,000 patients per years in France undergoing these types of cardiac
      surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that botulinum toxin injection may substantially reduce
      postoperative AF during the first 3 weeks after cardiac surgery without any serious adverse
      events. By the suppression of ganglionic plexi (GP) activity in the epicardial fat pads, mild
      term antiarrhythmic effects can be achieved with fewer antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulant
      treatment.
