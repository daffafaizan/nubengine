      compare the incidence rate of RA-related myocardial injury indicated by change in levels of
      myocardial injury biomarkers (such as TNI and CK-MB) between low temperature rota-flush
      solution group and room temperature rota-flush solution group. Based on previous study, the
      incidence rate of RA-related myocardial injury is 68.0 % in patients with severe calcified
      lesions undergoing PCI. And in our study the expected incidence rate of RA-related myocardial
      injury is up to 34.0 % in patients with severe calcified lesions undergoing PCI after
      treatment with low temperature rota-flush solution. Moreover, the investigators estimated 10%
      loss follow-up of these patients in each arm. As a result, a total of 110 patients with heavy
      calcified lesions were required, and with 55 patients per group as a ratio of 1:1
      randomization.
