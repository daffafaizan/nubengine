      would allow systematization of surgery and even improved safety of the procedure. The
      development of this new surgical technique must now face certain obstacles, in particular (i)
      financial considering the extra cost generated by the use of the laser and (ii) technique due
      to the need to re-learn certain gestures and certain variations related to the laser
      procedure and more specifically the instability of the pupillary mydriasis (dilatation)
      during the actual surgery. The use of a systematic preoperative pharmacological mydriasis
      protocol should allow maximum intraoperative mydriasis to be maintained, allowing
      satisfactory surgery throughout the procedure. Several drugs or medical devices are now
      indicated in cataract surgery, but their effectiveness has not been specifically evaluated
      for the laser technique. This study could thus make it possible to validate or not a protocol
      of mydriasis that could make consensus in the future for the practice of FLACS.
