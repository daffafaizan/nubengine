      associated desaturations

      20 OSA subjects will be recruited and studied with polysomnography and a head band allowing
      to emit short sound stimulations during sleep. the study will take nplace at the Center for
      investigation and research in sleep (CIRS)

      The magnitude of oxygen desaturations following apnea with and without sound stimulations
      will be compared. The effects of different types of sound stimulations on the magnitude of
      cortical and autonomic reactions will also be studied as well as the patients' subjective
      perception of the sounds.
