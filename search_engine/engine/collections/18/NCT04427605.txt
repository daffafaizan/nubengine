      as an anesthetic and analgesic agent for procedural sedation. The use of ketamine as a
      prolonged infusion was first described in 1990 and a prolonged infusion of ketamine has been
      described as a successful strategy for analgesia and sedation in patients with hemodynamic
      instability, in patients who were mechanically ventilated and poorly responsive to
      conventional drugs. An other indication for ketamine infusion is the presence of
      bronchospasm, due to its action in promoting bronchodilatation. However, existing studies on
      ketamine for prolonged sedation are mainly retrospective and include small sample size,
      suggesting that this topic needs to be further investigated. The aim of this observational
      single center study is to describe the use of ketamine used as adjuvant to conventional
      analgesic and sedative strategy (opioid and benzodiazepine in continuous infusion) as
      prolonged infusion (i.e. â‰¥ 12 hr) in pediatric patients. The investigators will evaluate
      ketamine indications, dosages, infusion duration, adoption of boluses, modality of weaning.
      Concomitant analgesic and sedative management and monitoring of level of sedation (using a
      validated scale) are considered measures of efficacy. Sparing of other bronchospasm drugs
      sedative dosage are considered measures of efficacy if ketamine is used in patients with
      obstructive respiratory diseases. Presence of adverse effects (including withdrawal syndrome
      symptoms and delirium) during infusione or 48 hours after weaning are considered measures of
      safety. Data were collected using a standardized data sheet. The study lasted 18 months to
      reach a numerosity of 55 patients. All the requested institutional approvals were collected
      before starting the data collection.
