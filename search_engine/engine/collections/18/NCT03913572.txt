        1. Conduct a retrospective review of health information data from patients who have
           undergone surgery with a colorectal surgery attending at the University of California
           San Diego, including surgical treatment of perianal fistulas or other chronic perianal
           diseases, with or without injection of lipoaspirate containing adipose-derived stem
           cells. Patient data from December 2013 to April 1, 2018, will be obtained, with
           parameters including date of birth, sex, date of surgery, medical history, surgical
           history, laboratory values, perioperative data such as blood loss, length of surgery,
           operative complications, readmissions, and long-term complications and status of
           disease.

        2. Conduct an observational study comparing outcomes of patients that plan to undergo
           treatment of perianal disease using ASCs compared to those that do not use ASCs.
           Patients identified as candidates for the procedure by the colorectal surgeons and are
           planning to undergo the procedure will give informed consent and be recruited into the
           study. Participants will undergo isolation of ASCs using the REVOLVE â„¢ System and
           injection of ASCs into perianal wounds. Clinical data will be analyzed to determine
           efficacy of the procedure as a means of treating perianal disease.

        3. Use the above data to clinically characterize patients that undergo this surgical
           procedure and what patient characteristics may determine outcomes. Comparing follow-up
           data and disease status will determine efficacy of treatment with adipose-derived stem
           cells compared to similar treatments without the use of stem cells.
