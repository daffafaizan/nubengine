      I. Determine the feasibility and safety of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and chemotherapy in
      patients with HER2-overexpressing (2+ level of expression) metastatic osteosarcoma.

      II. Determine the response rate and 3-year event-free survival of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      III. Determine the cardiac toxicity and late effects of this regimen in these patients.

      IV. Determine the response rate and 3-year event-free survival of poor-risk patients with
      HER2-negative tumors treated with chemotherapy without the addition of trastuzumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor HER2 status
      (positive vs negative).

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising doxorubicin IV over 20 minutes followed by
      cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 of weeks 1 and 6, and methotrexate IV over 4 hours
      on day 1 of weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV or orally
      every 6 hours beginning 24 hours after each methotrexate dose and continuing for at least 10
      doses until methotrexate levels sufficiently decrease. Within 24-36 hours after completion of
      induction therapy, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) daily until blood counts recover.

      Patients undergo resection of any remaining primary tumor and/or metastatic lesions during
      week 11. Patients who are unable to undergo resection receive radiotherapy between weeks 11
      and 17.

      Patients receive post-induction therapy comprising doxorubicin IV over 20 minutes on days 1
      and 2 of weeks 17, 25, and 29; cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 of weeks 17 and 25;
      methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day 1 of weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 33; etoposide IV over
      1 hour on days 1-5 of weeks 13, 21, and 34; and ifosfamide IV over 4 hours on days 1-5 of
      weeks 13, 21, 29, and 34. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium and G-CSF as in induction
      therapy. Patients whose tumors are found to over express HER2 (2+ level of expression) also
      receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once a week for a total of 34 weeks in addition to
      the chemotherapy regimen.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 patients per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 2.5 years.
