      I. Characterize the effects of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy (nivolumab
      or pembrolizumab) on measures of bone health, including bone density and bone turnover
      markers, in a prospectively recruited cohort of 40 adult patients (>= 40 years) with melanoma
      diagnoses seen at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

      II. Identify associations of baseline demographic, clinical, and general bone loss risk
      factors (e.g., age, corticosteroid use) and tumor characteristics with bone loss in the same
      cohort.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples after starting immunotherapy and then at 6 and
      12 months. Patients also undergo DXA scan over 5-10 minutes after starting immunotherapy and
      at 12 months.
