      dyslipoproteinemia, a key feature of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) that independently
      predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertriglyceridemia, the most consistent lipid
      disorder in subjects with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, is chiefly a consequence of
      overproduction and delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). Although the
      precise mechanisms involved are incompletely understood, experimental and clinical evidence
      suggests that elevated apolipoprotein (apo) C-III may play a crucial role in the
      dysregulation of TRL metabolism. investigating the effects of these agents on VLDL-apoC-III
      kinetics. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of two lipid-regulating agents,
      atorvastatin and fenofibrate on VLDL-apoC-III transport. We hypothesized that atorvastatin
      and fenofibrate would have similar effects on apoC-III transport by decreasing the production
      and increasing the catabolism of VLDL-apoC-III.
