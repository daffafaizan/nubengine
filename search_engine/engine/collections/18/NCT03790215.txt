      of estrogen to local tissue is one of the causes of polyp formation.Studies suggested that
      the progesterone can accelerate the regression rate of endometrial polyps due to its
      antiestrogenic effects.Based on this, investigators intended to observe the therapeutic
      effect of dydrogesterone on endometrial polyps and provide a reference for clinical
      treatment.
