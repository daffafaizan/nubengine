      movements automatically. The underlying neural correlates of automatic movement have been
      investigated, but are not fully understood. In the present study, in order to investigate the
      brain activities contributing to the phenomenon, we use a specially designed dual task
      paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Forty healthy adult
      subjects are asked to perform motor tasks (squeezing of hand or sequential movement of
      fingers) while listening to an auditory distraction task, or to execute two different motor
      tasks simultaneously. fMRI is obtained during their performance of these tasks. By analyzing
      fMRI results, we will explore the brain regions especially devoted to the automatic
      movements.
