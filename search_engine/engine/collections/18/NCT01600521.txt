      particular, patients were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups:
      Paeoniflorin (PAE) + Cervus and Cucumis polypeptide injection (CCPI), Methotrexate (MTX) +
      Leflunomide (LEF), and MTX + LEF + CCPI. The therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated by the 7
      core set measures of American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Adverse effects, their severity,
      and the evaluators' professional judgments of relationships between the adverse effects and
      the drugs were documented.
