      of patients needed to be screened for a clinical trial, based on patient eligibility
      percentages applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2) for those meeting these
      criteria, follow changes in and compliance with medical therapy over two years, and 3) in a
      limited subset of eligible patients, perform MRI at baseline and after 2 years to measure the
      change in aortic area over time.
