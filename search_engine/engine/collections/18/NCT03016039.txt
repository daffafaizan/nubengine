      reproductive system. Although PID is a well known pathophysiology the diagnosis method I not
      well established and its true magnitude is unknown. Many women report that they have been
      treated for PID when they did not suffer from it and vice versa. Hence the main way to
      diagnose remains clinical and currently there is no well-established biochemical marker. In
      endometritis and wound infection the cause may be known but the pathogens involved in the
      disease formation vary as for this broad spectrum antibiotic is needed.

      Aims: To use curcumin supplementation as an additive treatment to induce clinical,
      biochemical response and remission in patients with suspected PID, Tubo ovarian abcess,
      Endometritis, wound infection.

      Hypothesis: An addition of oral curcumin to highly suspected PID/Endometritis/Wound infection
      patients may augment clinical and biochemical response and accelerates the improvements of
      the sign symptoms and reported outcomes of those diseases.

      Rational: Curcumin treatment has been shown to safe and efficient in inflammatory states such
      as in mild-moderate Ulcerative colitis (UC), obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus when used
      as an add-on to conventional treatment.

      In the gynecology and especially in the PID/Tubo ovarian abcess diseases the use of Curcumin
      as a supplement has never been studied.

      In the future it is necessary to study the use of curcumin in different gynecological
      diseases (e.g Endometriosis/Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and also in gynecology oncology) in
      which inflammatory and immune response are involve in the disease.
