      Between February and the end of March, out of 78 patients, 71% of the patients had a stroke.
      Therefore, my choice of topic for the Master's thesis fell on balance training of patients
      after a stroke. The duration of the study is based on the timetable for the Master's thesis.
      Initially, 20 stroke patients will be recruited. When the number is reached, the study is
      completed to begin descriptive statistics and analyze potential BIAS.

      Deficits in the vestibular, visual, motor, and / or somatosensory systems lead to falls in
      the first 6 months after the stroke. This affects approximately 46% of patients. But also
      cognitive processes, such as attention and concentration. Therefore, the treatment must be
      adapted to the respective strategy of the patient. If the patient increasingly uses the
      visual system, the therapy has to work a lot with the eyes closed. In turn, if he uses more
      of the sensorimotor system is increasingly trained with unstable documents. After this
      system, the balance program was set up. It is the same for the intervention and control group
      to make a difference between individual and group training.
