      of the NCCN guidelines, for the non-small cell lung cancer patient population. The decision
      support tool is offered by a trained coordinator to the patient and then utilized during an
      initial consultation. Patients complete forms before and after the visit indicating their
      level of decisional conflict, satisfaction, and satisfaction with decision. Pre-determined
      indices of quality of care were also collected by the study team.
