    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational, and sample procurement study of adult
      subjects presenting to an Emergency Department (ED) in whom ACS is in the differential
      diagnosis. Subjects must present to one of the participating EDs within 6 hours or less from
      the time of symptom onset, and must have experienced at least 30 minutes of chest discomfort.
      Those ED patients with possible ACS who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      approached for study enrollment by trained research personnel.

      The patient's diagnostic work-up and treatment will continue per the standards of the
      treating institution. As indicated by their clinical presentation, all subjects in the study
      will have objective cardiac testing for evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) during or
      in close proximity to the index ED visit or hospital admission. For this study, objective
      cardiac testing will consist of one of the following tests: exercise treadmill, coronary
      angiography, myocardial stress imaging, stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sestamibi
      scan, or dobutamine echocardiogram. Cardiac events and procedures, such as
      angioplasty-stenting and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), will be recorded during the
      index ED visit, hospitalization and post-hospital follow-up period. Subjects will have a
      30-day and 6-month follow-up contact by phone to collect this information on cardiac events,
      procedures, and survival.
