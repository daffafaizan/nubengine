    
      The primary endpoint is to compare the PFS (progress-free survival ) of etoposide plus
      carboplatin with paclitaxel combined with carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced
      pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.

      In addition, gene spectrum detection and Mini-PDX are applied for validation of
      pharmacodynamic.

      Results of clinical trials and pharmacodynamic test will be analyzed to provide evidence for
      the precise treatment for LCNEC.
