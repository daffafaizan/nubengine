      that have failed conventional peripheral venous access methods or in patients that are
      expected to be a "difficult stick", is not established. Conflicting results have been
      reported in the pediatric literature regarding the subjective benefit of NIR light devices in
      patients with perceived difficult peripheral intravenous access. In addition, knowledge about
      the efficacy of these devices in the adult inpatient setting is mostly unknown. The aim of
      the present study is to address these knowledge gaps.
