      The investigators want to measure the influence of personal history of patients, causal
      disease pre-existing, conditions of graft's realization, structure of patient's social
      environment (family or institutional); and wish to identify which of those elements can be
      protective or vulnerability factors with a view to allow adequate support (especially for
      patients who had multiple poor prognostic factors)

      The investigators will study pre-transplant psychological defense mechanisms of the subjects
      using the Bond Defense Style Questionnaire and structure of personality using the SCID II
      personality scale. They will evaluate post-transplant patient outcomes on clinical and social
      developments with DSQ 88 and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ 28) to six months, twelve
      months and five years after transplantation. Meanwhile, they will address each time you visit
      the data on consumption, misuse and alcohol dependence using the AUDIT questionnaire (Alcohol
      Use Disorders Identification Test).

      The hypothesis is that the defense mechanisms, their variations and personality of the
      patients are both vulnerability factors as protective factors in different phases of the
      graft. Identification should allow to optimize care and improve overall health. Results of
      this research could make it possible to determine the factors used in liaison psychiatry in
      the long term to ensure an adequate medical and psychiatric support to transplant patients.
