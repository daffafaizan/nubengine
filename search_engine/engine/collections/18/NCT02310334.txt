      with young fit adults in response to exercise; and demonstrate that automated pace guidance
      generated from real-time thermal-work strain monitoring and an optimized pacing policy will
      allow less stressful completion of a timed (60 minute) treadmill exercise of 5 miles. Each
      participant will undergo two treatments of first UNGUIDED followed by GUIDED exercise. The
      two exercise sessions will be conducted as part of a ~24 hour stay in an indirect calorimetry
      chamber.
