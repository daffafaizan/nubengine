      the effects of pranayama (ancient yoga breathing techniques) on fatigue and quality of life
      among 30 patients undergoing chemotherapy, on an every 2, 3, or 4 week schedule, with a
      fatigue score of at least 4 on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (most). Patients will be randomized
      to either pranayama or wait-list control. The pranayama group will learn and practice 3
      breathing techniques on a daily basis. The study period will occur during 2 consecutive
      cycles of chemotherapy (cycle A and Cycle B), and the wait-list control patients will
      crossover to the treatment arm at the beginning of his/her Cycle B. Fatigue will be measured
      using the revised Piper Fatigue Scale along with quality of life measures. These study
      measures will be conducted at baseline, at the end of cycle A, and at the end of cycle B. We
      hypothesize that pranayama will improve clinical symptoms of fatigue and quality of life
      among patients undergoing chemotherapy.
