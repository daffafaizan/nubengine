      Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 28 days,
      eligible subjects will receive treatment beginning on Day 1 of each 2-week dosing cycle for
      aveluumab. Treatment with aveluumab will continue until documented disease progression,
      unacceptable adverse event(s),intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of
      treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent,
      pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, After
      the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring
      (serious adverse events and events of clinical interest will be collected for 90 days after
      the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new
      anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier). Subjects who discontinue after 24months of therapy
      for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability or who discontinue after
      attaining a CR may be eligible for up to one year of retreatment after they have experienced
      radiographic disease progression. Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease
      progression will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until disease progression,
      initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.
      All subjects will be followed by telephone for overall survival until death, withdrawal of
      consent, or the end of the study.
