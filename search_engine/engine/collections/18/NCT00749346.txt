      stage of the trial. After all 14 patients have received 3 courses of Alimta (9 weeks of
      NovoTTF-100L treatment), these patients will be analyzed for toxicity. If the incidence of
      device related serious adverse events is < 20%, the trial will continue to the second stage
      where 42 patients will be assessed for safety and efficacy as part of a phase II study
      (including the first 14 patients in the phase I study).

      Efficacy will be assessed based on local disease control in the lungs and liver, time to
      systemic disease progression, and overall survival. Patients will be followed for at least 6
      months after the last course of NovoTTF-100L is applied to assess survival.
