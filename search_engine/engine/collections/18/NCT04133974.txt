      and relapse in heroin addicts using the methadone (a commonly used Âµ-opioid receptor agonist)
      instead of heroin as the trigger to reactivate drug memories. The subjects were randomly
      divided into 3 groups, in which they received methadone alone or extinction sessions 10 min
      or 6 hours after methadone administration. The extinction sessions were given 3 times per
      week for 4 weeks, each lasted for 30 min. During the extinction procedure, the subjects were
      exposed to images, heroin paraphernalia and mimic heroin. Subjective craving, morphine urine
      test and physiological responses were recorded monthly for 4 months.
