           hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Type 1 diabetes is associated with higher
           frequency neuropsychological consequences as mood disorders and structural changes in
           brain, particularly in hippocampus.

        -  Purpose: To describe the association between HPA axis activity and anxiety and
           depression scores in 6-12 year's old diabetes children.

        -  Abstract: The general objective is to precise the role of HPA axis activity in
           neuropsychological consequences of type 1 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that
           hyperactivity of HPA axis is associated with higher scores of depression and changes in
           hippocampal volume and mean diffusion.
