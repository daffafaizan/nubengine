      hormonal disorder or due to reduce energy expenditure with increasing energy uptake [1].
      Nowadays, obesity considered the second cause of deaths after smoking all over the world [2].

      Severe obesity increase the incidence of many chronic disease such as (diabetes mellitus,
      hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and others) [3]. This leads to substantial morbidity,
      early mortality [4], impaired quality of life [5] and excess healthcare expenditures [6].

      Laparoscopic bariatric surgery is the most recommended and effective long-term treatment for
      morbid obesity (which body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2) and obesity-related complication [7].

      Postoperative pain management after laparoscopic sleeve still considers a major challenge. As
      many of the patients express moderate-to-severe pain in postoperative period [8]. Causes of
      postoperative pain include inflammation of the peritoneum, intra-abdominal cavity stretch and
      irritation of diaphragm by carbon-dioxide (CO2) remains in the abdominal cavity [9].

      Multimodal analgesia regimens such as parenteral opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs and intraperitoneal instillation of different drugs such as local anesthetic drugs
      alone or with adjuvants like; opioid and α2 agonists' drugs such as clonidine and
      dexmedetomidine have been tried to reduce overall pain and postoperative complications of
      patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries [8, 9].

      Bupivacaine is the most commonly used local anesthetic drug, its intraperitoneal instillation
      has become a popular practice for pain relief after laparoscopic surgery as it causes
      blockade of free afferent nerve endings in peritoneum [10].

      Dexmedetomidine, the pharmacologically active d-isomer of medetomidine, it is a potent and
      highly selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist with sympatholytic, sedative, amnestic,
      anxiolytic, neuroprotective and analgesic properties [11].

      Ketamine is an immunomodulatory agent and anti-inflammatory drug and it has a noncompetitive
      antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor that blocks nociceptive input and
      reduce hyperalgesia [12].
