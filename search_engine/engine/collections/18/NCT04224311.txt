      MenACWY-D in plateletpheresis donors at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). Potential
      participants will be divided into three groups according to the number of plateletpheresis
      within 365 days of enrollment (including the day of enrollment): 1-2 sessions group
      (considered as the control group), 3-19 sessions group, 20-24 sessions group and randomly
      sampled from in allocation proportions of 0.45, 0.10, and 0.45, respectively; justification
      for this approach is provided in the Statistical Analysis section. MenACWY-D vaccine will be
      administered to each patient. Pre- and post-vaccination blood will be collected to assess
      immunogenicity, likely using serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) against Neisseria meningitidis
      for each serogroup. Immunogenicity will be primarily evaluated by seroresponse such as a
      fourfold increase of SBA titers between pre- and post-vaccination.
