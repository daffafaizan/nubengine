      in both the intervention and control group receive ordinary education and regimen adjustment
      as indicated based on CGM results. For participants in the intervention group, they will also
      receive CGM counseling immediately on the day of CGM sensor removal. For participants in the
      control group, they will receive CGM counseling on the day of routine 3 months outpatient
      visit.

      Qualitative data are collected through in-depth interview: User expectation, acceptability
      and satisfaction of CGM are also explored during in-depth interview with a semi-structured
      questionnaire.

      Quantitative data were collected through validated questionnaires, including evaluation of
      depression by a short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised
      (CES-D-R), emotional stress by Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID), self efficacy by
      Stanford Self-Efficacy for Diabetes (SES), at pretest and 3 months after CGM counseling.
