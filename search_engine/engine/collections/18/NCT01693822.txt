    
      A-PREDICT is a single arm, single agent, open label, multicentre, phase II study of axitinib
      in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma of predominant clear cell histology and
      unsuitable for debulking nephrectomy (as judged by the treating clinician). Patients who have
      provided consent and have satisfied the eligibility criteria will be registered into the
      trial.

      The starting dose of axitinib will be 5 mg twice daily by mouth, escalating to a maximum of
      10mg twice daily by mouth according to tolerability of treatment, for as long as patients are
      deriving clinical benefit. Treatment will be paused for one week prior to percutaneous biopsy
      of the primary on day 1 week 9. Disease progression will be evaluated according to RECIST
      v1.1 criteria 8 weeks after commencing treatment, at 8 weekly intervals to 6 months and 3
      monthly thereafter. Blood and tumour tissue samples will be taken prior to and during therapy
      to evaluate biomarkers of treatment response. Nephrectomy will be carried out on any patient
      who becomes suitable in the opinion of the treating clinician during the course of the trial.
      Where possible, tissue samples will be taken from resected specimens. Response to axitinib in
      marker lesions will be correlated with changes in biomarkers.
