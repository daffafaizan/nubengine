      assays q 8hr for the first day, and q 12h for the next 2 days. If clinically not indicated,
      the blood sample can be cancelled at any time, as in the case of a patient with an initial
      suspicion of acute coronary syndrome in which the final diagnosis is something else. Only
      patients with a definitive myocardial infarction will be analyzed.

      Subgroup analyses includes ST-elevation MI, Non ST-elevation MI, revascularization vs no
      revascularization, procedural myocardial infarction.

      Another analysis conducted is the correlation between the values of troponin and infarct size
      by echocardiography (in patients who have an echocardiography 2-7 days post AND 2-6 months
      post myocardial infarction)
