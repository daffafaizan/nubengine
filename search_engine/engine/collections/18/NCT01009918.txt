      Primary

        -  The primary objective of this study is to determine if administration of lisinopril or
           Coreg CR®, compared to placebo, will reduce the incidence of trastuzumab-induced
           cardiotoxicity, as measured by LVEF, in patients receiving adjuvant, or
           neoadjuvant,therapy for HER2 positive breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether subjects randomized to active agent have fewer interruptions in
           trastuzumab therapy due to cardiomyopathy.

        -  To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent in anthracycline and
           nonanthracycline patient cohorts

        -  To compare changes in HRQL among the treatment groups during the study intervention

        -  To evaluate the long term effects on the prevention of cardiomyopathy and impact on HRQL
           for either or both study agents

        -  To compare the predictive value of troponin I and BNP in the identification of
           trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to chemotherapy
      comprising an anthracycline (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral lisinopril once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral Coreg CR® once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo once daily.

      In all arms, study treatment begins with the first dose of trastuzumab and continues for up
      to 52 weeks or until the end of trastuzumab therapy.

      Quality of life is assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at baseline, at 52 weeks
      (or at the end of trastuzumab therapy), and at 18 and 24 months (or 6 and 12 months after the
      completion of trastuzumab).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
