      inflammatory reaction to infection leads to a life-threatening of organ dysfunctions. Sepsis
      and septic shock are major causes of death in intensive care units worldwide.

      The clinical picture of septic shock, the most severe form of sepsis, leads to uncontrolled
      production and release of a large number of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators, the
      "cytokine storm". Septic shock is accompanied by a massive increase in mortality of up to
      60%.

      This high mortality rate is due to a lack of current treatment options. The early recognition
      of the disease and its immediate treatment are decisive for successful therapy and the
      survival of those affected. The most important therapeutic steps, apart from focus control by
      antibiotics and surgical intervention, are the stabilization of the affected organ systems,
      in particular the circulatory system and the respiratory system. As an extracorporeal and
      non-specific procedure for the interruption of the cytokine storm, hemoadsorption by means of
      CytoSorb adsorbers may be an intervention, which has already demonstrated its basic
      effectiveness in the treatment of septic and cardiosurgical patients.
