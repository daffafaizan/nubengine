      study designed to evaluate the inhibition of radiographic progression by adalimumab compared
      with placebo in adult Japanese patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had not been
      previously treated with methotrexate (MTX). Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to
      receive either a subcutaneous injection of adalimumab 40 mg or matching placebo every other
      week (eow) during the 26-week double-blind phase. All participants also received 6 mg to 8 mg
      MTX weekly as basal treatment for their disease. Participants who experienced an increase in
      disease activity (more than 20% increase in tender joint count and swollen joint count) at
      Week 12, 16, or 20 compared with Baseline after having increased MTX dose to 8 mg per week
      for at least 4 weeks were discontinued from the double-blind phase and were eligible to
      receive open-label adalimumab 40 mg eow as rescue treatment. Participants who completed the
      26 weeks of treatment (either double-blind study drug [adalimumab or placebo] treatment or
      open-label adalimumab treatment) were eligible to enter the 26-week open-label phase in which
      they received adalimumab 40 mg eow. Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at
      Baseline and at designated study visits.
