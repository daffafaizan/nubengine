      foresaw the comparison within subjects of the investigational product versus investigational
      product with Lidocaine 0.3% (half face method); assignation of right or left face side to the
      two injective treatments was choose by the Investigator according to a previously defined
      randomisation list.

      Primary end point of the study was to evaluate the filling and bio-revitalizing activity on
      nasolabial folds of the product AliaxinÂ® EV Essential Volume, in women aged 40-65 years.

      It was also aim of this study to show if the addition of Lidocaine 0.3% to the
      investigational product (extemporaneous mixture) could have reduced the discomfort/pain
      sensation perceived by the subject during the injection procedure, without altering the
      aesthetic performance.
