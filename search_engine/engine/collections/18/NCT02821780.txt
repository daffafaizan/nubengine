      to an imbalance of blood supply upon demand. This results in a progressive chronic
      hypoperfusion with detrimental outcomes for the affected organ system and for the patient.
      Recent advances in genetic evaluation have identified several genetic variants causing
      cerebrovascular small vessel diseases. These diseases have common clinical presentation
      including recurrent strokes, progressive white matter degeneration, and debilitating
      dementia. The link between these pathologies is defects in the tunica media of arteries,
      which is composed mainly of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs).

      CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and
      leukoencephalopathy) is caused by mutations in NOTCH3. The disease is of slow onset, with
      initial clinical manifestations in the third and fourth decade of life, but progressive and
      fatal. Predominant clinical features include migraine with aura (atypical or isolated),
      strokes, memory loss, and multiple psychiatric symptoms including dementia. Currently,
      CADASIL is considered the most common hereditary subcortical vascular dementia, however,
      treatments are palliative, and there is little prospect of future therapies to directly
      address causation and block progression. We propose to characterize the etiology and natural
      history of CADASIL subjects through comprehensive clinical and molecular characterizations.
      Subjects will be seen at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) once a year for a period of
      2 years (total of 3 visits).
