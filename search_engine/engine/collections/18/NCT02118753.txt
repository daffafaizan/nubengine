      myocardial infarct size. This cardioprotective effect might explain, at least in part, the
      beneficial effect on mortality of eplerenone in patients with heart failure. Previous animal
      studies suggest that this cardioprotective effect is mediated by an increased formation of
      the endogenous nucleoside adenosine.

      Our objective is to study for the first time in human myocardial tissue ex vivo wether
      eplerenone limits ischemia reperfusion injury and whether this is mediated by adenosine
      receptor stimulation.

      From patients undergoing open heart surgery, the right atrial appendage will be harvested by
      the cardiothoracic surgeon. In the laboratory, two trabeculae will be dissected and suspended
      in an organ bath. Contraction will be induced by electrical field stimulation. Recovery of
      contractile force after a period of simulated ischemia and reperfusion will be used as an
      endpoint of ischemia-reperfusion injury.

      The trabeculae of each patient will be randomized to pretreatment with A)ischemic
      preconditioning (IP) of no IP as a positive control experiment; B)eplerenone or vehicle;
      C)eplerenone with or without caffeine; and D)aldosterone with and without eplerenone.
