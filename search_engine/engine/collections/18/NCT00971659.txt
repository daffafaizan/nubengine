      and both a GLP-1 analog (exenatide) and a DPP-4-inhibitor (sitagliptin), it could be a
      promising approach to combine insulin glargine with either exenatide or sitagliptin for
      optimum control of fasting and postprandial blood glucose values. Thus, in the present study
      the influence of either exenatide or sitagliptin as a 4-week adjunctive therapy to a basal
      insulin (insulin glargine) was investigated versus insulin glargine alone as active
      comparator in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Preexisting metformin was continued,
      sulfonylureas, if any, were stopped. In particular, the effects on postprandial blood glucose
      excursion following ingestion of a standard breakfast, assessed after 4 weeks of treatment,
      the effects on mean daily blood glucose, on self-measured 7-point profiles, the percentage of
      subjects reaching ADA treatment goals (HbA1c < 7.0%) at the end of treatment, on fasting
      lipid profile, on HOMA index, weight, hypoglycemic episodes and general safety were assessed.
      The study consisted of a screening visit, a 4-8 week (depending on pre-treatment) run-in
      period, a 4-week treatment period, and a follow-up visit. There were weekly visits at the
      site and twice weekly telephone contacts.
