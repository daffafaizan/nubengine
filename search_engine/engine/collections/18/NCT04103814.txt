      inflammation and functional impairment. While operative interventions exist, nonoperative
      modalities are the mainstay of treatment for most patients. Options include shoe wear
      modification, manual and physical therapy, intraarticular injection of corticosteroids or
      sodium hyaluronate, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and foot orthoses. Oral
      anti-inflammatories are the most effective non-operative strategy, but unfortunately, are
      associated with major adverse side effects and are contraindicated in many patients. Topical
      cannabidiol (CBD) cream has been shown to decrease inflammation, swelling, and pain response
      in arthritis models with minimal side effects, although the intervention has never been
      studied in hallux valgus or hallux rigidus. This prospective randomized trial will compare
      topical CBD cream vs placebo cream for the treatment of pain secondary to hallux valgus and
      hallux rigidus. The primary outcome of interest in the change in pre and post-treatment
      Visual Analog System (VAS) pain scores. VAS pain score is a measurement on a continuum of
      values of pain intensity. The purpose of this study is to determine if topical CBD cream is
      an effective treatment for pain secondary to hallux rigidus and hallux valgus.
