      Astellas Product Safety Management staff. Data from the pregnant subjects will be collected
      at 4 to 5 months of pregnancy by telephone interviews with the Registry. The Registry will
      also contact the subject at 2 months and 12 months after the estimated delivery date (EDD)
      for post-natal & pediatric follow-up. The Registry will confirm the information collected
      from the subject with the HCP by telephone interviews with the Registry, forms mailed/faxed
      to the Registry, electronic forms/queries sent to the Registry, or a combination of these
      methods. If a live birth is reported, the infant's HCP will be contacted for the Pediatric
      Follow-Up at 2 months and 12 months of age. If a birth defect is reported, targeted follow-up
      will be conducted.
