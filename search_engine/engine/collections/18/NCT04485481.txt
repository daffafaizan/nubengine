      It is expected that there will be up to 6 cohorts of 8 participants per cohort. In each
      cohort, participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either ADX-914 or
      matching placebo.

      It is planned that for each cohort in Part 1 a staggered 'sentinel' dose design will be used.

      Part 2 - MAD It is expected that there will be up to 3 cohorts of 8 participants per cohort.
      In each cohort, participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive either
      ADX-914 or matching placebo. Doses will occur every 2 weeks, for a total of 4 doses.
