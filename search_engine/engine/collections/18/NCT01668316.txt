      intervention on weight loss in overweight postpartum women. Weight loss programs have been
      shown to be effective in reducing postpartum weight retention. However, high attrition rates
      in these studies suggest that the added responsibility of a new infant at home and returning
      to work may limit a woman's ability to follow a diet plan and exercise regularly. We hope
      that by offering a weight loss program at the workplace, we can increase participant
      retention and maximize weight loss in this population. Our primary aim is to promote weight
      loss while preserving lean body mass during the 12 week intervention. Secondary aims include
      increasing cardiovascular fitness from baseline and improving cardiovascular biomarkers,
      including total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and markers of
      inflammation and metabolism.
