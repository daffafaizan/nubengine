      iv) prescribing (dose adjustment and the addition of adjunctive medication)

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the effect of APA pharmacist interventions on:

           i)Clinical:

        -  Change in the mean PHQ-9 and GAD-7 score

        -  Cognitive and functional impairment related to MDD and/or GAD

        -  The occurrence of relapse of depression and/or anxiety
