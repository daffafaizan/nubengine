      patients with multifocal or large intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for
      surgical resection, transplantation, or local ablative therapy. Among the patient group with
      intermediate tumor stage, in which the tumor dimension exceeds 10cm, the treatment outcome of
      conventional chemoembolization (cTACE), chemoembolization using drug eluting beads (DEB-TACE)
      and radioembolization using yttrium 90 is generally unsatisfactory. Some would consider HCC
      of size >10cm a relative contraindication for cTACE because of the poor treatment outcome.
      However, there is no better alternative treatment for local control of these tumors. Ablative
      chemoembolization (ACE) using Lipiodol-ethanol and anhydrous cisplatin has been found to be
      highly effective for local control of HCC as compared to cTACE in a case-control study. It is
      hypothesized that ACE is safe and effective for local control of large HCC of size >10cm.
