      Apple's ResearchKit (RK) to the standard consent process. The primary objective is to
      determine whether participants using the ResearchKit consent form have a significantly higher
      comprehension of the elements of consent than participants using the standard consent form.
      Through this two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) 120 participants will be asked to read
      through either a ResearchKit multi-tiered consent form administered on an iPod Touch device
      or a standard long-form consent form administered via paper and give their informed consent
      for a sham research study on health tracking apps. The participants will then be asked to
      answer a short series of questions (5 minutes) about the consent process in order to measure
      their subjective and objective comprehension. The main risk from this study is loss of
      confidentiality of responses, however this risk should be minimal given that protected health
      information (PHI) will only be collected on the consent document and all information will be
      stored on Duke Box in a private folder only accessible by the study team.
