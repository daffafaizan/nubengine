      receive tailored (tailored group) or non-tailored metformin treatment (non-tailored group).

      Tailored metformin treatment will consist of incremental doses regimen starting from a dosage
      of 850 mg daily (one tablet daily) with a weekly increase up to 2550 mg daily (three tablets
      daily). The dosage of metformin will be reduced according to the appearance of serous or
      affecting compliance drug-related side effects. Conversely, non-tailored metformin treatment
      consisted of fixed doses regimen of 850 mg twice daily. For both groups, the treatment will
      be of six months.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the clinical and reproductive
      outcomes, and the adverse experience will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant. Continuous variables will be analyzed with the unpaired t
      test and general linear model for repeated measures analysis with Bonferroni test for the
      post-hoc analysis as required. For categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square and Fisher's
      exact tests will be used.
