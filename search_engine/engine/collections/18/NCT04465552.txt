      Disease 2019 or COVID-19) is a pandemic with over 3 million cases globally and resulting in
      >230,000 deaths at the time of this writing. From initial reports in Wuhan, China, viral
      progression resulted in over 80,000 cases in January/February 2020 in China. The following
      global spread has involved more than 210 countries. Unfortunately, the United States has been
      significantly affected, with over 1 million confirmed cases and over 60,000 deaths, the
      highest in the world. As this global pandemic continues to rage, cardiovascular, especially
      arrhythmic manifestations associated with COVID-19 have become evident. A recent report from
      Wuhan, China, noted that 16.7% of hospitalized and 44.4% of ICU patients with COVID-19 had
      arrhythmias. Although arrhythmias appear to be common in COVID-19 patients, arrhythmia
      mechanisms and characteristics, predisposing factors, incidence of sudden cardiac death and
      predictors, therapeutic strategies employed as well as long term outcomes are not well
      understood. Hence, we seek to develop a multicenter registry aimed to characterize arrhythmic
      manifestations, employed treatment strategies and long-term outcomes among hospitalized
      COVID-19 patients in the US.
