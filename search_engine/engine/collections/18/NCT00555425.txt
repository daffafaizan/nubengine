      but office-based physicians lack evidence-based guidelines to decide between maintenance or
      detoxification treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone. The proposed study compares
      buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance (Mtn) vs. detoxification (Dtx) in a 18-week randomized
      clinical trail in a heterogeneous population of prescription opioid dependent patients
      (N=120) in a primary care clinic. Patients are randomized to Mtn or Dtx after a 2-week
      induction period. Mtn is designed to reflect usual care by primary care physicians and
      includes weekly drug counseling (DC) and referral to ancillary services. Dtx and Mtn will be
      identical for the first 4 weeks (stabilization) following randomization. In Mtn,
      buprenorphine/naloxone will continue unchanged for the remainder of the study. In Dtx, the
      dosage of buprenorphine/naloxone will be tapered to zero over the next 3 weeks, and patients
      will not receive additional buprenorphine/naloxone for the remainder of the study. Dtx
      patients will be offered thrice-weekly DC beginning during the taper and naltrexone will be
      offered 7 days following the last dose of Bup. The study will test the hypothesis that Mtn
      will lead to decreased illicit drug use and will demonstrate incremental cost-effectiveness
      compared to Dtx. Relevance to public health: The results of this study will help define the
      role of maintenance vs. detoxification with buprenorphine/naloxone in the care of
      prescription opioid dependent patients in primary care.
