      placement (IIPP) in sockets with facial bone dehiscences is a challenge, mainly in esthetic
      areas. This study evaluated the impact of soft tissue grafts on peri-implant alterations
      after 1-year follow-up. Twenty-four patients with one single failing maxillary incisor
      presenting facial bone dehiscence and receiving IIPP were randomly divided in three groups
      (n= 8 in each group): Control (CTL); Collagen Matrix (CM); Connective tissue graft (CTG). In
      addition to soft tissue grafts, all groups were treated with collagen membrane and
      deproteinized bovine bone mineral containing 10% of porcine collagen. Clinical, photographic
      and tomographic analyses were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months after surgery to
      evaluate tissue alterations.
