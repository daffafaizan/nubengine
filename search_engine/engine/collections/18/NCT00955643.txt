      (pockets>7mm) with bleeding on probing, SRP was rendered in all pockets. Additionally, five
      consecutive hyperbaric sessions were administered in 10 patients after random allocation
      (SRP+HBOT). Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline up to 6 months: plaque index (PI),
      bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical attachment level and BANA test.

      Results: SRP+HBOT resulted in greater probing reduction and attachment gain than SRP alone 3
      months after treatment (p<0.001). The BANA test was negative after 1 week only for sites in
      the SRP+HBOT group (p<0.05). However SRP+HBOT failed to show a significant difference from
      SRP group after 3 months were all BANA sites became negative (p>0.05).

      Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy had a short-term
      beneficial effect on pocket reduction and bacterial elimination, and may be considered a
      potential therapy option to improve the clinical outcomes of scaling in severe cases of
      chronic periodontitis.
