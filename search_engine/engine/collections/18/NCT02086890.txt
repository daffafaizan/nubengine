      proven treatment. Patients are interested in trying alternative therapies to try to reduce
      their vision loss, but only limited research evidence exists to support their use and
      potential benefit. The goal of this research project is to gain a better understanding of
      possible changes in ocular and retinal blood flow and measures of vision in RP patients
      receiving two promising therapies, electroacupuncture and transcorneal electrical
      stimulation.
