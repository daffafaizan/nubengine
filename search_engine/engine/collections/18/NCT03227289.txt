      hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy(HDCP) and gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM),
      are related to NRDS, ARDS and subsequent death. Meantime, it has also been proven that the
      prevention of PRF reduces the risk of NRDS and ARDS. However, few study reported the
      relations between PRF and the conversion from NRDS to ARDS, and it also remains unknown
      whether treating PRF can reduce the progression from NRDS to ARDS.

      We have found that PRF were related to the increase and deterioration of NRDS in a Chinese
      cohort. The aims of the present study were: 1). to report the effects of PRF on the
      conversion from NRDS to ARDS. 2). to clarify whether PRF treatment could prevention from
      conversion from NRDS to ARDS in a Chinese population.
