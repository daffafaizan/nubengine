      the McKenzie method, chiropractic manipulation, or the provision of an educational booklet
      for the treatment of patients with acute non-specific low back pain. Recently, the need for
      studies testing the effect of treatment strategies to specific diagnostic subgroups of
      patients has been emphasized. The present study aims to compare the effectiveness of the
      McKenzie method and chiropractic manipulation, information, and advice for patients with
      clinical signs of disc-related symptoms for duration of more than 6 Weeks.
