      insulin-induced hypoglycemia with plasma glucose < 50 mg/dL. Both episodes will be treated
      with a single subcutaneous injection of G-Pen™ glucagon. For the first treatment visit, all
      subjects will receive a 1 mg dose of G-Pen™ glucagon. The investigator will have discretion
      to repeat this same dose at the second treatment visit or give a 0.5 mg dose of G-Pen™
      glucagon. A follow-up phone call will be conducted 3-7 days following administration of the
      final dose of study drug as a safety check.
