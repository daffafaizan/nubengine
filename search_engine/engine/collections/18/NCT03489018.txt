      PCV is currently the most expensive vaccine in the routine immunisation schedule in
      Gavi-supported countries. This study aims to provide evidence which may enable a substantial
      decrease in the cost of PCV programmes, therefore increasing the sustainability of PCV
      programmes in low and middle income countries (LMICs). We propose to assess whether
      fractional (20% and 40%) doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10 and PCV13) in a 2p+1
      schedule (2 primary doses followed by a booster dose) induce non-inferior immunogenicity and
      effects on vaccine-serotype carriage when compared to the full dose. These lower doses could
      convert new 4-dose vials of PCVs into 10- or 20-dose vials, ready for immediate
      implementation in LMIC programmes.

      Primary objective:

      Non-inferior immunogenicity at 1-month post-boost (10 months of age). Non-inferiority will be
      reached if the lower CI around the ratio of geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of IgG
      (fractional/full dose) is >0.5 (i.e. the 2-fold criterion).

      Secondary objectives:

      Non-inferior immunogenicity at 1-month post-primary series (18 weeks of age). Non-inferiority
      will be achieved if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the difference
      in the proportion of 'responders', children with IgG>=0.35 mcg/ml, (fractional dose group -
      full dose group) is >-10% for at least 8 of the 10 vaccine types in the PCV10 arms and at
      least 10 of the 13 vaccine types in the PCV13 arms.

      The opsonophagocytic activity of the antibody response to 7 serotypes after full/ fractional
      doses at the 1-month post-boost time point.

      The direct vaccine effectiveness of full/fractional doses of PCV13 against carriage of
      serotypes 6A and 19A, with primary analyses at 18 months of age and secondary analyses at 9
      months of age.

      The proportion of children with evidence of vaccine-serotype carriage by trial arm at 9 and
      18 months of age.

      The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of serotype-specific IgG after the primary series of
      the 2p+1 schedule, prior to boost, at 9 months of age.

      The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of serotype-specific IgG after three doses of vaccine
      in a 2p+1 schedule at 18 months of age.

      The carriage prevalence at 9 and 18 months of age and IgG concentrations at 4 weeks after the
      primary series after full dose of PCV10 in a 3p+0 schedule, and full/ fractional doses of
      PCV10/13 in a 2p+1 schedule.

      Trial design:

      A phase IV individually-randomised controlled trial of full or fractional (20% or 40%) doses
      of PCV10/ PCV13, given as a 3-dose schedule to infants: 2 doses at 6 and 14 weeks of age and
      a booster dose at 9 months (the 2p+1 schedule) or 3 full doses at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age
      (the 3p+0 schedule).

      At 6-8 weeks of age, 300 infants will be enrolled at random into each of the seven trial arms
      and followed until 18 months of age.

      The seven trial arms:

      A. Full dose PCV13 vaccination in a 2p+1 schedule. B. 40% fractional dose PCV13 vaccination
      in a 2p+1 schedule. C. 20% fractional dose PCV13 vaccination in a 2p+1 schedule. D. Full dose
      PCV10 vaccination in a 2p+1 schedule. E. 40% fractional dose PCV10 vaccination in a 2p+1
      schedule. F. 20% fractional dose PCV10 vaccination in a 2p+1 schedule. G. Full dose PCV10
      vaccination in a 3p+0 schedule. This arm would represent the current vaccine and schedule in
      the Kenyan routine immunisation programme and would act as an additional comparison arm.

      Study procedures:

      No study procedures will be conducted without prior parental informed consent. Participants
      in trial arms A-F will provide 3 or 5 blood samples in the course of the trial at enrolment,
      4 weeks post-primary series (approximately 18 weeks of age) and 4 weeks post-boost
      (approximately 10 months of age); additionally a random selection of half the participants
      will contribute blood samples pre-boost (9 months of age) and at the last study visit (18
      months of age).

      Participants in trial arm G will provide 2 blood samples (at enrolment and at 4 weeks
      post-primary series (approximately 18 weeks of age).

      All participants will provide 2 nasopharyngeal swabs at approximately 9 and 18 months of age
      and contribute safety data.
