      a training that builds skills and stimulates practice. The investigators are evaluating
      different materials, which may encourage caregiver participation, enable user interaction,
      and promote better assimilation of concepts. The research team is designing the program to
      help to enhance caregivers' skills to deal with difficult behaviors, reduce distress, and
      improve quality of life.
