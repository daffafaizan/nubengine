      professionals and parents. The process is often performed poorly with under-dosing and
      over-dosing a major problem with sometimes fatal consequences.

      The British National Formulary for Children (BNFC), introduced in 2005, has given hospital
      and community prescribers with a valuable reference text.

      However, the comprehensive prescribing information presented in the BNFC and in the drug
      Summary of Product Characteristics is simplified in the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) for
      interpretation by parents. When the PIL is analysed, it becomes apparent that the age-range
      regimens presented may result in under and over-dosing with large differences in the daily
      dose received by children depending on their age and weight.

      The Paediatric Analgesia Slide is a simple device presenting pre-calculated volume (and
      therefore dose) information for parents. It allows for age/weight specific doses to be given
      thus minimising the risk of under and over-dosing. It also addresses the deficiency of the
      prescribing information in the PIL related to over and under-weight children.
