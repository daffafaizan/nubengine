      healthy participants in order to evaluate the bioequivalence between a single oral dose of
      esomeprazole tablet and capsule. The study will enroll 52 participants. Participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment sequences:

        -  Esomeprazole 40 mg capsule + Esomeprazole 40 mg tablet

        -  Esomeprazole 40 mg tablet + Esomeprazole 40 mg capsule

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule or tablet on Day 1 of each Intervention
      Period based on the treatment sequence to which the participant has been assigned.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration to
      participate in this study is 36 days. Participants will visit the clinic on Day -1 and
      remained confined until Day 1 of Intervention Period 1 and 2. A washout period of minimum 6
      days will be maintained between the dose in each Intervention Period.
