      I. To estimate the response rates of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas to
      single-agent depsipeptide.

      II. To estimate the time to progression of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas to
      single-agent depsipeptide.

      III. To evaluate the scope and extent of acute toxicities associated with single-agent
      depsipeptide when given to patients with soft tissue sarcomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive depsipeptide (romidepsin) intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and
      15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 6 additional courses beyond
      documentation of CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
