      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced mycosis
      fungoides (MF) as initial systemic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety of pembrolizumab in this patient population. II. To evaluate response
      rates of pembrolizumab in this patient population. III. To determine the progression free
      survival, duration of response, time to response and overall survival of pembrolizumab in
      this patient population.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the histologic features of the anti-tumor response in patients with
      advanced MF before and after treatment with pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients receiving complete response during courses 2-9 are held for the remaining
      courses. If patients relapse while treatment is being held, the patient will then complete
      remaining courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, and then
      every 3 months for up to 1 year.
