      failure after hepatectomy may lead to increased postoperative mortality. Therefore, it is
      very important to make preoperative surgical decisions, evaluate the safety of the operation
      and identify which patients are likely to suffer from liver failure. The artificial
      intelligence platform developed by IBM Watson for Watson tumor treatment decisions can
      provide treatment decisions and corresponding theoretical basis to guide surgical decisions
      based on the key clinical data of liver cancer patients.
