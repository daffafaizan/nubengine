      Bevacizumab will be administrated for an additional cycle over a 4 week period. Patients will
      undergo re-staging within 3 weeks of their 4th cycle of XELOX. This will include MRI of the
      pelvis. If the reassessment reveals that there has been no disease progression compared to
      the pre-treatment evaluation and the patient remains a candidate for an R0 resection, the
      patient will proceed to definitive rectal cancer surgery within 4 weeks from the last
      chemotherapy dose. If the surgical oncologist's reassessment reveals that the patient is not
      a candidate for an R0 resection, the patient will proceed to standard pre-operative radiation
      with synchronous Capecitabine.
