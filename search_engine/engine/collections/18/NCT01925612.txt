      difference in the response to treatment and whether there were differences in the side
      effects (unwanted effects).

      The second and third parts of the study are being done to see if there are any side effects
      (unwanted effects) of the higher dose of brentuximab vedotin when combined with a modified
      version of RCHOP that omits vincristine. The third part of the study is being done to see if
      there is a difference between BV+RCHP and RCHOP in the response to treatment.
