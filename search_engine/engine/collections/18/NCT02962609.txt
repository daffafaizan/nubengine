      units. In this position, infant is laid and fed on its back and the head is elevated to an
      angle of 45-60° in order to reduce the respiratory load of lungs. The ESL position, head of
      the infant is elevated to an angle of 45-60° and the infant is fed in the side-lying
      position. Since this position mimics the breast-feeding position, very preterm infants are
      supported to utilize the advantages of breast-feeding. A randomization was provided in the
      sample group consisting of totally 80 infants and while 38 infants were included in the ESL
      (experimental) group, 42 infants were included in the ESU (control) group.In the power
      analysis repeated at the end of the study, the power of the study was determined as 87% at a
      reliability of 95%.
