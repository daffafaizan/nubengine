      of respiratory diseases and cancer, corresponding to the rapid increase in the number of
      coronary stent implantation. Therefore, the standardized training of interventional
      cardiologists is particularly important. Nowadays percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      training mode is mainly for the trainees to operate on the patients under the experienced
      operator. Although this kind of training method can truly show the operation process, it has
      obvious limitations. For beginners, it takes repeated training and revision to achieve
      proficiency and accuracy.Learning only through real surgery may result in longer operative
      times, increased radiation exposure, and increased complications.This study is aim to
      evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of 3D printed silicone coronary artery simulator
      for percutaneous coronary interventional training.
