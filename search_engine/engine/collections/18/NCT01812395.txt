      became available and even newer ones are under developement. Ultrasonic Dissectors (UDs)
      which are primarily developed for laparoscopic surgery found widespread use in thyroid
      surgery. UDs while closing the nearby vessels cause overheating of neighboring tissues in a
      1-3 mm. area. Due to the generated heat UDs might cause nerve injury. We would like to see if
      usage of UDs during thyroidectomy poses a risk for superior laryngeal nerve injury compared
      to conventional thyroidectomy where vessels are first sealed with sutures then cut. To this
      end patients in both conventional and ultrasonic dissector thyroidectomy arms will be checked
      for superior laryngeal nerve function the day following operation and six months later.
