      were enrolled in this feasible study. All patients were subjected to abdominoplasty operation
      under spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia. Any intraoperative complications like
      hypotension, bradycardia, pain, nausea and vomiting related to spinal anesthesia were managed
      and recorded. Postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess pain severity and
      the need for analgesia to be administered.
