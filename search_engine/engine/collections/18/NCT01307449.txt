      functional immune responses when compared to PPV23 [23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide
      vaccine (Pneumovax®23)] in older naïve adults. We hypothesize that this is due to intrinsic
      defects in innate responses that could explain the poor immunogenicity of PPV23 when compared
      to PCV13. Therefore, we propose to extensively study innate and adaptive immune responses
      generated after administration of either pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines in
      older adults.

      STUDY DESIGN: Single center, open label study in which adult healthy volunteers will be
      vaccinated with either PPV23 or PCV13. Blood samples will be collected on Days D0 (at
      enrollment) and D1, D3, D7, D14, D30 and D180 post vaccination to study innate and adaptive
      immune responses.

      Even though PPV23 and PCV13 are considered safe, volunteers will be asked to report any local
      or systemic AEs from Day 0 (vaccination) to Day 7 . Reactogenicity events will also be
      evaluated by injection site examination on visits at D0, D1, D3 and D7. Also volunteers are
      asked to report any local or systemic AEs for 30 days post vaccination and any SAEs for 180
      days post vaccination. Volunteers are also asked to report local and systemic AEs developing
      the day of a blood draw.
