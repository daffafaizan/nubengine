      Stimulation (NMES), via the EmpiÂ® Continuum unit, will improve the ability with which
      children with Neonatal Brachial Plexus Palsy (NBPP) are able to use their biceps muscle in
      activities of daily living. We will examine the British Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle
      strength and participants' ability to perform active range of motion (AROM) movements.
      Patients will be divided into two groups with one group receiving NMES and the other
      receiving sham NMES. We plan to analyze the effects of this one treatment intervention of
      NMES to determine if the device improves the function of the biceps muscle strength and
      motion.
