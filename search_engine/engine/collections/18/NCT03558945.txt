      personalized neoantigen vaccines for pancreatic tumors. It is known that pancreatic tumors
      have various mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual
      patient and tumors. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear
      very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a
      vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any
      tumor cells that could cause the pancreatic tumors to come back after radical surgery. The
      study will examine the safety and effect of the vaccine when given at several different time
      points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an
      immune response. Finally we will establish the typical flow to assess efficiency and safety
      of vaccines according to the different reactivity of patients, as a result, to explore the
      most suitable practical approaches for applying personalized pancreatic tumor vaccines.
