    
      This trial will be designed as a randomised, data analyst-blinded, superiority trial, with a
      3-group parallel design to be conducted in Aalborg, Denmark. Reporting of the trial will
      follow CONSORT guidelines and TIDieR for intervention description. Reporting of the protocol
      will follow the SPIRIT statement. The planning of the trial is done in accordance with the
      PREPARE Trial guide.

      Participants will be stratified by sex and block randomised in block sizes of 3 to 12 (1:1:1)
      into 3 parallel groups of 60 participants using a random number generator on
      www.sealedenvelope.com. The block sizes will be random and concealed to the research
      assistants responsible of including participants. Group allocation will be coded, and the
      data analyst will be blinded to this code until after the analyses have been performed.

      The investigators will only conclude superiority of one intervention over the other if the
      intention-to-treat analysis leads to mean between-group differences of the Foot Health Status
      Questionnaire pain domain â‰¥14 points (minimally important difference) and P-values <0.05 at
      the primary endpoint (12 weeks) after adjustment for the baseline value.
