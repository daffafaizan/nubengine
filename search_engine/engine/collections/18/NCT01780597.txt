      ideal young brain dead donors have been declining whilst the number of more marginal donors
      have been increasing. The consequence of this is the number of heart transplants being
      performed have steadily declined.

      At present there are 600 hearts from brain dead donors offered for transplant every year in
      the United Kingdom (UK). Of these 200 have anatomical reasons why they cannot be used for
      transplant such as ischaemic heart disease. 100 are transplanted and the remaining 300 hearts
      are judged to have inferior function which probably occurs as a direct result of brain death
      (Dark).

      Ex vivo 'rig' testing has been developed for lungs that were judged unsuitable for
      transplantation. As a result several donor lungs have been 'improved' by warm perfusion on
      the rig to the extent that they became suitable for transplantation and so national lung
      transplant rates are increasing (Dark). The aim would be to develop a similar approach for
      the heart.
