      I. To collect germ-line deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and nucleic acids from cancer patients to
      further investigate the association and identify new germ-line mutations that impact cancer
      predisposition.

      II. To investigate the role of germ-line mutations in predicting cancer outcome and response
      to therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of the identified variants on tumor micro-ribonucleic acid
      (miRNA), protein and gene expression.

      II. To study expression of DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA) or protein in the blood of cancer
      patients with and without variants of interest to discover correlations between such levels
      and the presence of cancer and/or response to therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood and saliva samples 1-3 times at the discretion of the
      investigator for germ-line mutation analysis.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 5 years.
