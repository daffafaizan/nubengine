      life and efforts for promoting this practice, rates for this pattern of breastfeeding in
      Brazil are below those recommended by the World Health Organization(WHO), which advocates
      exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months. The last national survey about the
      prevalence of breastfeeding revealed a median duration of 10 months. However , the length of
      exclusive breastfeeding was only 23 days.

      A lot of studies identified maternal age as predictor of breastfeeding. In African, Asian,
      Latin American and the Pacific societies, older women, or grandmothers,traditionally have
      considerable influence on decisions related to maternal and child health at the household
      level.

      Considering all that, interventions intended to increase frequency of breastfeeding,
      particularly exclusive breastfeeding. However, there are few studies on this subject.
