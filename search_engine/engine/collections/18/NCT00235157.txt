    
      Multi-center, prospective, controlled, non-randomized investigational feasibility study. One
      hundred (100) patients with de novo or restenotic renal artery lesions consisting of >= 50%
      stenosis and reference vessel of >= 4.0 to <= 8.0 mm in diameter will be sequentially
      included, 50 without sirolimus coating, followed by 50 with sirolimus coating Palmaz
      GenesisTM. Patients will be followed for 24 months post-procedure, with all patients having
      clinical assessments at discharge, 1,6, 12 and 24 months. This study will be conducted at
      twelve investigational sites.

      It is anticipated that the total length of time required to complete the study will be 46
      months.
