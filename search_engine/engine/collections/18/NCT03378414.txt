      sign consent forms, then divided into three groups. Doctors collect the basic information of
      patient (including age,height, mental condition, vital sign, history of disease,
      pharmaco-history, genotype test, and so on.) All patients receive laboratory and image
      examination as baseline. Then, they will give cell treatment based on the clinical protocol.
      Doctors have follow-up visit on 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, and do efficacy
      evaluation.
