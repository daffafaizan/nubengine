      two- to threefold over the last 50 years. Current standard of care for atopic dermatitis
      includes topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, such as Elidel and Protopic. The
      chronic use of topical corticosteroids is limited by side effects including skin atrophy,
      striae, and even HPA axis suppression. The long-term effects of skin immunosuppression with
      calcineurin inhibitors are unknown and although not proven, a theoretical risk of skin cancer
      exists. Novel therapies for atopic dermatitis that avoid immunosupression are greatly needed.

      Epiceram, a newly FDA-approved medical device is a topical barrier repair cream designed to
      deliver special epidermal lipids to the top layers of the skin in order to correct skin
      barrier abnormalities found in atopic dermatitis. Epiceram does not contain corticosteroids
      or other conventional anti-inflammatory components and represents a novel class of skin
      barrier repair therapy for inflammatory skin disease. The objective of this study is to
      determine whether Epiceram is a safe and effective therapy for mild to moderate atopic
      dermatitis and whether it may serve as an alternative to Elidel therapy.
