    
      Tinea pedis (Athlete's Foot) is a common skin disease which affects a large number of the
      population. The development of hygienic socks through the microencapsulation technology have
      great potential to provide the convenient pharmacological treatment on one hand, and good
      moisture management which can reduce the microbial overgrowth on the other hand for patients
      with tinea pedis. The socks, therefore, reduce the effects of the skin disease on the quality
      of life.
