    
      This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the
      same time), single-center study. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 cohorts
      (groups) defined by the antipsychotic drug (aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone
      or paliperidone). Antipsychotics are drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and
      have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders. Participants will enter the investigational
      site in the morning of Day -1 and stay until the morning of Day 2. Participants will return
      to the study site for subsequent assessments as per study's schedule. The total study length
      for a participant is approximately 26 days, except for participants receiving aripiprazole
      for whom the total study length is approximately 39 days.
