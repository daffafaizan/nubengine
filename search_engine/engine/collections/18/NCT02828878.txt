    
      ApoGraft product is a mobilized peripheral blood cell product of a matched Related donor,
      collected via apheresis, which is exposed to the apoptotic mediator Fas Ligand (CD95L) prior
      to transplantation (Ex Vivo).

      The study is designed to address the aspects of engraftment and Prevention of Acute Graft
      versus Host Disease (aGvHD) rate and/or severity in 12 Patients

      STUDY DESIGN:

      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, proof-of-concept, staggered 4-cohort clinical study. Each
      cohort will include 3 patients with hemato-oncology disorders eligible for allogeneic
      HLA-matched HSCT. Patients in all cohorts will undergo similar study procedures and
      evaluation. The cohorts will differ from each other in the amount of apoptotic mediator Fas
      Ligand (APO010) to which the graft is exposed during incubation prior to ApoGraft
      transplantation and HSCT, ranging from 10 ng/ml APO010 in Cohort 1, 25 ng/ml APO010 in Cohort
      2, 50 ng/ml APO010 in Cohort 3 and 100 ng/ml APO010 in Cohort 4. APO010 is washed-out as part
      of the ApoGraft process and only trace amounts of APO010 are present in the final ApoGraft
      product

      The study consists of a screening phase (subject and donor clinical assessment and screening
      tests), transplantation of ApoGraft, and a follow-up period of 180 days during and after
      hospitalization.

      The study will progress from one cohort to the next based on an independent data safety
      monitoring board (DSMB) review and analysis of safety data
