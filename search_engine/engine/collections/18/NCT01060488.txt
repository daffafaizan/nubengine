      informed of the subject's randomisation group, the investigator phoned the access number
      given to him/her. The subject's allocation to a given randomisation arm was determined on the
      basis of a centralised randomisation (answering service), balanced per group of subjects with
      a minimisation on 2 criteria: age and BMI.

      This was a centralised randomisation using a Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) which
      was balanced in each of the following 3 categories of subjects:

        -  Category A = healthy volunteers,

        -  Category B = subjects with a strong probability of deficit in GH,

        -  Category C = subjects with a low probability of deficit in GH.

      In each of these 3 categories, the subjects underwent 3 tests whose sequences were determined
      by the following randomisation group:

        -  Group 1: GHRH+Arg, GHRH+Arg, ITT or

        -  Group 2: ITT, ITT, GHRH+Arg.
