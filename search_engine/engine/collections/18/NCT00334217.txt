      reduce their ability to benefit from their treatment. While there is considerable variety in
      the severity and types of cognitive impairment found in newly recovering patients, problems
      with attention, memory and executive function are very common. Since treatment requires
      sustained attention, remembering what is learned, integrating that knowledge and applying it
      to recovery, impairment in underlying cognitive processes makes successful treatment less
      likely. Although cognitive functioning improves with sustained sobriety, it is during the
      early phase of recovery that most patients receive the most intensive treatment. Recent
      research has suggested that cognitive remediation exercises during this early phase may speed
      up the return of cognitive functioning and in so doing may have a direct effect on whether
      patients find the treatment useful and complete their treatment. By keeping patients in
      treatment longer, cognitive remediation may have an indirect effect on substance abuse
      outcomes.

      Objectives: To pilot test the introduction of cognitive remediation at the Substance Abuse
      Day Treatment Program (SADP) at the Errara Community Care Center. Aims are 1) to assess the
      receptivity of patients to the intervention by determining rates of agreement to participate,
      2) to determine the number of cognitive remediation sessions that patients are willing to
      engage in, 3) to assess a variety of cognitive remediation tasks for their acceptability, 4)
      to evaluate neuropsychological improvements using pre-post assessment, 5) to evaluate its
      effects on substance abuse treatment participation, and 6) to evaluate its effects on
      substance abuse outcomes at 6 months follow-up.

      Design: Randomized clinical trial of cognitive remediation with an active control condition
      with observations at baseline, end of treatment and 6-months from intake
