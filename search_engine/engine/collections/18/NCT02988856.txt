      the eyelids) and blepharoptosis (incomplete opening of the eyelids). Both of these conditions
      occur because of a disruption in the normal agonist-antagonist neuro-muscular complex
      balance. Generally paralysis of the eyelid or facial muscles is responsible for the
      abnormality (the eyelids can close but not open, or open but not close). An external device,
      if able to generate an appropriately balanced force, could restore eyelid movement by
      performing the paralyzed function; for example, a ptotic (droopy) eyelid could be opened, and
      the functioning eyelid closure muscle could overcome the device's force. In prior work the
      investigators established proof-of-concept data demonstrating safety and efficacy for
      temporary management of ptosis up to 2 hour per day for 2 weeks. Preliminary data suggest
      similar safety for lagophthalmos. This study will expand on this preliminary work to examine
      longer wear times, home use, and feasibility for a wider range of eye lid disorders.
