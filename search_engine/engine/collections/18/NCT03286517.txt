      the KISS1 or KISS1R sensitivity increases during the pubertal transition in boys. Kisspeptin
      regulates HPG (hypothalamic pituitary gonadal) axis by secreting GnRH that acts on the
      pituitary gonadotrophs to secrete LH and FSH. But in contrast to pubertal period, juvenile
      period kisspeptin pulsatility is reduced, that leads to low GnRH pulsatility and low level of
      plasma LH, FSH and testosterone. The objective of this study was to determine the response of
      exogenous kisspeptin in various juvenile stages up to puberty and also in the adults by
      measuring the level of plasma LH and testosterone. This study would help us to determine that
      whether there is any link between the increased sensitivity of kisspeptin signalling and
      puberty onset?, Or at what Tanner stage pre pubertal boys enter into puberty.
