      use of a fast flow of hydration appears to be recognized beneficial, the addition of glucose
      is less well accepted. However studies on exercise physiology clearly demonstrates improved
      performance of skeletal muscle by increased hydration and carbohydrate replacement during
      prolonged exercise. This situation is similar to the condition of the uterus in labor
      especially since it is now established that glucose represents its principal source of
      energy.

      However, the effect of an additional carbohydrate intake on the evolution of labor has not
      been extensively studied until now, and there are several schools of thought on this subject.
      While some studies show that such glucose addition could reduce the total duration of labor
      as well as its second stage, others claim that this glucose supplement offers no benefit and
      may even be harmful to the fetus.

      It therefore seems imperative to conduct a study to compare the use of hydration with normal
      saline with or without dextrose during labor, as recommended in current flow (250 cc / h). To
      our knowledge, this has never been done.
