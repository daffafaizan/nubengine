      gonorrhoeae (NG) and C. trachomatis (CT) in the first and third trimester for the obstetrical
      population at St. Michael's Hospital over the course of six months. Secondary objectives
      include (1) feasibility of instituting third trimester screening for sexually transmitted
      infections, and (2) assessment of physician compliance with Canadian screening and treatment
      guidelines. This information will help us to deduce the optimal timing of screening for NG
      and CT in the obstetrical population at St. Michael's Hospital.

      It is hypothesized that the incidence rates of both NG and CT infections will be low, but
      that much can be learned from the positive cases in terms of risk factors and optimal timing
      of screening. Further, the feasibility of screening in the third trimester will offer options
      for future guidelines.
