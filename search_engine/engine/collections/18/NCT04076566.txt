      evaluate the performance and safety of the Alfapump® system in the treatment of patients with
      malignant ascites. The Alfapump® system is a fully implantable programmable pump, able to
      move ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder via 2 catheters. The Alfapump®
      has obtained CE (Conformité Européenne) mark approval for the indication of malignant
      ascites. The primary objective of the study is to assess the performance of the system to
      remove ascites. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      Alfapump® in the treatment of malignant ascites for a total follow-up period of 9 months, and
      to evaluate quality of life (QoL) by reduction or elimination of paracentesis requirement.
      Furthermore the study includes an exploratory scientific objective as to feasibility to
      obtain 'liquid biopsy' samples suitable for analysis in a non-invasive way after Alfapump®
      implantation. 40 patients with malignant ascites will be enrolled in up to 8 sites in Europe
      (Belgium, United Kingdom, Switzerland). Specific sub-analysis of data from patients with
      gynecological (ovarian) cancer is planned.
