      exercise intolerance and higher mortality in patients with COPD. Limb muscle dysfunction in
      COPD consists of muscle atrophy and reduced muscle strength but also intra-muscular
      alterations in oxidative capacity and mitochondrial function are often present. Moreover,
      reduced blood flow to exercising muscle may also contribute to the muscle dysfunction in
      COPD. The mechanisms responsible for muscle dysfunction in COPD patients remain unclear but
      could be a consequence of reduced lung function, inflammation, medications or low physical
      activity. Loss of lung function with COPD is normally irreversible so the transition to
      near-normal lung function after lung transplantation is a unique model to investigate the
      adaptation of the limb muscle to improved lung function. Thus, the purpose of this project is
      to investigate the effect of lung transplantation on limb muscle function (mitochondrial
      function, oxidative enzyme capacity, fiber type distribution, oxygen delivery/uptake) and
      daily physical activity level in patients with COPD. The project has a translational focus on
      muscle dysfunction in COPD and uses methodologies from clinical medicine, integrative
      physiology and molecular biochemistry in order to gain knowledge of mechanisms behind limb
      muscle dysfunction and exercise intolerance in COPD.
