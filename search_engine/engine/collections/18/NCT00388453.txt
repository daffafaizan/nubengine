      through a variety of modalities utilizing 24 hour ambulatory pH monitoring which can register
      the duration, pattern and symptom correlation of distal esophageal acid exposure. This can be
      accomplished via a catheter probe connected from outside the body and placed through a
      nostril, advanced past the hypopharynx and down into the distal esophagus. Or, a small pH
      detector temporarily implanted in the distal esophagus during endoscopy can record reflux
      events. However, despite available technologies, there has long been a deficiency in
      detecting extra-esophageal reflux in the upper esophagus/ hypopharynx. This is of interest
      for gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, and pulmonologists in the evaluation of
      extra-esophageal reflux as a potential culprit for asthma, chronic cough, laryngitis, globus,
      and non-cardiac chest pain. Until now, there has not been a device sensitive enough for
      accurately detecting extra-esophageal reflux (EERD) and clinicians have relied upon
      subjective response to empiric treatment with acid reducing medications to determine whether
      acid reflux was at the root of the symptoms. There are currently no well designed published
      studies with this device to assess its role in this group of difficult to treat patients.
