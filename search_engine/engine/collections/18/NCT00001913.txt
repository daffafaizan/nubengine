      to ascertain how brain activation patterns differ depending on the subject's familiarity
      with, and emotional attachment to, the person depicted in the visual stimulus. In a series of
      studies, subjects will view unfamiliar and familiar (including personally familiar and
      famous) faces; mothers will view pictures of their own child and those of familiar and
      unfamiliar children; and bereaved and non-bereaved spouses will view pictures of their
      spouse, other family members, and unfamiliar people. The use of emotionally significant faces
      as activation stimuli may help to elucidate the neural circuitry underlying interpersonal
      attachment and psychological responses to loss.
