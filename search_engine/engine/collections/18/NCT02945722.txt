    
      Hemodialysis patients will be randomized in 2 arms: one arm where persistent carriers will be
      decolonized. Decolonization schedule associate the use of mupirocin nasal ointment 3 times a
      day and chlorhexidine bath once a day for 5 days. Screening of persistent carriers in this
      arm will be done every 3 months and a new decolonization will be proposed to patients found
      (again) persistent carriers. Determination of carriage status will be done using one nasal
      swab by following the algorithm previously described. Bacterial load will be determined by a
      quantitative S. aureus PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) : persistent carriers are the patient
      with a bacterial load > 103 CFU/mL (Colony Forming Unit) .

      The other arm is HD patients in which decolonization is not performed including impersistent
      carriers.

      All infections that occurred in enrolled patients will be counted in both groups
