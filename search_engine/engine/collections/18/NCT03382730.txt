      patients treated with ventilators (breathing machines) in intensive care units (ICUs). A
      commonly used mouthwash called chlorhexidine can reduce lung infection but most recent
      evidence shows it may increase the risk of death. In this study 6 participating intensive
      care units (ICUs) will de-adopt oral chlorhexidine and introduce a bundle of oral care
      practices using a multi-faceted educational tool kit. The investigators will measure changes
      in patient-oriented outcomes including mortality, ventilator-associated complications (VACs)
      and oral health status. A concurrent process evaluation will study how the intervention is
      delivered and received by patients and clinicians..
