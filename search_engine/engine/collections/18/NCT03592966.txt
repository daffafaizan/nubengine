      shown to improve measures of vascular function as well as cognitive performance in human
      intervention studies. Blueberries are rich in anthocyanins, a subclass of flavonoids that
      have been widely linked to health benefits, particularly improvements in endothelial
      function. Research have previously shown that blueberries improve executive functioning and
      memory in both healthy adults and children. These improvements were seen within 2-5 hours
      post-consumption of blueberries, a time-course that positively correlates with improvements
      in vascular function (measured as flow-mediated dilation). This indicates that increases in
      blood flow may influence improvements in cognitive performance. To date no study has
      investigated whether blueberry consumption can induce an increase in cerebral blood flow,
      with subsequent improvements in vascular and cognitive function. In this study, investigators
      aim to directly link wild blueberry consumption with increased vascular and cerebral blood
      flow and positive cognitive outcomes in healthy individuals through the life course, between
      the ages of 8 and 80 years old. Investigators will use a large group of healthy subjects
      representative of the general public over a wide age range in males and females to evaluate
      the generalisability of the health benefits of blueberry consumption.
