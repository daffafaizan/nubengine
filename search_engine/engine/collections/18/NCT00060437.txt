        -  Determine the 4-month progression-free survival rate, as measured by prostate-specific
           antigen and clinical criteria, in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate
           cancer treated with perifosine.

        -  Determine the side-effect profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Course 1: Patients receive oral perifosine twice on day 1 and once daily on days 2-21.

        -  All subsequent courses: Patients receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-21.

      In all courses, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 1.5 years.
