      these devices have achieved accuracy sufficient for clinical use, no such devices have been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and there are currently no such devices on the
      market in the United States. While these devices are typically able to measure the heart and
      respiratory rates with some accuracy,v the accurate calculation of oxygen saturation from the
      arterial pulse (SpO2) using a "non-contact" reflectance oximetry probe is complicated by the
      interference of ambient light, patient temperature changes, as well as the inherent
      limitations of the sensing devices currently utilized. Poh et al have been somewhat
      successful at calculating the heart rate from a video recording using independent component
      analysis. However, Poh's method does not calculate instantaneous rates and requires a facial
      recognition component to track the facial orientation in the image, is not capable of
      measuring respiratory rate, and relies primarily on analysis of reflected green light (which
      cannot be used for the calculation of oxygen saturation). Our work involves modifying a
      commercial off the shelf (COTS) 3-channel (red, green, blue) CCD (charge coupled device) or
      CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) camera in the form of a web cam to detect near
      infrared and infrared spectrum radiation and applying an algorithm based fast Fourier
      transformation (FFT) of individual red pixel intensity to detect motion and color changes.
      Because our algorithm analyzes the first derivative of red pixel intensity, a face-tracking
      component is unnecessary, and we are able to calculate the heart rate and the respiratory
      rate in real time.
