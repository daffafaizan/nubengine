      consists of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, but progression ultimately occurs for most
      patients. Second-line treatment options available to patients who suffer failure of
      first-line treatment include further chemotherapy (docetaxel and pemetrexed) or targeted
      therapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great
      efficacy in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation. High EGFR gene copy number was
      associated with great sensitivity and prolonged progression-free survival of NSCLC from
      EGFR-TKIs. This phase II study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of erlotinib
      compared with pemetrexed as second-line treatment for EGFR wild-type and EGFR FISH-positive
      lung adenocarcinoma.
