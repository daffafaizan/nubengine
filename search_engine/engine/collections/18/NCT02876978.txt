    
      A single-center, open-label pilot study to determine the safety, tolerance and engraftment
      potential of CAR-GPC3 T cells in subjects with GPC3+ positive lung squamous cell carcinoma.

      Primary objectives:

      Observe and determine the safety and tolerance in escalating dose infusion of CAR-GPC3 T
      cells (CAR T cells targeting GPC3) transduced with the lentiviral vector, and the survival of
      the CAT-GPC3 T cells in vivo, referred to as engraftment potential.

      Secondary objectives:

      The following indexes are monitored for curative effect of CAR-GPC3 T cells on lung squamous
      cell carcinoma:

        1. Objective response rate (ORR), is defined as the ratio of patients diagnosed as partial
           remission (PR) to complete remission (CR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

        2. Progression free survival (PFS), is defined as the duration from baseline to PD (audited
           and confirmed by independent imaging), or to the day of any death event. The earlier one
           shall prevail.

        3. Time to tumor progression (TTP), is defined as the duration from baseline to disease
           starts to get worse or spreads to other parts of the body.

        4. Overall survival (OS), is defined as the time period from the 1st day of treatment to
           the day of death for any reason. For patients who are still alive at the data analysis
           day, OS data is subject to the last confirmed time of survival patients.
