      also well established that physical activity, with or without weight loss, improves many
      health-related problems and can have a positive impact on mood. Therefore, physical activity
      may amplify the health and psychological benefits often experienced from bariatric surgery.
      Prior to surgery many patients are relatively inactive due to physical and social barriers
      associated with their weight. In addition, many patients find it difficult to adopt an active
      lifestyle after surgery, despite an increased capacity to exercise. However, weight loss is
      associated with physical activity after bariatric surgery. Nonetheless, little is known about
      the most effective means to promote activity among this group of individuals. This study will
      examine changes in physical activity and fitness after bariatric surgery and examine whether
      the addition of pedometer use and exercise counseling may lead to greater improvements.
