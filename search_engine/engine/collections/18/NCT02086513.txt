      and likely take approximately 24 months to complete accrual. Treatment will consist of LDE225
      given daily for continuous dosing in 28-day cycles. Participants will have undergone
      allogeneic SCT and have developed chronic GVHD which has not responded sufficiently to
      systemic corticosteroids (dose of at least 0.25 mg/kg/day of ideal body weight), have
      relapsed disease while tapering steroids, or not having an adequate response to steroids plus
      other therapies. Participants who are responding will then be eligible to receive additional
      courses of therapy. Participants will be followed on trial for 12 months after starting
      therapy and the trial will be completed when all participants have reached 12 months of
      follow-up or have withdrawn from the trial.

      The initial dose escalation phase of 4 cohorts of participants (each cohort 3-6 participants)
      will have a primary endpoint of safety and toxicity of administering LDE225 in this setting.
