      to obtain a prolonged apnea in awaken subjects. Such an application should be of interest for
      MRI taking into account its susceptibility to motion of the chest and the imperfect
      techniques of respiratory gating that are usually performed at end expiration. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the benefit on image quality of different sequences performed with
      and without the device in healthy subjects.
