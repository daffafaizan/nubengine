      type and severity of toxicity based on safety and tolerability assessments. 3 dose level (3 ×
      10^11, 1 × 10^12, 3 × 10^12) will be evaluated. Part 2 (combination therapy) is designed to
      gather safety, tolerability, biodistribution data, and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy
      of SynOV1.1 in combination with atezolizumab. Part 3 (expansion study) is designed to further
      evaluate the efficacy SynOV1.1 in combination with atezolizumab in participants with HCC.
