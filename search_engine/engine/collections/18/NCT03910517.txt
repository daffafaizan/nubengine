      The prevalence of MSK pain within the study population will be presented in absolute numbers
      and as percentage values. To investigate if E-sport related training loads differ among
      athletes with and without MSK pain we will use total E-sport related training load (N hours
      spend on structured E-sport + N hours spend on unstructured E-sport). An independent sample
      t-test will be applied for this comparison if data are normally distributed. To assess if
      physical activity levels are different among athletes with and without MSK pain we will use
      the responses from the IPAQ short form. For this comparison we will use an independent sample
      t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Participant characteristics, distribution and number of
      MSK pain sites, utilization of health professionals and pain medicine, physical activity
      levels, training loads and sleep patterns will be presented descriptively. The data will be
      presented with means, standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals. Non-parametric data
      will be presented with absolute numbers and as percentage values, medians and range.
