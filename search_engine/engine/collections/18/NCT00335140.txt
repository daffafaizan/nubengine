      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response rate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the proportion of progression-free and overall survival in these patients.

        -  Determine rituximab cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics (only in patients requiring
           intrathecal chemotherapy).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV 3 times weekly in weeks 1-4; high-dose methotrexate IV over 2
      hours in weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9; oral or IV leucovorin calcium every 6 hours for 12 doses
      beginning 24 hours after the start of methotrexate in weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9; vincristine IV in
      weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9; oral procarbazine hydrochloride daily on days 1-7 in weeks 1, 5, and
      9; oral dexamethasone daily in weeks 1-6; and cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice weekly in
      weeks 11 and 14.

      Patients with positive cerebrospinal fluid also receive methotrexate intrathecally and oral
      leucovorin calcium every 12 hours for 8 doses beginning 24 hours after the start of
      methotrexate in weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
