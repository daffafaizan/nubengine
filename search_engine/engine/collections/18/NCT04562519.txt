      or acupressure) or through medications (such as pilocarpine, cevimeline,
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers) or by
      electrostimulation as transcutnaeous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (Bossola and Tazza,
      2012).

      Eighty HD patients (40 diabetics and 40 nondiabetics) will receive 20 minutes of TENS on skin
      over bilateral parotid gland, 3 times weekly for 3 weeks to investigate the hyposalivation
      response of diabetic and non diabetic HD patients to TENS.
