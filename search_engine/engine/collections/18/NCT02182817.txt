      15 months of age will have significantly lower neurocognitive scores at 6,18, 24 and 36

      without prior exposure to general anaesthesia or surgery. (GUSTO: Growing Up Towards Healthy
      Outcomes in Singapore: a prospective longitudinal study providing normative data from the
      local population).
