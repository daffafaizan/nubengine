      Primary

        -  To collect clinical data and family histories and blood and/or tissue samples from
           patients diagnosed with pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer, for use in
           future studies.

        -  To collect information regarding food preparation and intake in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To make available to researchers medical data and biospecimens to enable them to develop
           better ways to screen people at risk for pancreatic conditions, including pancreatic
           cancer.

        -  To investigate genes or substances that increase susceptibility of developing pancreatic
           conditions.

        -  To find agents that may help prevent, treat, or cure these conditions.

        -  To learn whether inherited factors increase the risk of pancreatic diseases, pancreatic
           cancer, or other cancers.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete two 1-hour surveys assessing health, clinical and family history of
      pancreatic conditions including cancer, and food preparation and intake. Patients also
      complete a 15- to 30-minute follow up survey at 6 months and 1 year to assess health, health
      practices, and family history. A review of the patient's medical information is obtained from
      the medical record.

      Blood samples are collected for future research studies. Oral cells and stool samples may
      also be collected for future studies.
