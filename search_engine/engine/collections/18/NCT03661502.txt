    
      Randomized controlled trial comparing low inspiratory and expiratory flow during variable
      volume ventilation (VVV) with a constant volume decelerating flow (PCV pressure controlled
      volume guarantee) ventilation.

      After anesthesia induction patients are VVV or PCV ventilated with a positive end expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) of 10 cm H2O. Average tidal volume is set at 6 ml/kg and end tidal CO2 is
      kept between 30 and 50 mmHg in both groups by adapting breaths per minute between 10 and 16.
      I/E ratio is set at 1/1 in VVV and at the standard Â½ in PCV.

      Dynamic lung compliance is measured before and during pneumoperitoneum. If dynamic lung
      compliance is less than 40 or decreases below 40 a first lung recruitment (10 sec of 30 up to
      40 cmH2O) is given till dyn compliance rises above 40.

      Dynamic lung compliance is further monitored and when value decreases again below 40, a new
      lung recruitment (LRM) is given and the PEEP is increased to 15 cm H2O after the second LRM.

      All patients get an opioid free general anesthesia with anti inflammatory agents and deep NMB
      with full reversal at end of surgery.

      The moment and number of LRM performed after induction of anesthesia with the averaged
      reached lung compliance is used to compare both ventilation methods.

      The oxygen saturation without oxygen at arrival of PACU and the need for oxygen when
      saturation drops below 95 % are compared between both groups.
