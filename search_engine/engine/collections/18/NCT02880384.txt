      a sputum sample for culture and sensitivity testing, urine for detection of S. pneumonia and
      L. pneumophila, an anterior nasal swab for S. aureus PCR, a nasopharyngeal swab for S.
      pneumonia PCR and the FilmArray LRTI v.2.0 IUO Panel, and blood for procalcitonin testing
      and, in cases in which the patient is suffering rigors and hypotension, cultures. As part of
      this study, sputum or sputum equivalent will be acquired for testing using the FilmArray LRTI
