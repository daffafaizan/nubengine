      throughout the body, sleep disorder, stiffness, fatigue, depression and other psychological
      problems. Patients with FM feel incapable of performing the majority of activities of daily
      living. Medication offers only short-term benefits. Thus, it is necessary to include other
      measures for treatment, such as physical activity and patient education. Art therapy combine
      the field of psychology with artistic activities, working with therapeutic and instructive
      aspects as well as the potential for personal growth contained in all forms of art.
