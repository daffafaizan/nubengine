    
      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of two cangrelor regimens of bolus plus infusion (A and B).

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of Cangrelor (A and B).

        -  To compare the pharmacodynamics of cangrelor regimens with that of an oral 600 mg dose
           of clopidogrel (A, B, C and D).

        -  To determine the effect of prior cangrelor treatment on the pharmacodynamics of
           clopidogrel (C and D).

        -  To determine the effect of prior clopidogrel treatment on the pharmacodynamics of
           cangrelor (Group D).

        -  To determine the effects of concomitant clopidogrel and cangrelor exposure on the
           pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel (Group D).
