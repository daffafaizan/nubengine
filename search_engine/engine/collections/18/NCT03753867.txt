      latency reactivating the HIV reservoir and the potential for selective eradication of
      HIV-harbouring cells. We feel that acitretin shows significant potential as a potential
      adjuvant to current ART regimens, however, there is a lack of data to demonstrate that
      treatment with acitretin at normal are able to induce molecular and transcription changes
      consistent with the above activities. In order to provide a scientific basis for retinoid
      therapy in HIV infection, a Phase I trial of acitretin in human subjects is proposed.
