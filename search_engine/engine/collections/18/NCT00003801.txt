      with rhabdomyosarcoma who survived 5 years from diagnosis after treatment on Intergroup
      Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG) protocols I, II, III, and IV pilot. II. Determine the
      mortality of these patients and compare this mortality to the general population, especially
      in the third and fourth decades of life. III. Determine treatment specific risks of
      developing a second malignancy following treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma and the potential
      genetic influences (family history of cancer). IV. Determine the association between
      decreased fertility/offspring and dose, schedule, and total dose of alkylating agents
      (especially cyclophosphamide) received during treatment and with selected genitourinary and
      paratesticular primaries. V. Determine the effect of the dose and location of therapeutic
      radiation for primary head and neck cancer on achieved final height. VI. Determine the
      association of therapy with doxorubicin (dose and age when received) with cardiac and
      vascular events.

      OUTLINE: Patients (or parent or surviving family member) complete the baseline questionnaire
      plus other questionnaires (offspring, family history, other topic specific). Medical data is
      also collected from past records.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1600 patients will be accrued for this study.
