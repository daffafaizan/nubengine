      postoperative vertigo and oscilopsia due to nystagmus. In general, the dominant symptom
      postoperatively is vertigo. Preoperative chemical vestibular ablation can reduce vestibular
      symptoms postoperatively. We used 1.0 ml of 40 mg/ml nonbuffered gentamicin in three
      intratympanic installations over 2 days, 2 months preoperatively in 10 patients. Reduction of
      vestibular function was measured by the head impulse test and the caloric test. Reduction of
      vestibular function was found in all gentamicin patient groups. After gentamicin vestibular
      ablation, patients underwent home vestibular exercising for two months. The control group
      consisted of 10 patients who underwent only home vestibular training two months
      preoperatively. Postoperative rate of recovery and vertigo in both groups were evaluated with
      the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), the Glasgow Health Status Inventory (GHSI) and the
      Dizziness Handicap Inventory questionnaires, as well as survey of visual symptoms by specific
      questionnaire developed by us.
