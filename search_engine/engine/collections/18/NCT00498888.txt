      (phase II), and 1 year post-entry (phase III)

      Women with UUI will be divided randomly into one of the four treatment groups. Every subject
      will participate in 4 visits. The drug group treatment consists of administration of
      tolterodine SR 4 mg daily for 3 months. Subjects who assigned to the pelvic floor
      rehabilitation, pelvic floor muscle training, and bladder training groups will be treated via
      4 visits to a physical therapist, who is trained in the procedures. The chief researcher (RK)
      will be blinded to the treatment groups and will perform the outcome measures in all phases.

      Study variables will include impairment ratings, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness
