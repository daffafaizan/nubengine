      Patients with advanced stage of the disease need extensive tumor excision with neck
      dissection. Secondary reconstructive surgeries using free flap could improve the
      postoperative function or appearance of cancer survivors. Oral functions include respiration,
      speech, mastication, deglutition, and cosmetics. Advanced treatments make survival rates
      increased, but might develop shoulder dysfunction, speech, mastication, donor site morbidity
      and psychological issues. The purpose of this project is to explore the effects of
      rehabilitation following reconstructive surgery in oral cancer survivors.

      This study design is an interrupted time-series design. The investigators will recruit 50
      subjects one week following reconstructive surgery. The measurements include manual muscle
      strength, joint range of motion, maximal mouth opening, pain status, hand-to-neck test,
      hand-to-scapula test, hand-to-opposite-scapula test, 6-minute walking test, timed up & go
      test, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life
      questionnaire (QLQ)-C30, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
      quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-H&N35 and return-to-work. These tests were done at the
      first visit (0 week post-operation), three months and six months after reconstructive surgery
      respectively. The intervention programs consist of edema control, scar management, pain
      management, respiration training, oral function training, neck and shoulder function
      training, donor site mobility training. Continuous variables were analyzed by descriptive
      statistics. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the difference between measurements. Binary
      logistic regression was used to predict the factors of return-to-work.
