      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) to provide prolonged postsurgical analgesia in men
      undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. The primary endpoint is the duration of
      abdominal analgesia from the infiltration into the TAP as measured by the time to the
      subject's first postsurgical opioid administration.
