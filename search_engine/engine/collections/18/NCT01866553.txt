    
      Study phase: Phase II.

      Patient population:

      Patients with suboptimal molecular response or stable detectable molecular residual disease
      after ≥ 2 years of treatment with imatinib (i.e. BCR ABL level between 0.01% and 1% IS).

      Study objective:

      To assess the effect of switching CML patients, who have been treated with imatinib ≥ 2 years
      and who have stable detectable molecular residual disease between 0.01-1.0% (IS), to the
      combination of Nilotinib and PegIFN, in terms of the proportion of patients who achieve
      confirmed MR4.0.

      Study design:

      Single arm, open label, multicenter study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      nilotinib 300 mg BID, alone and in combination with PegIFN 25 - 40 μg/week in patients not in
      CMR. Patients will be treated with nilotinib 300 mg BID at the beginning of the study to
      establish the tolerability before adding PegIFN. Combination treatment will be continued
      until Month 12, which is followed by monotherapy phase of nilotinib 300 mg BID. Overall study
      duration for the individual patient is 24 months.
