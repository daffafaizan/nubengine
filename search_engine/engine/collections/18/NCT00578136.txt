      considerable postoperative discomfort. The patient has to meet certain discharge criteria
      such as tolerating liquids, adequate level of analgesia, etc., prior to being discharged from
      the day surgery unit.

      Currently, both rectus sheath block and local infiltration of the surgical site are used for
      providing post-operative analgesia for umbilical hernia repair surgery. The local
      infiltration can only be done at the end of the surgical procedure as it could alter the
      planes of the surgical field if performed preoperatively. We believe that the analgesia
      provided prior to the surgical incision will decrease the amount of intraoperative and
      postoperative opioids used and the subsequent side effects of these medications (5,6). The
      rectus sheath block, a regional anesthetic technique, offers possible improved pain
      management following umbilical hernia repair in a recent observational study (1-3,7). We will
      perform a double-blinded, randomized study to compare the efficacy of rectus sheath block and
      surgical infiltration in providing postoperative analgesia.
