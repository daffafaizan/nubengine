      morbidity and the costs of endovascular versus conventional surgical repair of pararenal,
      supra-renal and type 4 THORACO-abdominal aortic aneurysms.

      The primary goal of the study is to demonstrate a significant drop in 30-day mortality and
      life threatening morbidity in the endovascular arm of the study. Our hypothesis, derived from
      the literature, that the average 30-days mortality is 3% after endovascular repair and 10%
      after open surgery justifies the design of a prospective study between endovascular therapy
      (250 patients (amendment) treated in 8 University hospitals with significant experience of
      the technique) and open repair (660 similar patients analyzed form the national database of
      the MOH).

      In-hospital morbidity are similarly expected to be lower in the endovascular group. We also
      wish to demonstrate that endovascular repair does not represent a significant over-cost, as
      compared to open repair. The cost of the implantable medical device (IMD), of follow-up
      screening, and of eventual repeated interventions should be compensated by a reduced stay in
      intensive care unit ICU, and by a reduced in-hospital length of stay.
