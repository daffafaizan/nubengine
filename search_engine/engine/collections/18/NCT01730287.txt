      teeth in stepwise excavation. The common material which is applied as a liner over the
      remained caries in SE is Calcium Hydroxide(CH). There are several reports of the solubility
      of this liner over time which could interact with sealing of the cavity in long term. It
      seems that a material with antibacterial activity, good sealing ability and suitable
      mechanical properties could cause SE be done efficiently with good prognosis.

      MTA is a biomaterial that has been introduced since 1993 with antibacterial property and good
      sealing ability. A New Endodontic Cement, Calcium Enriched Mixture (CEM) cement with good
      antibacterial effect like CH with sealing ability that is proposed to be similar to MTA
      according to its double sealing property. CEM cement has been suggested as a suitable
      material in pulp capping of permanent molars with irreversible pulpitis.
