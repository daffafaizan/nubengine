      Support Aging-in-Place for People with Long-Term Disabilities (RERC TechSAge). This study
      uses videoconferencing to translate an evidence-based exercise program for older adults,
      Seated Tai Chi for Arthritis, from an in-person setting to a remote class and to a different
      population, adults aging with mobility disabilities. In the 8-week Tele Tai Chi intervention,
      participants will use a tablet or computer to join a small-group, online class (1hr, twice
      weekly) from home; during each session, participants will exercise as a group along with the
      pre-recorded video lessons and have the opportunity for social interaction (via video chat)
      before and after class. The study will examine the effects of the Tele Tai Chi program on
      physical activity and social connectedness (primary outcomes), as well as exercise
      self-efficacy, falls efficacy, depression, quality of life, and pain (secondary outcomes) for
      adults aging with long-term mobility disabilities, a population likely to experience barriers
      to in-person exercise participation.
