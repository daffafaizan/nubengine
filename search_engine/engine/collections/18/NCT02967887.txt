      in advanced HCC. However, cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil acts on cells without tumor
      selectivity. Therefore, to improve the tumor selectivity and effectiveness of HAIC, molecular
      subtyping-based stratification strategies should be considered. In this study, patients who
      have progressed or intolerance to sorafenib with non-metastatic HCC in TNM stage III-IVA and
      ECOG PS 0 or 1, Child-Pugh class A will be enrolled. 96 patients with pre-treatment tumor
      biopsy will receive Cisplatin (60mg/m2 for 2h on day 2) and 5-fluorouracil (500mg/m2 for 5h
      on days 1-3) through implanted port system. This treatment will be repeated every 4 weeks, up
      to 6 times. The primary objective is to determine overall response rate, where benefit is
      defined as complete or partial response according to mRECIST V1.1. Secondary endpoints
      include time to progression, progression free survival. The biopsy tissue will be subjected
      to real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for quantification of gene
      expression levels. Patients will be categorized into two groups according to gene expression
      results, and then AUC value of ROC curve analysis will be evaluated as an exploratory
      endpoint to assess predictive performance of biomarker for therapeutic response of HAIC.
