      included. At random 22 patients undergo laparoscopic lateral suspension with mesh operation
      and 22 patients undergo laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy operation. Evaluation will take place
      during the surgery, at the postoperative visit after 4 weeks, 6th months and 12th months.
      Quality of life, degree of vaginal prolapse, safety, operation time and complications will be
      evaluated.

      Subjective assessments will include Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Michigan
      Incontinence Severity Index (M-ISI), Prolapse Quality of Life questionnaire (PQoL), Pelvic
      Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP-SS) and Visual Analog Score (VAS).

      Objective assessments will include routine gynecologic sonography, Pelvic Organ Prolapse
      Quantification System (POP-Q) and pelvic floor biometry measured by transperineal sonography.

      Transperineal sonography will include those measurements:

      Urethral rotation, Pelvic organ descent, Hiatal Diameter and the Anatomical localization of
      apex.
