      completing a circuit while carrying a backpack with a variable weight of 0.5 kg to 2.5 kg,
      according to the child´s age and sex. This weight range follows the guidelines of the World
      Health Organization, which states that the younger the female child is, the lighter the
      backpack should be, in order to assure the school children´s health condition. The following
      tasks should be carried out; from a sitting position, the child stands up and walks along a
      10m-long flat course, going up and down a 2-step rise (17 cm high x 27 cm wide) about halfway
      along that distance, to reach a bookshelf with three 0.5 kg objects (i.e. colorful plastic
      bowling pins filled with sand). The objects are placed on the top shelf at eye level, which
      should be removed, one by one, to the lower shelf at the level of the umbilicus, and then to
      the ground. Next, the objects should be placed on the lower shelf and then back to the top
      shelf. The child walks back along the same route. (S)he sits down, stands up and immediately
      starts the next lap. The following verbal instructions are given during the test: "sit" and
      "stand." The time required to walk five laps is registered; the less the time spent, the
      better the performance is. The test performance was evaluated by comparing the patient´s data
      with the data predicted by the equation, in his study with healthy children. The equation for
      girls is "time in TGlittre-P = 3.781-0.083 x AGE"; and boys, "time in TGlittre-P =
      4.025-0.123 x AGE".
