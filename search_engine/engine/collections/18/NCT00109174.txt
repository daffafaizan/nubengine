      Following infusion of [13C]glucose and/or [13C]acetate, in vivo MRS (magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy) can monitor the rate of flux of the 13C atom from glucose and/or acetate to
      glutamate to glutamine. Thus, this procedure can provide measure of glutamate (GLU) and
      glutamine (GLN) turnover in brain. We have established parameters to obtain these
      measurements in nonhuman primate brain. The current protocol seeks approval to optimize MRS
      parameters and to develop new MRS techniques for human brain using the GE 3T, the Siemens 3T,
      and the Siemens 7T device.

      Study population: All subjects will be aged 18 65 years, without serious medical illnesses
      and meet criteria listed in Section VI A.

      Design: Subjects will receive either oral administration of [13C]glucose or an intravenous
      infusion of [13C]glucose and/or [13C]acetate to approximately double their plasma glucose
      levels. The plasma acetate level will remain within the physiological range observed in
      humans (Lebon et al, 2002). While lying in the 3T or 7T device, serial data acquisitions will
      be obtained over ~2 h to optimize the experimental conditions so as to measure the 13C
      signals from GLU, GLN and other metabolisms in brain.

      Outcome measures: The primary goal of this study is to measure GLU/GLN turnover in brain.
      With no additional data acquisition, we can also obtain information on the synthesis of GABA,
      the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in brain. GLU is converted to GABA via the enzyme
      glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). While monitoring the transfer of 13C signal from GLU to
      GLN, we can simultaneously measure the transfer of 13C signal from GLU to GABA and thereby
      measure the activity of GAD (Li et al 2005). In addition to directly measure 13C signals, 13C
      labeling to brain metabolites can also be measured indirectly by detecting proton MRS during
      infusion of [13C]glucose and/or [13C]acetate.
