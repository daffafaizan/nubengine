      relation to the characteristics of their families, and to explore the similarities and
      differences in 4 different European countries. Parents and adolescents will complete
      questionnaires which incorporate and adapt many standard measures. The parent questionnaire
      includes components of : a) Family Adjustment and Cohesion Scale (FACES), b) Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire for parents (SDQ-parent), c) Parent Stress Index (PSI), d)
      Adoption Satisfaction Questionnaire (ASQ), d) Brodzinsky Scale (openness in family
      communication related to adoption), and e) basic demographic information.

      The adolescent questionnaire includes elements of : a) SDQ-adolescent, b) Health Behavior in
      School Children questionnaire (HBSC), c) Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), d) Lee Scale
      (Discrimination Scale for Adoptees).

      It is hoped that the study will permit a better understanding of the experiences of families
      and their children after international adoption. This knowledge will help potential adoptive
      families as well as families who have already adopted. This information is not yet available
      in a European context. In addition, the information will be valuable to adoption
      professionals. Moreover, the opportunity to compare outcomes and experiences of families and
      adolescents in 4 European countries will allow a better understanding of the contribution of
      different cultural contexts to these outcomes. It is hypothesized that different cultural
      practices and beliefs about adoption likely impact the experience of adoption by adolescents
      and parents. A better understanding of this dynamic will be useful clinically as well as at
      the community level and beyond.
