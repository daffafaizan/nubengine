      for inclusion criterion were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial. The HUK group was
      administered with HUK and standard treatment(general treatment for anti-platelet,
      lipid-lowering and improving circulation,etc.), the control group received only standard
      treatment. Kallikrein+Standard Treatment Group (general Treatment for anti-platelet,
      lipid-lowering and improving circulation,etc.) and Standard Treatment Group were randomly
      selected.

      At admission and discharge, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS), Barthel
      Index(BI), muscle strength were scored; The DTI were performed and DTT were utilized to
      reconstruct corticospinal tract to observe its direction and appearance changes then to
      evaluate the integrity and impairment degree of the corticospinal tract which was divided
      into four grades according to DTT presented compression, deformation, or rupture. Fractional
      anisotropy(FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC) of infarct region and corresponding
      contralateral normal regions were measured.

      Blood samples were collected to test serum myelin basic protein(MBP) and vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The primary endpoint is
      the short-term motor function prognosis of the AIS patients, we also evaluated the recovery
      of corticospinal tract and the serum MBP and VEGF changes during treatment in two groups.
