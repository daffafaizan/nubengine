      encounters versus traditional in-office postoperative visits in women undergoing pelvic
      reconstructive surgery. The postoperative experiences of both groups will be assessed via
      surveys. Virtual Clinical Encounter Group: - Receive video-conference call from office nurse
      48-72 hours post discharge from hospital - Receive video-conference call from fellow and/or
      attending physician approximately 30 days (4-6 weeks) from surgery -- Complete telephone
      survey one day later - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending
      physician approximately 90 days (10-12 weeks) from surgery -- Fill out surveys after office
      visit Traditional Office Group: - Receive telephone call from office nurse 48-72 hours post
      discharge from hospital - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending
      physician approximately 30 days (4-6 weeks) from surgery -- Complete telephone survey one day
      later - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending physician
      approximately 90 days (10-12 weeks) from surgery -- Fill out surveys after office visit
