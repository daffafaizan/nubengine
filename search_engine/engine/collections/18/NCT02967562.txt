      more prematurely more likely to require resuscitation

      Current UK guidelines advise initial resuscitation with the delivery of five 'inflation
      breaths' lasting 2-3 seconds with peak inflation pressure of 30cmH2O (20-25cm H2O in
      premature neonates). Previous studies have shown that despite resuscitation training,
      clinicians in both simulated and real resuscitation scenarios do not deliver the recommended
      duration of inflation breaths. This, combined with leaks around the facemask often being as
      large as 50% or greater, contributes to low expired tidal volumes during resuscitation, thus
      increasing the likelihood of hypoxia and delay in establishing effective respiration.

      The use of sustained inflations (up to 15 seconds), rather than intermittent shorter
      inflation breaths, has shown promising results, with reduction in the need for intubation,
      and the need for and duration of mechanical ventilation. Around 30% of units in Germany use
      sustained inflations as first line delivery room management, as do many other hospitals
      around the world. Resuscitation guidelines from the USA, UK and Europe suggest that sustained
      inflations should be researched further.

      Several studies have shown that for several lengths of inflation breaths, the expired tidal
      volume achieved is higher if the baby makes respiratory effort during the inflation (active
      inflation) and that stimulation of spontaneous respiratory effort is a key part in
      establishing an FRC, enabling spontaneous breathing, and increasing the likelihood of
      successful resuscitation.

      To date, there are no studies directly comparing whether prolonged inflations are more
      successful at provoking an inspiration than other methods of resuscitation. We therefore aim
      to compare a 15 second sustained inflation to repeated shorter inflations to determine which
      is more effective.
