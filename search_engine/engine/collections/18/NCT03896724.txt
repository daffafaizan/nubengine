    
      Participants will be randomised 2:1 to receive vaccination with the IMP (R21 adjuvanted with
      Matrix-M; Group 1 and Group 2) or control vaccination with Rabies Vaccine (Group 3).
      Participants and investigators will be blinded to group allocation for each participant.
      Efficacy of vaccination will be assessed by comparing the development of malaria between
      Groups 1 versus Group 2 participants.

      There are two study vaccines: the IMP, R21 adjuvanted with Matrix-M; and Rabies Vaccine.
      Group 1 (active vaccine group) participants will receive 3 vaccinations of R21 5μg with 25μg
      Matrix-M, 4 weeks apart via the intramuscular route, and a booster vaccination one year
      following the third vaccination.

      Group 2 (active vaccine group) participants will receive 3 vaccinations of R21 5μg with 50μg
      Matrix-M, 4 weeks apart via the intramuscular route, and a booster vaccination one year
      following the third vaccination.

      Group 3 (control group) participants will receive three vaccinations with rabies vaccine,
      four weeks apart, all given intramuscularly and a fourth vaccination with rabies vaccine one
      year following the third vaccination.
