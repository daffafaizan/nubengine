      interventional study assessing the efficacy and safety of the TER vs monthly regimens of 0.5
      mg ranibizumab intravitreal (IVT) injections in patients with newly diagnosed nAMD. Patients
      will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment arms, Treat and Extend or monthly regimens.

      There will be 3 periods in this study: Screening period (up to 14days), treatment period (11
      months), follow-up period (1 month). At randomization visit patients will be randomized into
      one of the 2 treatment groups Group I ranibizumab 0.5 mg based on monthly treatment or Group
      II ranibizumab 0.5 mg based on TER (randomization ratio of 1:1) and will receive the first
      dose of Investigational treatment. Patients in Group I the following visits will perform on
      monthly intervals. For patients in Group II the investigator will evaluate disease activity
      (i.e., signs of exudation) based on SD-OCT, and in case of absence of disease activity every
      next visit will be 2 weeks), with a maximum of a 12-week interval.
