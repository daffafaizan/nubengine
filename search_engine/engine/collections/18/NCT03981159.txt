      irreversible degeneration of nerve cells. The loss of these cells leads to the continuous
      decline in muscle function with alterations in biochemical and haematological parameters. The
      objective of this study was to examine the effects of exercise training on physical function
      and biochemical markers in elderly Alzheimer's disease patients.
