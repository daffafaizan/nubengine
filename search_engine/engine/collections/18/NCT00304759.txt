      course of radiotherapy (6000cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks-hypofractionated) or treatment
      with a conventional fractionation course (7800cGy in 39 fractions over 8 weeks-standard).
      Three-dimensional conformal radiation treatment techniques, including intensity modulated
      radiotherapy will be used for both hypofractionated and standard treatments to avoid normal
      tissue exposure to radiation and minimize the risk of acute and late treatment related
      toxicity. The primary outcome measure is biochemical (PSA) failure defined by the ASTRO
      consensus criteria. Secondary outcomes include biochemical-clinical failure (BCF), mortality
      from cancer, toxicity and health-related quality of life. It is planned to recruit 1204
      patients to the study. If the safety and efficacy of the shorter course are demonstrated,
      then its adoption would reduce the social, emotional and economic burden of treatment for
      patients and their families.
