      common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and transitions to dementia, increased fall risk, and poor
      quality of life. EF is a set of processes that include mental flexibility and attention that
      are needed to learn and optimize performance of complex cognitive and motor skills. Such
      skills include the ability to generalize task performance under different conditions (context
      processing) and to perform two tasks simultaneously termed dual-task (DT) performance.
      Deficits in EF lead to problems in daily functioning and loss of independence and create
      psychosocial and economic burdens on patients and caregivers and stakeholders including
      health care providers. There is currently no effective treatment in PD to address EF
      deficits. Our animal and clinical studies in PD demonstrate that skilled exercise facilitates
      neuroplasticity of the basal ganglia (BG), a brain region sub-serving EF and supports the
      hypothesis that exercise will reverse EF deficits in PD. Furthermore, recent studies in
      healthy aging support that skill-based exercise that specifically promotes motor skill
      fitness (MSF), compared with aerobic exercise that promotes cardiovascular fitness (CF), has
      a greater impact on EF and related BG circuits. The aim of this application is to compare and
      elucidate the effects of skill-based versus aerobic exercise versus control on MCI of the EF
      subtype in PD; we hypothesize that skill-based exercise will result in the greatest
      improvement in EF and lead to modification of underlying neural substrates.
