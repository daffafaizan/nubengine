      withdrawal. A minimum of 6 cycles of the combined therapies should be administered, unless
      progression occurs before or safety reasons cause the discontinuation of one or two drugs of
      the combination therapies. In case of no progression, it will be investigator's decision to
      continue or not the study treatment after 6 cycles according to his clinical practice.
