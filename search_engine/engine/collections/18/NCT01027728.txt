      sequential stages, Stage A and B. This protocol describes the objectives, design, and
      procedures for Stage A of the study. The protocol will be amended in future when sufficient
      data from Stage A have been collected to initiate Stage B. The protocol amendment will
      describe the objectives, design, and procedures for Stage B of the study.

      Stage A will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, sequential dose
      escalation sub-study in 24 subjects with stable RA. Three sequential dose cohorts of 8
      subjects will be included in this stage:

        -  Cohort 1: 100 mg CCX354-C or placebo

        -  Cohort 2: 100 mg CCX354-C or placebo

        -  Cohort 3: 200 mg CCX354-C or placebo

      Safety and PK data from each cohort will be reviewed by a data monitoring committee
      (DMC)before dose escalation to the next dose level. The study will proceed to Stage B only if
      the safety and tolerability profile of Stage A is deemed acceptable by the DMC.
