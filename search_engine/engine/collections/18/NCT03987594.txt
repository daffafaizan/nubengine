      TUF group, only fulguration on the Hunner lesion is performed. For TUF+HD group
      hydrodistension is performed for 8 minutes at pressure of 80cmH2O, and then fulguration on
      the Hunner lesion is performed. Therapeutic effect is evaluated using Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) pain score, O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis questionnaire (IC-Q), Pelvic pain
      urgency/frequency patient symptom scale (PUF), frequency volume chart parameters, EQ-5D
      Health Questionnaire, Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf), Patient Global Assessment
      (PGA) at the point of 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after operation. During the observational period,
      subject patients are not provided with any additional medical, physical or surgical treatment
      for symptom relief. Subject patient who complains of symptom requiring medical, physical or
      surgical intervention during the study period, is dropped from the study. Comparison of
      therapeutic efficacy between the two groups is performed using independent two sample t-test.
