      I. To determine the efficacy of AZD2171 in platinum sensitive and platinum insensitive
      disease, based on either RECIST criteria (for patients with measurable cancer
      radiographically) or clinical response benefit (modified Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup [GCIG]
      CA-125 response or stable disease for at least 16 weeks).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression-free survival. II. To assess modified GCIG CA-125 response rate.
      III. To assess duration of modified GCIG CA-125 response. IV. To assess the safety of the
      recommended phase 2 dose of AZD2171 in this asymptomatic patient population.

      V. To explore the pharmacodynamic effects of AZD2171 by correlating clinical outcomes with an
      angiogenic profile derived from serial assessments of soluble VEGFR2, circulating endothelial
      cell levels, and VEGFR phosphorylation in circulating endothelial cells.

      VI. To explore pharmacogenetic differences in kdr/flk-1, HIF1alpha, p53, and endothelial
      nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in PBMCs from subjects who consent separately for
      pharmacogenetic studies.

      VII. To determine whether oncogenic mutations predict response to AZD2171.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease
      sensitivity (platinum-sensitive disease vs platinum-insensitive disease).

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study.
