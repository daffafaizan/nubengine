      stenosis or valvular prosthesis,is the most common arrhythmia, with an estimated prevalence
      of 1.5-2%. AF is associated with a greater risk of arterial thromboembolic events, especially
      cerebrovascular, whose incidence is 5-7 times higher. The risk of death is also doubled, and
      AF has a greater degree of disability and probability of recurrence than stroke due to other
      causes. To prevent stroke in patients with NVAF, antithrombotic treatments are employed with
      oral anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and, in a number of circumstances,
      antiplatelet agents. Although VKA (mainly warfarin) are highly effective to reduce the risk
      of stroke, and have been the sole choice for stroke prevention during the last 50 years,
      their use is limited for a number of reasons: narrow therapeutic range, drug and food
      interactions, need for monitoring, and risk of bleeding. Recently, new oral anticoagulants
      (NOACs) have been marketed for this indication. The aim of this study was to determine the
      standard clinical practice followed in the treatment to prevent stroke in patients with NVAF
      in Turkey. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the current status of the clinical
      background of AF patients and to follow, analyze and evaluate patients with AF in a large
      multicenter nation-wide trial. The primary inclusion criteria will be age â‰¥18 years and with
      electrocardiographically confirmed NVAF (eg, by electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, etc).
      The enrollment of patients will be started in February 2014. All the participating
      institutions will enroll all consecutive patients with NVAF under regular outpatient care or
      under admission.
