    
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease
      characterized by deposition of tau and motor, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Since no
      effective treatment is available, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as tDCS,
      could be a valid complementary therapeutic approach. The tDCS modulates the spontaneous
      activity of the neural network by applying a direct current flow on the cortical brain areas
      (anodic or cathodic stimulation). Despite its efficacy in psychiatric disorders, the
      therapeutic use of tDCS in neurodegenerative diseases requires more systematic studies. The
      aim of this study is to verify the safety and efficacy of tDCS in PSP on motor, cognitive and
      behavioral symptoms.
