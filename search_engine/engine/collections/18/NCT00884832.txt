      unsatisfactory. In addition to weak anal sphincters, our data suggest that reduced rectal
      capacity may contribute to rectal hypersensitivity and the symptom of rectal urgency in FI.
      During a 4 week study, oral clonidine restored rectal capacity and improved fecal continence
      in women with urge-predominant FI. Clonidine improves fecal continence and stool consistency
      in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, we now propose a
      placebo-controlled study of clonidine for FI. Our aims are to (i) compare the effects of
      clonidine and placebo, to be given for 4 weeks, on symptoms, anal pressures, rectal
      compliance and sensation in women with FI. Forty four women (18-75 y) with urge predominant
      "idiopathic" FI and â‰¥ 4 episodes of FI during a 4 week screening period will be recruited to
      this study. Thereafter, patients will be treated with clonidine or placebo for 4 weeks. Bowel
      symptoms will be recorded in a diary. Anal sphincter pressures, rectal compliance and
      sensation will be evaluated before and during treatment with clonidine.
