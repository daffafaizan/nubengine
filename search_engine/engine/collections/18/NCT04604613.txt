      I. Validate the use of a molecular panel of estrogen-induced genes to predict recurrence in
      low risk endometrial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Calculate the positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV)/sensitivity
      (Sens)/specificity (Spec) of lymph node mapping to predict pelvic lymph node involvement.

      II. Correlate CA125 and HE4 levels with recurrence and to explore the use of other serum
      biomarkers to predict recurrence.

      III. Describe patterns of recurrence in a low risk patient population. IV. Determine if
      molecular panel can predict lymph node involvement in low risk endometrial cancer patients
      who undergo pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.

      V. Compare performance of molecular panel to the Mayo low risk criteria for prediction of
      lymph node involvement.

      VI. Compare performance of molecular panel to the high intermediate risk criteria from
      Gynecologic Oncology Group, trial 99 (GOG 99) for prediction of recurrence.

      VII. Determine the feasibility of lymph node mapping in this patient population.

      VIII. Determine the morbidity and mortality of lymph node dissection and mapping.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node mapping. Patients may also undergo
      bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at the direction of the treating physician. If peritoneal
      disease or other contraindications to lymphatic mapping are detected at the time of surgery,
      mapping and sentinel node biopsy are performed at the surgeon's discretion. At the time of
      hysterectomy, patients undergo collection of tissue for molecular testing. Before and after
      surgery, patients also undergo collection of blood samples for tumor marker analysis.
