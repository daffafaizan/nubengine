      Surviving Program (CTS) was translated into German. The content of the CTS was adapted to
      breast cancer specific needs in three interdisciplinary workshops based on a participatory
      approach including active patient engagement. Additional disease-specific topics were
      developed and confirmed applying a multi-stakeholder e-rating approach. After a consensus
      meeting with the participation of breast cancer survivors, health care professional and
      international experts in the field of self-management, consensus on the program was reached
      in June 2017, resulting in the CTS-BC-CH program, i.e. a standardized manual for course
      leaders.

      This pilot study aims to explore the reach of the CTS-BC-CH program (integrated into the
      clinical pathway) and to investigate its preliminary effectiveness for female Swiss breast
      cancer patients. The CTS-BC-CH is delivered in two breast cancer centers in in the
      German-speaking part of Switzerland as a group-based program with seven weekly sessions of
      2.5 - 3 hours led by trained peer-leaders. Course leaders have to complete a 4-days training
      provided by certified master trainers. First, participants are enrolled for usual care,
      followed by participants who will attend the CTS-BC-CH course. Participants will complete
      self-reported questionnaires at three time points over a period of 6 months.
