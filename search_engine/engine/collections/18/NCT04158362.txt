    
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of standard endocrine therapy + abemaciclib
      combination versus standard chemotherapy based on progression-free survival (PFS) within 24
      weeks, in patients with visceral metastases of ER+/HER2- breast cancer and high tumor burden.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either:

        -  Standard chemotherapy regimen physician's choice either (paclitaxel or capecitabine)

        -  Standard endocrine therapy regimen physician's choice + abemaciclib (Letrozole or
           anastrozole for patients nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) naÃ¯ve or relapsing >1
           year after the end of adjuvant endocrine therapy, and fulvestrant for patients relapsing
           on adjuvant or less than one year after completion of adjuvant NSAI)
