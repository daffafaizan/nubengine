      drug abuse and addiction; determine the potential use of new therapies, both pharmacological
      and psychosocial; and decipher the long-term effects of drugs of abuse on the development,
      maturation, function, and structure of the brain and other organ systems. In support of the
      IRP's work, the scientific goal of this screening protocol is to assess potential research
      participants' eligibility for NIDA IRP research studies. Screening will include medical and
      psychological tests and procedures. The data collected during screening are a unique and
      valuable source of information that aids in NIDA's mission. Therefore, a secondary goal of
      this protocol is to obtain data that characterizes the population of subjects contacting NIDA
      about research participation and to analyze data so obtained, such as that on the prevalence
      and consequences of HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and related diseases.
