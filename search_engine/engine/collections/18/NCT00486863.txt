      treatment of Schistosomiasis japonicum in pregnant women living in endemic villages of Leyte,
      The Philippines. The study will enroll 375 pregnant women, ages 18 and over, infected with S.
      japonicum. The primary study objective is to quantify the efficacy of PZQ treatment for S.
      japonicum at 12-16 weeks gestation on newborn birth weight among live births. This will be
      assessed by measuring birth weight within 96 hours of delivery to 10 grams. The secondary
      objectives are to: 1) assess treatment efficacy with respect to maternal and newborn
      nutritional status and maternal parasitologic response to treatment; 2) collect preliminary
      safety and toxicity data on use of PZQ among pregnant women and their newborns; 3) identify
      extra-placental mechanisms mediating the hypothesized beneficial effect of PZQ on birth
      outcomes; and 4) identify extra-placental mechanisms mediating the hypothesized beneficial
      effect of PZQ on birth outcomes. Participants will be involved in study related procedures
      for 9 months (8 months pre-natally and 1 month post-natally) for mother and infant. This
      study is linked to DMID protocol 08-0049.
