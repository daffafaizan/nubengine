    
      In this study, patients who are undergoing thoracotomies will be consented separately from
      the surgery itself.

      Patients will be consented for the study in the surgical clinic or on the day of the surgery
      in the Surgical Admission Suites (SAS), prior to being taken to the OR. The study
      participants will be given a standard 266 mg single dose injection of liposomal bupivacaine
      by the surgeon at the start of the surgery. Immediately prior to the injection of the local
      anesthetic, 5 ml of blood will be drawn from the patient via the arterial line. The arterial
      line will be placed as part of standard surgery procedure and not for the purposes of the
      study. Blood will then be drawn from the patient after the injection of the local anesthetic
      at 5 mins, 15 mins, 30 mins, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Each blood draw will be 5
      ml. Blood will be drawn a total of 13 times.

      The arterial line will not remain in the patient for the purposes of the study and will be
      removed per standard procedure. If more blood samples are needed after the arterial line is
      removed, we will first attempt to obtain blood an existing venous catheter. If blood cannot
      be obtained this way, a venipuncture will be performed.

      Blood samples will be analyzed for the following pharmacokinetic parameters: area under the
      serum concentration-time infinity (AUC), maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax), time to
      attain Cmax (Tmax), and apparent terminal elimination half-life (T1/2).

      At the time blood samples are drawn, pain scores will be recorded on a standard ten-point
      pain scale. These pain scores will be omitted if the patient is under general anesthesia.
