      determine subjects' eligibility through medical history, physical exam, lung function
      testing, and exercise testing. Those who qualify will be invited back to 2 test visits, at
      which subjects will undergo lung function testing and high-resolution CT scans before and
      after treatment with one of the study drugs. All subjects will take both study drugs: those
      who are randomized to Perforomist at Test Visit 1 will take Foradil at Test Visit 2, and vice
      versa.
