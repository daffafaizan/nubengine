      muscular fatigue or pain precluding to maintain the position. Each exercise will perform
      under two conditions.

      On the control condition, the patients will perform both tests without any cognitive
      condition, while on the experimental condition they will be instructed to perform both tests
      while performing a mathematical subtracting task (starting at 300, by sevens).

      The starting condition will be randomly assigned with a 5-minute rest prior to the next
      condition. Time to task failure and pain perception using a visual analog scale will be
      assessed.
