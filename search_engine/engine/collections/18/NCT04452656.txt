      erector spinae plane block in pediatric patients undergoing corrective cardiac surgeries
      versus fentanyl infusion as the control group. Our primary outcome will be the total dose of
      intraoperative fentanyl boluses.

      Randomization will be achieved by using an online random number generator. Patient codes will
      be placed into sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes by a research assistant who is
      not involved in the study. A medical personnel not involved in patient management will be
      responsible for opening the envelope and give the instructions contained within each envelope
      to theanesthesiologist who is expert in doing the ESPB in patients included within the block
      group. this expert anaesthesiologistwill not be involved in collecting data but another
      anaesthesia doctor will be responsible for patientmanagement and collecting the
      intraoperative and postoperative data.
