      laser technology under the guidance of optical coherence tomography imaging (OCT). The laser
      modality that we plan to use is the long-pulse Nd:YAG 1064nm laser, which is a non-ablative
      laser already shown to effectively treat BCC. Laser treatment of BCC has limited precedent in
      the literature, but the addition of OCT has the opportunity to enhance outcomes by better
      targeting the treatment and permitting more precise monitoring of clearance. We propose to
      use OCT imaging to guide the laser treatment to achieve optimal efficacy with minimized
      side-effects.
