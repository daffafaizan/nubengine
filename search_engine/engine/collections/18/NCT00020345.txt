      progression, and survival in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated
      with neoadjuvant intraperitoneal gemcitabine and intravenous gemcitabine with radiotherapy
      followed by surgery and adjuvant intraperitoneal gemcitabine, intravenous gemcitabine, and
      fluorouracil.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal gemcitabine in these patients.

      III. Correlate patterns of mRNA expression with response to this regimen and prognosis in
      these patients.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine intraperitoneally (IP) every 6 hours for 4
      doses on day 1. Treatment repeats in 1 week for a total of 2 courses. Beginning 1-3 weeks
      after completion of IP chemotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on
      day 1 or 2 of each week and radiotherapy on days 1-5 of each week for 6 weeks. Within 6 weeks
      after the completion of combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients with stable or
      responding disease undergo surgical resection. Patients with completely resected
      extrapancreatic disease then receive 2 additional courses of IP gemcitabine beginning 1-3
      weeks after surgery. Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of IP chemotherapy, patients
      receive gemcitabine IV once weekly for a total of 3 weeks and fluorouracil IV continuously
      for up to 6 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 10-100 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
