      year old and above). Cluster sampling will be used to select respondents that will be
      representative of the Malaysian population. Selected respondent will be interviewed,
      anthropometric measurement taken, blood and urine sample taken.

      Blood will be analyzed for thyroid function (thyroxine, triiodothyronine and thyroid
      stimulating hormone), autoantibodies (anti-thyroperoxidase and anti-thyroglobulin). Urine
      will be analyzed for urinary iodine.

      Those diagnosed with autoimmune thyroid disorders with strong family history of thyroid
      disorders (multiplex multi-generation family involvement) will have their blood sent for
      whole exome sequencing and linkage analysis done to identify possible susceptible gene for
      autoimmune thyroid disorders

      Respondents detected to have hypo- or hyper- and subclinical hypo- or hyperthyroidism will be
      referred to their nearest health centre for further evaluation and treatment appropriate for
      their condition.
