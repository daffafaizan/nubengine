      artery disease (CAD). Well accepted as a lifestyle disease, known risk factors for CAD
      development include changes in blood lipid content and type as well as micro inflammation in
      the arterial wall. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides are increased, high
      density lipoprotein (HDL) is reduced. Furthermore, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome,
      hypertension, overweight, reduced physical activity and smoking also precede CAD development.
      Common for many of the risk factors is that they are induced by improper diet. Recent
      research has shown that especially total amount, composition and quality of the macro
      nutrients, protein, carbohydrate and fats, is important. In this project we will explore
      changes in blood gene expression in response to a western and a balanced crossover diet
      intervention.
