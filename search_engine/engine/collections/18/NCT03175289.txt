      I. Investigate the impact of a prophylactic targeted exercise program, expiratory muscle
      strength training (EMST), on swallowing function and well-being of individuals on head and
      neck cancer (HNC).

      II. Determine the impact of EMST on objective respiratory measures of individuals with HNC.

      III. Determine the relationship between mean dose across the swallowing muscles (oral tongue
      and supra-hyoids, base of tongue, superior, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors,
      proximal esophagus)/dose on each muscle and the swallowing functional outcomes from aim 1.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care comprising of written patient education materials
      focusing on oral care, signs/symptoms of dysphagia/aspiration, and trismus. Patients
      participate in a therapy session conducted by a speech pathologist over 30 minutes once per
      week for 6 weeks during chemoradiation therapy. Patients also perform prescribed exercises at
      home daily for 3 sets of 10 repetitions.

      participate in a therapy session conducted by a speech pathologist over 30 minutes once per
      week for 6 weeks during chemoradiation therapy. Patients perform prescribed exercises at home
      daily for 3 sets of 10 repetitions. Patients also participate in an EMST session over 30
      minutes comprising of 5 sets of 5 repetitions daily for 5 days per week for 6 weeks during
      chemoradiation therapy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
