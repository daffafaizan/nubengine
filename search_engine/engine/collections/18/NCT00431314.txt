           pressure, finger pressure and skin autofluorescence.

        2. Measuring toe- and finger pressure before and during hemodialysis to determine the
           chance of developing critical limb ischemia in the extremities.

        3. To assess the differences in finger pressure in hemodialysis patients before and during
           hemodialysis in patients with either arteriovenous fistula in the upper extremity or
           not.

        4. To predict mortality and cardiovascular disease by determine the fastness of
           accumulation of Advanced-Glycation-Endproducts (this concerns follow-up measurements of
           skin autofluorescence; another study has collected data of skin autofluorescence in
           hemodialysis patients in our centre in 2003)
