      this is curative in only approximately 70% of patients. If not adequately treated, the
      disease can have significant morbidity largely due to the development of hypertension,
      diabetes and malignancy as well as possible loss of vision or other neurologic complications
      of a large pituitary mass. Inadequately treated acromegaly is also associated with a
      mortality rate 2-3 fold over the general population. All the mechanisms responsible for the
      increased morbidity and mortality in acromegaly as well as what biochemical criteria should
      be used during treatment in order to normalize the increased morbidity and mortality are not
      known. This study aims to follow patients with acromegaly prospectively from active disease
      through treatment in order to identify these factors.
