    
      Using ultrasound images prospectively acquired, the purpose of this study entails a second
      review of ultrasound images with suspicious breast lesions using an interactive "deep
      learning" (or artificial intelligence) program developed by SamsungMedison Co.,Ltd.

      The images will be reviewed by the radiologists twice: first without, and then with
      assistance of artificial intelligence program by SamsungMedison Co., Ltd.

      BIRADS system will be used in this study.

      The objectives of the study are twofold: to quantify the statistical equivalence of
      radiologists' opinion and AI's output (CADe), and to check BIRADS score-based diagnostic
      accuracy (CADx) that is gained by the Radiologists' use of this interactive tool
