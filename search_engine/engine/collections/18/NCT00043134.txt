        -  Compare the efficacy of low-dose decitabine vs standard supportive care, in terms of
           overall survival, of elderly patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Compare the response rate and progression-free survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine the toxicity of decitabine in these patients.

        -  Assess the duration of hospitalization and number of blood transfusions in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to cytogenetic risk factors (good vs poor vs intermediate vs unknown), disease
      (primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) vs secondary MDS), and participating center. Patients
      with a successful cytogenetic exam are also stratified according to overall International
      Prognostic Scoring System score (intermediate 1 vs intermediate 2 vs high risk). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive decitabine IV over 4 hours every 8 hours for 3 days. Treatment
           repeats every 6 weeks for 4-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive care. Quality of life is assessed at
           baseline, every 6 weeks during therapy, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 3
           months thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
