      and severely disrupt family well-being. The objective of the protocol is to test the impact
      of Omega 3-6 on pre-specified biological signatures (IL-1β, IL-2, and IFNγ) and to correlate
      changes in the biological signatures with changes in ASD symptoms. Fatty acid supplements are
      natural products with anti-inflammatory properties often used for treatment of ASD symptoms,
      but the efficacy remains unproven.
