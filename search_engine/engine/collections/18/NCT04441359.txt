      formula with a mixture of short and long chain inulin-type oligosaccharides on
      immunological-health related outcomes, as well as on gastrointestinal function and well-being
      in infants during the first year of life. Effects on infant growth, tolerance and on the
      composition of fecal microbiota were further objectives of this study. The study was
      conducted as a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy
      term infants. The two groups of the study are product group (standard infant formula
      supplemented with inulin-type fructans) and control group (non-supplemented standard infant
      formula).
