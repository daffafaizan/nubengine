      "NutrakosÂ®" Amino Acid Food Supplement, both photoexposed and not photoexposed on skin areas
      (forearm volar and dorsal surface) by non-invasive instrumental measurements; the product
      will be tested for 1 month by female subjects, aged 35-70 years with skin photoaging. An
      additional aim of this study was to evaluate the product tolerance both by investigator and
      volunteers.
