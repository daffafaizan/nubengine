      interventions because these procedures usually require repeat scans, which causes more
      radiation exposure to the patients. Computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy is widely
      used in diagnosis of lung nodules with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 93%-97%. Compared
      with the large lung lesions, computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy for lung nodules
      might require more scanning to adjust the position of needle tip. Therefore, it might expose
      the patients to more radiation. However, studies regarding computed tomography-guided core
      needle biopsy for lung nodules are still lacking.

      In this study, investigators aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy and radiation exposure
      between low-dose and standard-dose computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy for lung
      nodules.
