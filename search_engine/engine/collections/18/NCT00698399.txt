      serum of patients who are undergoing liver transplantation surgery. This study will utilize
      the biological markers, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), NGAL, and cystatin-C, sensitive
      markers of renal medullary injury in the blood and allantoin, a marker of oxidative stress as
      indicators of renal injury in a kidney during liver transplants. It is hypothesized that: (1)
      these markers are less pronounced in living donor liver transplant recipient patients than in
      cadaveric liver transplant recipients, and (2) these markers are less pronounced in cadaveric
      liver transplant recipients in which a "piggy-back" technique was used versus recipients in
      which a total venous occlusion technique was used. This study will be done in a multi-center
      format, along with researchers at UCSF
