        -  Determine the rate of clinical and hematologic response in patients with Philadelphia
           chromosome-positive recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia or previously
           untreated or recurrent or refractory blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia when
           treated with arsenic trioxide.

        -  Determine the duration of hematologic response and overall survival of these patients
           when treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pattern of clinical adverse experience in these patients when treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 2-3 hours daily for 28 days. Patients who respond
      may receive a second course of therapy beginning 28 days from the last dose of the first
      course.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-49 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
