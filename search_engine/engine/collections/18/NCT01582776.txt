    
      This study is an open label, multicenter study with two phases:

      The Phase IB part of the study is a dose escalation study of lenalidomide (Revlimid)
      administered orally during on 3 weeks of every 28-day cycle, in combination with fixed doses
      of obinutuzumab (GA101) in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma patients.

      The Phase II part of the study is an efficacy study of the association of the recommended
      dose of lenalidomide associated with GA101 in 2 separate populations of patients:
      relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell
      lymphoma: cohort 1), relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (cohort 2) and previously
      untreated follicular lymphoma (cohorts 3 and 4). First, all patients will receive a
      combination of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide for a total of 6 cycles. Patients who achieve at
      least a partial response after 6 cycles will receive a maintenance treatment with
      obinutuzumab for 2 years and Lenalidomide for 1 year as tolerated, or until disease
      progression.
