      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of pemetrexed disodium in children and adolescents
           with refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate the presence of the C677T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrolate
           reductase gene, the presence of a polymorphism in the enhancer region of the thymidylate
           synthase (TS) gene promoter (2R and 3R tandem repeats), the presence of a polymorphism
           within one of those repeats, and the presence of a functional polymorphism in the
           3'-untranslated region with toxicity in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels at study entry with toxicity in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate various gene expression profiles with response in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pemetrexed disodium until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
