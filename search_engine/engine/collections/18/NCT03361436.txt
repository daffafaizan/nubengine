      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of radiation and eribulin mesylate
      (eribulin) when used in combination for the preoperative treatment of retroperitoneal
      liposarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of a preoperative chemoradiation protocol for retroperitoneal
      liposarcoma.

      II. To assess the surgical outcomes of retroperitoneal liposarcoma resections after
      preoperative chemoradiation.

      III. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of eribulin in combination with radiation in
      subjects with retroperitoneal liposarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of eribulin mesylate.

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 and
      undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week beginning on day
      8 of cycle 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may undergo surgery within 3-10 weeks after
      radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 9 weeks, and
      then every 6 months for 10 years.
