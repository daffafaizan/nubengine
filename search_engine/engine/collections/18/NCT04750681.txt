    
      This study has been designed as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled interventional
      study.

      Sixty-six subjects were randomly allocated to the control (placebo) or test (Saffr'activ®)
      group.

      A screening visit was scheduled within 4 weeks before Day -7 (study inclusion). At Day -7 and
      Day 0, questionnaires were completed to evaluate sleep quality, stress level and quality of
      life. Between Day -7 and Day 0 baseline data for actimeter and sleep diary were registered.
      Then, subjects were supplemented during 6 weeks with the placebo or saffron (Saffr'activ®)
      product, depending on their group. Following the baseline period, two other periods of one
      week were scheduled to collect actigraphy data: between 2 and 3 (from Day 14 to Day 21) weeks
      and between 5 and 6 (from Day 35 to Day 42) weeks after the beginning of the intervention. At
      the middle (Day 21) and at the end of the study (Day 42), questionnaires were completed to
      evaluate sleep quality, stress level and/or quality of life.
