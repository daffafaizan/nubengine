      still accounts for a high rate of morbidity in patients diagnosed with CD. Recently, a phase
      II multicenter randomized study was reported showing that expanded adipose tissue derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (atMSCs) in combination with fibrin glue was an effective and safe
      treatment for complex perianal fistula. However, dose escalation of allogeneic bone marrow
      (bm) MSCs for the local treatment of perianal fistulas has not been studied.

      In this study, three escalating doses will be tested in a total of three cohorts. MSC
      implantation will be preceded by surgical localization, curettage of the fistulous tract and
      closure of the internal opening. Per cohort, patients will be randomized in a 5:2 fashion to
      receive either 10x10^6 (cohort 1), 30x10^6 (cohort 2) or 90x10^6 (cohort 3) bmMSCs or no
      cells (control group).

      The primary endpoint will be assessed at week 12: i) the number of adverse and serious
      adverse events and ii) a reduction in the number of draining fistulas, which is defined as
      absence of discharge and absence of collections of â‰¥2 cm directly related to the treated
      fistulas tracts as measured by MRI.
