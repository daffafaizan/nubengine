      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of irinotecan when
           administered with temozolomide and vincristine in young patients with refractory solid
           tumors, including brain tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of this regimen in patients with low- vs high-risk UGT1A1
           genotypes.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A9, and BCRP genotypes with the pharmacokinetics and
           pharmacodynamics of irinotecan and its metabolites in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are stratified
      according to UGT1A1 genotype (high-risk [7/7 or 6/7 genotype AND bilirubin â‰¥ 0.6 mg/dL] vs
      low-risk [absence of high-risk criteria]) if a high-risk patient experiences a dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT).

      Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 and oral irinotecan on days 1-5 and 8-12.
      Patients also receive vincristine IV over 1 minute on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience DLT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
