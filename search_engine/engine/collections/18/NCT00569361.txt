      described as a risk factor to develop asthma. The objective of the study was to evaluate the
      contribution of the respiratory epithelium to development of allergic rhinitis and asthma and
      to identify the molecular mechanisms driving rhinitis toward asthma.

      Methods: Using a human pangenomic microarray, we established expression profiles of nasal
      epithelial cells, collected by brushing of patients belonging to one of four distinct
      children 2 to 18 years of age groups:

        1. allergic rhinitis to dust mite (AR) isolated (n=12),

        2. AR associated with bronchial hyperreactivity (n=12),

        3. AR associated with asthma (n=14),

        4. control (n=14).
