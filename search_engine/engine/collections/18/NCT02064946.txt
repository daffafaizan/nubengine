      deprivation therapy (ADT)-related side effects including ADT-induced bone loss, decreased
      muscle mass, falls, reduced muscle strength, and diminished physical performance in older
      prostate cancer patients. The vitamin D supplementation is aimed at reducing fracture risk by
      maintaining proper bone density, thereby preventing osteoporotic/osteopenic conditions and
      increasing muscle mass. Both vitamin D and exercise are efficacious in maintaining proper
      bone health and muscle mass among the general population, but little research has been done
      on prostate cancer patients and survivors. Vitamin D could reduce fracture risk among
      prostate cancer survivors.
