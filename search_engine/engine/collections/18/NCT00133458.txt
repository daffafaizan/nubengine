      subarachnoid cysticercosis. It will enroll 120 individuals, male and female age 18 to 65, and
      diagnosed with subarachnoid cysticercosis, a disease caused by the invasion of the basal part
      of your brain by a parasite named Taenia solium. Subarachnoid cysticercosis is usually
      treated with albendazole for one month to kill the parasite. This study will determine if two
      months of albendazole (ABZ) therapy is better than one-month. The study will last 3 years.
