      jugular vein cannulation in the patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.

      Ultrasound-guided central vein cannulation has many advantages, giving the operator the
      possibility of choosing the most appropriate and safest venous access on the basis of
      ultrasound assessment, performing a 100% safe insertion, ruling out malposition or
      pleuropulmonary damages, during and after the procedure.

      There is an increasing body of evidence supporting the use of ultrasound guidance for CVC
      placement.

      This makes the strong rationale to conduct this research thus the aim of this study is to
      evaluate the real benefits i.e outcome of Long versus Short Axis ultrasound guided approach
      for internal jugular vein cannulation in the patient for elective cardiac surgery as central
      venous cannulation (CVC).
