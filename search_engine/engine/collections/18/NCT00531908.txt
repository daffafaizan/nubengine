      of acromegaly in the same subject. We will also compare the response to furosemide
      administrated before and after treatment of acromegaly in the same subject. We expected that
      the response to amiloride will be greater before than after treatment, while the response to
      furosemide will be lesser before than after treatment.

      Definition: Extended description of the protocol, including information not already contained
      in other fields, such as comparison(s) studied.

      Patients will be recruited in the Department of Endocrinology and Reproductive diseases in
      BICETRE University Hospital and will be explored in the Centre for Clinical Investigation of
      HEGP. Investigations will be performed during 4 separate day-hospital stays (2 pre-treatment
      and 2 post treatment) in the CIC of HEGP. The tests will consist of blood and urine sample
      collections before and after a single dose administration of furosemide or amiloride. The
      tests will be performed before treatment of acromegaly in random order and separated by
      48hours, interval performed before treatment, and repeated in the same order after
      normalization of IGF1 by appropriate treatment.

      The study will last for 2 years, with a 12 months maximal participation of each patient
