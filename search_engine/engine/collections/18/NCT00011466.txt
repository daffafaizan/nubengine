      their sibling controls, and 25 children from control families without ADHD in order to assess
      their protein, carbohydrate, fat, calorie, and multiple specific nutrient intakes. In
      addition, a questionnaire will be completed on each child describing several aspects of
      eating behavior, food choices, and gastrointestinal, allergic, and infectious concomitants.
