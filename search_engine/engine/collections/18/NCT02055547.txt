    
      This was a 3 part, randomized, single and multiple ascending-dose trial that evaluated the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of MK-8521 in healthy
      non-obese male (Part 1-Panels A and B, Panels C, D, and E of Part 2, and Part 3 Panel H)
      participants between the ages of 18 and 45 years and obese male participants (Part 2, Panel
      F) 45 to 65 years of age. An optional Panel G in Part 2 per protocol did not occur.

      Part 1 was a single rising dose study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of single
      subcutaneous (SC) doses of MK-8521. Two panels of 8 healthy young non-obese male participants
      were dosed in up to 3 alternating dosing periods of MK-8521 or placebo (in a 6:2 ratio).
      Participants had a minimum 7 day washout between dosing periods.

      Part 2 was a multiple-rising dose study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple
      SC doses of MK-8521. Three panels (C-E) of 8 healthy young non-obese male participants
      received daily SC doses of MK-8521 or placebo (in a 6:2 ratio) as a titration regimen for 10
      consecutive days. One panel (Panel F) of 8 older obese male participants received daily SC
      doses of MK-8521 or placebo (in a 6:2 ratio) as a titration regimen for 14 consecutive days.

      Part 3 was a single dose, 3-period crossover study in 12 healthy lean male participants.
      Participants were randomized into 6 treatment groups and received a sequence of 3 treatments
      (MK-8521 at 35μg, 125μg and placebo). All participants in Part 3 received MK-8521 (high dose
      of 125μg and low dose of 35 μg) and placebo. There was a minimum 7 day washout between each
      dosing period for each individual participant.
