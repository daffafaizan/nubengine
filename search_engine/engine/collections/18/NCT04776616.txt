      (STAI) questionnaire, undergo screening for ACE score (adverse childhood experiences), and
      will be asked about basic demographic data. After they complete the initial surveys, the
      patient will be assigned to either the control group or the experimental group. They will be
      sent home with the light, along with instructions to use their light every night for 1-2
      hours as ambient lighting. We hope to enroll a maximum of 26 patients in this study with 1:1
      randomization (13 control, 13 experiment).

      At approximately halfway through the intervention, the PI will call the patient and ask how
      often she has been using the light, how long she uses the light for every night, and whether
      she has noticed any effects (either positive or negative).

      At the prenatal visit around 36 weeks gestation or at time of delivery, whichever is sooner,
      patients will be asked by the PI to turn in their light and also fill out the STAI once
      again.

      After delivery, the PI will review the medical record and record any change in opioid
      replacement therapy during pregnancy as well as the total dose of opiate required during the
      inpatient admission for delivery.
