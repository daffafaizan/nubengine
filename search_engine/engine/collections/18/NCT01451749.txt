      impairment but of insufficient severity to constitute dementia1,which is a transitional stage
      between normal aging and dementia. Amnestic MCI is the most common subtype of MCI, which
      shows the least reversion to normal, and is defined as a significant impairment in memory but
      with no impairment in activities of daily living. In an interventional study of patients
      meeting Petersen criteria for amnestic MCI, 16% progressed to dementia per year, 99% of whom
      received an AD diagnosis. Hence, MCI, in particular amnestic MCI is generally recognized in
      many cases to represent prodromal AD and becomes a new target for prevention and treatment of
      AD.

      The specific aims for the study is to evaluate change in Efficacy and safety of shenwu
      capsule in treating amnestic MCI. Using a randomized controlled parallel group design, 324
      older adults diagnosed with amnestic MCI participate in a 6-month supervised protocol of
      either shenwu capsule or donepezil. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at
      baseline, and months 3 and 6. Before the 6-month intervention, medial temporal atrophy (MTA)
      or hippocampal volume atrophy on the CT or MRI scan are assessed for all subjects. The
      results of this study may provide support for a safer and inexpensive treatment strategy that
      specifically targets individuals with the mild cognitive impairment that directly influence
      risk of developing dementia for older adults.
