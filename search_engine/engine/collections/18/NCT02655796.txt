      falls result in serious injuries representing a significant source of morbidity and
      mortality. Good evidence shows that many falls can be prevented. Thus, identifying people
      with risk of falling is crucial. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the screening
      accuracy of a device (OAK) in assessing fall risk in the elderly.

      Participants are recruited at IRCCS Galeazzi Orthopedic Hospital in Milan, among outpatients
      and healthy volunteers. A brief questionnaire is administered in order to collect data
      relevant to the CDC Algorithm for Fall Risk Assessment. Then, participants are assessed
      through the OAK device. The OAK assessment is evaluated in terms of performance, accuracy (in
      comparison to the CDC Algorithm for Fall Risk Assessment) and safety.
