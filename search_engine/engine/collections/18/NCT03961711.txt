      performed in the United States. As the elderly proportion of the population continues to
      grow, it is estimated that the number of total hip arthroplasty will grow by 71 percent and
      total knee arthroplasty will grow by 85 percent by the year 2030 (Sloan, M The Journal of
      Bone and Joint Surgery 2018). As these numbers continue to rise, health care delivery must
      evolve into a more efficient, cost effective system without compromising the quality of the
      care delivered.

      Telemedicine involves using electronic communications and software to provide clinical
      services to patients in place of an in-person visit. Benefits of telemedicine include
      avoiding unnecessary trips to hospitals, saving time, and reducing the number of working days
      missed (Asiri, A Acta Inform Med 2018). Used in general surgery followup care, anonymous
      survey responses demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction with 85% expressing a desire to
      utilize telemedicine for followup care in the future (Nikolian, V Annals of Surgery 2018).
      Postoperative telemedicine has been studied in many specialties, but literature exploring its
      use in orthopedics has been scant.
