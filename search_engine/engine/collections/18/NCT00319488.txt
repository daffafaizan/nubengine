    
      Acute Intervention Management Strategies (AIMS) is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,
      placebo-controlled parallel comparison study that will compare the effectiveness of three
      treatments, when given at the onset of RTI-associated symptoms, in increasing the proportion
      of symptom-free days over the entire treatment period of the 5- to 9-month study. There will
      be a 2-week period to qualify and characterize participants, who at that time will have no
      lower respiratory tract symptoms other than mild cough. A total of 244 participants will be
      randomized to one of three treatment groups and followed for the remainder of the
      fall-winter-early spring season. Participants will receive one of the following treatment
      regimens for 7 days, at the first sign of RTI-associated symptoms: 1) active ICS plus placebo
      LTRA plus albuterol inhalation treatments four times daily; 2) active LTRA plus placebo ICS
      plus albuterol inhalation treatment four times daily; or 3) placebo ICS plus placebo LTRA
      plus albuterol inhalation treatments four times daily.
