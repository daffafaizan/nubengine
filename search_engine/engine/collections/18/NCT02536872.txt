      clinics at Medway NHS Foundation Trust. Patients will be identified from previous records and
      also prospectively from new patients. They will be sent information regarding the trial
      before attending their first appointment.

      Patients attending urogynaecology clinics will provide a fresh clean catch specimen of urine.
      A conventional hospital Mid stream speciemn of urine (MSU) will be sent. Urine will be
      dipsticked for nitrites and leucocyte esterase. The urine will then be spun and undergo
      microscopy using a special stain (looking for intracellular organisms in shed urothelial
      cells). The urothelial cells will be cleaned with antibiotics. The cells will then be lysed
      and their contents cultured. The contents will undergo Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
      sequencing to identify bacteria. Sensitivity testing will be used to assess and deliver the
      appropriate antibiotic regime.

      Women will be treated with a 6 week course of antibiotics as per their usual treatment. Broad
      spectrum antibiotics will be prescribed to all women based on the previous successful
      therapeutic regime as described by Vijaya. Six weeks after the end of antibiotic therapy
      patients will be reviewed and their urine retested.
