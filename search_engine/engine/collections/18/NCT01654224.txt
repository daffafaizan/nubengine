      leading cause of vaccine preventable death, and the leading cause of infection related deaths
      among nursing home residents(Nace, Drinka et al.2010). Each year, an estimated 36,000
      individuals die from seasonal influenza and over 90% of these deaths occur among older
      adults, primarily the frail older adults residing in LTC settings(Fiore,Uyeki et al.
      2010).Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing influenza (Nichol and Treanor
      2006). Despite increasing success in immunizing LTC residents though, outbreaks continue to
      occur annually with case fatality rates ranging between 5-55% (Nace 2008). Older adults have
      a reduced response to influenza vaccination, in part due to age related immunosenescence
      (Keitel, Atmar et al. 1121; Skowronski, Tweed et al. 2008). It is widely recognized that more
      effective vaccine options are needed for frail older adults. One option is to increase the
      hemagglutinin (HA) dose in influenza vaccines in an effort to increase antibodies to
      hemagglutinin. To date, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the HDIV among LTC
      residents.
