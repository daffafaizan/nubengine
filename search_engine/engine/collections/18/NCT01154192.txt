      excessive ovarian androgen production marked by increased serum testosterone (T) and
      androstenedione (A) levels. Studies to determine the alteration in ovarian steroidogenesis
      that lead to abnormal production of ovarian androgens have revealed increased CYP17 gene
      expression with accentuated 17-hydroxylase activity leading to exaggerated
      17-hydroxyprogesterone (17P) responses to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation. In contrast,
      T and A responses did not distinguish between PCOS and normal women, although these androgens
      were clearly greater in the former compared to the latter group. As a result, 17P
      responsiveness has been employed to determine the functional capacity of the ovary to produce
      androgens. The stimulatory agents that have been used included GnRH agonist, Lupron, at a
      dose of 10 microgram per kilogram, or hCG at a dose of 10,000 IU.We propose to conduct a
      study that will determine the pattern of androgen responsiveness to 25ucg of hCG after 24
      hours in adolescents with PCOS, those with oligomenorrhea, and in normal controls. This will
      allow for a comparison of these adolescents' ovarian functional capacity to produce
      androgens.
