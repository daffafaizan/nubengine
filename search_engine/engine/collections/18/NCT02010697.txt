      Nonsmokers are the majority of the society. If an intervention can be designed to mobilize
      nonsmokers to help smokers quit, then it has strong implications for increasing smoking
      cessation at the population level. The conventional approach in smoking cessation is to
      target smokers directly. This study aims to test whether targeting nonsmokers can be equally
      effective. The study employs a three arm randomized design, in which a smoker-nonsmoker pair
      in the same household will be randomized into one of the three groups. One group receives
      materials targeting the smoker in the household, one group receives materials targeting the
      nonsmoker, and the third group serve as a control group. The intervention consists of mailed
      materials which include postcards, informational materials, CDs, DVDs, coupons for
      cessation-related incentives such as nicotine patches, and links to secured websites. The
      mail campaign is augmented with brief phone calls to ensure receipt of mailings and to
      reinforce targeted messages.The mail campaign is augmented with brief phone calls to ensure
      receipt of mailings and to reinforce targeted messages. At 3 and 7 months post randomization,
      project staff contact all participants to assess their smoking status.
