      extension of a custom-made mouthguard on the degree of satisfaction of elite water polo
      players. Eighteen water polo players participated in this study. Two different custom-made
      mouthguards were made, a conventional one and a reduced palate extension mouthguard. They
      wore them during the training sessions and for competing one type of mouthguard for the first
      and fourth week and the other type of mouthguard for the second and third week. The sequence
      was randomized to obtain one-half of the participants started the first week wearing the
      conventional mouthguard, and the other half wearing the shortened mouthguard. The
      participants rated the degree of discomfort or inconvenience in reference to speech,
      breathing, swallowing, nauseas/vomiting, pressure/pain, loosening, aesthetics, and athletic
      performance, in a 10-point scale, considering 0 no discomfort/inconvenience and 10 maximum
      discomfort/inconvenience. After each session, players also rated the perception of protection
      and the degree of satisfaction in a 10-point scale, considering 0 no protection/satisfaction
      and 10 maximum protection/satisfaction.
