      therapist (trained on the study) who will fill out the MIND questionnaire on admission and
      make sure the other scales/questionnaires are also completed. On the same day of the
      collection of MIND, MRC score for quadriceps and biceps strength, Sequential Organ Failure
      Assessment (SOFA) score, Glasgow coma scale, Hospital Anxiety-depression scale (HADS),
      EuroQol-5D, Gussago Dependence Nursing Scale (GNS) will be also gathered. After 1 day and 30
      days the MIND questionnaire will be also evaluated. Index of ADL-(Katz index) will be
      evaluated on discharge as well as weaning rate and survival.

      Sample Size Determination

      Based on the method of Rouquette A et al (1) we estimated a sample size of 200 patients to
      allow for the Rasch modelling to be applied.

      Statistical analysis

      Assessment of construct validity:

      Confirmation of the structure (e.g. multitrait analysis), clinical validity (comparison of
      disability score according to external clinical criteria)

      Assessment of reliability:

      Internal consistency reliability (using Cronbach's alpha), test-retest reliability (using
      intraclass correlations)

      Assessment of sensitivity to change over time:

      Comparison of change in disability score according to change in external clinical criteria

      classification
