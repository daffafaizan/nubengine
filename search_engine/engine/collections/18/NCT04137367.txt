      depressive symptoms are mediated by transdiagnostic rumination and how characteristics of the
      symptom network moderate these effects. The Affective Bias Modification Task (ABM) will be
      applied in a randomized controlled, double blind clinical trial with 6 months follow-up.
      Personalized networks are generated from prospective assessment of depression-related
      processes at baseline and follow-ups. Patients (n = 150) will be recruited from out-patient
      clinics at Diakonhjemmet Hospital, and randomized into one of three conditions: active, sham
      and assessment only. Patients aged 18-65 with depression (major depressive disorder) or
      bipolar disorder 2, with or without comorbid anxiety and/or alcohol use disorder will be
      included. The main hypothesis is that subjects who are in the active ABM group will exhibit
      less tendency for stress related (state) rumination compared to those in the placebo group.
      Active vs placebo ABM will decrease depressive symptoms (6 months) and this effect will be
      mediated by the change in state rumination. Densely connected symptom network and high
      strength centrality of rumination at baseline will moderate the effect of ABM. By combining
      mechanisms research with a personalized symptom network approach, this study will be in the
      forefront of understanding how a drug-free treatment option works and for whom it works best.
