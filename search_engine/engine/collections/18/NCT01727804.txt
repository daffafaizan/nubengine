      garnet laser, with or without fluoride, in prevention of occlusal caries in the primary
      dentition. High caries risk children (7.6Â±1.4 years) were selected for this study and
      received the following treatments: G1-1st molar was negative control, and the 2nd molar
      received a resin sealant; G2-1st molar was negative control, and the 2nd molar received laser
      irradiation (100 milliJoule, 5 Hertz - 0.5 Watts); G3-1st molar received only fluoride gel
      and the 2nd molar received fluoride gel + laser irradiation; G4-1st molar received only
      fluoride varnish and the 2nd molar received fluoride varnish + laser irradiation. Patients
      were followed up to 12 months to evaluate the formation of white-spot lesions and/or caries
      cavities by three calibrated observers.
