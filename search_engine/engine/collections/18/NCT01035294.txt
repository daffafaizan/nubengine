      Primary aim:

      To determine the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial of a phone-administered,
      mindfulness-based training program, as measured by recruitment and retention rates, treatment
      adherence and fidelity.

      Secondary aims:

        1. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of a phone delivered mindfulness-based
           intervention on mindfulness levels, measured as the difference between baseline and
           post-intervention Five Factors of Mindfulness scores (FFM) in the intervention and in
           the control group at the end of the intervention. Hypothesis: Mindfulness levels will
           improve in the intervention group compared to the control group.

        2. To obtain preliminary estimates of the effect of a phone delivered, mindfulness-based
           intervention on anxiety, measured as the difference between baseline and
           post-intervention Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) anxiety scores in the
           intervention and in the control group at the end of the intervention. Hypothesis:
           Anxiety levels will be reduced in the intervention group, compared to the control group.

        3. To collect preliminary data about the number of arrhythmic episodes/administered shocks
           during the intervention period. Hypothesis: the proportion of patients experiencing
           arrhythmic events/shocks will decrease in the intervention vs. the control group.
