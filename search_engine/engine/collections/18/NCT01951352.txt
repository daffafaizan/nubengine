      (specifically LL-37) present on the human skin after washing with different commercially
      available hand soaps. First we will do a baseline tape-stripping procedure to measure the
      amount of LL-37 on subjects' forearms. Tape stripping involves applying small, round tapes
      (CuDerm, Dallas, TX) to the skin, massaging them for about 10 second, and then removing them.
      This process is repeated 9 times for each tape. After doing baseline tape stripping samples,
      each participant's forearms will be washed with a different soap. The soap will be rinsed
      off, and the skin allowed to dry. After the forearms are dry (about 5 minutes later), repeat
      tape-stripping will be performed. This tape-stripping process will then be repeated 4 hours
      later, and then 24 hours later as well. Results of the LL-37 expression at each time point
      will then be compared between soaps.
