      Primary

        -  Test the feasibility of pre-treatment, bedside assessment of functional and cognitive
           status in older adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      Secondary

        -  Obtain preliminary data regarding the predictive value of pre-treatment, bedside
           assessment of functional and cognitive status on overall survival, length of
           hospitalization and early death.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      At baseline, patients complete questionnaires including the Vulnerable Elders Survey
      (functional status), the Mini-Mental Status Exam (cognition), and the Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies-Depression. Patients also undergo physical function testing via the
      Short Physical Performance Battery and hand grip strength. Further information parameters are
      obtained by periodic medical chart reviews.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
