      in individuals post stroke. In order to compare the effect of CIMT vs. treadmill training
      only on walking function in individuals post-stroke, a 6 week, single-blind, randomized
      training study will be conducted with three assessments of gait to determine the training
      effect. Subjects will be blocked by gait speed into slow (< 0.4 m/s) or fast (â‰¥ 0.4 m/s)
      subgroups and randomized to either the CIMT or treadmill training only groups at the initial
      test. Following the initial test, individuals from the 2 groups will undergo intensive
      locomotor training. Training will be performed 3 times per week for 6 weeks with the training
      time for each visit set to 45 minutes as tolerated, excluding set up time. Data collection
      will proceed until 36 subjects from 2 groups have been trained.
