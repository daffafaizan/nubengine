      lubiprostone is through increasing fluid and mucus secretion and improving lubrication of the
      intestinal lumen. The effects of lubiprostone on gastrointestinal (GI) transit and small
      bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) have not been sufficiently explored.

      The current study was designed to investigate whether: (a) lubiprostone alters GI transit and
      (b) affects SIBO in constipated patients.

      Twenty nine female patients (mean age of 39 year: range 19-64) with chronic constipation
      received 2 weeks of lubiprostone (24 mcg b.i.d., P.O.). Stool consistency based on Bristol
      stool scale and the frequency of bowel movements were recorded. Gastric emptying time (GET),
      small bowel transit time (SBTT), colon transit time (CTT), combined small & large bowel
      transit time (SLBTT) and whole gut transit time (WGT) were measured using wireless motility
      capsule. Small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) status was assessed by the lactulose breath test.
