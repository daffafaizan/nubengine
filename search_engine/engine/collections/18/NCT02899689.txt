      induce labor. Dilapan-S速 a synthetic osmotic cervical dilator made of a patented hydrogel
      (AQUACRYL), works by stimulating the release of endogenous prostaglandins, which degrade
      collagen fibers and soften the cervix. Additionally, it dilates the cervix gradually and the
      effect is gentle as well as predictable. Recently, Dilapan-S速 has been approved by the FDA as
      a mechanical dilator for cervical ripening. There are no data comparing this newly approved
      Dilapan-S速 to the Foley catheter, the most commonly used mechanical dilator method.
      Therefore, The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy
      of Dilapan-S速 compared with Foley catheter for cervical ripening before induction of labor in
      pregnant women greater than 37 weeks.
