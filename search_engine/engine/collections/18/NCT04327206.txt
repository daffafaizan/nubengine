      will be randomised to receive a single dose of BCG vaccine or 0.9% NaCl placebo. Participants
      will be followed-up for 12 months with notification from a Smartphone application or phone
      calls (up to daily when ill) and surveys to identify and detail COVID-19 infection.
      Additional information on severe disease will be obtained from hospital medical records
      and/or government databases. Blood samples will be collected prior to randomisation and at 3,
      6, 9 and 12 months to determine exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2). Where required, swab/blood samples will be taken at illness episodes to assess
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The trial includes a pre-planned meta-analysis with data from 2834 participants recruited in
      the first phase of this study, where participants were randomised to receive BCG or no BCG
      vaccine at the time of receiving influenza vaccination.
