      potential differences in therapeutic responses. To address the problem of low minority
      recruitment we are initiating a randomized trial of a recruitment intervention (RECRUIT)
      funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health disparities (NIMHD) to
      increase racial/ethnic diversity in clinical trials.

      Our specific approach is directed toward multi-site trials conducted at specialty clinics
      within academic centers with recruiting venues that include community practices or practices
      of colleagues in other areas of the academic center. The intervention will focus on
      approximately 60 specialty clinics. Clinical sites will be randomized to the intervention or
      control group. The target of the intervention will be the site investigators and clinical
      trial coordinators.
