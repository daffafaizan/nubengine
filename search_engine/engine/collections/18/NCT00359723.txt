    
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common disorder caused by the loss of dopamine-producing brain
      cells. The disorder is generally treated with levodopa combined with carbidopa. Nerve cells
      use levodopa to make dopamine. Carbidopa delays the conversion of levodopa into dopamine
      until it reaches the brain. Motor fluctuations (the wearing off effects of levodopa
      characterized by sometimes rapid changes between uncontrolled and normal movements) are a
      common, and often difficult to manage, source of disability in people with PD.

      In this trial researchers will study the effects of methylphenidate (MPD), also known as
      Ritalin-a drug marketed in the U.S. to treat hyperactivity and narcolepsy-on
      carbidopa/levodopa and other antiparkinson medications taken orally by individuals with
      Parkinson's disease who experience motor fluctuations when they take levodopa. The overall
      goal of this project is to develop better symptomatic therapies for PD.

      After 2 screening visits to the treatment clinic to evaluate the wearing "on" and "off"
      effects of levodopa, eligible participants will be scheduled for 3 admissions to the General
      Clinical Research Center at Oregon Health & Science University during which they randomly
      will receive the study drug, MPD, or placebo, along with their usual carbidopa/levodopa
      therapy and/or other antiparkinson medications. Also, participants will have their
      parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, postural instability, and bradykinesia) rated and blood
      pressure and pulse measured at regular intervals.

      Duration of the study for participants is about 3 weeks and includes 2 outpatient clinic
      visits (for screening) and 3 inpatient clinic visits (with overnight stays).
