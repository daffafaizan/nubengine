      have been seen in the CMC ED with a diagnosis of mild brain injury or concussion and a
      negative CT scan. The investigators will be collecting blood samples, and administering
      cognitive and balance tests. The investigators will also be following symptoms and cognition
      throughout the first year to help define typical recovery, and guide prognosis.
