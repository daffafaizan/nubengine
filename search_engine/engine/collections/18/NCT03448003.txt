      I. Assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial involving a mobile, standardized,
      comprehensive integrative oncology (IO) prevention program.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare group differences over time in biological pathways including: immune function, gut
      microbiome, endocrine function, insulin and glucose metabolism, inflammation, other
      cancer-related pathways (from peripheral blood), antioxidant capacity, and nutrient levels.

      II. Determine whether the IO group has improved patient reported outcomes over time
      including: quality of life, sleep disturbances, aspects of mental health, and psychosocial
      measures including: mindfulness, social support, and measures of positive growth.

      III. Compare group differences over time in dietary patterns, fitness levels, percent body
      fat, and anthropometrics.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients attend IO prevention program consisting of 1-2 physical activity, nutrition
      and diet, and mind-body practice sessions over 60 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. Patients also
      attend a behavioral counseling session once weekly for up to 26 weeks. Patients complete
      exercises over 30-60 minutes 3-5 times weekly for 12 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients receive no intervention. After 26 weeks, patients may crossover to Group
      I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 26 weeks and 1 year.
