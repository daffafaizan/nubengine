      to continue in two extensions: MK0518-004-10 (NCT00100048), which extended the study to 144
      weeks, and MK0518-004-20 (NCT00100048), which extended the study to 240 weeks. Participants
      who had been randomized to MK0518 in the base study continued at 400 mg MK0518 twice daily.

      Participants randomized to efavirenz in the base study continued to receive efavirenz at the
      dosage given in the base study. The doses of open label tenofovir and lamivudine continued
      unchanged.
