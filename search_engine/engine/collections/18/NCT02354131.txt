    
      Part 1: This is a single-centre, phase 1a, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of bevacizumab-niraparib combination and determine the RP2D in
      patients with platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
      cancer.

      The standard 3+3 design will be used. Part 2: (n=94) This multicenter, prospective,
      open-label, randomized phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy of niraparib against
      niraparib-bevacizumab combination in Women with platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      Stratification: Patients are stratified according to:

        1. HRD status (positive/negative)

        2. Treatment-Free interval to prior therapy (6-12 months > 12 months) Randomization: 1:1
           randomization

      Study arms: Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms:

      Arm 1: Niraparib monotherapy until progression. Arm 2: Niraparib-bevacizumab combination
      therapy until progression.
