      level of randomization will be performed at the practice level in order to study the impact
      of involving both clinicians and office staff in making their own personal changes (i.e.,
      creating the "healthy" office)- a central component of AIM - on the translation of the
      project's educational tools to patients. The second level of randomization will occur at the
      patient level comparing two practice level interventions designed to improve nutrition,
      increase physical activity and improve emotional well-being. Furthermore, the effectiveness
      of the educational tools will be evaluated on self-reported diet, physical activity and
      emotional well-being and established physiologic measures on behavioral change. Both arms of
      the study will receive brief office-based counseling using established tools that have been
      compiled for this project. Practices will be asked to work on incorporating brief nutrition,
      physical activity and emotional well-being messages into routine care - either motivational
      in nature for people not willing to work on lifestyle changes, or goal-oriented for those
      working on changes. Patients in the intervention arm will also receive feedback concerning
      changes in two novel physiologic measures that correlate with improved nutrition and
      increased physical activity.
