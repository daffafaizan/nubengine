    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (when
      more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) early access
      program (EAP) study. The study will be conducted in 2 phases: a Screening Phase
      (approximately 30 days prior to administration of first dose) and a Program Drug Phase (Day 1
      up to 30 Days after last dose of study drug). Enrolled participants will receive 420
      milligram (mg) oral ibrutinib once daily on a 28-day cycle until disease progression,
      occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, no longer achieving clinical benefit, or the end of
      program. Treatment will be continuous (without interruption) and self-administered. Disease
      evaluations will be conducted according to local standard of care as clinically indicated.
      Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study. All enrolled and on-going
      participants in the program will continue to receive ibrutinib by the EAP until marketing
      approval or 6 months after this date.
