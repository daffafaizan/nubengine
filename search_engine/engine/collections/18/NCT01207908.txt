      DMD is a progressive degenerative muscle disorder for which there is no current cure.
      Glucocorticoids (GC) are often used to improve motor function and survival but have
      significant side effects such as growth failure, weight gain, insulin resistance and
      osteoporosis. IGF-1 stimulates both the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle
      cells and is thus important for muscle repair and regeneration. IGF-1 offers potential as a
      therapeutic agent for DMD as it may improve or preserve motor function and reduce GC side
      effects such as growth failure and insulin resistance.
