    
      Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate and determine clinical and biochemical
      comparison of 3 different methods including Er:YAG laser, diod laser, and conventional
      techniques commonly used in resective gingival surgeries in terms of preoperative anxiety,
      postoperative satisfaction, epithelization, gingival temperature, inflammation and pain
      levels in post-operative healing process.

      Method: This study was conducted on 32 female, 13 male, a total of 45 individuals (study
      group patients) with an indication of resective gingival surgery in the anterior region of
      the maxillar anterior regions and 11 female, 4 men, a total of 15 individuals (negative
      control group patients) with a healthy gingiva. Clinical periodontal parameters, gingival
      crevicular fluid (GCF) KGF-2 and VEGF-A levels and gingival temperature levels were recorded
      before the investigation and during operations with 3 different techniques, gingival
      temperature was measured. Gingival temperature and epithelization levels in 3, 7, 14 and 21
      days; GCF KGF-2 and VEGF-A levels in 14 and 21 days and pain levels between 1-7 days of
      post-operative healing process were evaluated. Preoperative anxiety and postoperative
      satisfaction were evaluated through questionnaires
