      have a greater glucose-lowering effect than do high-carbohydrate diets. However, compared
      with usual diet, the effect of a behavioral intervention promoting a
      low-carbohydrate/high-unsaturated fat and high-protein dietary pattern among individuals with
      prediabetes or untreated type 2 diabetes is not well understood.

      The overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to study the effect of a behavioral
      intervention promoting a low-carbohydrate/high-unsaturated fat and high-protein dietary
      pattern compared with usual diet on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other metabolic risk factors
      among individuals with or at high risk of diabetes (HbA1c 6.0-6.9%).

      A total of 150 participants with HbA1c 6.0-6.9% will be recruited and randomly assigned to
      either a 6-month behavioral modification program designed to reduce carbohydrate intake
      (initial target <40 g digestible carbohydrates, final target <60 g digestible carbohydrates)
      or to usual diet in a 1:1 randomization ratio.

      The primary outcome will be the difference between the active intervention and control groups
      for change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be fasting glucose,
      systolic blood pressure, total-to-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio, and body
      weight.

      Findings from this study may provide evidence about the role of carbohydrate restriction in
      individuals with or at high risk of type 2 diabetes.
