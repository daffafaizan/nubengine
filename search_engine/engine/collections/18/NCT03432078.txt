      who are referred to a specialist unit for hypnotherapy are consecutively included in the
      study. Firstly, the patients are invited to a meeting with the nurse for information about
      the study, check for eligibility and to sign the written informed consent. Exclusion criteria
      that could influence GI symptoms such as organic GI disease, severe psychiatric comorbidity
      and pregnancy are controlled for. The patients are randomized to either individual or group
      treatment given by a nurse trained in hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. The
      randomization is organized and performed in blocks by an external unit connected to the
      University in order to be accurate. The treatment consists of eight sessions of gut directed
      hypnotherapy during twelve weeks. A standardized protocol is used and is the same both in the
      group setting as well as in the individual treatment arm. In each group approximately eight
      patients are included. Every session lasts for one hour. Outcome measures in the study are GI
      symptom severity, GI-specific anxiety, psychological distress and health related quality of
      life. These effects are measured by validated questionnaires at baseline and at various time
      points during the treatment period as well as after the completion of the treatment and
      during follow-up.
