    
      Primary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the effect of iloprost inhaled on postoperative PH after biventricular
           repair for CHD.

        2. To verify the benefits of iloprost inhaled in improving the hemodynamics after
           biventricular repair for CHD.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To investigate the preventive effect of iloprost inhaled on the life-threatening PHC
           occurring immediately after complex congenital heart surgery or occurring just after
           weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass.

        2. To explore the potential of iloprost inhaled to reduce the early mortality after PHC and
           to decrease the use of ECMO/VAD.
