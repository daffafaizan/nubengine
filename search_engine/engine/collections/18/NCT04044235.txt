    
      The main goal of the study is to provide preliminary evidence about feasibility and
      acceptability of delivering PrEP to AGYW identified as potentially at high risk of HIV
      infection in Lilongwe city communities and two public facilities in Lilongwe, Malawi. The
      primary objectives are to; determine HIV prevalence among all AGYW identified as potentially
      at high risk of HIV infection in urban Lilongwe; assess the HIV program's ability to enroll
      and retain the PrEP cohort for one year; assess participants' and providers' perceptions of
      the barriers and facilitators for providing PrEP to inform implementation of PrEP study and
      future interventions and assess the cost of PrEP delivery in the routine HIV program.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To measure annual HIV incidence in a prospective cohort of HIV-negative AGYW identified
           as potentially at high risk of HIV infection but declined to enroll in PrEP cohort study
           in urban Lilongwe.

        2. To measure annual HIV incidence among HIV-negative AGYW who enrolled in PrEP cohort
           study in urban Lilongwe.

        3. To determine risk factors for HIV in a cohort of AGYW recruited in the prospective
           cohort study
