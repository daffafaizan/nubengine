    
      In an observational study with cross-sectional analysis and prospective data collection, the
      investigators recruit patients with:

        -  >20 years old

        -  An established coronary artery disease defined by an episode of ST-elevation myocardial
           infarction, non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome or stable angina

        -  An exposure to clopidogrel therapy (75 mg per day for at least 7 consecutive days).

      The exclusion criteria are:

        -  Presence of allergy to clopidogrel

        -  Severe hepatic dysfunction, disease or active pathological bleeding (e.g.,
           gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding)

        -  Use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or cilostazol

        -  inability to give informed consent.

      Collected data for patients encompasse baseline characteristics, including age, gender,
      obesity (defined as a body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m2), smoking, medical history, and
      coadministered drugs.

      The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research at our center
      and all subjects gave informed consent for study participation.

      Platelet function assay is assessed by the VerifyNow P2Y12 analyzer following manufacturer
      instructions (Accumetrics, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA) using venous blood samples collected in
      tube containing 3.2% sodium citrate.

      Genotyping for CYP2C19, ABCB1, PON1 and P2RY12 polymorphism is performed using the polymerase
      chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequencing.
