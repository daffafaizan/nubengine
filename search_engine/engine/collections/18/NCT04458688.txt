    
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Several lines of
      evidence suggest that MS is an autoimmune disease with both T and B-cell activity leading to
      CNS inflammation which results in demyelinating injury. Ocrelizumab was FDA approved in March
      2017 for relapsing remitting (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) by
      depleting B cells. It has shown to be effective in reducing the annualized relapse rate,
      decreasing disability progression, and reducing the number of new and active MRI brain
      lesions.

      Previous research studies have reported a more aggressive course in African Americans with
      MS, more lesions on the MRI scan, and more severe injury to layers of the eye (specifically
      in the retina) compared to Caucasians.

      This is a novel study investigating the effect of ocrelizumab in African American relapsing
      multiple sclerosis (RMS) patients compared to Caucasian RMS patients using imaging measures,
      specifically multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical coherence
      tomography-angiography (OCTA). This is a non-drug intervention study; therefore, patients who
      are recruited will have already decided to make ocrelizumab their disease-modifying therapy
      before enrollment. The study will recruit 86 (including 6 potential screen fails) patients in
      total (40 African American patients and 40 Caucasian patients who are matched by age, sex,
      disease duration, and disease disability. The study will consist of 5 visits in six-month
      intervals across two years.
