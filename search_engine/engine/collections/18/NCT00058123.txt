        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent or progressive
           anaplastic glioma treated with poly ICLC.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the tumor response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the biological effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive poly ICLC intramuscularly 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
