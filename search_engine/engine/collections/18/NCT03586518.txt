      myocardial tissue by exploiting the different water content of tissues. It correlates well
      with histo-pathological levels of myocardial fibrosis in diseases of pressure overload such
      as aortic stenosis. There is growing evidence to demonstrate the potential of native T1
      mapping as an imaging biomarker of myocardial fibrosis in patients with ESRD; myocardial
      native T1 values are higher in patients with ESRD than controls, and associate with measures
      of myocardial strain and circulating markers of cardiac dysfunction. Although native T1 times
      are affected by water content of tissues, our group has shown that native T1 times are not
      influenced by clinical changes in fluid status in HD patients and that the inter-study
      reproducibility and intra- and inter-observer variability of native T1 are outstanding.

      Native T1 mapping is a promising, non-invasive imaging biomarker of myocardial fibrosis in
      patients with advanced renal disease. It is essential that the technique is validated against
      histology before further use in clinical studies.

      The aim of this study is to directly assess the relationship between native T1 mapping and
      levels of MF examined at post-mortem in haemodialysis patients.
