      psychoeducation programme (MBPP) for Chinese people with schizophrenia. A single-blind,
      multi-site, pragmatic randomised controlled trial conducted in Hong Kong, mainland China, and
      Taiwan with 300 participants consistently demonstrated significant improvement in regard to
      insight of illness, functioning, mental state and the length of re-hospitalisations when
      compared with conventional psychoeducation and Treatment As Usual (TAU) groups (Chien, 2017).

      The study hypothesises that:

        1. Participants receiving MBPP will decrease their use of rumination and expressive
           suppression, and increase the use of cognitive reappraisal compared to a control group
           after completion of the intervention.

        2. Participants receiving MBPP attain a reduction in depressive/anxiety symptoms compared
           to a control group after completion of the intervention.

        3. These effects are expected to be maintained through 3-month follow up with regular
           self-practice.
