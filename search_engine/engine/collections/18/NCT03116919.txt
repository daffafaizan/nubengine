      several changes have been made to government sponsored food programs with respect to
      potatoes, such as lifting the restriction on the number of servings of starchy vegetables
      (including potatoes) established by the Healthy Hunger-Free Act, and re-allowing white
      potatoes in the cash-value voucher for fruits and vegetables of the Special Supplemental
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), after the Institute of Medicine
      asserted that there was insufficient evidence that white potatoes had adverse health effects.
      However, the investigators recently reported an increased incidence of hypertension with
      increasing potato consumption in three large prospective US cohort studies after adjusting
      for sodium intake and other potential confounders. The investigators also analyzed the
      association of short-term potato intake from a 24-hr dietary recall with
      endothelial-dependent vasodilation measured by brachial artery ultrasonography in the
      Modifiable Effectors of Renin System Activation Treatment Evaluation (MODERATE) trial.
      Participants who consumed one or more than one serving of boiled, baked or mashed potatoes
      during the previous day had a 1.7% lower endothelial-dependent vasodilation when compared
      with participants with no potato intake (p-value= 0.01) after adjusting for other factors.
      This is a relevant difference in endothelial function - by comparison, every 10 year increase
      in age was associated with a 1.2% lower endothelial function. Therefore, the investigators
      plan to analyze the effect of one serving of boiled, baked or mashed potato per day on
      endothelial function in a crossover feeding trial of healthy adult men and women.
