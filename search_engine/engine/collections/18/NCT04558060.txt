      patient's motivation to make positive health changes in their lives. A common training method
      for medical professionals is the use of human standardized patients, who are actors who
      pretend to be patients for educational interviews. Standardized patients are expensive and it
      is challenging to maintain an adequate pool of patient actors. Accordingly, after licensure
      or medical boards, health professionals typically adopt new evidence-based practices, like
      motivational interviewing, without human standardized patient training experiences. Given the
      established importance of post-training coaching and feedback to the acquisition of
      motivational interviewing, innovative training methods are needed. Computer virtual patients
      may provide a cost-effective alternative that is scalable and supports dissemination of
      evidence-based practices. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a virtual standardized
      patient, relative to academic study, for training motivational interviewing among health care
      professionals from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense.
