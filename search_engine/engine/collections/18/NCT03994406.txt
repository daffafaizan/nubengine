      will be more effective than placebo (a) in reducing or eliminating ocular discomfort
      associated with contact lens wear, (b) prolong hours of comfortable wear, (c) prolong total
      hours of contact lens wear, (d) improve ease of insertion and removal of contact lens, and (
      c) reduces friction between cornea/lens and lens/eyelid, without use of artificial eye drops
      or gels. One mechanism supporting this hypothesis is preliminary evidence of increased meibum
      secretion following CLM2 topical gel application.
