    
      This is a randomized, multicenter early phase II trial exploring the pre-operative activity
      of afatinib vs. nontreatment. The study includes an early monitoring of the surgical
      co-morbidities for patients treated with afatinib and accrual may be stopped prematurely
      according to a pre-defined safety stopping rule.

      Patients will be randomized with a 5:1 ratio, between the two arms: afatinib and 'no
      treatment'. It is intended to include a total of 30 eligible patients out of which 25
      patients will be randomized into the afatinib arm.

      Patients allocated to the 'no treatment' arm will mainly serve as a reference to interpret
      the results of the translational research part of the study although no formal comparison
      between the afatinib arm and the 'no treatment' arm is intended.

      Patients will be first registered into the EORTC system after signing the informed consent
      form. The site will have to complete all the study related procedures within 4 weeks prior
      randomization and all eligibility criteria should be met before the patient can be randomized
      into the study.

      The registration of patients will proceed with slots for patients which will be opened or
      closed based on the randomization of patients into the afatinib arm. Starting with 3 free
      slots, an additional slot will become available for each patient randomized to the 'no
      treatment' arm.

      Registration will be paused after three completes the 4 week observation period after
      surgery. Similar action will be done after the next 3 patients have been entered into the
      afatinib arm.

      Once the first 6 patients in the afatinib arm have been observed for surgical toxicities of
      grade â‰¥ 3 for 4 weeks following surgery, the slot system will cease to operate.
