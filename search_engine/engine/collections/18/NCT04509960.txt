    
      The investigators will used two different ways of pro-seal laryngeal mask insertion technique
      (laryngoscopy- guided technique or the standard technique) in elective minor surgeries of
      geriatric toothless patients.

      The investigators will record the respiratory dynamics, heartbeat, systolic, diastolic, mean
      arterial pressures every 5 minutes during surgery. The investigators will record the
      laryngeal mask insertion time and oropharyngeal leakage pressure. The investigators will
      evaluate the placement of a laryngeal mask according to young criteria. The development and
      severity of coughing, retching, laryngospasm, extremity, and head movement during laryngeal
      mask placement will be recorded. Bloodstains, sore throat, hoarseness will be recorded on the
      mask that may develop due to laryngeal mask placement. The investigators will use the
      Briacombe scoring and Campbell category system to assess the position of laryngeal mask
      airway devices.
