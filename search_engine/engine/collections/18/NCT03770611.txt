      The aim of the present study is to evaluate and to compare the effect of a nutritional
      supplement of probiotics and/or prebiotics on serum concentrations of uremic toxins and
      inflammatory markers compared to placebo, in automated peritoneal dialysis patients.

      Sample size:

      For the sample size calculation a mean differences formula was used, with a 95% confidence
      level, a 80% sample power and accuracy of 0.05. As a reference, the study of Salmean YA, 2015
      was considered; in this study, the administration of pea fiber + inulin during 12 weeks in
      chronic kidney disease patients, significantly decreased (p<0.05) serum concentrations of
      p-cresol (5.82 ± 1.72 mg/L) in comparison to placebo (7.25 ± 1.74 mg/L). After substituting
      formula values and adding 20% of possible losses during follow-up, the sample size is: 28
      patients.

      Additionally, sample size calculation was made considering other outcomes. In the study of
      Xie LN, 2015, the administration of high-fermentable soluble fiber in ESRD patients on
      hemodialysis during 6 weeks, significantly decreased (p<0.05) inflammation markers:
      C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (4.8 ±
      4.5 pg/mL, 10.1 ± 1.4 pg/mL, 31.8 ± 5.3 mg/L, respectively) compared to control group (9.5 ±
      5.6 pg/mL, 13.1 ± 2.4 pg/mL, 51.5 ± 14.6 mg/L). After substituting the formula, sample size
      was 19, 7, and 5 for CRP, TNFa and IL-6, respectively.

      Thus, the highest value was finally used: 28 patients for intervention group.

      Statistical analysis:

      Quantitative variables will be shown as mean and standard deviation or median (25-75
      percentiles) according to their parametric or non-parametric distribution; Qualitative
      variables will be shown as frequency and percentage. Intergroup comparisons will be performed
      with χ2 or Fisher test for qualitative variables and one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for
      quantitative variables as appropriate. For intra-group comparisons Mc Nemar test will be used
      for qualitative variables and paired T-test, Wilcoxon, repeated-measures or Friedman ANOVA
      for quantitative variables as appropriate. An intention to treat analysis will be performed.
