    
      Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most widely used classes of drugs and are
      prescribed primarily for gastric acid-related diseases, eradication of Helicobacter pylori,
      and prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastropathy,and
      gastroesophagial reflux diseases , Although PPIs have an excellent overall safety profile,
      some severe adverse effects, which include bone fracture, dementia, myocardial infarction,
      infections, micronutrient deficiencies, and kidney diseases, PPIs may trigger acute
      interstitial nephritis,a potentially sever adverse event commonly associated with acute
      kidney injury. The increase in prescription and inadequate use of this class of medication
      calls for studies on the effects of prolonged PPI therapy on renal function.
