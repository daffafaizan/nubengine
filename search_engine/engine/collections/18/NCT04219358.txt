      nanoencapsulated 0.05%. Nanoencapsulation is a process that concentrates the drug into a
      capsule not visible to the naked eye, allowing it to penetrate skin more easily and will only
      release the drug at the lesion site. The drug is presented in a free form inside the gel in
      the others formulations.
