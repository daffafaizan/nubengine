      sessions) or a physical therapy (PT) groups (ten sessions) during two weeks. Multimodal PT
      program included: ultrasound therapy (US), transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS)
      and massage. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index ( NDI), range of motion and
      (CROM), Questionnaire SF-12 and PPTs in sub-occipital and upper trapezius muscles were
      measured at baseline, at the end of treatment and at 1 month follow-up. T-tests and a
      repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (RM-MANOVA) were used for VAS, CROM and
      PPTs, respectively.
