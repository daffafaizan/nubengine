      that are unable to meet target weight loss goals on a low calorie diet (LCD) are
      intrinsically less metabolically flexible than their weight-losing counterparts. The
      investigators expect that this 'inflexibility' will be characterized by impaired fat
      oxidation (as determined by indirect calorimetry) in response to caloric restriction. If this
      were the case, these subjects may represent a population of 'super-responders' likely to
      demonstrate a robust response to approaches to increase fat oxidation. The investigators will
      also measure lipid concentrations in skeletal muscle and liver by hydrogen 1 magnetic
      resonance (1H-MRS) to determine both the stability of these measurements as well as the
      magnitude of changes that can be seen during LCD.
