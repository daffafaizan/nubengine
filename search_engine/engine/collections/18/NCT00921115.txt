      minimal side effects. Hormone receptor positive breast cancer generally does not respond very
      well to chemotherapy, which has many side effects. Hormonal therapy with a single drug such
      as Anastrozole is the main type of treatment used to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.
      Whether a combination of Anastrazole nad Fulvestrant is effective and feasible is not known.
      This study is being done to answer this question.

      This is a phase II single arm study. Patients will have an Oncotype Dx performed and only if
      the recurrence score is low or intermediate, they would be eligible. Eligible patients will
      receive Anastrazole and Fulvestrant for 16 week.

      Subjects will receive Anastrazole 1 mg po q day and Fulvestrant 500 mg IM, day 1, day 14, day
      28 and thereafter once every 28 days on outpatient basis. On day 28, subjects will be
      evaluated for side effects and clinically and a needle core biopsy (optional) will be
      obtained. If there is increase in Ki 67 by 50%, subjects will be taken off the study.
      Response evaluation will occur every 28 days during outpatient clinic visits. All treatment
      will continue until 4 months when patients will undergo surgical intervention. After surgery,
      patients will be off study and will receive additional breast cancer therapy at the
      discretion of their treating physician. Patients who develop progressive disease on protocol
      will be removed from the study and will then be treated at the discretion of the treating
      physician. The protocol will be closed after the last accrued patient has had surgery.
