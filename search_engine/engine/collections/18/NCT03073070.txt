      tests that will determine if the subjects can be in this study. If the subject is qualify,
      he/she will be asked to return for the following scheduled visits.

      Study visit 1: We will draw a small amount of subject's blood from the IV. The study
      subject's blood will then be marked with biotin. We will give back the subject's blood marked
      with biotin through IV within 4 to 6 hours. Endotoxin analysis (conducted pre-infusion) and
      bacterial culture analysis (conducted post-infusion) will be performed. Twenty minutes after
      the blood transfusion, we will draw blood from the IV. After that, we will take out the IV
      and the subject can go home.

      All follow-up study visits:

      The subject will have a study visit 24 hours after receiving blood marked with biotin. After
      that, the subject will have a clinic visit every 7-10 days. These visits will end when we can
      no longer find the biotin marked blood cells in the subject's blood. This is expected to be
      approximately 12 weeks later.

      At these visits, we will draw blood and also collect all blood glucose results in the past
      7-10 days.

      After the study visits are completed, there will be one follow-up visit 4-6 months after the
      subject receives the biotin marked RBCs. We will draw about 0.25 ml of blood.

      Continuous glucose monitoring and HbA1c determination-- We will monitor continuous glucose
      concentrations throughout the study. This will be accomplished by setting up FreeStyle Libre
      Pro continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device for each study subject. In addition, HbA1c
      will be measured once in the middle of the study (likely visit 6) and in the end of the study
      (likely visit 12).
