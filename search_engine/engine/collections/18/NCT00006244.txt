      I. Evaluate initial response to therapy, time to disease progression, and overall survival in
      MM patients treated with melphalan, IL2- incubated peripheral blood stem cells, and
      sequential IL2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate grade 3-4 toxicities encountered by younger (< 56 years old) and older (>56 years
      old) advanced multiple myeloma patients treated with melphalan, IL2-incubated peripheral
      blood stem cells, and sequential IL2.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 2-3 hours on day -2 and an infusion of
      IL-2-treated autologous or syngeneic peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Beginning on day
      0, patients also receive IL-2 IV continuously over 5 days followed by 2 days off. Treatment
      with IL-2 repeats weekly for 4 weeks. Beginning 1 month later, patients undergo maintenance
      therapy comprising interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) 3 times a week in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
