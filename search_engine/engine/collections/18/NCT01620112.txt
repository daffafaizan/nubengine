      because they facilitate surgical anaesthesia, muscle relaxation and post-operative
      analgesics.

      Various drugs are used to supplement local anaesthetics during brachial plexus block. Many
      studies in the literature show that clonidine, which is an alpha-2 agonist, prolongs the
      length of anesthesia and post-operative analgesia.4,5 However, clonidine's side effects-such
      as hypotension, bradycardia and sedation can limit its use.

      There are no studies comparing different clonidine concentrations on the axillary brachial
      block, so the hypothesis of the present study was that different clonidine concentrations and
      LA volumes may influence the anaesthesia and analgesia quality on this type of regional
      block.
