      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic or inoperable locoregional
           medullary thyroid cancer treated with irinotecan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response is
      assessed after completion of 4 courses. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial
      response (PR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or PR. Patients who have stable disease
      receive up to 12 total courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
