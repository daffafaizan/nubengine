      assigned to either a control or 3 experimental groups. An initial evaluation and
      rehabilitation program will be established which includes a home exercise program. Therapy
      will be 2 days per week for 2 weeks. Thirty of the subjects will use ThermaCare continuous
      heat neck wraps applied for 6 hours before home exercise, 30 will use ibuprofen (1200 mg /day
      given in 3 dosages) plus ThermaCare neck wraps before home exercise, 15 will use a sham heat
      wrap and a Ibuprofen placebo each day and the last 15 will have conventional therapy.
      Intervention with heat or Ibuprofen will be used on days that they are not being treated in
      the clinic. All groups will be evaluated initially and after 2 weeks. They will be given home
      exercise and heat compliance logs and analog visual pain scales to be filled out each night
      before exercise and, if they used heat, before and after heat will be applied. The physical
      therapist will also be asked to evaluate their home compliance, pain and the benefit to them
      from the heat packs. Subjects will complete a neck disability questionnaire at the beginning
      and end of the study. At the end of the two weeks of treatment, a multivariate ANOVA will be
      performed to compare changes in home exercise compliance, functional level, pain level, range
      of motion, and strength. A statistical level of pâ‰¤.05 is considered predictive of a
      difference between groups.
