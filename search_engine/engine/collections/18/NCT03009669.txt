      status continuously by observing the application of stroke volume variation(SVV) and pleth
      variability index(PVI) and their correlation in patients undergoing intestinal tumor
      surgeries.

      Methods: 50 patients undergoing elective intestinal tumor surgery were enrolled, ASAⅠ-Ⅲ, aged
      18-65 years. After the induction of general anesthesia, cardiac index(CI), cardiac
      output(CO), stroke volume variability(SVV), stroke volume index(SVI) were monitored with
      Vigileo system, while pleth variability index(PVI) and perfusion index(PI) were monitored
      with Massion Radical 7 system. During the surgery, goal directed fluid therapy was conducted
      according to the data of CI、SVI and SVV. Heart rate(HR), mean arterial pressure(MAP), central
      venous pressure(CVP), CO, CI, SVI, SVV, PI, PVI were recorded while after the induction of
      anesthesia(T1), making surgical incision(T2), performing intestinal anastomosis(T3) and
      closing the abdominal incision(T4). And we calculate the correlation of SVV and PVI using
      Pearson Correlation Analysis at different time points.
