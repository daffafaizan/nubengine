    
      This is a fundamental, prospective, multi-centres, interventional non-comparative study
      without the administration of a study product to patients.

      The objective is to test in vitro the binding of different ImotopesÂ® to class II HLA antigens
      on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolated from patients presenting a diagnosed and
      stabilized neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, as well as their ability to generate a
      cytolytic response directed against the immune cells involved in the maintenance and
      triggering of the disease (i.e. non-cytolytic T cells recognising the same epitopes and
      antigen presenting cells (APC) presenting the same epitopes).

      The patients will be asked to provide at least 2 peripheral blood samples of approximately
      100 milliliters each time, with a minimum of 14 days interval between these 2 samples. These
      blood samples will be taken by a member of the healthcare staff qualified to perform this
      type of procedure. If the results obtained with the 2 initial samples would be of interest to
      the Sponsor, the patient will be asked to come back for additional samplings with a maximum
      of 6 additional blood draws. The total volume of blood that will be taken over a 6 months
      period cannot exceed 500 milliliters with a maximum of 200 milliliters over a 30-day period
      for patients with a weight of min 50kg. The study has no other constraint.

      The list of analysis planned to be performed on blood samples are presented below:

        -  Identification of the class II HLA antigens of each patient

        -  Study of the binding to HLA antigens of synthetic peptides whose amino acid sequence
           comes from the sequence of human aquaporin 4 and includes a priori epitopes recognised
           by T cells

        -  Identification of peptides which, after binding to the HLA antigens, might induce a
           cytolytic response directed against the immune cells involved in the maintenance and
           triggering of the disease (i.e. non-cytolytic T cells recognising the same epitopes and
           APC presenting the same epitopes)

        -  Non selective genomic analysis (SNPs) in the scope of the single cell transcriptomic
           analysis technics
