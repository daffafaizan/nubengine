      injury occurs following a cardiopulmonary bypass used during cardiac surgery procedures. The
      pathomechanisms of acute kidney injury (AKI) is complex and multifactorial. It may involve
      few injury pathways: ischemia and reperfusion, endogenous toxins, inflammation, metabolic
      factors and oxidative stress. Biochemical markers of acute kidney injury such as ischemia
      modified albumin (IMA) or urinary excreted of brush-border enzymes of the proximal renal
      tubules analysed perioperatively will be assessed in this study. There has been no official
      recommendations toward routine use of analysed biomarkers.
