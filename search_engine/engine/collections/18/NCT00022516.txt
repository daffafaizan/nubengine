        -  Evaluate a low-dose cyclophosphamide and methotrexate chemotherapy-maintenance regimen
           in early breast cancer.

        -  Compare the disease-free survival, overall survival, and systemic disease-free survival
           of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, menopausal status (pre vs post), and approved induction chemotherapy
      (anthracycline and cyclophosphamide vs other agents). Treatment duration is 12 months of
      low-dose chemotherapy-maintenance regimen (CM-maintenance) vs no chemotherapy-maintenance
      regimen (no-CM) following standard adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms. Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years, and yearly follow-up
      thereafter.
