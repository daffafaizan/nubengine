      evaluate the safety and efficacy of delayed continuous use of bivalirudin 4 hours after ePCI
      for the treatment of peri-operative myocardial injury (PMI) compared with bivalirudin use
      during ePCI. Based on previous study reported and estimated 10% loss follow-up of these
      patients in each arm, a total of 330 patients with CHD were required in our study, and with
      165 patients per group as a ratio of 1:1 randomization.
