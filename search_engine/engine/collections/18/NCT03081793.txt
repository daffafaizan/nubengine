      determination of the blood oxygen saturation level of the patient. The same device often
      reports also an average pulse rate of the subject.

      If the subject has low blood perfusion in the hands or suffers from acute atrial
      fibrillation, the determination of the pulse rate is challenging and therefore the readings
      provided by current technology are unreliable.

      Optical heart rate monitors (OHR) have recently become popular in sports and wellness
      applications and their performance in healthy subjects having normal blood perfusion in the
      extremities is well studied and documented and good accuracy has been shown healthy subjects.
      The performance of wrist-worn OHR monitors in hospital patients, however, has not been
      extensively studied.

      The aim of the study is to test novel wrist-worn photoplethysmographic (PPG) device in
      surgery patients and study its feasibility in detecting heart rate and beat to beat heart
      rate of patients having normal sinus rhythm or arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation (AF).
