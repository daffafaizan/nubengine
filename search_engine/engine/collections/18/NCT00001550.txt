      severe and painful axial and limb rigidity enhanced by anxiety, sudden motion or external
      stimuli. Although the cause of SMS is unknown, immunologic mechanisms have been implicated on
      the basis of circulating autoantibodies in the patient's serum and CSF, against GAD (glutamic
      acid decarboxylase), the enzyme involved in the synthesis of GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid).
      Uncontrolled studies have also shown that plasmapheresis, corticosteroids and high dose
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are variably effective in improving the clinical symptoms
      of these patients. The purpose of the present study is to demonstrate in a double blind,
      placebo-control design, the efficacy of IVIg in patients with SMS. The effect of IVIg will be
      assessed with a series of objective measurements including muscle function, mobility and
      stiffness. Changes in the circulating anti-GAD antibodies will be also examined and their
      pathogenetic role in the cause of SMS will be determined. If IVIg proves effective, it will
      be a valuable tool in the treatment of these patients who are currently dependent on high
      doses of Valium (up to 60-100 mg daily), or steroids and experience significant side effects.
