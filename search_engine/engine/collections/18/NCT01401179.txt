      perinatal mortality and a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality. Although the
      determinants of preterm labor and delivery are uncertain, evidence suggests intrauterine
      infection is a contributing factor. Antibiotic therapy for women in preterm premature rupture
      of membranes has been a routine practice. However the optimal regimen remains unclear and the
      choice of latency antibiotic regimen is at the discretion of admitting physician. The group 1
      is treated only with cefazolin (1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days). The group 2 is given a
      combination of cefazolin(1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days) and erythromycin(250mg p.o. four
      times a day for 7 days). In group 3, clarithromycin (500mg p.o. 4 times a day for 7 days) was
      treated with cefazolin(1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days). This study is designed to compare
      the efficacy on maternal infection, chorioamnionitis and neonatal morbidity and mortality and
      to review the evidence and provide recommendations on the use of antibiotics, especially by
      comparing the combination regimen in PPROM.
