    
      This study will be a Phase 1, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single and
      multiple ascending dose sequential group design in up to 48 healthy male Japanese subjects,
      performed at a single study center. The planned number of cohorts is 4 but up to 6 cohorts
      may be included if the Safety Review Committee (SRC) considers it necessary to repeat a dose
      level or if additional dose steps are required. Screening will be completed between Days -28
      and -1. Primarily gradual escalation of the dose will be conducted with the oral suspension.
      Eight subjects will participate in each cohort. Four ascending dose levels are planned.
      Within each cohort 6 subjects will be randomised to receive AZD5718 and 2 subjects randomised
      to receive placebo. Each subject will receive one dose of AZD5718 or placebo on the first
      dosing day (Day 1, single ascending dose, SAD) and on Days 3 to 10 (multiple ascending dose,
      MAD). On Day 2 no dose will be given to the subject. In total each subject will receive 9
      doses. Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will proceed after the SRC has evaluated the
      safety, tolerability and other relevant data of a completed cohort. The subjects will stay at
      the study site until 48 hours post-dose and will return 7 to 10 days after dosing for a
      follow-up visit. Each subject will be involved in the study for 7 weeks.
