      success with oral or sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of food allergy. Oral
      treatment, which requires very high doses, is associated with a small but appreciable risk of
      systemic reactions. Sublingual immunotherapy, which utilizes much smaller doses, is safer but
      constraints inherent in the available methods of sublingual administration have limited the
      utility of this method. Typically sublingual immunotherapy for food allergy has used either
      fresh foods or a simple liquid extract. These methods are not optimized for practicality or
      dwell duration in the mouth, and, thus far, dosing has been limited by the ability to make
      concentrated extracts and by the volume of extract that can be applied to the sublingual
      space. This study is being conducted to determine if a dissolving peanut extract film, will
      improve efficacy for immunotherapy for peanut allergy.
