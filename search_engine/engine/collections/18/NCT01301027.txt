    
      Randomization:

      100 overweight or obese patients will be randomly allocated to oral pioglitazone 15 mg/d or
      placebo for two weeks by blocks of five using a random number generator and monitored for
      adverse events including hypoglycemia. If they tolerate the 15 mg pioglitazone or matching
      placebo for two weeks, participants will be assigned to 30 mg of pioglitazone or matching
      placebo for 24 more weeks. Those who received 15 mg of pioglitazone will receive 30 mg of
      pioglitazone for the next 24 weeks. Those who received placebo for initial 2 weeks will
      receive another placebo that matches the 30 mg pioglitazone pill for 24 weeks.

      Baseline:

      Participants will have fasting blood drawn for adipokines: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha
      (TNF-alpha), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), high
      molecular weight Adiponectin (HMW-A), and leptin. All patients will undergo MRI scans on the
      mid-week non-dialysis day. Twenty each of overweight/obese patients randomized to
      pioglitazone or placebo will also undergo subcutaneous fat biopsy on the mid-week
      non-dialysis day.

      Study Period:

      Participants will return to the dialysis unit at weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26.
      During these visits, clinical assessments will be conducted including review of blood sugars,
      jaundice, weight gain, and visual symptoms. Study treatment compliance will be assessed and
      details of adverse events experienced, particularly hospitalizations and emergency department
      visits will be collected. Fasting blood draws for primary and secondary outcomes will be
      collected on visit weeks 10 and 26.
