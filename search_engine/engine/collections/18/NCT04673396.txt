      tolerance test and a pharmacokinetic study. The dosage increment principle of 3+3 was
      adopted. At the end of the tolerance test, 3 dose groups (low, medium and high) were selected
      to conduct pharmacokinetic studies after evaluation by the researchers on the premise of good
      safety, and at least 8 patients were included in each group for PK study (at least 8 patients
      in each group could be evaluated for PK ).

      After the end of the experimental drug tolerance and pharmacokinetics study, the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of single dose administration were compared with that of sodium
      norcantharidate for injection in the dose range of clinical use.
