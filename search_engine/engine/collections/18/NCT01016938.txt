      and external surrogates. We propose to (1) investigate the feasibility of tracking the
      real-time tumor position using dynamic MRI and inferring tumor position using external
      surrogates placed on the skin of the subject and (2) determine lung function during and
      following radiation by assessing lung perfusion maps obtained via dynamic MRI with dose maps
      in order to determine image-based biomarkers for lung toxicity following radiation therapy.
