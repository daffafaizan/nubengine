      pregnancy seeking or a program of three complete IVF cycles (i.e. three oocytes retrievals
      regardless of the number of embryo transfers performed). The initial time point will be the
      time of randomization. Women of both study groups will initiate treatment (surgery or IVF) in
      a shortest delay, maximum 3 months. Only live birth pregnancies and initiating within a
      12-months period starting from this time point will be included in the primary outcome.
