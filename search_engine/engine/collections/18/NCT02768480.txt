      type 2 diabetes, and considered to be eligible to discharge from specialized care to primary
      care will be included. Patients with severe neuropathy, not controlled ischemic heart disease
      and nephropathy stage IV/V will be excluded. Enrolled patients will be randomized in two
      groups: follow-up supported by periodic nurse phone calls plus primary care (intervention
      group) or followed by primary care team (control group). The intervention group will receive
      regular telephone calls (every 3 months for 1 year) and will have a toll-free number to
      resolve questions about the disease management. Main outcome is the glycemic control between
      groups after 1 year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes include: rate of hypoglycaemia, blood
      pressure control,emergency visits, nephropathy progression and death.
