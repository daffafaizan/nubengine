    
      This is an open-label, multiple-dose, multiple-day, single-arm safety study of repeat-doses
      of DIC075V in patients with acute post-operative pain following abdominal (i.e.,
      non-laparoscopic abdominal surgeries) or orthopedic (e.g., hip or knee joint replacement)
      surgery. Eligible patients will receive DIC075V IV bolus q6 hours. Safety assessments will be
      collected at baseline (immediately prior to starting DIC075V therapy) and at study discharge
      or early termination.
