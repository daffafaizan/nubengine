      greater risk for anxiety than the general population. The lifetime prevalence of anxiety in
      MS is estimated at 48.9%, compared to 37.9% in the general population. The negative
      consequences of anxiety for individuals with MS include impairment of work function and
      workplace attrition, increased healthcare usage and healthcare costs, increased physical
      disability (i.e., higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score), and reduced overall
      quality of life. And while anxiety has been shown to be acutely elevated both before and in
      the first years after diagnosis, individuals with longstanding MS also exhibit anxiety at
      higher rates than the general population. Of note, women are at heightened risk for both
      anxiety and MS, and lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with increased prevalence
      of anxiety in MS. In the SUNLIGHT study, participants join a structured meeting in which they
      receive content specifically focused on anxiety, its detrimental impact on individuals with
      MS, and an emphasis on techniques to reduce anxiety. Over the 12-week period of the
      intervention, participants learn techniques for stress reduction that can be
      self-administered, such that the benefits of participation outlive the active period of the
      intervention.
