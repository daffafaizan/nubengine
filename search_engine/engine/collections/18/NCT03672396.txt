      week exercise intervention in mCRPC patients receiving ADT. It will also examine if a
      home-based exercise intervention can improve muscle strength, body composition, physical
      function, cardiopulmonary function fatigue, and patient reported outcomes (fatigue,
      depression, quality of life (QoL)).
