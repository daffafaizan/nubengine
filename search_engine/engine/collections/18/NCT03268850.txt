      superior outcomes compared to dialysis and deceased donor kidney transplantation (KT).
      However, the annual number of LDKTs has declined over the last decade, particularly among
      minority and low-income patients. The investigators hypothesize, and have preliminary data to
      support, that the financial impact on living donors (LDs) is a major contributor to the LDKT
      decline and for persistent racial disparities in LDKT rates. Many LDs have substantial
      non-reimbursed direct and indirect costs, most notably the loss of income or wages following
      surgery. In this study, the investigators will: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of offering
      reimbursement for LD lost wages on the LDKT rate; (2) examine whether offering reimbursement
      for LD lost wages reduces known racial disparities in LDKT; and (3) determine whether study
      outcomes differ significantly by maximum reimbursement amount for LD lost wages.
