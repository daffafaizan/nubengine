      agitation, aggression and apathy. These symptoms are called Behavioural- and Psychological
      Symptoms in Dementia (BPSD), and are difficult to treat. Antipsychotic and antidepressant
      medication is in use, despite its lack of clinical evidence.

      We will discontinue antipsychotics in one group of 12 patients and antidepressants in one
      group of 12 patients. Patients should have dementia of Alzheimer- or vascular origin. They
      should live in Nursing Homes and have no other psychiatric disease for which they receive
      psychotropic drug. They will be registered with 7 different questionnaires at baseline and
      after 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The study period is 24 weeks. The questionnaires are filled in
      by the patients and the nurses at the nursing homes.

      This is an open labelled study with no control group. Based on the results of this study, we
      will design a RCT study with placebo-controlled group.
