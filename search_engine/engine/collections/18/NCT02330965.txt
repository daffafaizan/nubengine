      placebo-controlled, variable treatment duration study comparing the efficacy and safety of
      BAF312 to placebo in patients with SPMS (NCT01665144). Investigators will explore both
      immunological and neuroprotective mechanisms of BAF312 (siponimod), a novel agent in the
      setting of a SPMS clinical trial.

      This study is part of a multi-center study, with the University of Michigan serving as the
      central site.
