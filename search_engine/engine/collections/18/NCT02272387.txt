      population. We will recruit eligible pregnant women 20 weeks 0 days or less. On study entry,
      patients will complete a demographic survey, vitamin D exposure survey, and an Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS) questionnaire. Baseline vitamin D levels will be obtained
      using a 25 OH D (vitamin D) assay.

      Women found to be vitamin D deficient/insufficient will be approached for randomization to
      vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU/week x 8 weeks + prenatal vitamin versus placebo +
      prenatal vitamin. A repeat 25 OH D sample plus a vitamin D exposure and EPDS questionnaires
      will be obtained between 24-28 weeks gestation upon completing treatment. All patients will
      then be kept on maintenance vitamin D until delivery (total vitamin D 800IU/day which
      includes prenatal vitamin). Delivery 25 OH D samples will be collected on all women. At
      delivery, these women will also complete vitamin D exposure and EPDS questionnaires. Maternal
      and fetal outcome data will be collected on all patients.

      As for vitamin D sufficient patients, they will be followed with vitamin D exposure and EPDS
      questionnaires at 24-28 weeks and delivery. A 25 OH D sample will be obtained at delivery for
      these women. Maternal and fetal outcome data will be obtained.

      For vitamin D deficient women declining randomization, they will be given vitamin D repletion
      based on their preference after counseling. We will continue to follow their questionnaires
      and outcomes similarly to the vitamin D sufficient group.
