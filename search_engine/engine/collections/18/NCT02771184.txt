      test subjects. The subjects are either lung-healthy (control group) or subjects with
      pneumothorax condition or pulmonary fibrosis. The lung sounds are recorded in supine position
      on an examination table. A foam pad with several lung sound transducers is placed under the
      back of the subjects. During the recording the subjects wear a nose clip and hold a
      pneumotachograph with both hands. The subjects are instructed to breath at a certain airflow
      rate during inspiration, with natural breathing during expiration. For each subject
      investigators simultaneously record 30 seconds of the airflow signal and the lung sounds from
      16 lung sound transducers.
