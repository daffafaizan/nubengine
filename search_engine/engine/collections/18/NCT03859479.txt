      inclusion criteria, is identified, an endoscopic polypectomy will be assigned. All eligible
      polyps will be randomly assigned (1:1) to endoscopic polypectomy with either the cold snare
      resection or hot snare resection (control group). Randomization will be stratified using
      random numbers. After resection, the marginal mucosa will be carefully observed with used of
      magnification and image enhancement (near focus imaging or narrow band imaging) for determine
      residual tissue. The time period when the snare will be entered in the bowel lumen and until
      a polyp will be retrieved will be recorded by a stopwatch.

      All polyps will be retrieved for morphological examination to estimate R0/R1resetion. After
      polypectomy all patients will be observed for 3-4 days in-hospital to diagnose and eliminate
      complications (delayed bleeding and perforations). All patients will have a control
      colonoscopy 6 months after polypectomy to investigate long-term results.
