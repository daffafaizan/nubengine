      were included in the study and divided into 3 groups. (n=10) (Group 1: Bond a braid retainer,
      Group 2: Ribbond retainer, Group 3: EverStick Ortho retainer). Colour measurements will be
      made with spectrophotometer (Vita easyshade) after debonding (T1), after retainer application
      (T2), in 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and finally 1 year from 6 lower anterior teeth. The
      Commission Internationale de I'Echairage L*a*b* system will be used to determine the tooth
