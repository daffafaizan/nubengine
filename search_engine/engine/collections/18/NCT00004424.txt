      This is a randomized, double blind study.

      Patients are randomized to receive either a continuous infusion of propofol or a continuous
      infusion combination of fentanyl and midazolam preceded by a loading dose. Sedative doses may
      be reduced if necessary. Treatment is continued until sedation is no longer needed, any other
      sedative therapy is administered, or unacceptable toxicity is experienced.

      Patients are assessed after extubation, just prior to hospital discharge, and then every 2
      months for 6 months after hospital discharge.
