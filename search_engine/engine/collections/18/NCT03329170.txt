      Children with CHD are at high risk of developing caries (Stecks√©n-Blicks C et al 2004). In
      Swedish high-risk areas for developing caries, 12 % of three-year-old children had moderate
      and severe carious lesions (ICDAS II 3-6) and 11% initial carious lesions (ICDAS II 1-2)
      (Anderson et al 2016). Based on the assumption that 10% in the intervention group and 30% in
      the control group will develop caries (ICDAS II 1-6), p<0.05 and power 0.80, a sample size of
      at least 65 individuals in each age group is required. 1.7.2017-31.12.2021 198 Finnish
      speaking families will be offered to participate in the study. To secure an even distribution
      block randomization will be used. The patients will be randomized into blocks of 4 and 8,
      with the help of www.randomization.com (Pandis et al 2011).
