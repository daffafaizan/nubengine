      randomized controled.Patients are diagnosed primary liver cancer based on pathology or cell
      biology.They are randomized into 2 groups:both groups receive TACE.The treatment group
      receives Cinobufacini injection 20ml via hepatic artery during Transarterial
      Chemoembolization(TACE) operation , Cinobufacini injection 20ml+5% Glucose injection 500ml
      from the second day of TACE until 7th day, and Cinobufacini tablet 3 tablets Tid for 2
      months..The control group only receives TACE.Mainly to study Cinobufacini leads to the
      influence of the immunologic function after TACE.Immunological examination and Blood
      biochemistry evaluation include the number ratio、activity and function of immune cell,the
      immune cell marker(CD3、CD4、CD8,etc),tumor marker(CEA、AFP),etc.Clinical evaluation includes
      image data(CT/MRI),drug toxicities,quality of life(QOL),etc.
