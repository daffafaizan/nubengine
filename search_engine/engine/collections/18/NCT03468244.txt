      the trial protocol.For patients with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric
      adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma tumor who have
      disease progression with first line chemotherapy. Single or multiple doses of personalized
      mRNA tumor vaccine encoding neoantigen will be given to observe the safety and efficacy the
      mRNA tumor vaccine.

      Primary objectives:

      Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the personalized mRNA tumor vaccine in
      patients with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

      Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of personalized mRNA tumor vaccine in patients
      with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma with the following parameters:

      Time of tumor progression (TTP);

      Disease Control Rate (DCR);

      Objective Remission Rate (ORR);

      Overall Survival (OS).
