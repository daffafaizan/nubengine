    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the incidence of graft rejection and severe graft-versus-host disease after
           myeloablative HLA-mismatched peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from
           first-degree relatives in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate overall survival, relapse, non-relapse mortality, and event-free survival in
           these patients.

        -  To characterize additional hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities of myeloablative
           haploidentical PBSCT.

        -  To characterize donor hematopoietic chimerism in peripheral blood stem cells after
           PBSCT.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days
           -7 to -2, busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -7 to -4, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2
           hours on days -3 and -2.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo infusion
           of unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells on day 0.

        -  Post-transplant regimen: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours
           on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus IV over 24 hours or orally twice daily on days 5-180, and
           oral mycophenolate mofetil 3 times daily on days 5-34 followed by a taper to day 90.
           Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or clinically significant
           graft-vs-host disease.

      After completion of PBSCT, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.
