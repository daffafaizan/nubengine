    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare length of hospital stay between patients treated with thoracic epidural
      analgesia (TEA) versus (vs.) pre-incision ultrasound-guided, four-quadrant transversus
      abdominus plane (TAP) block after open liver resection within an enhanced recovery program.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the area under the curve of early (0-48 hour) post-operative pain scores and
      number of patients who experience severe postoperative pain between the TEA and TAP groups.

      II. To compare anesthetic-related complication rates and need to change modalities between
      TEA and TAP groups.

      III. To compare surgery-related complications (including 30-day readmission and 90-day
      mortality rates) between TEA and TAP groups.

      IV. To compare return to baseline symptom burden, functional and cognitive status between TEA
      and TAP groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo placement of thoracic epidural catheter before surgery. Patients
      receive hydromorphone hydrochloride and bupivacaine via thoracic epidural catheter every 10
      minutes or 3 hours as needed. Patients may receive fentanyl and bupivacaine or plain
      bupivacaine via thoracic epidural catheter.

      ARM II: Patients undergo placement of ultrasound-guided, four-quadrant transversus abdominus
      plane block. Patients receive plain bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine via TAP block.
