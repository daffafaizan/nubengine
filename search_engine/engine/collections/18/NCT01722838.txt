      to evaluate its efficacy in reducing HIV risk behaviors and 3) to expand the limited body of
      research on HIV prevention/risk reduction practices for African American men who have sex
      with men(AAMSM). The study will use a randomized-controlled trial design to compare receiving
      B-ME intervention to receiving basic men's health and wellness messaging (standard of care),
      hypothesizing: hypothesizing: that participants who complete B-ME intervention will report
      greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors than the standard of care comparison group. The
      study will utilize a pre-test/post-test design with participants randomized to intervention
      and comparison groups; have a strategy to retain at least 80% of participants through study
      completion; collect data at baseline, at 3 months post-intervention, and at 6 months
      post-intervention; and rigorously measure outcomes that directly impact HIV risk. Data will
      be collected at each assessment point to assess B-ME's ability to improve behavioral outcomes
      that directly impact Black MSM HIV risk: (1) number of unprotected anal and vaginal sex
      events; (2) number of unprotected sex events with persons of unknown HIV status; (3)
      frequency of HIV testing, and (4) increased communication between partners about sex and
      strategies for reducing the risk of HIV infection.
