      treatment administered 3 times with a 2-week interval between each administration in
      different tumor types. In absence of progressive disease at the first tumor assessment
      following NKR-2 administratio, the patient will receive a new cycle of 3 administrations
      maximum with a 2-week interval. The study will contain two consecutive segments: a Phase I
      dose escalation and a Phase I expansion segment.

      The Phase I dose escalation segment will include 2 arms, one in solid tumors and one in
      hematological tumors. The dose escalation design will include 3 dose levels: The dose
      escalation phase will consist of 3 cohorts (Cohorts 1-3) for the solid tumors, and 3 cohorts
      (Cohorts 4-6) for the hematological tumors; with each set of 3 cohorts receiving escalating
      doses of the NKR-2 therapy.

      Two additional cohorts will be added in each dose escalation arm with the aim to provide a
      more intense treatment during the induction treatment. These additional cohorts in both the
      solid arm (cohort 8-9 - only in CRC) and in the hematological arm of the study (cohort 10-11
      - only in AML/MDS) will therefore evaluate a tighter schedule of NKR-2 injections with the
      three first injections within the induction cycle separated by a 1-week interval followed two
      weeks later by a second cycle (cycle 2) with a 2-weeks interval between each three NKR 2
      injections. These cohorts will each enroll 3 patients in case of no DLT. Based on safety and
      early clinical data from these cohorts, the specific schedule of cohorts 8-11 might be
      selected for the expansion.
