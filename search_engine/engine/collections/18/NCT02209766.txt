    
      This is a Phase 1, single-centre study that plans to enrol 3 cohorts in 3 study arms (Study
      Arms A, B and C). Study Arms A and B will be comprised of cohorts of healthy male Japanese
      subjects in randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose parallel
      studies and Study Arm C will be comprised of a cohort of healthy male Caucasian subjects in a
      single and multiple dose open-label study.

      Two dose levels, 2 and 4 g D5884, will be investigated in healthy male Japanese subjects. Up
      to 18 healthy male Japanese subjects aged 20 to 45 years, inclusive, will be enrolled in 2
      cohorts (Study Arms A and B) and up to 6 healthy male Caucasian subjects will be enrolled in
      a 3rd cohort (Study Arm C). Each subject will participate in 1 cohort only.

      Following a screening period of a maximum of 42 days, subjects will reside at the study
      facility for 18 nights starting from the day before dosing (Day -1) to Day 18 (day of
      discharge). The follow-up period after dosing will be 8 (Â±2) days after last dose. Dose
      administration in all 3 study arms will be done in the following sequence: a single dose of
      D5884 or placebo will be administered; this will be followed by a 2-day washout period; after
      the washout period, multiple doses of D5884 or placebo will be administered, once daily for
      14 consecutive days. The 1st cohort (Study Arm A) will receive 2 g D5884 (n=6) or placebo
      (n=3), the 2nd cohort (Study Arm B) will receive 4 g D5884 (n=6) or placebo (n=3) and the 3rd
      cohort (Study Arm C) will receive 4 g D5884 (n=6).

      The PK analysis included all evaluable PK data appropriate for the evaluation of interest
      (eg, with no major protocol deviations or violations thought to significantly affect the PK
      of the drug) from all subjects who received D5884.
