      and motor impairments. In the literature, there are lots of studies including various
      approaches for rehabilitation of these parameters such as sensory interventions, conservative
      treatments, neurophysiological approaches and motor imagery. The posture of the cervical
      region is impaired by the findings of the disease such as rigidity, flexor posture and loss
      of axial rotation. Considering that the cervical region is rich in proprioceptors and one of
      the key points for the vestibular system, interventions to this area can be thought to
      contribute to postural control and gait. However, taking into account of literature, there is
      no study investigating the effects on balance and gait of cervical mobilization by
      stimulating proprioceptors and vestibular receptors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      investigate the acute effect of cervical mobilization on balance and gait in patients with
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
