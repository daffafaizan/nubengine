      treatment group, who will receive the HHT program; or a control group. Patients in the active
      treatment group will receive the 12-week digital audio HHT program. This protocol consists of
      7 sessions, each approximately 30-40 minutes, administered every 2 weeks, for a cumulative 12
      weeks of treatment, along with a shorter (approximately 12 minute) session administered
      daily. Patients in the control group will receive a digital audio educational program.
      Subjects in both groups will be assessed at baseline, 4-6 weeks into treatment, at the end of
      the treatment, and 3 months after conclusion of the program. Global change in symptoms will
      be assessed with a 7-point Likert scale. Patients will be considered to respond if they have
      significant improvement on the Likert scale at the post-treatment visit. Patients will
      complete a chest pain symptom diary, the SCL-90 and the Coping Strategies
      Questionnaire-Catastrophizing subscale to assess psychological features, and the SF-36 as a
      measure of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL).
