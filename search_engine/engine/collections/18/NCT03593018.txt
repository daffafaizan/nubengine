      more resistant to conventional chemotherapy and is generally associated with an inferior
      outcome. In case of relapsed of refractory disease, survival durations are in the range of
      only a few months.

      Several agents have been evaluated in this setting in recent years: romidepsin, bendamustine
      or belinostat. The response rate with these agents rarely exceeds 30% and responses are
      usually of limited duration.

      Azacitidine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with
      various myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes. In this case, azacitidine significantly
      increase the survival time compared to standard of care option. This response to azacitidine
      could be correlated to the existence of recurrent mutations and those mutations have also
      been described in AITL.

      The present protocol will use Azacitidine according to the same schedule than in MDS that is
      continuous treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
