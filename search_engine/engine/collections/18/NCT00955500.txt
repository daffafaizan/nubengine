      and poor quality of life. Appearance of HE occurs in the setting of precipitating factors
      that increase plasma ammonia. The gastrointestinal tract is the primary source of ammonia,
      which is produced by enterocytes from glutamine and by colonic bacterial catabolism of
      nitrogenous sources, such as ingested proteins. This is the rationale for proposing
      low-protein diet as strategy to reduce ammonia production and as standard diet in patients
      with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. However, low-protein diet could cause wasting
      muscle and predispose to recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy, since muscle is an important
      site for extrahepatic ammonia removal.

      Branched-chain amino acids have shown beneficial effects on mental state of patients with
      chronic hepatic encephalopathy. The possible mechanism of action may be improvement of
      nutritional status through induction of protein synthesis. However, role of branched-chain
      amino acids in treatment and prevention of acute hepatic encephalopathy is not established.

      Administration of a normal-protein diet containing oral branched-chain amino acids may reduce
      recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy as compared to a low-protein diet.
