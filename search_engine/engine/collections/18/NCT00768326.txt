      world's population. Antipsychotic drugs remain the cornerstone in the pharmacotherapy of
      schizophrenia. However, none of the available drugs is ideal, in particular because of their
      complex safety profile and the limited effectiveness against certain symptoms of the disease.
      Thus, only one dimension of the morbidity, that is, the positive symptoms, can be expected to
      respond to treatment whereas negative symptoms and cognitive deficits are, at best, only
      marginally targeted.

      Given this, there is no doubt that the current antipsychotic drugs leave much room for
      improvement and call for new, more effective pharmacotherapies in the treatment of
      schizophrenia. In the current study, patients suffering from schizophrenia and experiencing
      clinically significant symptoms of the disease will be included. In the current study,
      eligible patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to blinded treatment with either Lu
      31-130 (3, 5, 7, 10 or 14 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. The study includes 5 parts with
      increasing doses of Lu 31-130 (Part A [3 mg/day], B [5 mg/day], C [7 mg/day], D [10 mg/day],
      and E [14 mg/day]). A decision to initiate Part B [5 mg/day of Lu 31-130], C [7 mg/day of Lu
      31-130] or D [10 mg/day of Lu 31-130] will be based on safety and tolerability of the
      previous study part. Dependent on the safety, tolerability and PK data from Part D the study
      may proceed with Part E. The efficacy and the safety of Lu 31-130 will be evaluated in
      comparison to the pooled placebo group from all 5 study parts.
