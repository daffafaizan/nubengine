      patients with advanced malignancy harboring cyclin pathway aberrations (CCN/CDK alterations).
      The investigators study will determine whether cyclin signaling aberrations associate with
      response to this CDK inhibitor. Once completed, this study will identify subpopulations of
      patients that would best benefit from CDK inhibitor therapy with palbociclib and suggest
      directions for future study.
