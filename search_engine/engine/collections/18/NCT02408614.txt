      been reported to influence the acute vascular responses to exercise. However, little is known
      regarding the influence of interval training, aging and gender on these responses. The
      objectives of this study are: 1) to examine the acute vascular responses to continuous low-
      and moderate-intensity exercise and interval training; and 2) to examine the influence of age
      and gender on these responses. Subjects will perform the following 3 types of treadmill
      exercise in a random order: 1) slow-pace walking; 2) moderate-pace walking; and 3) interval
      training. Flow mediated dilation using high resolution ultrasonography and arterial stiffness
      using applanation tonometry will be measured before, immediately after and 1-hour after each
      acute bout of exercise.
