      participants, and will randomize and allocate participants 1:1 to the 'Mindful Living With
      Insomnia (MLWI)' group (n=500) and the 'CBT-I' group (n=500). The Intervention will involve
      12 sessions over 6 weeks course, 2 sessions a week and 0.5 hours per session. The primary
      outcome will be sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), severity
      of insomnia symptoms assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and sleep parameters
      recorded using Mi Smart Band. The secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety,
      depression, and mindfulness. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the
      intervention period, and at a 3-month follow-up. Analysis of covariance, regression analysis,
      Ï‡2 test, t-test, Pearson's correlations will be applied in data analysis.
