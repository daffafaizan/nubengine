      and shrink-age has been analysed in the experimental setting, there is scarce data available
      in humans. In addition, different mesh fixation techniques are applied, but the influence of
      mesh fixation on shrinkage is not known in human patients.

      Mesh shrinkage is assessed using two different techniques for fixation.

      Blinded randomized trial using a Parietene composite mesh for laparoscopic ventral hernia
      repair. Patients with ventral hernias of no larger than 8 cm were assigned to either mesh
      fixation using transfacial nonabsorbable sutures or titan tacks. Primary endpoint was mesh
      migration, secondary endpoints were mesh shrinkage, surgical morbidity and pain.
