    
      All patients receive standardized anesthesia care for hepato-biliary surgery according to the
      existing anesthesia protocol. The type of anaesthesia will be randomized : propolipid (TIV)
      or sevorane(inhalation).

      At designated times, hemodynamic variables will be recorded.

      These will include:

        -  HF (/min)

        -  CVP (mmHg),

        -  MAP (mmHg)

        -  CI (L/min.m2)

        -  PPV (pulse pressure variation). Hemodynamic measurement will be done using PiCCO
           catheter.

      The hemodynamic measurements will be compared and related to hepato-splanchnic blood flow and
      pressure measurements performed by the surgeon:

        -  Flow v. porta

        -  Flow art. hepatica

        -  Pressure v. porta

        -  Pressure v. cava The flow measurements will be done using ultrasound transit time ï¬‚ow
           measurements TTFM (Medi-Stim AS, Oslo, Norway).

      At the same time pressure measurements will be obtained in portal vein and caval vein using a
      25-gauge needle which is directly placed in the vein. Both flow and pressure will be
      simultaneously recorded (VeriQ 4122, Medi-Stim AS, Oslo, Norway). Both measurements will be
      done during apnea to minimize the effect of ventilation on pressure & flow. Flow values will
      be expressed in ml per minute, pressure values will be expressed in mmHg.
