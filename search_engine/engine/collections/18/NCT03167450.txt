      community by storm with the promise it holds to cure and ease the burden of debilitating
      diseases. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the implications of using this type
      of tool in human research and medicine. Researchers need to understand the viewpoints of
      patients, their families, and their providers, to ensure that the approach taken towards
      gene-editing is inclusive and respectful of different interests and concerns. The dialogue,
      thus far, has been dominated by scientific researchers, physician scientists, ethicists,
      public health and policy experts. It is important to the advancement of the science to study
      the patient s perspective about the use of the technology. In addition, parents often play
      important roles in the decision-making process; in this regard, understanding the views and
      questions of this group of individuals regarding CRISPR/Cas9 human use is essential. We
      conduct a qualitative study with a mixed methods component to investigate the knowledge,
      attitudes and beliefs of patients living with sickle cell disease (SCD), the parents of
      patients with SCD, and the physicians of this patient population regarding the use of
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The study is designed to measure these three cohorts baseline overall
      genetic literacy, CRISPR-specific literacy, and general attitudes and beliefs toward
      gene-editing/CRISPR Cas9(in both somatic and germline cells); to evaluate the utility of an
      educational tool in improving one s understanding of this innovative technique; and to gauge
      how attitudes and beliefs toward gene-editing, specifically CRISPR Cas9, perhaps shift or
      remain intact after the educational video, as well as within a focus group space.
