      Reported in 2011 by the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects 116 million American
      adults - more than the total number of individuals affected by heart disease, cancer, and
      diabetes combined. An estimated $635 billion each year is spent in the medical management of
      chronic pain and lost productivity. Better clinical methods to diagnose and localize pain are
      needed.

      The investigators have developed a S1R-specific radiotracer, [18F]FTC-146. Using imaging
      approaches to assess the location of S1R in pain may provide a tool to diagnose pain
      generators, monitor treatment response, and aid in the selection of patients for treatment.

      The goal is to use [18F]FTC-146 to image S1R expression in healthy volunteers and to compare
      the images to those individuals suffering from pain conditions in the following categories:
      (1) nociceptive pain (pain that results from tissue injury or inflammation), (2) neuropathic
      pain (pain that results from direct injury, disruption, impingement/compression or
      malfunction of the peripheral and/or central nervous system), and (3) mixed pain (pain that
      appears to have both nociceptive and neuropathic).
