      after clinical examination and imaging procedures performed, held at Okan University
      Hospital, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Clinic. Data will be recorded with the shoulder
      evaluation form in the study and cases will be divided into three groups with simple
      randomization method. The initial range of motion of the participants will be evaluated
      bilaterally using an electro-goniometer. The muscle tone evaluation will be made with
      MyotonPro. Muscle strength assessment will be performed with the MicroFET2 dynamometer at the
      appropriate measurement positions. Participants' pain assessment will be done in the rest,
      activity and night pain using the Visual Analog Scale. The Shoulder Pain Disability Scale
      will be used to assess participants' shoulder function. The short-form-36 questionnaire will
      be used evaluating the quality of life. Physiotherapy application will be applied to all
      three groups in the form of standard treatment protocol, duration and number. For the first
      group ESWT application will be done at energy density of 0.12 mJ/mm2, in the second group, at
      an energy density of 0.3 mJ/mm2, for the third group application will be done as sham ESWT.
      The ESWT will be administered once a week and in two separate sessions of 2000 strokes. After
      initial measurements, re-evaluations will be done in the fourth and sixth weeks. The
      statistics will be analyzed by appropriate methods.
