      resistance will be recruited and randomized into two groups according to their body mass
      index (BMI), i.e. normal weight (BMI=18.5-23Kg/m2) group and overweight or obese (BMI >
      23Kg/m2) group1. The acupuncture treatment will last for six months, 3 times per week, 30
      minutes per treatment. The primary outcome is changes in insulin sensitivity from baseline to
      after 6 months of acupuncture treatment measured by OGTT.
