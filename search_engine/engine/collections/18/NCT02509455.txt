    
      1. Determine a long time recording (over 60s) description of any differences in the drift
           and noise for the 2 systems during simultaneous recordings with the systems aligned with
           each other at rest.

        2. Compare Sensoro trunk sway measures with those of SwayStar for a battery of 17 stance
           and gait tasks. The tasks to range from tasks with small velocities (standing on 2 legs
           eyes open, ca 0.1 deg/s or eyes closed on foam ca.10 deg/s) through tandem and gait
           tasks with velocities of ca 70 deg/s to the most dynamic with high velocities (rising
           from a chair, ca 150 deg/sec).

        3. Estimate the additional value of adding trunk sway values for the yaw axis as an outcome
           measure of balance control.

        4. Estimate the advantage of adding one or two sensors on the legs to help identify gait
           balance events and body posture.
