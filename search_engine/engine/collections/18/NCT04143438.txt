      Surgery is commonly used to stabilise the patella during knee flexion. However proofs of
      efficacy of surgery on patello-femoral kinematics have not yet been found. Analysis of the
      patello-femoral kinematics is crucial to understand, assess et correct the patella
      instability. The investigators have developed, validated and published a 3D analysis method
      from biplanar X-rays (EOS 3D imaging). Our aim in this study is to assess the correction of
      the patello-femoral kinematics after surgery using the EOS 3D imaging method.
