      or meat, at a level often seen in late infancy, in healthy, prepubertal children can increase
      fasting levels of serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 as well as insulin, glucose and HOMA
      insulin reststance, HOMA beta cell function and amino acids.

      IGF-I levels are positively associated with growth velocity in children and some studies
      suggest that a high animal PI can stimulate growth. During protein deprivation IGF-I
      decrease, but it is unknown whether a high PI can increase s-IGF-I in well-nourished
      children.

      Insulin is also a growth factor, and studies have found that postprandially, milk possess
      some insulinotrophic effect not related to its carbohydrate content. However, the effect on
      fasting insulin in children is unknown.

      Design: Twenty-four 8-y-old boys are asked to take either 1.5 l of skimmed milk (n=12) or the
      same amount of protein as 250 g low fat meat (n=12) daily for seven days. The remaining diet
      they can choose freely. At baseline and after seven days, anthropometrical variables are
      measured, diet is registered (3-d weighed records), and the blood analytes are determined
      after fast.
