    
      Patients that meet eligibility criteria and are seen in a clinic assigned to the control
      group will be given a Control-Encounter Decision Intervention (Control-EDI) about kidney
      disease in general (not tailored to the patient) by their primary care provider. Eligible
      patients that agree to participate and give consent will complete enrollment, 1, 6, and 12
      month follow-up visits.

      Eligible patients that are seen in a clinic assigned to the intervention group will be given
      a personalized Intervention-EDI by their primary care provider. Following this, eligible
      patients that agree to participate and give consent will complete the enrollment visit, and
      have a baseline call with a health coach. In addition to the 1, 6, 12 month follow-up visits
      these patients will also have approximately 4-6 phone calls with the health coach between the
      baseline visit and 11 months after enrollment.

      In both groups the study team will be collecting medical information and assessments
      regarding their health; blood sample and urine samples at baseline and 12 months;
      approximately 4-6 phone calls; as well as surveys at various time points.

      In order to reduce in-person human subject activity due to the Coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) pandemic, participants in both groups receive an at home blood pressure monitor so
      that systolic- & diastolic-BP data can be collected at all 4 time points (baseline, 1, 6, 12
      months).
