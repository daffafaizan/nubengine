      be particularly resistant to systemic treatment, and no systemic therapy has yet been
      demonstrated to improve survival. Drugs commonly used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma
      rarely achieve durable responses in patients with uveal melanoma. Because of the lack of
      effective systemic treatment options, outcomes are poor once metastatic disease occurs, and
      the median survival from the time of the development of distant metastatic disease is 6 to 12
      months. Although it is clear that novel effective therapies are desperately needed for this
      disease, the development of such therapies has been hampered by the rarity of uveal melanoma.
