        -  Determine the efficacy of chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin
           in combination with pegfilgrastim in patients with previously untreated intermediate- or
           poor-risk germ cell tumors.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 120-180 minutes on days 1 and 2, cisplatin IV
      over 30 minutes and ifosfamide IV over 120 minutes on days 1-5, and pegfilgrastim
      subcutaneously on day 6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients may required surgery after chemotherapy and, if viable non-teratomatous germ
      cell tumor is found in the surgical specimen and there is no interval disease progression,
      these patients may receive 1-2 more courses of chemotherapy after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 2
      months for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.
