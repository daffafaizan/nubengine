      in healthy volunteers.

      Rift Valley fever is a disease caused by RVFV and it is transmitted to humans through a
      mosquito bite or contact with virus-contaminated tissues and fluids. Although initially
      restricted to Africa, the virus can be transmitted by several different mosquito species that
      are more widely distributed than the virus itself, leading to concerns of disease spread as
      has occurred in the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar. In humans, RVFV infection usually
      presents as a sudden febrile illness, but severe manifestations including bleeding disorders
      and neurological complications may also occur. RVFV is considered a global health threat with
      significant potential for international spread and use in bioterrorism.

      Vaccines against RVFV are available for livestock, however no licensed vaccines or specific
      treatments are currently available for humans.

      The study will enable assessment of the safety of the new vaccine called ChAdOx1 RVF and the
      extent of immune response in healthy volunteers. Healthy adult volunteers will receive a
      single dose of a new candidate vaccine at different doses. The objective of this
      first-in-human study is to find the optimal dose of the vaccine, balancing immune responses
      and profile of adverse events.

      Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited in Oxford and vaccinated at the Centre for
      Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine and will be followed for a period of 3 months. The
      study is funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(BBSRC) and
      the Medical Research Council (MRC)/Department of Health, through the UK Vaccines Network.
