      patients. The poor prognosis of the disease is partly attributed to difficulties encountered
      with the diagnosis of this infection. Invasive sampling procedures are often precluded in
      these patients. In addition, conventional diagnostic techniques lack sensitivity. Recently
      there has been increasing interest in the investigation of the lungs by noninvasive means
      including measurement of biomarkers in exhaled breath (e.g. NO) and those found in the cooled
      and condensed exhalate,termed EBC. It has been demonstrated that a measurable fraction of the
      EBC in healthy subjects is derived from aerosolized airway lining fluid. The presence of
      biomarkers for IPA will be investigated in EBC of patients with IPA, compared to controls.
