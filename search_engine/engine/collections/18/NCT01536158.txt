      tolerance in closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants.

      Eighty preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus will be enrolled in this
      prospective-randomized study. Patients will receive oral ibuprofen at an initial dose of 10
      mg/kg, followed by 5 mg/kg at 24 and 48 h or oral paracetamol 15 mg/kg per dose every 6
      hours.

      One of the following echocardiographic criteria of a duct size >1.5 mm, a left
      atrium-to-aorta ratio >1.5, left-to-right shunting of blood, end diastolic reversal of blood
      flow in the aorta, or poor cardiac function in addition signs of patent ductus arteriosis
      determined the need of treatment.
