      Primary objective:

      1. To compare the change in pain intensity from baseline based on the Numeric Rating Scale
      [NRS] between subjects randomized to the IDDS group and subjects randomized to the CMM
      group.The comparison will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months following enrollment. The
      evaluation at 6 months will be considered the primary time point for evaluation.

      Secondary objectives:

      For each of the following secondary objectives, the comparisons between the IDDS group and
      CMM group will be made using the intra-subject change from baseline as the dependent
      variable.

        1. Compare the subject reported PROMIS 29 between the IDDS group and CMM group. Individual
           subject scores recorded at baseline and months 3, 6, 9 and 12.

        2. Compare the accrued cost of therapy for pain control including those related to adverse
           events, ED visits, cost of medications between the IDDS group and CMM group

        3. Compare the number of other concurrent treatments performed on each subject between the
           IDDS group and CMM group. Individual subject counts recorded at months 3, 6, 9 and 12
           will be compared.

      Additional safety objective:

      1. To characterize pain and device related adverse events for all subjects throughout the
      study through completion of 12 month follow-up or subject exit.
