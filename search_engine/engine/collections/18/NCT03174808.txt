      standard mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) protocol. Participants will be assigned
      home practice based on the MBSR protocol, and will be given audio recordings (MP3) to
      accompany and instruct in home practice.

      Eligible participants will attend weekly group sessions for 8 weeks and will be assessed at
      baseline, following cessation of the intervention (8-weeks), and 16 weeks. Outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Extended effects of the intervention will be
      assessed at 16 weeks.
