      support for the residual beta cell mass. This integrated therapeutic regimen addresses major
      pathogenic mechanisms in T1D (Type 1 Diabetes) and thus represents a rational and well
      supported approach to preserve insulin secretion in T1D (Type 1 Diabetes). This approach
      could halt the disease progress, preserve Î²-cell function and hopefully reduce dose of
      insulin required to manage T1D (Type 1 Diabetes). The investigator hypothesizes that Omega-3
      Fatty Acids and Vitamin D, administered to patients with newly or established T1D (Type 1
      Diabetes) and residual stimulated C-peptide secretion will be safe and may preserve insulin
      secretion.
