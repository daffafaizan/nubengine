      severe malaria. The effect of the intervention on the mother's psychological wellbeing will
      also be assessed. Both caregivers and children will be assessed on the ward before being
      randomly assigned to the treatment arms. The interventions in both arms will be done in three
      phases with the third phase being done at home after discharge. Post-intervention assessments
      will be done on both the caregivers and mothers 6 months after discharge.
