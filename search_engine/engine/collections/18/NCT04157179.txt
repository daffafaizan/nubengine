      metabolic stress at risk for permanent injury. We will measure CBF, OEF, and CVR in children
      with and without perturbations in cerebral oxygen delivery over time to determine each
      parameter's role in clinical and radiologic neurologic outcomes. Measuring CBF and OEF can be
      done with specialized MRI sequences. Measuring CVR requires a vasoactive response, such as
      carbon dioxide. In order to delivery carbon dioxide evenly and as safely as possible, we will
      use an MRI-compatible device to prevent over-breathing carbon dioxide and allow rapid
      steady-state physiology to minimize total scan time.
