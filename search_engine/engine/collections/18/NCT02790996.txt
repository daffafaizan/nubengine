        -  To compare the efficacy of an optimised vancomycin dosing regimen to a standard
           vancomycin dosing regimen in patients with late onset, bacterial sepsis, known or
           suspected to be caused by Gram-positive microorganisms.

        -  To compare the safety of vancomycin (including renal and hearing safety) by allocation
           group in the intention to treat (ITT) population

        -  To describe the PK parameters according to vancomycin dosing regimen and outcome using
           population PK modelling in the ITT population

        -  To describe PK/PD in terms of the probability of target attainment (PTA) with different
           vancomycin dosing regimens in the ITT and per protocol (PP) populations

        -  To describe outcomes and duration of therapy at the end of vancomycin treatment and at
           the short term follow-up visit by allocation group in the ITT and PP populations

        -  To compare the clinical outcome to the antibacterial susceptibility of infecting
           organisms

        -  To compare colonisation by resistant microorganisms (e.g. vancomycin-resistant
           enterococci (VRE)) and Candida spp. by allocation group at baseline, TOC and short-term
           follow-up

        -  To validate across multiple centres a host biomarker panel to allow improved diagnosis
           of bacterial sepsis and monitor response to antibacterial therapy
