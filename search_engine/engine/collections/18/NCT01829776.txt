      previous 2 months to participate in the FFF program. All subjects will record their falls and
      injurious falls on a daily basis for at least 3 weeks before the program, during the program
      and for 8 weeks after the program. The program will consist of a weekly 2 hour session. One
      hour of the session will be educational and one hour of the program will involve exercise.
      The outcome of this study will be change in fall rate between the periods before, during and
