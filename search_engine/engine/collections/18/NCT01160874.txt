      Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the capacity to drive in adults presenting an ADHD. Duration of
      participation for each patients will be 7 days. Four days after inclusion, patients will have
      to stop all psychostimulant treatment. Participants will then spend 24 hours (on days 6 and
      7) at the "Groupe d'Etudes Neurophysiologie Pharmacologie Sommeil et Sommnolence"(GENPPHASS)
      in the "Centre Hospitalier Universitaire"(CHU) of Bordeaux. During this time, they will
      undergo complete polysomnography.The next day, they will perform a Maintenance Wakefulness
      Test (MWT). A neuropsychological evaluation of one hour will also be done. Finally, a driving
      test on a simulator will be performed.

      Study significance: patients will benefit from an objective exploration of their sleep (with
      possibly, a sleep disorder discovery) and from a specific treatment. This study will
      demonstrate the necessity to investigate daytime function (sleepiness and performance) and
      the sleep quality of patients with ADHD. It will also demonstrate that part of the adults
      with ADHD handicap is based on an awakening disorder which adds to the attentional disorder.
