      will receive the recommended dose of leuprorelin 3.75 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks
      for 96 weeks. Participants with body weight <20 kg will receive recommended dose of 1.88 mg
      subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 96 weeks.

      This trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study is 104
      weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic, and will be followed-up by the
