    
      Primary aim:

      To investigate the acute renal response to respiratory alterations of acid-base equilibrium
      in order to better understand the underlying physiological mechanisms and to evaluate the
      validity of a renal monitoring system to indirectly assess the effectiveness of the
      respiratory function.

      Secondary aim:

      To collect data on the chronic response of the renal system in patients affected by chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as on the acute response to acute variation of
      the chronic respiratory acidosis characterizing patients affected by COPD exacerbation.

      Study protol:

      Mechanically ventilated patients will undergo controlled variation of the ventilatory setting
      (hyperventilation vs. hypoventilation) in order to induce a controlled reduction or increase
      in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (and an increase or reduction of arterial pH),
      within normal range of pH (7.35 - 7.45) During the variations, urinary concentrations of
      electrolytes and pH will be monitored.
