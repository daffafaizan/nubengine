      especially those independent of dialysis. Based on the personal experience of experts from
      different areas in China, patients with stage 5 CKD have been treated with different
      formulations of herbs including Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi), Codonopsis pilosula
      (Dangshen), Semen Cuscutae (Tusizi) and Radix et Rhizoma Rhei (Dahuang) etc. . Based on the
      Traditional Chinese Medicine theory and clinical practise, these herbal medicines help
      strengthening "spleen-kidney" and dispelling "turbidity" . To determine whether CM therapies
      including Chinese herbal formula, Chinese patent medicine via oral pattern and/or Colonic
      administration, will significantly defer dialysis initiation, we conduct the Chinese Medicine
      on Deferring Dialysis Initiation (C-MODDI) study. It's a multicenter, prospective, controlled
      trial, also an effectiveness study that are conducted in the "real world" of a variety of
      busy clinical practices, with heterogeneous interventions that are more representative of the
      general effectiveness of CM therapies.
