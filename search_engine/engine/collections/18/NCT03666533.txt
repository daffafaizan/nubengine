      to dependence on others, recurrent falls, limitations in community ambulation and poor
      quality of life. The main objective of this study is to test both efficacy and
      neurophysiological mechanisms of a novel approach to treat persistent gait deficits after
      stroke with a combination of simultaneous non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial
      Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and gait training. The investigators will enroll chronic
      stroke subjects (>6 months) with gait deficits. Subjects will be randomized to 10 sessions of
      either active tDCS+gait training or sham tDCS+gait training. Gait training will be
      accomplished in the treadmill-based Virtual Reality environment targeting longer single limb
      stance with the paretic limb. The primary outcome measure will be both gait speed and single
      limb stance duration. Other outcome measures will assess various components of gait-related
      functional domains. The study will also characterize neuroplastic brain changes in response
      to bihemispheric tDCS combined with gait training based on corticospinal excitability using
      motor evoked potentials and functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI).
