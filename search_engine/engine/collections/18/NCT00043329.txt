      IFN-g 1b (ActimmuneÂ®) is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) to reduce the
      frequency and severity of serious infections. It is also approved in patients with severe,
      malignant osteopetrosis to delay the time to disease progression. In research trials, IFN-g
      1b has been given to over 2,000 patients in diseases such as CGD, osteopetrosis, atopic
      dermatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, atypical mycobacteria and various cancers.
