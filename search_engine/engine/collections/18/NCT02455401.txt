      that results in dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, bleeding, delayed hospital discharge, as
      well as decreased parental satisfaction and an unpleasant experience for the pediatric
      patients. Although administration of perioperative opioids increases POV incidence,
      remifentanil has less affect the incidence of POV than other opioids such as fentanyl.
      However, there are few study that evaluate the effects of remifentanil on the incidence of
      POV. Therefore, the investigators will conducted the study that the effects of remifentanil
      on the incidence of POV in children undergoing strabismus surgery during sevoflurane
      anesthesia. One hundred five children from 3 to 6 yr of age, ASA physical status 1 or 2 were
      assigned randomly selected to one of three groups: high dose remifentanil group (bolus 1.0
      mcg/kg; infusion 0.1 mcg/kg/min), low remifentanil group (bolus 0.5 mcg/kg; infusion 0.1
      mcg/kg/min), or no remifentanil group (no remifentanil administration). Primary endpoint, the
      incidence of POV for 24 hours postoperatively, will be compared between three study groups.
