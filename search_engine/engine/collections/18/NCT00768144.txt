      response (OR) defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The null and
      alternative OR rate were 5% and 20%. If one or more patients enrolled in the stage one cohort
      (n=17 patients) achieved PR or better than accrual would proceed to stage two (n=18
      patients). There was 42% probability of stopping the trial at stage one if the true OR rate
      was 5%. With 35 patients, this design had 85% power to detect the 15% difference in OR rates
      assuming 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05.
