      disc has been the topic of multiple studies in the literature. The results have been mixed,
      with the majority of the studies finding some benefit, but outcomes have varied drastically
      amongst the many studies. The aim of this study is to develop a grading scale for
      intraoperative assessment of nerve root inflammation to determine if this subjective
      assessment is an adequate indicator for response to epidural steroids following discectomy.
      Patients will be allocated randomly preoperatively to the intervention group versus control
      group. Pictures of the spinal cord and associated nerve root will be captured
      intraoperatively. These pictures will be scrutinized postoperatively and an inflammation
      grade will be assigned. The investigators will then identify if nerve roots with a
      higher-grade of inflammation respond differently to epidural steroid administration when
      compared to lesser-grades of inflammation. This will be measured with the a variety of
      outcome measures.
