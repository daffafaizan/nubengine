    
      Eligible healthy participants will be randomized to receive either treatment sequence 1 (AB)
      or treatment sequence 2 (BA), as follows:

        -  Treatment A: Acalabrutinib tablet, 100 mg, fasted state

        -  Treatment B: Acalabrutinib capsule, 100 mg, fasted state

      Participants will receive fixed single doses of acalabrutinib on 2 occasions, under fasted
      conditions.

      The study will comprise:

        -  Visit 1: A screening period of up to 28 days before first dosing.

        -  Visit 2: Two treatment periods:

             -  Participants will be admitted to the study center on Day -2 of Treatment Period 1
                to confirm eligibility before first dosing. Eligibility criteria will be
                reconfirmed on Day -1 of each treatment period.

             -  On Day 1 of Treatment Periods 1 and 2, participants will be administered the
                assigned treatment (A or B) as randomized, followed by a protocol defined washout
                period between Treatment Periods 1 and 2.

        -  Visit 3: A Follow-up Visit/Early Termination Visit at 7 to 10 days after last
           administration of study drug.

      Each participant will be involved in the study for approximately 6 weeks.
