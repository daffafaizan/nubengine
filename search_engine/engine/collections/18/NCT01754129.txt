      had concluded the naso-intestinal phase were included in this study. DUODOPA was administered
      via a portable pump directly into the proximal small intestine via a percutaneous endoscopic
      transgastric jejunostomy (PEG-J) tube. There were 3 planned visits during the study:
      enrollment (Visit 1), 1 year (Visit 2), and 2 years (Visit 3).
