      of their child to the emergency department for asthma care. Those participants randomized to
      the intervention will receive additional education on effective communication with their
      child's primary care provider (PCP). These participants will also receive educational text
      messages for three months after their initial visit. Text messages will include education on
      effectively communicating with their child's provider and general asthma information. Both
      the control group and intervention group will receive text message reminders to schedule
      regular follow up visits with their PCP and get an annual flu shot. Both groups will be
      contacted for follow up phone interviews at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
