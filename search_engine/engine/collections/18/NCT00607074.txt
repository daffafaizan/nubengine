    
      A randomised double-blind controlled intervention of 36 weeks duration was conducted in a
      rural community located 40kms north-west of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Infants aged
      between 3 and 11 months were randomly assigned to either receiving anti-Giardia and
      antihelmintic treatment, or anti-Giardia treatment only, or a control group receiving
      placebos. Weight and supine length were recorded every 4 weeks. Every 12 weeks intestinal
      permeability (L/M ratio), haemoglobin, plasma albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein,
      immunoglobulin G and Giardia intestinalis specific IgM titre (GSIgM) and eggs of the three
      common geohelminths and Giardia intestinalis cysts were determined.
