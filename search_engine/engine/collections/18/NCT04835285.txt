      (GE Signa) with 8-channel surface coil for body scanning. For myocardium, pancreas and
      pituitary gland iron overload quantification in children we have used special sequences for
      T2*-mapping based on fast gradient echo sequences - multi-phase fast gradient echo and
      ultrashort gradient echo (uTE) in axial and coronary plane. For breath-hold acquisition due
      to failure of communication and invariable behavior some children received anaesthetic
      support with mechanical ventilation. Miocardium, pancreas and pituitary gland T2* relaxometry
      maps were calculated automatically by commertial application ReportCARD Functool (GE
      Healthcare) and integrated Philips T2* maps.

      The placement of region of interest (ROI) in target organ were performed by following
      criterion: for the myocardium - in the interventricular septum in short axis plane; for the
      pancreas - in corpus in axial plane; for the pituitary gland - in adenohypophysis; for all
      organs the area of large and small blood vessels, which can introduce distortions of the
      obtained results were excluded. Then for selected ROI T2* data acquisition in milisecond [ms]
      were performed and calculated automatically by approximating the attenuation curve with the
      highest likelihood method.
