      non toxic end products. If paracetamol is administered in supra-therapeutic doses this
      pathway becomes saturated and an alternative pathway is utilised. This results in a toxic
      metabolite called N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). If NAPQI is not metabolised by
      glutathione to cysteine and mercapturic acid, then NAPQI bind to hepatic cells resulting in
      necrosis and hepatotoxicity.

      Therefore the investigators plan to measure the levels of the paracetamol metabolites in
      patient undergoing liver resection.

      Patients will undergo liver resection according to their onco-surgical requirements. As part
      of the normal post operative care they will receive 1g paracetamol every six hours unless
      stated otherwise by the operating surgeon. Urinary samples will be taken for the first 4 post
      operative days and used for analysis of the urinary paracetamol metabolite levels.
