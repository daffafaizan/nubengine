      Primary

        -  Evaluate the tumor response rate in patients with previously treated metastatic breast
           cancer treated with vinflunine and capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Describe the adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Describe the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive vinflunine IV over 20 minutes on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on
      days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every other course, and at the completion of study
      treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
