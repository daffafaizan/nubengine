           addition to cisplatin and doxorubicin, patients will receive 5-fluorouracil
           intravenously as a continuous infusion for the duration of the study. In order to do
           this, patients will receive an infusion pump that can be carried with them. Treatment
           cycles will be repeated every 21 days for a maximum of 8 cycles.

        -  Prior to enrollment in this study and while the patient is receiving the therapy,
           routine blood tests and x-ryas (including chest x-rays and CT scans) will be performed
           to check the body's response to the treatment. Blood tests will be checked once a week
           and chest x-rays and CT scans will be checked every 6 weeks.

        -  Patients with progressive disease or intolerable side effects will be removed from the
           study. Patients with stable disease or tumor response will continue therapy for a
           maximum of 8 cycles.
