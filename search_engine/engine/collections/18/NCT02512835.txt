      spots, and determine prospectively how clinicians use these community data at the point of
      care and for populations of patients. The investigators hypothesize that (1) the patients in
      a primary care practice live in a range of communities with different social determinants of
      health, including cold spots that lack health-promoting resources, (2) community vital signs
      are associated with patient health outcomes (e.g., being up-to-date with preventive care,
      control of chronic conditions, morbidity), and (3) knowing that a patient resides in a cold
      spot will help clinicians improve patient care.

      Aim 1a: Determine community vital sign cold spots in the catchment area of 12 primary care
      practices.

      Aim 1b: Determine whether patients residing in cold spots experience worse outcomes, such as
      receiving inadequate care, worse chronic disease control, or higher morbidity.

      Aim 2: Determine whether knowing a patient's community vital signs and social needs at the
      point of care will change clinical management; and explore how practices could use community
      vital signs for population care.

      Aim 3: Identify other community vital signs that practices would find useful for managing
      patients.
