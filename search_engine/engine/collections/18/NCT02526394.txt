      the characteristics of the people who are these cases, makes it clear that UK adolescents
      will require booster doses of vaccination for both in the near future. These are increasingly
      important priorities for the national immunisation policy advisers to the Department of
      Health, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).

      There are good indications that the likely target agegroup for these booster vaccinations
      will be at 14-17 years. Therefore this study seeks primarily to measure antibody responses to
      the meningitis C and whooping cough vaccines when given at the same time in this agegroup,
      and see how well the vaccines are tolerated.

      Up to 800 adolescents will be recruited across eight study groups. The eight groups arise as
      a result of combinations of four meningococcal and two whooping cough vaccines each
      participant will receive a single dose of each of the two types of vaccine (i.e. two
      injections). Two blood samples will be collected of 10ml each, one prior to vaccination and
      the second at 35 weeks later. These samples will allow assessment of how the immune system
      responds to the vaccinations in terms of the antibodies that are present in the blood.

      The study will also be assessing how well the vaccines are tolerated in this age group when
      given together, as described above. Each participant will therefor be asked to complete a
      health diary for the week following vaccination. This will record any redness/ swelling/ pain
      at the injection site as well as any illnesses or visits to a GP or hospital.
