      is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it working
      for a long time. Unless a person receiving a kidney from someone else takes drugs that reduce
      immune function, the kidney will be rejected. Those drugs must be continued life-long and
      cause many issues. Therefore, tolerance of the transplanted kidney, without chronic rejection
      and without the need for permanent immunosuppressive drug treatment, is a highly desirable
      goal. If this can be achieved, it would make "one kidney for life" possible.

      The study treatment includes several days of study medications followed by a kidney and bone
      marrow transplant. After the transplant, the study treatment will continue with a few more
      doses of study medications and then anti-rejection medication is started. After a while, the
      anti-rejection medication is slowly stopped. Researchers will examine blood and tissue
      samples and try to identify genetic markers for certain conditions like chimerism, response
      to therapy, and tolerance.

      *** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the
      Immune Tolerance Network do not recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy
      for recipients of cell, organ, or tissue transplants outside of physician-directed,
      controlled clinical studies. Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can
      result in serious health consequences and should only be performed in certain rare
      circumstances, upon the recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider.
