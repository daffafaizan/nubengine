        1. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
           plerixafor in combination with fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan as a conditioning
           regimen for children and young adults undergoing a second allogeneic stem cell
           transplant (SCT) procedure.

        2. The study determines the secondary objectives:

             -  To describe the pharmacokinetic properties of plerixafor in this study population

             -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse and overall survival in study
                participants at one year after this second transplant procedure

        3. Other exploratory objectives include:

             -  To study the correlation between the pharmacokinetic properties of plerixafor and
                key regulatory and effector T cell populations in blood before and after exposure
                to plerixafor.

             -  To evaluate the content of leukemia cells in bone marrow and in blood before and
                after exposure to plerixafor

             -  To evaluate key regulatory and effector T cell populations in bone marrow and in
                blood before and after exposure to plerixafor
