      between 10% and 40%. Several treatment alternatives have been suggested until now.
      Nevertheless, the ideal treatment has not been identified yet. On the one hand this is
      related to the low amount of valid scientific information regarding different treatment
      methods. On the other hand the impact of patients' quality of life, which plays a major role,
      has not been fully considered. To date, there is no established Questionnaire on Quality of
      Life that provides physicians an assistance to obtain information on the subjective effects
      caused by stress urinary incontinence.

      In the present study the patients' Quality of Life will be assessed by use of two
      questionnaires, that is a new one and an already validated questionnaire. The study
      population consists of patients who already received an implantation of a sub-urethral
      surgical mesh (TiLOOP® Tape), of symptomatic patients before an operation, and of a group of
      non-symptomatic women. Subjects will be asked in a single visit only to fill in both
      questionnaires.

      Furthermore the safety and effectiveness of the TiLOOP® Tape mesh will be evaluated in the
      study arm of treated patients.

      Study has been terminated after major recruitment failure (only 21 instead of 240 patients
      has been included).
