      in patients with metastatic or recurrent nonhematologic malignancies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive gemcitabine IV on
      days 1 and 8, followed immediately by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 8. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 5 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
