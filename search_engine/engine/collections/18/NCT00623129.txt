        -  To determine if electrostimulation using the Liss stimulator can objectively improve
           salivary flow as measured by sialometry compared to a placebo device in patients with
           chronic radiation-induced xerostomia and head and neck cancer.

        -  To determine if electrostimulation using the Liss Stimulator can improve the subjective
           sensation of mouth dryness compared to a placebo device.

        -  To characterize the effect of electrostimulation using the Liss stimulator on quality of
           life compared to a placebo device.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo placement of electrodes to the following acupuncture points:
           stomach, liver, pericardium, small intestine, and large intestine. Patients then undergo
           electro-stimulation of the acupuncture points using the Liss Stimulator for 20 minutes
           once a day for 10 days and then 3 times a week for 2 weeks.

        -  Arm II (placebo): Patients undergo placement of electrodes to the following acupuncture
           points: stomach, liver, pericardium, small intestine, and large intestine. A device that
           does not produce an electric current is placed over the electrodes for 20 minutes once a
           day for 10 days and then 3 times a week for 2 weeks.

      Patients complete questionnaires, including the Brief Pain Inventory, the Xerostomia
      Inventory, and a subscale of the University of Washington Head and Neck Symptom Scale, at
      baseline, on days 5 and 10 of treatment, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after completion of
      treatment. Sialometry (unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva measurement) is also
      performed at the same time points.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months.
