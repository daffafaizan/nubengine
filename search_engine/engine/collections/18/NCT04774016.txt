      months of life. After 6 months of age, requirements for absorbed iron are high, as infants
      need to build body iron stores and triple their body weight before the first year of life.
      Iron concentrations in mature breastmilk are low (~0.3 mg/L) and cannot adequately cover the
      high iron requirements of children between 6 and 24 months of age. Follow-up formulas (FUF)
      are fortified milk-based products intended for infants above 6 months of age and young
      children aged 1-3 years, and are widely used as a liquid part of the weaning diet to
      supplement the diet of young children with macro- and micronutrients. Prebiotics and
      probiotics are increasingly added to foods for infants and young children due to emerging
      evidence on possible health benefits. We recently showed that the addition of prebiotic
      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) to an iron-containing micronutrient powder increased iron
      absorption in Kenyan infants. To our knowledge, the effect of the combination of pre- and
      probiotics (synbiotic) or human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) on iron absorption from an
      iron-fortified FUF has not been investigated.

      Thai children (10-14 months old) will be assigned to receive FUF fortified with isotopically
      labelled iron as FeSO4 1) with synbiotic, 2) HMO, and 3) without added prebiotics as a
      reference, in random order. Besides the iron source and synbiotic or HMO, the test FUF will
      be identical in terms of macro- and micronutrient composition. For the secondary objectives
      of this study, which will have a single-group, before-after design, each infant will receive
      the test FUF with added synbiotic for 25 days on gut comfort and quality of life outcomes.
