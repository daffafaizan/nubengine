      hepatocellular carcinoma. The programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody, was effective
      and tolerable in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor thrombus. We
      aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib combined anti-PD1 antibody in
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who can not receive redical therapy.
