      regulated by the equilibrium between the opposite hyperopic and myopic defocus. A sharp focus
      of retinal image (foveal fixation) is fundamental for co-ordination of the equilibrium. The
      DISC lens is a custom-made multi-zone bifocal soft contact lens which is based on
      simultaneously provides clear vision and defocus at all viewing distances. It comprises of
      correcting zones for correcting distant prescription(correction of refractive error, and
      defocusing zones to incorporate constant myopic defocus for slowing down myopia progression.
