        -  Evaluate the clinical efficacy of HAART intensification with MVC as treatment of HIV-1
           infection in patients with a CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/uL and/or a recovery of CD4 cells <
           25% compared to the HAART initiation and with a complete and stable virologic
           suppression after 12 months of HAART. Patients could also being included if their CD4
           slope has been stable without any improvement, with an absolute value around 200
           cells/uL.

        -  Evaluate the effects of HAART intensification with MVC on the modification of
           immunologic and virologic parameters.

        -  Evaluate the tolerability of HAART intensification with MVC and the appearance of
           drug-related side effects.

      Design:

      This will be a randomised, multicenter, study that will evaluate HAART intensification with
      MVC as treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients with a CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/uL and/or a
      recovery of CD4 cells < 25% compared to the HAART initiation and/or a stable CD4 slope
      without any improvement, with an absolute value around 200 cells/uL and with a complete and
      stable virologic suppression after 12 months of HAART.
