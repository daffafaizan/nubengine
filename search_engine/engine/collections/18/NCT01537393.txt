      by an eye bank. The donor cornea is placed into a liquid that helps preserve the cornea until
      it is transplanted. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved storage of the cornea
      in this liquid for up to 14 days before the transplant. The purpose of this study is to see
      if the length of time the donor cornea is kept in the preservation liquid before the
      transplant affects the likelihood of the transplant being successful. We will follow
      participants for 3 years after transplant to see if there are any differences in transplant
      success or in the number of transplanted endothelial cells (the layer of cells that line the
      undersurface of the cornea) on the corneas that were preserved for 7 days or less compared to
      those preserved between 8 and 14 days. We have no reason to believe that there is any greater
      risk for transplant failure with either preservation time group.
