      and stone extraction. The randomization process will be done using closed envelop method and
      will be withdrawn by a nurse in the outpatient clinic.

        1. Patients in conservative treatment group will receive medical treatment in the form of
           antibiotics, analgesics and antispasmodics for 3 days. These patients will be followed
           up for improvement on the ground of clinical symptoms and serum bilirubin level and
           abdominal US for CBD stones.

             1. Improvement: If the stone spontaneously passes to the duodenum and CBD is clear
                completely from the stones proved by US, the patient will undergo laparoscopic
                cholecystectomy (LC) within 3 days.

             2. No improvement: the patient will undergo ERCP and then LC.

        2. Patients in ERCP group will undergo ERCP and wide papillotomy and stone extraction
           directly then laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) within 3 days.
