      physical therapists. Even before reporting to clinics there is long history of using over the
      counter pain killers. Pain avoidance behaviors let the joint stiff so much that a clinician
      help is sought. Most times the cause of frozen shoulder is not known, therefore is termed as
      'idiopathic frozen shoulder'.There is huge literature regarding the management of frozen
      shoulder and yet after the decades of research there are gaps in treatment options. In modern
      age of health care, it is common goal of every health care to make patient self-sufficient as
      early as possible. The self-care models have tremendous advantages. The current study has
      compared the use of theraband, co-contraction and isometric exercises. The current study was
      novel in a way that there is limited literature about treating shoulder hypomobility with
      physical strengthening exercises. All three methods were employed to see if they improve
      ranges along with accompanying pain and disability.
