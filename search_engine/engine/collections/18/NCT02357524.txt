      acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused or suspected to be caused
      by susceptible isolates of designated Gram-positive microorganisms.

      Antibiotics of this class (lipoglycopeptide and lipopeptide antibiotics) artificially prolong
      phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) by binding to and preventing the action of the phospholipid
      reagents needed to activate coagulation.

      Because precipitation of oritavancin has been shown to occur in human plasma at
      concentrations as low as 50 Î¼g/mL in vitro, a relevant approach to further elucidate the full
      range of effects of oritavancin plasma concentrations on coagulation testing would be to
      conduct a clinical study in healthy volunteers in which coagulation tests are monitored
      following a single 3 hour infusion of 1200 mg oritavancin. The data from this study will help
      inform physicians about how to manage patients who require coagulation monitoring in the
      setting of treatment with oritavancin.
