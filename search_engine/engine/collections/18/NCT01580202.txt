      risk of HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare, and lamivudine (LAM) prophylaxis is recommended
      according to the practice guidelines despite of limited evidence. However, failure of LAM
      prophylaxis defined as virologic breakthrough during LAM therapy and withdrawal hepatitis
      after discontinuation of LAM therapy occurs occasionally, which may lead to liver-related
      morbidity and mortality as well as premature interruption or a delay of chemotherapy.
      Considering that LAM therapy showed relatively higher rates of drug resistance and of
      withdrawal hepatitis, studies on the better choice of prophylactic antiviral regimen is
      warranted.

      The purpose of our study is to conduct a multicenter, prospective, randomized study comparing
      the effect of entecavir (ETV) versus LAM for the prevention of HBV reactivation in
      HBsAg-positive patients with hematologic and oncologic malignancy undergoing cytotoxic
      chemotherapy.

      A total one hundred eighty HBV carriers with malignancy undergoing chemotherapy will be
      randomly assigned to each prophylactic therapy arm of ETV and LAM group. The primary endpoint
      of the study is the HBV reactivation rate during antiviral therapy and 6 months after
      discontinuation of prophylactic antiviral therapy.

      If the prophylactic efficacy of ETV is superior to that of LAM, ETV will be the preferred
      prophylactic therapy for HBsAg-positive cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
