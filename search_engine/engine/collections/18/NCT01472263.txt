      is the causative agent of HTLV associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).
      Although only 5% of HTLV-infected individuals will develop HAM/TSP, the investigatorts have
      observed that about 30% have neurological complaints and/or neurogenic bladder associated
      with HTLV-1. The immunopathogenesis of those diseases is related to the exaggerated immune
      response with high production of cytokines and induced neurological injury. So far there is
      not any effective drug against HTLV-1 and modulation of the immune response can help to
      alleviate the clinical manifestations of those patients and prevent the progression of
      symptoms. The preliminary data show that pentoxifylline has ability to decrease production of
      TNF-α and IFN-γ in patients with HTLV-1 infection and patients with HAM/TSP. The proposal
      entitled "Evaluation of the efficacy of pentoxifylline in attenuating the neurological
      disease associated with HTLV-1 and negatively modulate the immune pathological response"
      extends the previous studies in order to determine the ability of pentoxifylline in modulate
      the immune response and modify the course of the clinical manifestations in patients infected
      with HTLV-1. The influence on the immune response in the expression of disease will be
      determined in a therapeutic trial with two groups of patients: 1) patients with neurogenic
      bladder associated with HTLV-1, 2) patients with HAM/TSP. Primary end point is clinical and
      neurological exam and secondary end point are measure of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α,
      IFN-γ, IL-1 and IL-6) and chemokines that attract T cells to sites of inflammation (CXCL9 and
      CXCL10).
