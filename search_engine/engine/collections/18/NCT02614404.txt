      with dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine on suppression of parasitemia in patients with
      uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In vitro studies of P. falciparum parasitized
      erythrocytes demonstrate that inhibitors of the protein tyrosine kinase SYK prevent malaria
      parasite egress from infected red blood cells and thereby terminate the parasite's life
      cycle. Although no potent syk kinase inhibitors were approved for human use at the time of
      initiation of this study, a bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate (GleevecÂ®))
      that also exhibits off-target inhibition of syk tyrosine kinase, has been FDA-approved for
      treatment of a number of human malignancies including chronic myelogenous leukemia and GIST.
      Because imatinib can be taken daily for many years without significant toxicity, it can be
      used to obtain a preliminary indication of whether inhibition of erythrocyte syk kinase can
      suppress parasitemia in patients with P. falciparum malaria. In a phase 1 clinical trial on
      the same patient population, anti-malaria activity was observed with imatinib, with little or
      no accompanying toxicity. Because dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine constitute the
      currently used standard-of-care therapy for malaria in Southeast Asia, the above trial will
      test the safety and efficacy of the combination of imatinib plus dihydroartemisinin and
      piperaquine in treatment of uncomplicated malaria. In this pilot study, the rate of decrease
      in peripheral blood parasitemia in 30 adult male patients with uncomplicated malaria will be
      compared to the same rate of decrease in parasitemia in 30 adult male patients treated solely
      with dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine.
