      leukocyte antigen (HLA) production by normal antibody secreting cells (ASC) in sensitized
      renal allograft candidates. The design involves treatment of subjects with bortezomib using
      one of three dosing regimens (4 doses, 16 doses or 32 doses of bortezomib). Using novel
      assays, anti-HLA production is determined by measuring the bone marrow derived ASC at
      baseline (prior to therapy) and after treatment (at day 14, 3 days after the last bortezomib
      dose). Paired data are used with patients serving as their own controls. Finally, the safety
      of bortezomib is evaluated by monitoring total serum antibody levels and the incidence of
      side effects (primarily neuropathy) at 1 month, the final follow-up point.
