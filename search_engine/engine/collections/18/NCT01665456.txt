      providers in averting serious child birth related complications at the community level. For
      instance, no one knows what happens to pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and the baby in
      a context where a significant proportion of women are delivered by neighbors, relatives or on
      their own. Literature is also scanty regarding the outcomes of child birth related
      complications in situations where Traditional Birth Attendants conduct a significant
      proportion of deliveries.

      A thorough understanding of factors that fuel disrespect and abuse as well as their effect on
      utilization of delivery services will help providers and programme managers to explore ways
      of addressing this issue. This study hypothesizes that since majority of deliveries take
      place at the household level, most complications and even deaths are likely to occur at this
      level.

      The overall objective of this study is to determine the effect of provider type in the
      occurrence and management of serious childbirth related complications among postpartum women
      at the community level in Bungoma and Lugari Districts of Western Province, Kenya. Specific
      objectives of the study are:

      To determine the quality of obstetric care given by community midwives and TBAs to clients
      seeking antenatal care, during delivery and post-partum care at the community level by
      assessing providers' preparedness and the range of services offered.

      To assess the nature of obstetric complications among those women who were delivered by
      skilled health providers, versus those who were delivered by TBAs, neighbors, friends or on
      their own To determine the role of socio-economic, demographic and health service related
      factors in the occurrence of child birth related complications at the community level To
      obtain views from key stakeholders on the extent and occurrence of child birth related
      complications at the community level
