      commonly performed procedure for the treatment of painful arthritis of the shoulder, and
      numerous studies have demonstrated its success. During this time, much has been learned about
      the efficacy, as well as the complications, of the procedure, and since its introduction in
      the 1950's, shoulder arthroplasty has undergone an evolution in design. The value of such
      innovations has not yet been determined and will depend on the results of long term follow-up
      studies. The purpose of this study is to provide follow-up information and design
      modification directives.
