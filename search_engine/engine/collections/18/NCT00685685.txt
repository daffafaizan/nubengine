    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the relative bioavailability and
      therefore the bioequivalence of a test formulation of lovastatin tablets to an equivalent
      dose of Mevacor® tablets after a single oral dose administered under fasting conditions.

      Fifty-four healthy, light/non/or ex-smoking, non-obese, male volunteers at least 18 years of
      age will be randomly assigned in a crossover fashion to receive each of two lovastatin dosing
      regimens in sequence with a 7 day washout period between dosing periods. On the morning of
      Day 1, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive either a single
      oral dose of the test formulation, lovastatin (1 x 40 mg tablet), or a single oral dose of
      the reference formulation, Mevacor® (1 x 40 mg tablet). After a 7 day washout period on the
      morning of Day 8, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive the
      alternate regimen. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and for 24
      hours post-dose on a confined basis at times sufficient to adequately define the
      pharmacokinetics of lovastatin. Blood sampling will then continue on a non-confined basis at
      36 and 48 hours post-dose. A further goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of this regimen in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be monitored throughout the
      confinement portion of the study for adverse reactions to the study drug and/or procedures.
      Vital signs will be monitored if judged necessary by the physician in charge. All adverse
      events whether elicited by query, spontaneously reported, or observed by clinic staff will be
      evaluated by the Investigator and reported in the subject's case report form.
