      In England, everyone in the age group of 60-69 years is invited to participate in bowel
      cancer screening. Those who test positive in the initial screening stool test are invited to
      have a colonoscopy. The purpose of colonoscopy is to detect any obvious cancers, and in the
      absence of obvious cancers the purpose is to detect and remove all the polyps present in the
      colon, as polyps have the potential to develop into cancers. However, colonoscopy still
      misses up to 25% of polyps. Cap assisted colonoscopy improves polyp detection but still
      misses a significant number of polyps. There is a need for an improved cap design which will
      help improve polyp detection.

      Research question/hypothesis:

      Does using an endocuff on a colonoscope improve polyp detection as compared to standard
      colonoscopy in bowel cancer screening patients?

      Study design:

      Parallel group, single blinded randomised controlled trial

      Study participants:

      Patients attending for colonoscopy under the bowel cancer screening programme

      Planned sample size: 534

      Planned study period: 12 months

      Primary objective:

      To assess the impact of endocuff assisted colonoscopy on the number of polyps detected per
      patient
