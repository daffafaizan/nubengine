      pathologic markers in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for epilepsy or Parkinson
      disease. Newly developed technology allows for the chronic recording of these brain signals
      at the same time as clinical stimulation is occuring. We will learn both whether these HFO
      correlate with disease activity and whether the HFO change in response to ongoing stimulation
      (potentially giving insight into the underlying mechanism of action of DBS). Study
      participants will undergo DBS in the same way as is usually done but will receive this newer
      battery with ability to record brain signals.
