    
      This is a single arm phase II study of SBRT for prostate cancer to primarily assess acute and
      late toxicity and secondarily PSA outcomes and quality of life measurements of an extreme
      hypofractionated regimen of 36.25Gy in 5 fractions over 10-11 days. The radiation therapy is
      to be delivered using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with the aid of volumetric
      image guidance to ensure accuracy. Toxicity will be measured at preset intervals, as will
      HRQOL parameters using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC) questionaire which
      focuses on bowel, urinary, sexual and hormonal symptoms.
