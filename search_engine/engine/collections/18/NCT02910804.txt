      would be of great help in GBM patients. BBN, with the amino acid sequence of
      Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2, has been extensively used for the development of
      molecular probes for the imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), a member of
      the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors that over-expressed in various
      types of cancer cells including glioblastoma multiforme. For interests in clinical
      translation of GRPR targeting dual modality probe, an open label dual modality imaging PET/
      NIFR study was designed to investigate the safety and imaging guiding performance of
      68Ga-BBN-IRDye800CW in patients with GBM.
