      adjuvant chemotherapy in subjects with early stage (I-III), HER-2 normal breast cancer. A
      total of 80 adult subjects will be enrolled in order to have 73 subjects who start the
      eribulin portion of the adjuvant study regimen. After completion of 4 cycles of AC, each
      subject will begin 4 cycles of eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes
      on Days 1 and 8 of every 21 day cycle.
