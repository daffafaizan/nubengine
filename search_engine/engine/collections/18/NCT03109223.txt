      arms and a reference breast fed group. The experimental variable is the composition of infant
      formula fed to healthy term infants for a period of 16 weeks upon entering the study as their
      sole source of nutrition. The formulations are a commercial control (Control, NPS-E23); and
      the control formula containing the human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) 2-fucosyllactose (2FL) at
      1g/L (HMO, NPS-E23XA).

      Infants will be enrolled on or before 14 days of age and fed a study assigned formula for 16
      weeks. Weight, length and head circumference will be measured at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12
      and 16 weeks of study entry. Formula volume will be recorded for a three-day period before
      each visit. Fecal samples will be obtained at baseline (convenience samples) and at week 16
      for all subjects and analyzed for microbial populations. Buccal cheek cells of all infants,
      and mothers of breast fed infants, obtained by swab at week 16 will be genotyped for FUT2.
      Information on adverse events and new/change of medications will be collected at in person
      visits and by telephone interviews between in-person visits.

      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: It is estimated that approximately up to approximately 200 subjects will
      be enrolled in the formula groups to obtain up to approximately 65 evaluable per protocol
      subjects in each group. As non-randomized reference group of approximately 85 breastfed
      infants will be enrolled to obtain approximately 65 evaluable infants.
