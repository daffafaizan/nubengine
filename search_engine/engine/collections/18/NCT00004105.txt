      (RPTDs) of vinorelbine and paclitaxel when combined with a fixed dose of estramustine in
      patients with advanced cancers or metastatic prostate cancer. II. Determine the toxicity
      pattern of this regimen at the MTDs and at the RPTDs in these patients. III. Make preliminary
      observations of antitumor activity in these patients treated with this regimen as leads for
      the Phase II portion of this study. IV. Establish the efficacy of the RPTDs of vinorelbine
      and paclitaxel when combined with estramustine in patients with prostate cancer who fulfill
      the criteria for the Phase II portion of this study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of vinorelbine and paclitaxel. Patients
      receive oral estramustine every 8 hours on days 0-2 and 7-9 and vinorelbine IV over 6-10
      minutes immediately followed by paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 2 and 9. Courses repeat
      every 21 days. Patients with complete response, partial response, or stable disease continue
      treatment indefinitely in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vinorelbine and paclitaxel until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each drug is determined. The MTD is defined as the lowest
      dose at which 2 or more of 3-6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. The recommended
      Phase II dose of vinorelbine or paclitaxel is defined as the dose immediately preceding the
      MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12-16 patients will be accrued over 1 year for Phase I of the
      study and a total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for Phase II of the study.
