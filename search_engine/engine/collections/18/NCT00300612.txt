      be diagnosed with malignant melanoma and 8,000 will die of the disease this year in the
      Unites States despite all current therapy. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to
      melanoma vaccine therapy using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans
      in attempt to vaccinate patients against their melanoma The expression of the murine
      alpha(1,3)galactosyltransferase [alpha(1,3)GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of
      alpha(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with advanced stage
      melanoma will undergo a series of twelve intradermal injections with a trivalent vaccine
      composed of irradiated allogeneic melanoma cell lines (HAM-1, HAM-2 and HAM-3). These cell
      lines have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based
      retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha(1,3)GT gene. Endpoints of the study include
      determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and
      immunological responses.
