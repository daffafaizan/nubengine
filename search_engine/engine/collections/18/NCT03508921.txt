      for non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB). However, a paucity of data exists regarding
      urinary tract infections (UTI), the most common adverse event following injection. The
      investigators propose a randomized, controlled cross-over trial to investigate the utility of
      commonly practiced antibiotic protocols and simultaneously derive information regarding risk
      factors for post-procedural UTIs and their affect on treatment efficacy.

      The investigators plan to initiate a prospective, randomized non-inferiority cross-over
      trial, in which a participant receives peri-procedural antibiotics exclusively at the time of
      one injection, and then at a subsequent injection, completes a three-day course of
      antibiotics post-operatively in addition to the peri-procedural dose. Enrollment is planned
      to achieve a total of 68 participants. Participants will be evaluated at 3 weeks and 3 months
      following injection to identify adverse events and treatment success. Inter-injection time
      will be measured and used a surrogate for efficacy over multiple injections.

      These results, in addition to filling a void in current literature regarding the increasingly
      utilized treatment with BTX-A, have the potential to modify clinical practice regarding
      antibiotic use and decrease rates of adverse events. The means to stratify patients based on
      their specific risk of UTI may be used to facilitate antibiotic stewardship and improve
      patient outcomes.
