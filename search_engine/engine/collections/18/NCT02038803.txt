    
      Adult cystic fibrosis patients from the Rush University Medical Center Adult Cystic Fibrosis
      Program will be recruited for a prospective before and after cohort study to evaluate patient
      preference for either the TOBI Podhaler or inhaled tobramycin solution and compare the
      efficacy of the TOBI Podhaler to tobramycin inhaled solution. This project will evaluate the
      potential differences in efficacy, medication adherence, treatment time, side effects/adverse
      effects, quality of life, and identify patient preferences between the use of TIP and TIS.
      Measurements after a 28-day cycle of tobramycin inhaled solution, first 28-day cycle of TOBI
      Podhaler and third 28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler will include FEV1, number of acute pulmonary
      exacerbations, adherence, cough frequency, sputum characteristics, and side effects or
      adverse events. The quality of life as assessed by the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised
      (CFQ-R) will be measured after a 28-day cycle of tobramycin inhaled solution and the third
      28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler. The FEV1 values, number of missed treatments, and total
      treatment time will be analyzed through a repeated measures analysis of variance. Comparisons
      of the CFQ-R data before and after the switch to the TPI will be made with the Student's
      t-test. The chi square test will be used to evaluate differences in categorical data. All
      tests will be tested at an alpha equal to 0.05. Responses for the adverse reactions or side
      effects will be listed and categorized. The percentages of patients preferring each inhaled
      solution will be reported.
