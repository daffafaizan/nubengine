      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells for
           cellular adoptive immunotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD4+
           antigen-specific T-cell clones in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CD4+
      antigen-specific T-cell clones are generated over the next 2-3 months using immunogenic
      peptides MART1, tyrosinase, or gp100.

      Patients receive autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells IV over 30 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of autologous CD4+ antigen-specific T-cells
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed on days 1 and 3 post T-cell infusion, and then once weekly for 12
      weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
