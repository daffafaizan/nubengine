      conventional delivery in obstetrical stirrups. It will include nulliparous women presenting
      in active labor to the L&D East (low risk) Unit at Parkland Hospital, > 370/7 weeks
      gestation, with singleton fetuses in cephalic presentation. The primary outcome variable is
      any perineal laceration. Secondary outcomes measures include (1) 3rd or 4th degree
      lacerations and (2) any lacerations in subgroup comparisons between study arms.
