      system of maternal depression prevention and management within Head Start. In our March 2014
      review of the CT.gov protocol, we synchronized it with our institution's IRB protocol, which
      had been modified based on how the individual studies within this series relate to one
      another. Specifically, the original IRB protocol combined two studies into one: a 'main'
      depression prevention trial (n=230, R01MH091871), and a small adjunct pilot aimed at
      referring those with symptoms of major depression to further care (n=60). Thus, the original
      CT.gov protocol included subjects both at risk for depression and with symptoms consistent
      with major depression. When the latter pilot study subsequently received external funding, we
      separated the two studies into two IRB protocols, and thus have adjusted our CT.gov protocol
      to the appropriate sample size of 230, and indicated symptoms of major depression as an
      exclusion criterion for the prevention trial. Because Major Depressive Episode was
      inadvertently listed as a primary outcome measure for the prevention trial (and PTSD and
      Anxiety as secondary outcome measures), we have removed them as such and listed it under
      'other' outcomes, thereby aligning the CT.gov protocol with the statistical analysis plan of
      the original grant application and IRB protocol. Lastly, we corrected administrative errors
      in the study's projected end date and masking design.
