      investigator recruited patients with H pylori infection. Using a computer-generated
      randomization sequence, the investigator randomly allocated patients to either 12-day reverse
      hybrid therapy (pantoprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole
      500 mg for the first 7 days, followed by pantoprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1 g for another 5
      days; with all drugs given twice daily) or a 12-day standard triple therapy (pantoprazole 40
      mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, amoxicillin 1 g for 12 days; with all drugs given twice daily) at
      a 1:1 ratio. Our primary outcome was the eradication rate by intention-to-treat and
      per-protocol analyses.
