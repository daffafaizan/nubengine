      increased levels of physical and/or psychosocial problems after treatment in early breast
      cancer and locally advanced breast cancer.

      830 patients stratified by cancer sites and treatment - a minimum of 120 patients within each
      stratum - will be recruited.

      Institutional data on follow-up policy, demographic and clinical data (related to treatment
      history and tumor characteristics) will be collected. Patients will complete a set of 139
      Quality of Life questions, at one single time point.

      Statistical analysis includes descriptive statistic for socio-demographic and clinical data,
      overall and per treatment, age and risk group. Patterns of follow-up will be identified and
      described overall, and per treatment, age, risk group and country.

      Where available, normative data will be used to identify those QoL domains where there is a
      clinically relevant difference with the general population.

      Multivariable model building will be used to build predictive models on the overall
      population to investigate determinants for the physical, sexual and emotional needs based on
      the identified PROM outcomes. Factor analysis will be undertaken to investigate the
      inter-correlations between physical, sexual and emotional needs in the overall population and
      in the relevant subgroups of interest.

      The magnitude of the observed differences will be assessed by clinical important effect size
      rather than by statistical significance.
