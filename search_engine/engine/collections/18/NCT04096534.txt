      (SRM). The warm ischaemia and hypotonic zero-ischaemia approach are widely used techniques of
      care. But they have some negative effects according to renal function (RF) after surgery. We
      decided to compare influence of arterial blood pressure (normotension or hypotension) during
      partial nephrectomy on RF.

      A single-center prospective study comparing normotonic and hypotonic partial nephrectomy will
      be conducted.

      The design involves random allocation of eligible patients to normotonic or hypotonic partial
      nephrectomy group in 1:1 ratio.

      Experimental group - normotonic partial nephrectomy (avoidance of hypotension: mean blood
      pressure more or equal 65 mm Hg).

      Control group - hypotonic partial nephrectomy (using medical hypotension; avoidance of
      hypertension: mean blood pressure less than 65 mmHg

      According to preliminary calculations, taking into account type I error of 5% and power of
      80%, 100 patients should be included in the study. In order to compensate for data loss, the
      estimated sample size is increased by 10%. As a result, the total sample size is 100 +10 =
      110 patients (55 patients for each group). The expected duration of the study is 36 months.
