      patients with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to sequential dose cohorts. Patient
      safety will be monitored with frequent physical examinations, vital sign measurements,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and hematology and chemistry laboratory studies, and by recording
      all adverse events (AEs). Blood will be obtained for analysis of the concentration of
      belzutifan and to assess biomarkers.

      Part 1B: Once the MTD and/or the RP2D is achieved, and expansion cohort of 50 patients with
      advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) will be enrolled.

      Part 2: After determination of the MTD/RP2D, up to 25 patients with other specified solid
      tumors may be enrolled. Up to 3 different tumor types may be included in this part of the
