    
      All German hospitals provide a set of routine data to federal adminsitration for
      reimbursement. This dataset includes all ICD-10-Codes (German adaption) as well as all
      procedure codes.

      This dataset is pseudonomized and risk adjusted for every individual case and afterwards
      feedbacked to each participating hospital including all accumulated data from all other
      hospitals as well as the German Average for sepsis mortalities provided by the German Federal
      Institute of Statistcs for benchmarkings.

      Based on this data, the icosmos trial will provide support to all participating hospitals for
      two major strategies to be implemented

        1. An algorithm for structured analysis of

             1. low-risk-fatalities as potentially preventable deaths for underlying problems in
                diagnosis, treatment, etc

             2. high-risk-survivors as "best practice"

             3. coding errors for improvement of coding quality

        2. a structured sreening program of every patient on every ward in every shift for
           deterioration and support algorithms including consiliary support and outreach teams as
           well as structured education

      The icosmos trial will investigate the effects as well on quality of coding and sepsis
      incidence as well as on sepsis-related sepsis in-hospital mortality for participating
      hospitals in comparison to the German Average.
