      adults have prediabetes. Identifying strategies to prevent the progression of diabetes in
      this older adult population is imperative. One strategy that has shown promise is lifestyle
      modification. As adults age they also increase sedentary behavior, decrease physical
      activity, and have increased occurrence of sleep problems. The combination of these lifestyle
      factors are likely responsible for the decreases in glycemic control with aging. The American
      Diabetes Association recommends that prediabetic adults, including older adults, increase
      structured aerobic exercise and incidental (non-exercise) physical activity while decreasing
      sedentary behavior. It is emphasized that structured exercise is the most important of these
      recommendations. However, initiating an exercise routine, may unintentionally affect time
      spent sitting, non-exercise physical activity, and other lifestyle behaviors like sleep.
      These changes may attenuate or enhance the effects of exercise on glycemic control. This
      study will compare the effects of moderate and high intensity exercise on glycemic control,
      and determine whether changes in non-exercise physical activity, sitting time, and sleep are
      associated with the observed changes. Because of the increasing prevalence of diabetes with
      age, identifying the optimal exercise prescription to preserve glycemic control in older
      adults has important clinical implications.
