      phonation quickly after total laryngectomy/total pharyngolaryngectomy/total circular
      pharyngolaryngectomy.

      When the longevity of the implant is abnormally short (less than 3 months), the
      multiplication of changes is likely to increase the risk of overall morbidity related to
      maintaining the functionality of the voice prosthesis and to alter the patient's quality of
      life.

      Reinforced innovative prostheses, currently not supported by the French Social Security,
      delay the occurrence of intraprosthetic leakage compared to standard prostheses.

      This study assesses the economic efficiency from a societal perspective and a one-year time
      horizon, from vocal rehabilitation with reinforced inter-tracheoesophageal prosthesis versus
      standard voice prosthesis in case of intra-tracheal leakage in total laryngectomy patients.

      Patients are randomized in 2 arms. Arm A usual care with reinforced prosthesis, or arm B
      usual care with standard prosthesis. Each patient is followed during 12 months.
