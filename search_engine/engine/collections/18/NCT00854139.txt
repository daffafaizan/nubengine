      response to the transplant but not to other antigens. In the realm of kidney transplantation,
      tolerance means that the recipient is unable to detect the donor transplant kidney as
      foreign, and therefore the recipient is unable to reject the kidney. Donor bone marrow
      engraftment leads to kidney graft tolerance in animal models. Renal failure is a major
      complication of multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy for which the only known cure is
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Standard bone marrow transplantation is associated
      with frequent toxicity in patients with multiple myeloma, and is generally no considered an
      option for those patients with end stage renal disease. Myeloma patients are excluded from
      conventional renal transplantation protocols because of their underlying malignancy. A less
      toxic bone marrow transplantation protocol, combined with renal transplantation, could
      provide an opportunity for cure of the myeloma and correction of ESRD in patients with this
      disease. In addition, successful marrow engraftment may be expected to lead to a state of
      tolerance. Successful implementation of tolerance would be a major benefit to transplant
      recipients. The significance of developing tolerance is that the patient would be spared the
      disabling complications of indefinite immunosuppression, which include infections, cataracts,
      osteoporosis, diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and malignancy
