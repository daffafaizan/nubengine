      The proposed study is a community-based blinded randomized controlled trial with 2 study arms
      that will be conducted in two phases:

        -  Phase I will take place during the dry season (December to April), when malaria
           transmission rates are lower. Eligible subjects (one per household) will be individually
           randomized to receive a daily dose of either a powdered vitamin/mineral fortificant
           containing 12.5 mg of iron (plus ascorbic acid, vitamin A and zinc), or a placebo
           (containing all micronutrients excluding iron), added to complementary foods, for 5
           months.

        -  Phase II will take place during the wet season (June to October), when malaria
           transmission rates are higher. Eligible subjects, who did not participate in Phase I,
           will be individually randomized to one of the two study arms as described above and
           followed for 5 months.

      A dual phase design, with two unique cohorts, was chosen so that preliminary results (at the
      end of phase 1) could be assessed by an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. It
      is possible that during the dry season no impact of iron will be detected, while during the
      wet season, an impact will be observed. With this possible outcome, it is potentially
      feasible to translate this knowledge into a Ministry of Health Program to only provide iron
      supplementation (fortification) during the dry months of the year (December to April).
