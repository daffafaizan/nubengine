      small superficial wounds and impair surgical healing. We will investigate whether a
      psychological intervention to reduce stress can improve surgical healing.

      Ninety patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be randomised to
      receive either standard care or a brief pre-surgical psychological intervention plus standard
      care. Patients will complete a pre-surgical questionnaire to assess stress, anxiety,
      depression, illness perceptions and current health, at least 3 days prior to surgery. Then
      the intervention will be delivered. A second questionnaire on the morning of surgery will
      reassess stress, anxiety and illness perceptions to see whether the intervention has reduced
      stress and increased control perceptions. Plasma catecholamines and salivary cortisol will be
      tested to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing stress-related hormones
      and to investigate their role in wound healing. During surgery 2 small expanded
      polytetrafluroethylene tubes will be inserted in the wound, which will be removed after 7
      days. Wound healing will be assessed by hydroxyproline and total protein deposition in the
      tubes, as well as by the presence of wound infection. Patients' post-surgical recovery,
      including pain and fatigue, will also be assessed. If this brief psychological intervention
      can improve wound healing and aid recovery, it would provide a simple strategy to improve
      outcomes in surgery.
