      brain, has gained increasing attention. Monitoring of the spontaneous electroencephalogram
      (EEG) and of auditory evoked potentials (AEP) has been suggested. Even if EEG and AEP reflect
      effects of anesthetic drugs, a visual interpretation is not expedient. As a consequence,
      several processing methods have been suggested that reduce the electroencephalogram to a
      numerical value. In the current study, a set of EEG- and AEP parameters based on different
      analysis methods is tested with respect to the parameters ability in separating consciousness
      (reflected by responsiveness to command) from unconsciousness at the transition between these
      stages. Therefore data of 80 unpremedicated patients undergoing general anesthesia with
      remifentanil and either sevoflurane or propofol is used. The study period is from induction
      of anesthesia until patients follow command after surgery and includes a reduction of the
      hypnotic agent after tracheal intubation until patients follow command. The isolated forearm
      technique is applied before muscle relaxants are given to maintain the ability to squeeze
      hand to command.
