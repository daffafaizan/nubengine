      evaluation at 3-4 months and 6-8 months after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction
      surgery since January 2016. The objective criterion were based on the international
      guidelines for muscle imbalance after ACL surgery and return to sport, as a muscle deficit of
      less than 20% on knee extensor muslces and less than 10% on knee flexor muscles of the
      operated knee (vs. healthy).

      The investigators will study the predictive analysis of the intermediate muscle strength test
      to predict the risk of muscle imbalance on the final isokinetic muscle strength assessment.
      The investigators will also study the individual, injury and surgical criteria associated
      with muscle imbalance.
