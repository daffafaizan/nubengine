      is the third most common cancer. Obesity can increase both the chance of developing bowel
      cancer and it's progression. Increased liver fat is likely to be important in this process,
      but it is not easy to measure liver fat accurately without invasive biopsies.

      Chemotherapy is often used to treat colorectal liver metastases before surgery. It is known
      that chemotherapy can increase liver fat and can reduce liver function, however it is not
      known if these changes are either reversible or related.

      Understanding the relationship of these changes and their potential reversibility could help
      plan the best treatment for colorectal liver metastases and to understand the wider
      relationship between obesity and cancer.

      A Manchester cancer research team have developed new MR (magnetic resonance) scan techniques
      which are better able to measure liver fat levels without needing invasive biopsies. The
      researchers also have a newly-developed fully-licensed machine which can measure liver
      function more accurately by using a breath test (LiMAx test), donated to the team for this
      study by the manufacturer, Humedics GmbH.

      Patients undergoing pre-operative chemotherapy for CLM at the Christie Hospital will be
      invited to join this study. Their liver fat content will be measured using the new MR
      techniques and their liver function measured using the LiMAx test. These will be measured
      before chemotherapy, during chemotherapy, and after they finish. Their normal treatment will
      remain unchanged. When they undergo liver surgery, the section of removed liver will be
      analysed for fatty changes to help confirm that the MR scans are accurate.
