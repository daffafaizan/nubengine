      height and stiffness on the forces and motion of the lower limb during over-ground walking in
      individuals who use an AFO for daily walking. Previous studies suggest that heel height and
      stiffness effect limb loading, but these data and the analysis techniques applied are
      limited.

      Two groups of subjects with impairments below the knee, that result in functional deficits
      and require daily AFO use, will be recruited for this study. The first group will have
      unilateral deficits associated with musculoskeletal injury or disease (Group 1), and the
      second group will have bilateral or unilateral deficits associated with peripheral nervous
      system disease (Group 2).

      Lower limb forces and body motion will be assessed using computerized motion capture and
      force plates in the floor, as individuals walk over-ground. Small reflective markers placed
      on the participant's skin and force measuring plates in the floor will be used. Participants
      will walk with their clinically provided AFO, with added heel cushions of two different
      heights and stiffness's (4 conditions) at a controlled velocity and self-selected velocity.
      If able, they will walk without their AFO at a self-selected pace. Participants will be asked
      to provide information regarding their health condition and opinions of the conditions
      tested.
