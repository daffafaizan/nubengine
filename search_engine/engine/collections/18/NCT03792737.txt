    
      This study adopts a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled design. The study
      population are subjects who undergo thyroid surgery.

      Before the surgery, subjects are randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to the investigational group 1
      (using Spiral PDS Plus), investigational group 2 (using Spiral MONOCRYL Plus) and control
      group. See the table below for the specific suture levels, materials and techniques of each
      group.

      A blinded central imaging evaluation will be performed on the healing condition of surgical
      incision on Day 5-7 post-surgery. The subjects will be blinded to the type of suture used for
      wound closure.
