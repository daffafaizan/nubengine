      screening/eligibility phase, which included a screening visit and 2 eligibility visits, and
      the treatment phase, which included 4 on-therapy visits conducted at Week 2, Week 6, Month 3,
      and Month 6. A washout period based on previous ocular medication preceded Eligibility Visit
      1. Subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at both eligibility visits were
      randomized to 1 of 3 study drug groups. The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Brinzolamide/Brimonidine over a 3-month period, with an additional 3 months of
      study drug exposure intended to provide further safety data.
