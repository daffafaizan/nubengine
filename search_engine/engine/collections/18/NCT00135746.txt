      are unsuccessful. Treatment studies have demonstrated that current smoking cessation
      techniques are less effective for women. There is no clear explanation for this difference,
      but it may involve a differential response to nicotine replacement treatments (NRTs) and/or
      smoking-related stimuli. For women, NRT may be less effective at suppressing withdrawal or
      blunting the effects of smoking during a quit attempt. Women may also be more sensitive to
      smoking-related stimuli, such as the taste, sight, and smell of smoke. Tailoring treatment to
      the separate needs of subgroups, such as men and women, may produce better outcomes. The
      purpose of this study is to assess the influence of gender on the effectiveness of
      transdermal nicotine treatment in a group of male and female smokers.

      Participants in this double-blind, dose-comparison study will complete separate sessions in a
      random order.

      Each session will last approximately 6.5 hours and will correspond to a specific transdermal
      patch dose (0, 7, 14, or 21 mg). Objectively verified cigarette abstinence will be required
      before each session. Sessions will occur at least 48 hours apart to avoid carryover.
      Cognitive, behavioral, subjective, and physiological measures will occur during study visits.
      Specifically, the NRT dose response to tobacco suppression and cigarette blunting effects
      will be compared in women and men.
