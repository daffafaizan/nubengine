      a comprehensive adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in women undergoing treatment
      for breast cancer. The study will enrol a total of 80 patients, randomized 1:1 to liposomal
      doxorubin vs epirubicin. Standard and tissue Doppler imaging parameters will be appraised at
      transthoracic echocardiography will be used and will constitute the primary and co-primary
      end-points. In addition, other efficacy and safety end-points will be appraised, including
      disease free progression.
