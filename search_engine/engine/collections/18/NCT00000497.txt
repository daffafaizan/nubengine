      The background against which the proposal was made had been developed from the combined
      information of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study and the Hypertension Detection
      and Follow-up Study. Data from both these studies clearly established the importance of
      reducing sodium content by means of diuretic administration as a mainstay of the treatment of
      elevated blood pressure. The risks of the lifetime of treatment were undefined, but the cost
      of indefinite treatment of high blood pressure was sufficiently high to stimulate careful
      examination of alternative modes of management of such patients. The demonstrations by Parijs
      and others that moderate reduction in sodium intake led to improved management of
      hypertension and data suggesting that increased potassium intake may enhance this blood
      pressure lowering effect associated with sodium restriction was cited by the investigators as
      a basis for the trial. Any additional data regarding modest sodium restriction and potassium
      ingestion would have impact on utilizing such therapy in preventing hypertension and as
      adjunctive therapy.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study was intended to take advantage of the availability of patients at the three centers
      at the completion of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program Study. These patients
      were enrolled as 'stepped-care' participants and had been treated with antihypertensive drugs
      for at least five years. The main objective of the study was to determine the contribution of
      dietary modification to maintenance of normal blood pressure after withdrawal of medication.
      Two types of diet change were followed: 1) reduction of sodium intake coupled with increased
      potassium intake; and 2) reduction of weight in the subgroups of patients that were obese.
