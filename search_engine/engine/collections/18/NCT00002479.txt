      fungoides/Sezary syndrome. II. Evaluate the spectrum of toxicity of TRA in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-agent Chemotherapy. Tretinoin, All-trans-Retinoic Acid,
      TRA, NSC-122758.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 1 or more of the first 15 evaluable patients experience an objective
      response, then 20 additional patients will be entered. It is anticipated that the accrual
      rate will be 1-2 patients per month.
