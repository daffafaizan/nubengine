      the evolution of resistant strains of HIV. However, one major problem with combination
      nucleoside therapy in patients with advanced disease is the increased toxicity resulting from
      such therapy. One approach to minimize toxicity while perhaps retaining some of the benefits
      of combination therapy is to alternate the two drugs.

      Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms: AZT plus ddI, AZT plus ddC, and AZT
      alone alternating monthly with ddI. Half of the patients receiving AZT alternating monthly
      with ddI will start with AZT, while the other half will start with ddI. Treatment continues
      until death or termination of the study. Patients are followed every 4 weeks. The study will
      include a subset of patients for whom virologic, pharmacokinetic, and macroneurologic
      assessments will be made.
