      major complication. Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      has reported to reduce vitreous hemorrhage. Recently, numerous reports have shown the
      efficacy of reducing neovascularization activity before vitrectomy by preoperative
      intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. When intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection is
      used as an adjunct therapy, a shortterm effect is needed. Because it is reported some adverse
      events caused by bevacizumab injection. Hattori et al reported intravitreal injection of 0.16
      mg/0.05 ml bevacizumab in PDR patients marked blockage of intravitreal VEGF concentrations in
      the pilot study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate low dose of intravitreal
      bevacizumab as a preoperative adjunct therapy reduce the postoperative vitreous hemorrhage.
      This study involves PDR patients who underwent vitrectomy between May 2012 and August 2013 at
      Surugadai Hospital of Nihon University. The risks to participants are accompanied by the
      intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (especially the possibility of endophthalmitis and
      thromboembolic events).

      Between June 2012 and August 2013, one investigator (AM) randomized PDR patients with an
      indication for primary 25-gauge vitrectomy into a sham group and an IVB group. One day after
      injection, three surgeons except AM conducted the surgeries. Vitreous samples were collected
      at the start of surgery, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were evaluated.
