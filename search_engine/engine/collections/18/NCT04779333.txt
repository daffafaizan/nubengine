    
      This is a randomized trial comparing the LEAP program to standard BMT for ADHD (without the
      enhanced focus on health behaviors, mHealth technology, or social media). Specifically, 80
      families will be randomized to receive either LEAP or a standard BMT program based on Russell
      Barkley's Defiant Children intervention manual. Moderators (e.g., child sex, medication, BMI)
      and mediators (e.g., change in PA) will be analyzed as exploratory outcomes. Hypotheses being
      tested include: 1) LEAP will be successful in increasing PA in children with ADHD in the
      short-term and over a year, more so than standard BPT and 2) children randomized to LEAP will
      exhibit greater and more sustained improvement in clinical outcomes relative to standard BMT.
      If successful, the R33 phase will inform the development of a larger and longer, confirmatory
      trial.
