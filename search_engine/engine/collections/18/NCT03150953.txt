    
      A. Each group will receive the usual clinical care for having an MRI under general
      anesthesia:

        1. General anesthesia. The type of anesthesia used will be determined by the individual
           anesthesiologist, and will be the safest technique possible to allow for the desired MRI
           images to be obtained.

        2. All participants will be covered with 1-2 warm blankets before receiving anesthesia and
           while in the scanner as part of standard warming measures.

        3. All participants will have continuous temperature monitoring during the scan.

      B. Participants will be randomized to one of the three

        1. 20 subjects will receive the standard of care which is 1-2 warm blankets. This group is
           called the control group.

        2. 20 study subjects will have the MRI-safe bore covering applied. This includes a clear
           covering sheet positioned over the openings of the MRI scanner.

        3. 20 study subjects will have the MRI-safe bore covering applied, and in addition one
           opening of the covering sheet will be connected to a "Bair hugger" ( an approved device
           which blows warm air). The second opening will act as a vent to let air out of the MRI
           scanner bore. The Bair hugger will be programmed to deliver forced air at 38 degrees
           Celsius (approximately 100 degrees Fahrenheit) into the contained space within the MRI
           scanner.

      Body temperature will be monitored continuously and documented in the electronic anesthesia
      record. The temperature of the forced air will be adjusted to maintain a goal body
      temperature of 36-38 degrees Celsius (96.8- 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit).

      Image quality will be evaluated by the MRI-technologist and MRI -cardiologist subjectively.
