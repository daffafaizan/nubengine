      prognostic scoring system . A FIGO score of 6 or less indicates low-risk GTN whereas a score
      of 7 or more identifies high-risk disease.

      Table 1- FIGO Anatomical staging of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia:

      Stage I Disease confined to the uterus Stage II Disease extends to the outside of the uterus,
      but is limited to the genital structures Stage III Disease extends to the lungs, with or
      without genital tract involvement Stage IV All other metastatic sites

      RCOG guidelines (No. 38February 2010 ) recommends the use of rescue regimen of alternating
      methotrexate( MTX) and leucoverin for 8 days (class D). However, several protocols using MTX
      were described. No prospective randomised controlled trials have been done to compare the
      efficacy of resue regimen with the ther protocols. In a retrospective study done showed that
      high dose methotrexate regimen is more effective than the rescue regimen.

      In addition, several concerns have been raised towards the use of leucoverin with
      methotrexate, although reducing the side effects, however, it may increase the resistence to
      the effect of MTX .

      On the other hand, High dose regimen offers a less hospital stay which may be more convenient
      to the patients, together with the same incidence of side effects.

      In our study we are going to compare the efficacy and tolerance of both regimens in patients
      diagnosed to have low risk PGTN.
