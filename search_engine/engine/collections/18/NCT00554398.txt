      limits of detection with standard assays, replication-competent virus persist in a stable,
      latent reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells. So, there is a rapid resumption in plasma viremia
      when therapy is interrupted.

      In addition to cellular reservoir, other pharmacologically privileged areas such as the
      central nervous system and the genital tract might act as additional sources of residual
      virus in patients with undetectable levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA. There is great current
      interest in strategies for depleting and eliminating this reservoir.

      The antiviral potency of current regimens emerges as an important determinant of complete
      viral control. In certain patients, the latent reservoir decay can be hastened with treatment
      intensification.

      An intensification with the HIV-1 integrase inhibitor Raltegravir (RAL) of a stable HAART
      regimen with persistent HIV-1 viral suppression could increase the slope of decay of the
      HIV-1 latent reservoir. This could provide further insight into this area, decrease the size
      of latent reservoir, and translate into clinical benefits for patients being simplified to
      maintenance monotherapy with RAL or in the HIV-1 rebound kinetics and slope after a
      programmed treatment interruption.
