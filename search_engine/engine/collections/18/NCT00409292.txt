           calendar for each treatment cycle. Each cycle lasts four weeks during which you will be
           taking the study drug, RAD001, orally every day.

        -  Participants will come into the clinic every other week during the time of enrollment.
           At each clinic visit blood work will be taken to monitor the participants health and a
           physical exam will be performed. CT scans will be repeated every 2 months to assess the
           tumor.

        -  Participants will remain on the study as long as they continue to benefit from the study
           medication.
