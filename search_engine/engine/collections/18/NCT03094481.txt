      and elderly individuals. They are often a result of direct trauma to the shoulder, typically
      from a fall. Clavicle fractures represent 5-10% of all fractures and represent the most
      frequent fracture in the human population. Midshaft fractures account for 69-85% of the
      clavicle fractures, distal shaft fractures 12-28%. (1) Analgesia for clavicle fractures can
      be challenging for anaesthetists secondary to the complex and varied innervation in this
      region. Literature describing the innervation of the clavicle and overlying skin is
      heterogeneous with the C3 to C6 nerve roots being involved. The clavicle itself has been
      reported to be innervated either by C4 or by C5 and C6 (subclavian nerve) nerve roots. (2)
      Regional anaesthesia for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia of clavicle fractures
      employs several possible, commonly used approaches. The contemporary literature surrounding
      the optimal regional anaesthetic technique for clavicle surgery which can provide superior
      postoperative analgesia and minimize systemic agents intraoperatively is lacking Currently
      there are only small case series or case reports published. Peripheral nerve blocks used to
      anesthetize the clavicle include SCPB, ISB, and combined SCPB-ISB. Larger, systematic trials
      have not yet been performed to our knowledge and as recently as one year ago a call for more
      evidence in this area of regional anaesthesia was published in the American Society of
      Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine. The purpose of this study is to compare analgesic
      outcomes after the common regional anesthetic techniques (ISB versus SCPB versus both).
