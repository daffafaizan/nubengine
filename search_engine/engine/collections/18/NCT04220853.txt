    
      Pathological-anatomical changes in the nasal cavity (nasal septum/perforation, mucosal
      hypertrophy) negatively affect nasal airflow, increase resistance - cause nasal obstruction
      and are often an indication for surgery.

      The aim of the study is to examine nasal airflow parameters at pre-defined intervals in
      patients after septoplasty and turbinoplasty .
