      population. The study will look at which strategy results in the best short-term clinical
      outcomes for the population. Also, the study will look at patient satisfaction of contact
      with his/her health care team, quality of life, and family dynamics.

      The three arms are:

        1. HIT (health information technology) aided approach

        2. Contracted conflict-management strategy

        3. Combination of the HIT-aided approach and the contracted conflict management strategy
