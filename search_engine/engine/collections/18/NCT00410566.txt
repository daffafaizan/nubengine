    
      ASM deficiency (ASMD), also known as Niemann-Pick A and B disease, is a rare genetic disorder
      in which reduced activity of the lysosomal enzyme, ASM, leads to the accumulation of
      sphingomyelin primarily in macrophages throughout the body. This deficiency results in
      characteristic features such as hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, interstitial lung
      disease, growth retardation, coronary artery disease, fatigue, and in severe cases,
      neurodegeneration with death in early childhood. There is no specific treatment for this
      disease. This Phase 1 safety study will seek to enroll a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 30
      eligible adults patients with ASMD with each patient participating for approximately 7 weeks.
