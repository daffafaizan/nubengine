    
      Aim: Identify predictive factors of good results after primary Descemet's Membrane
      Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK) in Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD).

      A monocentric retrospective observational study was realized at the Regional Hospital Center
      of Metz-Thionville, Mercy Hospital, Metz, France.

      102 eyes of 82 patients with Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) underwent DMEK
      between March 2016 and March 2018 were analyzed. Follow-up time was 12 months. The studied
      prognostic criteria were: pre-operative Central Corneal Thickness (CCT), CCT's delta between
      pre and D15 post-operatively, anterior mean keratometry, pre-operative endothelial cell
      density (ECD) and postoperative ECD at 6 and 12 months, pre-operative visual acuity, donors'
      and recipients' ages, recipients' sex, rebubbling and triple procedure (DMEK combined with
      cataract surgery). Surgery was considered successful when best spectacle corrected visual
      acuity (BSCVA) was 0.1 logMar or less (â‰¥0.8) 1 year postoperatively.
