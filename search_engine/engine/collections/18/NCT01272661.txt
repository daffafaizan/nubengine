      disparity that adversely impacts child and maternal health. The overall objective of Breast
      for Success is to increase the rates of breastfeeding initiation, continuation and
      exclusivity among high-risk mothers in the City of Cleveland via home-based culturally
      appropriate interventions. Key project components include a new Curriculum with brief
      engaging modules utilizing games, teach-reteach strategies, and interactive learning to
      address specific barriers identified in focus groups (e.g. pain, low milk supply, breast
      "myths"), and two innovative support components, the Breastfeeding Doula and Father Support
      Programs. Breast for Success was developed in collaboration with and will be disseminated in
      partnership with the Cleveland Department of Public Health MomsFirst initiative (a Healthy
      Start Program), which delivers comprehensive services including twice-monthly Community
      Health Worker home visits prenatally through 2 years postpartum to 500 women annually. The
      investigators will measure program success via participation logs, satisfaction
      questionnaires and breastfeeding rates at 1, 3 and 6 months postpartum.
