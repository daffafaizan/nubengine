    
      This is a Pre-market, Prospective, Multi-center, Single arm, Non-randomized Study.

      The objective of this study is to:

        -  To assess the deliverability of the Resolute Integrity Stent for suitable patients
           according to Indication for Use with a reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.25 mm to 4.0
           mm in 200 evaluable patients

        -  To assess the in-hospital Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) rate

        -  To collect data on resource utilization in the catheterization lab. At least 200
           evaluable patients from about 15 study centers in China who meet the eligibility
           criteria and sign the informed consent form will participate in this study.

      The expected time of participation in the study for each subject is from informed consent
      sign-off up to hospital discharge.

      An angiographic core laboratory and a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be utilized.
      Adjudication of pre-specified clinical endpoint events will be done by an independent
      Clinical Events Committee. An angiographic core laboratory will review all baseline,
      procedural, and clinical event angiograms for all patients.
