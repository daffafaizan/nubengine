      irradiation. For patients who were poor candidate of surgery, image guided thermal ablation
      could be an alternative.Radiofrequency ablation has been widely applied in the treatment of
      eary-stage non small cell lung cancer and those patients with GGO. However, up to date, no
      study had explored the microwave ablation in the treatment of GGO.
