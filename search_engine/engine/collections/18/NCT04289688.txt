    
      The study is designed as a hospital-based cohort study at the pediatric ward of Kisantu
      general referral hospital. The investigators foresee a study inclusion period of 5 months.
      The study period is currently determined as such that it includes approximately 2 months of
      the dry season and 3 months of the rainy season. Seasonality is taken into account, because
      the rain affects the condition of the road and local disease epidemiology and can thus
      influence the study results. Most data will be collected retrospectively, i.e. all data on
      the health itinerary collected from the questionnaire and referral letter and the data from
      the health records in the referring health centers. Only the data from the in-hospital
      laboratory tests and clinical outcome will be collected prospectively.

      The data from the health records at referring health centers will be consulted after
      termination of the five months study inclusion period to avoid any influence from the study
      in the patient management at health centers during the study.
