      durvalumab (MEDI4736). It is the investigators hypothesis that this combination of ionizing
      radiation and immunotherapy is well tolerated and stimulates a clinically significant
      pancreas-cancer specific immune response. This trial's primary objective will be to evaluate
      whether the combination of RT and durvalumab can improve median PFS compared to chemotherapy
      historical control data in metastatic pancreas cancer patients who have progressed through
      first-line chemotherapy. The study population includes the metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma patients who have progressed through first-line chemotherapy. The number of
      subjects proposed to complete this study is 55.
