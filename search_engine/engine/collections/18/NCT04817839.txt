      placement for stress urinary incontinence will be asked to participate in the study. If
      eligible and willing to participate, patients will be randomized to a "3 weeks post-operative
      restriction" or "6-week post-operative restriction" of activities group.

      Currently, pelvic surgeons' recommendations for activity and lifting restrictions during
      post-operative period vary widely from 1 to 50 pounds (10). Given variation in literature and
      reasonable expectations for lifting restrictions, 20-pound lifting restriction was considered
      to be a reasonable and attainable expectation from patients. Both groups will be given an
      identical set of postoperative instructions which include refrainment from lifting anything
      over 20 pounds, avoid strenuous exercise, running, or perform high-impact aerobic activities
      during the restricted activity period. Depending on their random allocation, patients will
      follow these instructions either for 3 or 6 postoperative weeks. The activities which all
      patients will be allowed to do during their postoperative recovery include walking, using
      stairs and showering in both groups. All patient will be asked to refrain from sexual
      intercourse for 6 weeks consistent with current routine post op recommendations (6). Other
      than the time of activity restriction post op (heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, running,
      high impact exercise), patients will receive identical postoperative instructions otherwise.
