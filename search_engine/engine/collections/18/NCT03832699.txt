      vaginally and orally. Duphaston is an oral progesterone drug, which has recentlly been proven
      effective in fresh cycle IVF. Yet, less is known regarding its efficacy in frozen cycle IVF.
      Thus, the objective of our trial is to compare the efficacy of vaginal and oral progesterone
      in frozen IVF cycles.
