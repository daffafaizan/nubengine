      therapy with either 100mg mane and 100mg nocte for 21 days or Sporanox 200mg mane and 200mg
      nocte with food for 21 days. If a subject enters the study already receiving itraconazole
      prophylaxis at a dose of itraconazole higher than 100 mg twice a day, the subject will then
      be dosed on study at the pre-study dosage; that is, the subject will take the same number of
      capsules per day on study as the subject was taking prior to enrolment in the study.

      The following information will be collected at baseline; whether the participant is taking
      itraconazole prophylaxis and at what dose; whether the participant is taking gastric
      suppression therapy. Patients who are not taking food or who are taking gastric acid
      suppression therapy (antacids, an H2 antagonist or a proton pump inhibitor) can take Sporanox
      with cola or orange juice to maximise absorption as recommended in the Sporanox product label
      (not required for Lozanoc formulation).

      At Day 22, participants assigned to

        -  Lozanoc and who have completed 21 days of Lozanoc prophylaxis will cross over to the
           same number of Sporanox capsules with food for a further 21 days

        -  Sporanox and who have completed 21 days of Sporanox prophylaxis will cross over to the
           same number of Lozanoc capsules for a further 21 days.

      The dose of either drug may be dose-reduced or ceased for toxicity at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      During the course of the treatment periods participants will undergo the following
      assessments:

        -  Concurrent medication(s)

        -  Clinical adverse events

        -  Measurement of vital signs (weight, blood pressure, temperature)

        -  Targeted physical examination

        -  Documentation of any evidence of systemic fungal infection

        -  Medication and meal diaries

        -  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

        -  Laboratory safety assessments: Renal function and electrolytes (urea, creatinine,
           estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate),
           Liver function tests (bilirubin, albumin, total protein, alanine aminotransferase [ALT],
           aspartate aminotransferase [AST])

        -  Pharmacokinetic testing: Trough (pre-morning dose; 0 hr) sample will be collected at
           Baseline (Day 1), and at Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43. Post-dose samples will also be
           collected 2, 3.5 and 6 hours after the morning dose on Day 22 and Day 43
