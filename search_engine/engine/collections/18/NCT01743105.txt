        -  To assess the feasibility of measuring the diaphragmatic excursion in the context of
           emergency management (ratio of measured patients / included patients).

        -  To evaluate the time required for the measurement.

        -  To assess the intra-rater reproducibility of measurements of diaphragmatic excursion
           (comparison of first and second measures).
