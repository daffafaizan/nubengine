      cessation is the first-line treatment for slowing disease progression. Despite this, nearly
      50% of COPD patients continue to smoke following diagnosis. Smokers with COPD report high
      rates of co-occurring conditions - nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety - which serve
      as barriers to quitting. The current study will pilot test a behavioral intervention designed
      to target the common psychological factors underlying these co-occurring conditions and
      foster smoking cessation among COPD patients. The specific aim is to:

      Aim: Develop a multi-component behavioral treatment to address psychological risk factors
      among COPD patients. We will conduct a component analysis using single case design
      experiments with 15 participants to a) examine the contribution of each treatment component
      to the behavioral target of smoking for affect regulation, and b) establish proof-of-concept
      on the clinical endpoint of initial cessation (>24 hours abstinence).
