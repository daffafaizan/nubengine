      median nerve abnormality at the wrist. They subsequently had ultrasound imaging of the wrist
      at rest and during a stress test using hand activity. Two control subjects had nerve testing
      to prove that they had no nerve abnormality at the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel syndrome
      patients demonstrated nerve compression on the ultrasound images during the stress tests and
      the normal subjects showed no nerve compression.
