      destruction of beta cells in the islet, including Type 1 diabetes and Latent Autoimmune
      Diabetes in Adults (LADA). Insulin has been used as a routine therapy for AIDM to alleviate
      the hyperglycemic status, yet cannot effectively prevent the progressing destruction of beta
      cells or preserve its function. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analog Liraglutide has been
      tested in large-scale clinical trial to prove its various benefits for beta cells and
      glucolipid metabolism in Type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. However, its clinical
      application in AIDM is not well-defined so far. The aim of this study is to investigate the
      potential use of Liraglutide on glycemic control in AIDM.
