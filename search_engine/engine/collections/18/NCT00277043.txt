        1. Test dose arm 1 mg paclitaxel or docetaxel test dose is prepared in 3 ml of normal
           saline and administered over two to five minutes IV push at least 30 minutes after
           prescribed IV and PO pre-medications. If no discernable adverse reaction ensues, the
           balance of the taxane dose is prepared and administered as per standard or specific
           chemotherapy protocol.

        2. Non test dose arm The full taxane dose is prepared and administered as per standard or
           specific chemotherapy protocol, at least 30 minutes after prescribed IV and PO
           pre-medications.
