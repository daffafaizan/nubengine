    
      If you decide to participate in this study, we will collect 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of
      blood during the first/screening visit in order to extract your DNA. The sample will be sent
      to the research laboratory of Dr Stefan Pulst at the University of Utah for the study of
      genetic factors that modify the course of your disease.

      As part of this study, we would like to put some of your blood in a tissue repository.
      Submission of your sample to the repository may give scientists valuable research material
      that can help them to develop new diagnostic tests, new treatments, and new ways to prevent
      diseases. Scientists will not use your sample, or material isolated from it, for commercial
      products or services. Your blood will be kept by Dr. Stefan Pulst.

      Your sample will not have your name or other personal information linked to it. Your sample
      may be shared with researchers at the University of Utah and at other institutions. The only
      information we will keep with the sample is your age, what disease you have, the age at onset
      of your disease and the duration of the disease. The principal investigator at your site will
      be the only person who can link the sample to you. You can have your sample removed from the
      bank later by written request to your PI.

      You do not have to participate in the genetic modifier study or the tissue repository to be
      in the remaining part of this study.

      You will also be asked to complete several assessments that include questionnaires, motor
      function test, a neurological exam and a physical exam.
