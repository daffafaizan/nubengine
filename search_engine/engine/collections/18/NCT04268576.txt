      for patients participating in the study is the completion of the self-questionnaire QOR-15 on
      D-1 (the day before the operation), D0 (the day of the operation) and D1 (the day after the
      operation).

      It is planned to include 74 patients before the implementation of the early rehabilitation
      protocol and 74 patients after the implementation of the early rehabilitation protocol. The
      total duration of inclusion is established at 18 months.

      The measures applied should improve the patient's well-being and accelerate his return to
      normal life and therefore reduce the length of his stay.
