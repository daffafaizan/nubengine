    
      A phase II open label single arm multi-institutional study at Yale's Smilow Cancer Hospital
      (New Haven, CT, USA), the Smilow Cancer Hospital Care Centers (regional community-based
      clinics), the VA Connecticut Healthcare System West Haven Campus (West Haven, CT, USA) and
      Bridgeport Hospital (Bridgeport, CT, USA). The primary objective of this study was to
      determine the PFS in patients with MPC and LAPC treated with a dose attenuated modification
      of FOLFIRINOX.

      NOTE: Upon results reporting (2016), the registration record was reorganized to display MPC
      and LAPC groups in individual arms. The most meaningful comparison is between MPC/LAPC and
      historical controls. That is how results are reported in the published paper, see citations.
