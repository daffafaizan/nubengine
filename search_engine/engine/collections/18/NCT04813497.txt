    
      Grand HÃ´pital de Charleroi (GHdC) staff were exposed to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection
      during the first half of 2020: a seroprevalence survey, conducted in the summer of 2020,
      after the "first wave" of the epidemic, and before the "second wave", thus revealed a
      significant seroprevalence because of its exposure. This study, because of its high
      participation rate, also showed the sustained interest of the agents in knowing their
      serology, either for personal reasons, or for the purposes of recognition as an occupational
      disease.

      The GHdC decided in December 2020 to organize as soon as possible the vaccination of its
      salaried and self-employed employees who wish to take advantage of this opportunity. On the
      sidelines of this vaccination campaign, the management committee agreed to document the
      knowledge of the SARS-Cov-2 serology of all the staff of the establishment before this
      vaccination campaign, as well as a few weeks after vaccination. This knowledge must better
      organize the disease prevention strategy, both with regard to the staff themselves and the
      patients for whom they are called upon to treat.
