      survival because of Erlotinib's cytostatic effect, this results in a slowing down of the cell
      cycle, this in turn results in a hampering of the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy leading to
      a lack of synergism with the combination. We propose that a sequential approach to the
      combination allows each drug to be used in its optimum time, by sequencing the Erlotinib,
      giving it 24 hours after chemotherapy we allow the chemotherapy to exert its effect with
      cells actively in cell cycle, but delivering the Erlotinib at a time when cells are trying to
      return to cell cycle hence slowing the growth rate of the tumor cell population. By
      withdrawing the Erlotinib about 4 days prior to the next chemotherapy cycle, we allow the
      cells to go back into cell cycle and therefore become susceptible to chemotherapy again.

      Patients will be treated with intravenous paclitaxel over 3 hours followed by intravenous
      cisplatin/carboplatin on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Patients will be treated with Erlotinib
      at a loading dose of 300mg on Day 2 followed by 150 mg orally daily from Days 3-17 of each
      cycle of paclitaxel and cisplatin/carboplatin.

      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the response rate of combination of
      erlotinib, cisplatin/carboplatin and paclitaxel in the first line treatment setting of
      metastatic, recurrent and persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Secondary
      objectives are to assess toxicity, median survival, and progression free survival.
