      which accommodates 60 residents with intermediate and advanced stages of dementia. The
      primary features of the renovation include physical upgrades and the addition of a large
      u-shaped activity pavilion. The overarching objective of this study is to examine the effects
      of these design transformations in the facility and grounds on residents, family, and staff.
      The overall project will address the following questions:

        -  How does the long-term care unit renovation affect the health outcomes, quality of life,
           and lived experiences of residents?

        -  What are the effects of the long-term care unit renovation on care staff and family
           members?

        -  What aspects of the transformation were responsible for observed changes? And what
           aspects worked or did not?

      A multi-component, mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) research plan will be used in
      this project. Personal (resident, families, staff) and environmental variables (social
      interactions, implementation and use of technology and physical space) will be assessed
      pre-renovation (spring/summer 2017) and post-renovation (summer 2019 and 2020). With this
      mixed-methods research plan, wthe investigators will gain valuable information about the
      renovation that will be important for long term care facilities.
