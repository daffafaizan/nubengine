      Kamphaeng Phet Province, Thailand. Diabetic patients with eGFR â‰¥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were
      recruited from both districts. Patients in district A (control group) received standard CKD
      care according to NKF-K/DOQI guidelines1 whereas those in district B (intervention) received,
      in addition to the standard care, educational activities provided by nutritionist, pharmacist
      and physiotherapist, and quarterly home visits. Our home visits team consisted of nurse,
      health care officers and village health volunteers. During each hospital visit of both groups
      clinical data were assessed. All laboratory parameters were collected every 3 months, and LDL
      and HbA1C every 6 months. The primary end point was rate of eGFR decline. Secondary outcomes
      were random urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR), blood pressure, waist circumference,
      HbA1C and LDL .
