      ophthalmic emulsion in patients with endogenous anterior uveitis and to determine its
      clinical usefulness for treatment of this disease in the early phase of development, in
      comparison with RinderonÂ® solution (containing 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate) that has
      widely been used for treatment of postoperative inflammation, uveitis, etc. as a steroid
      ophthalmic solution.

      The secondary objective was to establish the evaluation system for a dose-finding study.
