      and economic hardships can compromise their development, negatively affect their overall
      health, and adversely affect their abilities to succeed in school and in life. Food
      insecurity (FI)-the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate or safe
      foods- while strongly associated with poverty, is an independent predictor of poor health
      outcomes for children.

      The Emergency Department (ED) of academic medical centers often serves as a point of care
      entry for impoverished and high-risk families. Although there is a growing interest in the
      healthcare system's ability to address Social Determinants of Health (SDH), little is known
      about food insecurity in the pediatric ED. Additionally, there are limited data on how to
      implement FI screening into practice in a way that maximizes elicitation of social need,
      while assuring patient and family comfort.
