      Clinic for an informed consent visit. At the informed consent visit, the participant will
      receive an activity monitor and a fall diary. Following a 4-week period where activity and
      falls are monitored, the participant will come to the Cleveland Clinic for a comprehensive
      physical and cognitive assessment primarily using a virtual reality treadmill system. During
      that baseline assessment, the individual will be randomized to either 1) traditional
      multi-modal training, or 2) augmented reality multi-modal training. Regardless of group
      allocation, the participant will complete a total of 16 treatment sessions (2x/week for 8
      weeks). The traditional multi-modal treatment will be administered 1:1 by a physical
      therapist. The augmented reality multi-modal training will be overseen by a physical
      therapist and administered via the Microsoft HoloLens 2 augmented reality device. Follow-up
      assessments will be conducted at the end of the 16 treatment sessions and 8 weeks after the
      treatment sessions have ceased. Falls and activity data will be monitored throughout the
      study.
