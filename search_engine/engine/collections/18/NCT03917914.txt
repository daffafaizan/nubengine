      health-related morbidity and mortality. Heart disease in COPD is a known but neglected
      comorbidity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 30-50% of deaths in COPD
      participants. Studies repeatedly show that CVD in COPD participants is under-recognised and
      under-treated yet participants with COPD are frequently excluded from clinical trials of
      drugs which reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality. This has led to under-treatment of CVD in
      COPD participants. A particular concern is low use of β-blockers. These have previously been
      considered to be contra-indicated in COPD and no RCTs have been conducted in this population.
      There is now observational evidence that cardioselective β-blockers are safe and may improve
      mortality, but this data is limited to retrospective analyses of cohorts of COPD
      participants. Contrary to previous concerns, retrospective analyses also suggest that
      cardioselective β-blockers may reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations. The proposed study will
      focus on treating CVD in COPD participants to reduce mortality and morbidity.

      The study will be conducted in approximately 20 sites in Australia and New Zealand, and
      possibly 1-2 international sites. Participants with COPD will be randomised to one of two
      treatment arms in addition to receiving usual care for their COPD over the study duration of
      24 months.
