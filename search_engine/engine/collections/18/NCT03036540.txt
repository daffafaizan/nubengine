      followed-up for the presence of complications related to catheter introductions. The symptoms
      and signs of upper limb thrombosis are recorded. The diagnosis is confirmed by sonography
      examination. The age, gender, principal diagnosis, the vein were midline catheter is inserted
      and number of vein punctures for catheter insertion are recorded. Afterward the patients are
      treated in the ward and the possible complications are recorded. The main concern is about
      the incidence of upper limb thrombosis. All the complications are recorded as well as date
      when they has appeared. The statistical analysis is done in order to evaluate the incidence
      of upper limb symptomatic thrombosis, the duration since insertion to thrombosis
