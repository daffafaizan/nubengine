      31 eyes were managed with Phaco-UCP and 30 eyes of age and sex matched patients were managed
      with phacoemulsification alone.

      Patients were randomized for either combined phacoemulsification and ultrasound ciliary
      plasty (Phaco-UCP) (the study group) or phacoemulsification alone (the control group). All
      surgeries were performed by one experienced surgeon (Y EZ).

      Preoperative evaluation included manifest refraction, BCVA measurement, slit-lamp
      biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, measurement of IOP with Goldmann
      applanation tonometry (average of 3 readings taken). Corneal diameter (White-to-white) and
      axial length measurement were done using IOL Master 500 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG., Germany).
      Ultrasound pachymetry with Tomey SP-100 (Tomey Corp. Nagoya, Japan) and visual fields using
      Humphrey Field Analyzer (24-2, SITA, standard program Carl Zeiss Meditec AG., Germany) were
      also performed.
