      cancer prevention all require an unpleasant, pre-exam cathartic bowel preparation. The
      discomfort and embarrassment associated with this bowel prep has been identified as a barrier
      to adherence of at-risk subjects with recommended colon screening guidelines. CT Colonography
      (CTC) is an imaging based test that evaluates the entire colon anatomy and requires cathartic
      bowel prep; its performance is considered comparable to optical colonoscopy (OC) for
      adenomatous polyp detection. In addition, CTC generates a large amount of data to be read by
      a human, and this data interpretation task can be aided by computer-assisted-detection (CAD)
      software to identify potential polyp lesions for the human reviewer. This trial studies the
      performance of a form of CTC that uses fecal tagging and electronic image cleansing to
      obviate the need for cathartic prep. In addition, readings prospectively employ CAD to
      potentially buffer human interpretation performance. The investigators are prospectively
      testing this augmented (non-cathartic, CAD-assisted) form of CTC in asymptomatic (screening)
      cohort. The trial is a prospective test comparison, using segmentally unblinded optical
      colonoscopy in combination with pathology specimens as a reference standard for presence of
      target lesions, adenomatous polyps 6 mm or greater in size.
