      treatment of gastrointestinal fistulas or perforations.

      Instead of a large abdominal incision or multiple incisions with the related postoperative
      morbidity endoscopic techniques will be used used which require no postoperative limitation
      of activities. Using novel tissue closure devices, such as a Tissue Apposition System or an
      endoscopic suturing system, we will evaluate the potential benefit, risks and impact on the
      patient's quality of life of this modified surgical technique in patients having either
      chronic gastrointestinal fistulas or acute perforations.
