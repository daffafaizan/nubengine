      The primary aim is to compare the two operational techniques: single bundle hamstrings versus
      double bundle hamstrings ACL reconstruction, using the KOOS (Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome
      Score) Quality of Life(QoL) subscore as the primary outcome and clinical examinations,
      functional tests and standing radiographs (Kellgren Lawrence method) as secondary outcome
      measurements. Those assesments will be measured after 1,2 and 5 years after the operation.

      Hypothesis:

      There are no difference between the two methods as judged by the KOOS QoL subscore.

      Questions to be answered:

      Is there a difference between double-bundle and single-bundle technique in the subjective
      outcome scores as measured by the KOOS score? Are there differences between hamstrings single
      bundle and double bundle technique when the Lachman test and the pivot shift test are being
      used? Is there a difference between hamstrings double-bundle technique and single-bundle
      technique in return to sports and activity level? Are there differences between double-bundle
      technique and single -bundle technique in functional tests (one-leg hop test)? Is there a
      difference in the development of osteoarthritis between the two techniques?
