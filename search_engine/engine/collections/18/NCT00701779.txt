      administered once daily for one year in combination with Tamsulosin (0.4mg), administered
      once daily for 3 months, followed by counseling on flexible dosing of Tamsulosin on an as
      needed basis, on the improvement of symptoms and clinical outcome in men with moderate to
      severe symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). At each scheduled visit (3, 6, and 9
      months), the subject will be counseled on withdrawal of Tamsulosin.

      A recently published, landmark study (MTOPS - Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms),
      co-sponsored by the National Institute of Health and the National Institute of Diabetes,
      Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH-NIDDK), demonstrated that, in selected patients,
      combination therapy with Doxazosin and Finasteride provided additive symptomatic
      improvements, reduced the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and surgical intervention,
      and was a more effective treatment for reduction in the overall risk of BPH clinical
      progression.

      The aim of this proposed combination study, in a population of patients at high risk of BPH
      clinical progression, is to investigate whether combination therapy with Dutasteride and
      Tamsulosin with the subsequent withdrawal of Tamsulosin can maintain superior symptom
      improvement. At each scheduled visit (3, 6, and 9 months), the subject will be counseled on
      withdrawal of Tamsulosin. We hypothesize that patients may start with a combination of
      Dutasteride and Tamsulosin and eventually may be able to eliminate the use of Tamsulosin and
      maintain acceptable urinary symptoms on Dutasteride alone.
