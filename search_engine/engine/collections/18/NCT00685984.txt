      blood flow before and after cold pressure testing), and biochemical markers of endothelial
      dysfunction will also be measured. Correlations between peripheral and coronary endothelial
      functions will be checked. The measurements will be performed and validated in two other
      groups

        -  30 patients with overweight but free of diabetes, matched with the patients with
           diabetes for age, gender and body mass index
