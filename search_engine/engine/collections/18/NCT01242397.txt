      study. Patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be enrolled and
      implanted with a CRT system. Baseline evaluation, which includes clinical symptom evaluation
      and an echocardiogram, will be performed at the time of randomization, which should occur as
      soon after device implant as possible but no later than 2 week post -implant. The baseline
      echocardiogram should be acquired prior to the device being programmed to the randomized
      setting. Repeat echocardiograms and scheduled follow-up evaluations will be performed at the
      end of each 3 month crossover period.
