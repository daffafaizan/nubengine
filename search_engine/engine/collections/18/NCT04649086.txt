      centers. Participants will perform 24 exercise sessions on cycloergometer (3 sessions/week, 8
      weeks). The experimental group (eccentric) will perform 5 habituation sessions: the initial
      power of the exercise will be set to 10 Watts and then increased by 10% each session,
      depending on the muscle tolerance. The training power must correspond to 3 times that of the
      control group to obtain a similar metabolic stimulation. The control group (concentric) will
      perform exercise training at an intensity of 60% of the reserve heart rate determined during
      an initial cardiorespiratory test. The primary outcome will be the change in distance covered
      during the 6-min walk test between the initial assessment and month 2. Secondary outcomes
      will include study of sarcopenia, muscle strength, general and muscular fatigue, quality of
      life, blood metabolomic data, ex vitro data for mitochondrial and histo-biochemical
      functionality from muscle biopsies of the Vastus Lateralis.
