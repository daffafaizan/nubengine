      were allocated to either the general anesthesia group (group control) or SPB (serratus plane
      block) + general anesthesia groups (group SPB) using randomized central computer-generated
      sequence software (SAS 19.0). The allocation ratio was 1:1 for the two groups. Group
      assignment was concealed by opaque sticking envelops. The major research content is to
      evaluate the quality of recovery using 40 questionnaire (QoR-40).
