    
      This is a natural history study, designed to collect data from patients with Alport syndrome
      with qualifying GFR. Assessments and blood and urine sample collection will be performed at
      Baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter, for up to 120 weeks. Scheduling of clinic visits will
      take in to consideration the timing of Standard of Care (SOC) visits. Alternative
      arrangements may be made to enable subjects to schedule a home nurse visit for study
      procedures instead of certain clinic visits. Remaining blood and urine aliquots will be
      stored and may be used in the future for the discovery, analysis, verification and/or
      validation of other biomarkers or test for renal disease. The samples will be kept for up to
      five years. Each sample will be identified only by it's barcode number and will not be
      individually identifiable.
