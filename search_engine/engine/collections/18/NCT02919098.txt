      and adolescent sexual and reproductive health, the investigators have developed a digital
      game-based sexual violence prevention program-Bystander-to be used with high school students
      to teach them about prosocial bystander behaviors and decrease acceptance of common rape
      myths. The goal of this research is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of Bystander
      when implemented in a school setting.

      This study will evaluate Bystander, a four-module intervention program. Each module is
      designed to last one school class period. It includes 20 minutes of individual gameplay
      through an interactive narrative featuring prosocial bystander behaviors and discussions
      dispelling rape myths. Each module also includes facilitated class discussion about the
      topics covered that day.

      The research team will conduct a pre/post efficacy and feasibility study that will capture
      data through a pre-, immediate post-, and 3-month follow up survey on knowledge about sexual
      violence and harassment, as well as attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived social norms and
      behavioral intentions around bystander behaviors (all measured at pre-, immediate post- and
      follow-up time points). It will also capture demographic information and previous bystander
      behaviors at baseline. It will finally involve qualitative in-depth interviews with school
      staff and administration about the program.
