      Agreement with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). This agreement allows any NIH
      investigator with an NIH Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol to secure
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) or cord blood units from the NMDP/CIBMTR registry for the
      purpose of transplanting patients who have no suitable matched related donors. As part of
      this agreement, the NMDP/CIBMTR Research Program requires that blood samples as well as
      baseline and outcome data (mainly demographic, quality of life, and clinical data) be
      collected and maintained in accordance with the NMDP/CIBMTR IRB approved protocols. The goal
      of the NMDP/CIBMTR Research Program is to improve the safety and effectiveness of unrelated
      donor HSC transplantation for both the donors and recipients, and to have a comprehensive
      source of data that can be used to study unrelated donor HSC transplantation. The NMDP/CIBMTR
      is the sole custodian of the data in the Research Database.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to incorporate all the NMDP/CIBMTR requirements for
      securing data and blood samples on recipients whose transplant was facilitated by NMDP/CIBMTR
      here at NIH as well as TED (Transplant Essential Data) level data submission for Allogeneic
      recipient patients and their donors. This protocol will include patients at the NIH that have
      enrolled in an NIH IRB approved protocol to receive related donor transplants as well as
      matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSC transplants or cord blood transplants facilitated by the
      NMDP/CIBMTR. It may also include patients that have undergone a MUD transplant at another
      approved transplant center but need to receive additional blood products from the donor while
      at NIH after completing a transplant center transfer. As of 03/02/2020, all newly enrolled
      subjects will only have TED level data submission to NMDP.
