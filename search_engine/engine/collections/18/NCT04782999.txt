    
      Design: 12 patients with type 2 diabetes will be recruited.

      All subjects will undergo 11 study visits: four visits before, three visits at 1 week after
      surgery and four visits at 3 months postoperatively:

        -  Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) with measurement of GLP-1 and GIP secretion will be
           performed before and 3 months post-surgery.

        -  Hyperglycemic clamps with co-infusion of saline, GLP-1 or GIP will be performed in a
           randomised order at three separate study visits in randomized order before, 1 week and 3
           months after surgery.
