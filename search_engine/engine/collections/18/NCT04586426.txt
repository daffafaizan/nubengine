    
      Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by production of
      monoclonal proteins (M proteins), which are comprised of pathologic immunoglobulins (Ig) or
      fragments of such, which have subsequently lost their normal function. Talquetamab is a
      humanized IgG4PAA bispecific antibody designed to target G protein-coupled receptor family C
      group 5-member D (GPRC5D) and the CD3 molecule found on T lymphocytes (T cell). Teclistamab
      is a humanized IgG4PAA bispecific antibody designed to target B cell maturation antigen
      (BCMA) and the CD3 molecule found on T cells. Rationale for combining talquetamab and
      teclistamab is that, these agents promote the activation of T cells and induce myeloma cell
      lysis mediated by secreted perforin and various granzymes stored in the secretory vesicles of
      cytotoxic T cells. This study consists 3 periods: screening phase (up to 28 days), treatment
      phase (start of study drug administration and continues until the completion of the end of
      treatment [EOT] visit); and a post-treatment follow-up phase (after end of treatment and up
      to 16 weeks after last dose of study drug(s) for each participant). End of study is defined
      as last study assessment for last participant in study. Total duration of study is up to 1
      years. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and biomarkers will be
      assessed at specified time points during this study. Participants safety and study conduct
      will be monitored throughout the study.
