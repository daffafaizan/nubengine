      severe burden of CV disease related to the underlying ESRD. As no therapy is currently
      indicated to target CVC, there is a need to investigate the ability of SNF472 to reduce CVC
      progression and, ultimately, to improve CV outcomes in HD patients. This phase 2b
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study is designed to assess the effect of SNF472
      on the progression of CVC as measured by calcium volume and CAC/Agatston scores in ESRD
      patients receiving HD. The study hypothesis is that administration of SNF472 over 52 weeks
      can slow the progression of CVC in this patient population compared to placebo.
