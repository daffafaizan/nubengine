    
      This is a randomized controlled trial involving 70 subjects divided in 4 groups: 25 single
      blinded subjects using THERANOVA-500 dialyzer enabling Expanded Hemodialysis (HDx) ; 25
      single blinded subjects using REVACLEAR-400 dialyzer enabling conventional hemodialysis (HD);
      10 non-blinded subjects using THERANOVA-500 enabling Expanded Hemodialysis (HDx) and 10
      non-blinded subjects using REVACLEAR-400 dialyzer enabling conventional hemodialysis (HD) for
      their chronic hemodialysis treatments over an active intervention period of 6 weeks. All
      subjects are to be dialyzed using REVACLEAR-400 enabling conventional hemodialysis (HD) for
      two weeks prior and for two weeks after the intervention period.

      Primary endpoint is mean post-hemodialysis recovery time (as reported by subjects once
      weekly) between groups (THERANOVA-500 vs REVACLEAR-400) (all subjects) during the 6-week
      intervention period.

      Secondary endpoints are:

        1. Post-hemodialysis recovery time change (mean of 2-week pre and 2-week post intervention
           period compared to mean during 6-week intervention period)(mean THERANOVA-500 vs mean
           REVACLEAR-400)(all subjects),

        2. Post-hemodialysis recovery time difference (mean between blinded and non-blinded
           THERANOVA-500 treated subjects during the 6-week intervention period,

        3. Post-hemodialysis recovery time difference (mean between blinded and non-blinded
           REVACLEAR-400 treated subjects during the 6-week intervention period),

        4. Post-hemodialysis recovery time difference mean gap between secondary endpoints 2 and 3,

        5. Percentage of subjects who report no (zero) recovery time (mean THERANOVA-500 vs mean
           REVACLEAR-400) during 6-week intervention period (all subjects),

           microglobulin (mean THERANOVA-500 vs mean REVACLEAR-400)(all subjects)(in nmol/L),

        7. Pre and post 6-week intervention period pre-dialysis difference levels of procalcitonin

        8. Pre and post 6-week intervention period pre-dialysis difference levels of free light
           chains (gamma and lambda)(mean THERANOVA-500 vs mean REVACLEAR-400)(all subjects)(in
           mg/L),

        9. Pre and post 6-week intervention period pre-dialysis difference levels of interleukine-6
           (mean THERANOVA-500 vs mean REVACLEAR-400)(all subjects)(in pg/ml),

       10. Pre and post 6-week intervention period pre-dialysis difference levels of C reactive
           protein (CRP)(mean THERANOVA-500 vs mean REVACLEAR-400)(all subjects)(in mg/L),

       11. Quality of life change (pre and at 2 weeks of intervention period) (mean THERANOVA-500
           vs mean REVACLEAR-400)(all subjects)(assessed by adapted KDQoL-SF questionnaire)(max
           score 130),

       12. Quality of life change (pre and at 4 weeks of intervention period) (mean THERANOVA-500
           vs mean REVACLEAR-400)(all subjects) assessed by adapted KDQoL-SF questionnaire)(max
           score 130),

       13. Quality of life change (at 4 weeks of intervention period and week 8 of study)(mean
           THERANOVA-500 vs mean REVACLEAR-400)(all subjects) assessed by adapted KDQoL-SF (max
           score 130),

       14. Quality of life change (pre and at 2 weeks of intervention period)(mean THERANOVA-500 vs
