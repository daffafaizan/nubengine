      countries in Central Africa. However, the 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceeds
      all previous outbreaks in geographic range and number of individuals affected. Ebola virus
      disease (EVD) is highly lethal with case fatality rates of 70-80% in the current West African
      outbreak. While the clinical manifestations of acute Ebola virus infection are well
      documented, little is known about long-term sequelae, ability to transmit Ebola, or long-term
      protective immunity in survivors from EVD. The purpose of this protocol is to study these
      questions in a cohort of EVD survivors from Liberia.
