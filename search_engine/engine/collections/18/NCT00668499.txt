    
      The Study Objectives in Phase I are:

      To determine the safety of the combination of VEGF-Antisense Oligonucleotide (VEGF-AS,
      Veglinâ„¢) plus Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in subjects with advanced Malignant Mesothelioma,.via
      a dose escalation protocol. To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose Limiting
      Toxicity (DLT) of VEGF-AS plus Premetrexed and Cisplatin. To determine the time to disease
      progression To determine the objective response rate of the combination of VEGF-AS plus
      Pemetrexed and Cisplatin for the treatment of advanced malignant mesothelioma

      The study Objectives in Phase II are:

      To further characterize the toxicity experienced by patients with malignant mesothelioma
      treated with VEGF-AS plus Cisplatin and Pemetrexed.

      To determine median and overall survival.

      The Laboratory objectives are:

      To measure plasma VEGF levels before, during, and after therapy as a correlate of outcome. To
      determine the pharmacokinetic profile of VEGF-AS plus Pemetrexed and Cisplatin.
