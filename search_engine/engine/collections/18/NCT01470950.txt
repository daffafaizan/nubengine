      For each group, the muscle biopsies will be divided into 3 samples which will be used for a)
      real-time PCR to quantify the gene expression of the different components of the
      ubiquitin-proteasome system (Atrogin-1, MuRF1, Nedd4, UBB and Psma) b) Western blotting,
      using anti-phospho-site specific antibodies to quantify the activities of the Akt/GSK3 and
      Akt/mTOR pathways and of their downstream regulators of protein synthesis, eIF2B, p70S6K and
      PHAS-1/4E-BP1and c) fiber type analysis to quantify the variation in MHC expression.
