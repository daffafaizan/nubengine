      diarrhea, abdominal pain, inflammatory change in the small intestine. Radiation creates
      changes in bacterial microbiome, the vascular permeability of the mucosal cells and in
      intestinal motility. Probiotics were known to improve gastrointestinal function. This is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 26 patients designed to evaluate
      the effect of probiotics to change the intestinal microbiome in in patients undergoing
      concurrent pelvic/abdominal RT.
