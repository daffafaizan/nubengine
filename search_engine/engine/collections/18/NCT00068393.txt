        -  Determine the response rate of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic
           unresectable renal cell cancer with sarcomatoid features treated with doxorubicin and
           gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin intravenously (IV) and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 2- or 3-10 or
      pegfilgrastim SC on day 2. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After 6 courses, patients undergo a MUGA scan. Patients with a stable* left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) continue therapy as above. Patients who reach a total doxorubicin
      dose of 450 mg/m^2 and are found to have unstable cardiac function or who have an abnormal
      LVEF continue therapy with gemcitabine alone.

      NOTE: *Stable cardiac function is defined as no decrease more than 15% of LVEF in absolute
      number and LVEF at least 35% in total function by MUGA.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients were accrued for this study.
