      effects of ionization air purification among 48 children in Beijing. Real or sham
      purification was performed in classrooms for 5 weekdays in a random order with a 2-month
      wash-out period. During the study periods, different indoor environmental factors were
      monitored including size-fractionated particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), ozone,
      carbon dioxide (CO2), negative air ions (NAI), noise, temperature and relative humidity,
      which were controlled as confounders in the analysis of the effects of indoor air
      purification. In addition, we analyzed the cardiopulmonary effects of those environmental
      factors on the children.
