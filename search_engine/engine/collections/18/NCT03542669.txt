      Immunotherapy is considered to be one of the most promising approaches in cancer therapy.
      This is a phase I clinical trial of cytotoxic T cell injection induced by dendritic cells
      loaded with 6B11 anti-idiotype minibody (6b11-OCIK injection) for drug -resistant and
      recurrence epithelial ovarian cancer. The investigators plan to recruit for 10 patients with
      epithelial ovarian cancer. The result of this study was statistic and analyzed with the
      record of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.1) evaluation standard.

      In this experiment, the initial dose of 1-2 x 10^9 cell infusion was designed for each
      patient.

      The primary endpoints of the Phase I study are:

      Dose limited toxicity (DLT) - it will be used to determine the maximum tolerance dose (MTD).
