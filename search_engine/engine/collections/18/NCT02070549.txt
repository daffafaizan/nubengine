      I. To provide appropriate dosing recommendations for patients with varying degree of hepatic
      dysfunction receiving trametinib (mild, moderate and severe).

      II. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      trametinib in advanced cancer patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of trametinib in advanced cancer
      patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document the non-DLTs associated with the administration of trametinib in patients with
      varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      II. To document any antitumor activity associated with trametinib treatment of patients
      enrolled on this study.

      III. To explore and characterize predictive biomarkers for individual cancer patients
      utilizing genomic sequencing technologies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
