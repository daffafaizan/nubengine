      and II women â‰¥18 yrs old with a singleton pregnancy in the 1st or 2nd trimester of pregnancy
      undergoing cervical cerclage with spinal anesthesia. Patients will be randomly allocated to
      the chloroprocaine (CP) or bupivacaine group (BUP). Patients will receive spinal anesthesia
      with either chloroprocaine 50 mg with fentanyl 15 mcg or bupivacaine 9 mg with fentanyl 15
      mcg.

      Bupivacaine is the most common local anesthetic used for cervical cerclage with spinal
      anesthesia. Bupivacaine is safe and has been preferred over other medications such as
      lidocaine, because it is associated with a low incidence of a complication from spinal
      anesthesia known as "transient neurologic symptoms" - a condition where pain and cramping in
      the buttocks and lower extremities can be experienced for several days. Bupivacaine is a
      long-acting local anesthetic agent and therefore has the disadvantage of a prolonged
      anesthetic recovery that may last a few hours.

      Chloroprocaine is a local anesthetic with a fast onset and short duration that may be used
      for spinal anesthesia for ambulatory procedures. Chloroprocaine is currently used at the
      research institution for spinal anesthesia for ambulatory surgical patients, especially for
      lower extremity orthopedic procedures such as knee arthroscopy, as well as for pregnant
      patients.
