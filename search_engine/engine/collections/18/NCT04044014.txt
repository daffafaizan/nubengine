      carrier dressing that will be used to deliver therapeutic agents to the skin. A
      polysaccharide, Gellan, has been chosen as the main component of this dressing (the
      biomembrane)and it can be produced in either a sheet or fluid gel forms. Gellan is a widely
      used material in both the food and medical industry e.g. as a lubricant in eye-drops (e.g.
      Timoptol XE, Merck Sharp & Dohme, USA).

      As part of the development of the dressing, the epidermal (skin) response to Gellan needs to
      be evaluated to check its safety.

      The main objective of this study is to establish the safety of the two different Gellan
      formulations (2% Gellan sheet and 2% Gellan fluid gel) following application to the epidermis
      (skin).
