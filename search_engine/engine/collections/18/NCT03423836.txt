    
      A total of 525 infants where planned to be enrolled at the 3 performance sites. The number of
      infants enrolled at each site depended on past Motor recruitment rates, and the observed
      delivery rate of high risk babies at that site. Infants were enrolled from both the high risk
      and low risk groups. The intended sample size was fixed, over sampling among the low risk
      group and was used to assure the sample size.

      The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) identified and provided each clinical site with
      participant listings of all MOTOR high risk births and a randomly ordered sample of low risk
      births for enrollment into the study.

      Mothers where approached by MOTOR or MOTORkids personnel to ascertain participant interest in
      enrolling their infant. Once consent was obtained, infants were followed and tracked until
      scheduled for the follow-up exams at age 24 months +/- 2 months adjusted age.
