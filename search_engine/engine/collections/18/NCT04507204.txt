    
      This phase IV study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, pragmatic study to investigate
      the treatment effectiveness of Adhansia XR at Month-2 after initiation, and the effectiveness
      of Adhansia XR overall and when compared with the active comparator group (OROS MPH or
      Concerta) over time. Additional outcome assessments for both treatment arms include
      Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) during the 6-month follow-up period. The burden of
      illness (BOI) will be investigated by collecting additional measures such as healthcare
      resource utilization (HCRU), broader treatment patterns, and comorbidities.
