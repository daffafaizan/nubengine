      pain and physical disability. Excessive loading at the knee joint is believed to contribute
      to the progression of knee osteoarthritis. The hip joint and surrounding muscles have been
      shown to influence the amount of stress occurring at the knee joint during walking. In
      particular, the hip abductor muscles may have an effect on the knee joint by controlling the
      position of the pelvis and/or by acting as lateral stabilizers for the knee.

      Research suggests that the function of the hip muscles during walking may be decreased in
      people with knee osteoarthritis and that greater loads may be placed on the knee joint as a
      result. Thus, interventions aimed at strengthening the hip abductor muscles may be effective
      for reducing stress on the arthritic knee and slowing the rate of progression of knee
      osteoarthritis.

      The design of the study is a two-group pretest-posttest design using an untreated control
      group. Thirty-five individuals with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis will be recruited
      through newspaper advertisements and from the practices of orthopedic surgeons in Kingston,
      Ontario. Each participant with knee osteoarthritis will be matched with an asymptomatic
      volunteer for age (+/- 5 years), height (+/- 5 cm), mass (+/- 5 kg) and gender. Participants
      in the control group will have no clinical or radiographic diagnosis of knee or hip
      osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and no history of hip or knee trauma or pain.
