      community-dwelling older adults and their families. Cognitive vulnerability means living with
      dementia, depression, and/or a recent episode of delirium (the 3Ds). Cognitive vulnerability
      in older adults is often overlooked by primary care and hospital-based providers, and
      represents a marker for overall vulnerability or frailty often missed when disease-specific
      approaches are emphasized in the care for older adults. Such patients often cannot adequately
      self-manage their comorbidities. Many studies of older adults and their families have
      demonstrated the great burden of living with cognitive vulnerability. The investigators will
      test the effectiveness of a team care model focused on the 3Ds (Home Based Care Team) guided
      by nurse practitioners with geriatrics expertise. Other team member disciplines will include
      pharmacy, social work, occupational and physical therapy, nutrition, and community health
      worker. Long-term objectives are to determine whether this care model can become a widely
      available approach for improving healthcare systems for older adults with cognitive
      vulnerability and their families, while improving outcomes of importance to these patients
      and families. A project Steering Committee, including cognitively vulnerable patients and
      family caregivers, will provide extensive input into many aspects of the research process.
