      one-third of the U.S. population in their lifetime. Women develop AUD more quickly and suffer
      a broader range of adverse alcohol-related health consequences than men. Physical activity
      (PA) interventions may play an important role as an alternate coping strategy for women with
      AUD and a means to decrease relapse.

      The primary aim of this project is to test the efficacy of a technology-supported lifestyle
      physical activity (LPA) intervention for preventing relapse among women with depression
      engaged in alcohol treatment. A total of 214 women from the Alcohol and Drug Partial
      Hospitalization Program (ADP) at Butler Hospital with AUD and depression will be recruited
      and randomly assign them to either a: 1) LPA+Fitbit intervention or 2) Fitbit Only control
      condition. Follow-up assessments will occur at 6-weeks, end of treatment (EOT) at 3 months,
      and 6, 9 and 12 months. Participants will also complete two, 10-day periods of ecological
      momentary assessment (EMA) during early recovery, at approximately weeks 5 & 6, and again at
      weeks 11 & 12.
