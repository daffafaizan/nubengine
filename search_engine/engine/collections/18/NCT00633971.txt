      skin discoloration to severe skin changes and venous ulcerations. Pain is often a prominent
      symptoms and PTS impairs patient quality of life. Prevention of PTS using compression
      stockings has been emphasized. There is a paucity of validated, effective treatments for PTS
      once the condition develops.

      While the pathophysiology of PTS is incompletely understood, chronic venous hypertension and
      insufficiency may increase the workload of the lymphatic system and result in
      over-capacitance with secondary damage and eventual lymphatic insufficiency. In selected
      patients with PTS, we have noted a symptomatic improvement in patients who receive lymphedema
      therapy to the limb.

      Complex lymphedema therapy (CLT) is a noninvasive treatment that includes four key
      components: meticulous skin care, manual lymph drainage, compression therapy, exercises and
      patient education for home management and continuation of the treatment. These techniques are
      designed to enhance lymph flow through intact cutaneous lymphatics and reduce swelling and
      restore function in the affected limb.
