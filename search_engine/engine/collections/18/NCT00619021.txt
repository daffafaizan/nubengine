      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride delivered via
           bronchial artery infusion in patients with recurrent or progressive non-small cell lung
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate local response in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients treated
           with this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride delivered via bronchial
      artery infusion.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride via bronchial artery infusion over 30-60 minutes
      on day 1 and via IV infusion over 30 minutes on day 8 of course 1. Patients then receive
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of all subsequent courses.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 8 weeks to 3 months for up to
      2 years.
