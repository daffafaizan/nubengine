      pathophysiological characteristics. One of these pathophysiological features is chronic
      airway inflammation which can be eosinophilic of nature. Blood eosinophils could be an
      accessible biomarker for this eosinophilic inflammation.

      Eosinophil counts can fluctuate due to their short half-life in blood and due to a diurnal
      rhythm. More needs to be known about this diurnal rhythm and the different confounding
      factors and sources of within-subject variability of this biomarker.
