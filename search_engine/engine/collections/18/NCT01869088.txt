      treatments worldwide for patients with unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC).However,
      the long term outcomes were generally poor for HCC patients treated with TACE. Recombinant
      Human Adenovirus Type 5, an E1B gene deleted adenovirus, is known to have a significant
      antitumor activity. In addition, local injection of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 can
      enhance the effect of antitumor therapies (chemotherapy and radiotherapy). The hypothesis is
      that patients with unresectable HCC may benefit from recombinant human adenovirus type 5 in
      combination with TACE.
