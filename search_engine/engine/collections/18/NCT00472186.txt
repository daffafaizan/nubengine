      tonsillectomy for an indication of obstructive sleep disturbance (snoring, choking/gasping or
      pauses in breathing during sleep.)

      Study participants will be randomized to two groups: study medication (Lansoprazole) or an
      inactive substance(placebo).

      Participants will be asked to do all of the following:

        1. Take the study medication twice a day for 14 days.

        2. Keep a log book which will include:

             -  Record the medications and amount of each medication taken each day for 14 days.
                This includes pain medication and the study drug.

             -  Record your child's activity level daily for 14 days.

             -  Collect your child's urine one time daily and test it using special medicated
                strips to monitor their daily liquid intake for 14 days.

        3. Meet with a Research Assistant or Study Physician 14-21 days after the study to collect
           the log book and perform a post-operative examination.
