      microbiomes among healthy smokers and COPD patients form the respiratory samples or lung
      tissues. In the previous study, distinct difference in composition of microbiome in lung
      tissue between healthy smokers and COPD patients was reported. This is a cross sectional
      study to analyze composition of microbiome of various samples (e.g. feces, sputum, and urine)
      and to compare difference of composition between COPD patients and healthy smokers. This
      study would help establishing gut-lung axis model in humans.
