    
      A Phase II multi-center, double-blind, parallel group, randomized and placebo-controlled
      clinical trial addressing the treatment of patients with active and symptomatic
      Scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Patients who are either treatment
      naive or only recently started treatment (</= 6 months of prior treatment) will be randomized
      in a 1:1 assignment to receive either oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and a placebo (Plac)
      or a combination of oral MMF and oral pirfenidone (PFD), with both regimens administered for
      18 months. The primary hypothesis is that the rapid onset and anti-fibrotic effects of PFD,
      which have been observed in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), will
      complement the delayed antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of MMF, to produce a
      significantly more rapid and/or greater improvement in lung function over time than occurs in
      patients receiving control therapy with MMF and Plac.
