      50mmHg ). In these healthy patients we observed rapid response in ONSD with changes in EtCO2.
      This again highlights the fact that optic nerve being in direct communication with the brain
      ,the pressure changes in the latter are reflected in the ONSD. The alteration in ONSD was
      immediate in response to EtCO2 changes, and moreover,changes in ONSD were parallel to the
      EtCO2 changes. Since CBF and cerebral blood volume change in response to changes in PaCO2,
      the ONSD also changes accordingly. Over the years ,advancements in monitoring of ICP has
      enabled the diagnosis of elevated ICP reliably by non-invasive techniques.Optic nerve sheath
      diameter measurement using bedside ultrasound has been shown to correlate with clinical and
      radiologic signs and symptoms of raised ICP. Despite the association between ONSD and PaCO2 ,
      there is scanty literature on ONSD responsiveness to a more dynamic surrogate of PaCO2, that
      is EtCO2. The pertinent advantages of EtCO2 over PaCO2 measurement is that the former is
      continuously monitored under anesthesia and avoids time consuming process of arterial blood
      gas sampling. Moreover, the sensitivity of ICP to even small fluctuations in EtCO2 has been
      reported in literature. Animal studies have estimated that the rate of this increase in ONSD
      by 0.0034mm/mmHg increase in ICP.

      The ONSD was smallest (0.29cm) at EtCO2 30mmHg, and biggest (0.40cm ) at EtCO2 50mmHg while
      it was intermediate ( 0.34cm) at EtCO2 40 mmHg. These changes in ONSD are direct
      representation of changes in ICP brought about by changes in CBF due to PaCO2 changes. Based
      on results of Bland Altman plots, the calculated 95% confidence interval (CI) for the
      difference of two measures( EtCO2 40mmHg and 30mmHg ) on ONSD was 0. 009 to 0.102 and the
      calculated CI for the difference of other two measures ( EtCO2 40mmHg and 50mmHg ) on ONSD
      was 0.152 to 0. 29 and thus were observed to be statistically insignificant.

      Recently Kim et al studied ONSD responsiveness to two levels of EtCO2 ,40 and 50mmHg, each
      measured at 1 and 5min and they observed significant changes in the diameter of ONSD. Thus
      their results are at variance with our study. Various possibly reasons for differences in
      findings are Kim et al studied a small number of patients as opposed to a relatively larger
      sample size in our study. Also they used total intravenous anesthesia combining propofol and
      remifentanil infusion. This combination is more likely to predispose patients to systemic
      hypotension which in turn would increase ICP by causing cerebral vasodilation. Other
      possibility for different results may be that sonographic measurements of ONSD may vary by
      the observer's skills or even type of ultrasound device.

      According to available literature, the upper limit of ONSD used to define ICP more than
      20mmHg (raised ICP ) ranges from 0.48 to 0.57 cm. In our study ,the upper limit of ONSD at
      EtCO2 level 50mmHg was average of 0.40cm which implies that even at EtCO2 50mmHg,
      intracranial hypertension is a remote possibility in healthy non-neurosurgical patients with
      normal brain compliance. We kept constant the factors such as position of patients, time of
      measurement after achieving target EtCO2, measuring ONSD in a single plain ( transverse) and
      involving same experienced operator,,thereby, avoiding any confounding factors.
