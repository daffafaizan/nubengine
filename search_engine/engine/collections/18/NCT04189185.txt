      year. Olecranon fractures are classified according to the Mayo classification in three
      groups. Type 1A and B are treated conservatively, while comminute fractures of type Mayo 2B
      and 3B are treated with plate osteosynthesis.

      The most common type is a simple two part fracture, Mayo type 2A, which represents 74% of all
      olecranon fractures. The typical treatment of Mayo type 2A fractures is osteosynthesis using
      k-wires and tension band wiring. This provides adequate fracture healing and good functional
      results. The use of plate osteosynthesis for Mayo type 2A fractures does not provide
      functional or health economic benefits compared with operation with tension band wiring.

      Common for both techniques is a high risk of re-operation due to delayed healing of the
      surgical wound, and complications arising from the implanted material.

      Recently, new techniques for Mayo type 2A fractures have been described, in which no metal is
      implanted. Osteosynthesis is achieved with strong sutures. These techniques have been shown
      to reduce the high risk of complications leading to re-operation without effecting the
      functional outcome or fracture healing rate.

      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that suture fixation of Mayo type 2A fractures will
      decrease the risk of re-operation and provide equal functional outcome compared with tension
      band wiring.
