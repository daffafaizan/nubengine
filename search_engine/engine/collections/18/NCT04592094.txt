      level of contraction of the transversus abdominal muscle.

      Blueback® Physio is a CE marked class I medical device. This medical device allows to measure
      and visualize in real time the activity of the transversus abdominal muscle, one of the
      deepest muscle of the abdominal wall. It is placed on the patient, during a rehabilitation
      session with a mhysiotherapist.

      The objective is to optimize the three key phases followed by the healthcare professional:
      teaching his patient to feel the contraction of the muscle, learning to control this
      contraction, then learning to master this contraction when the patient is in double task
      (movements rehabilitation targeting other muscles, cognitive tasks or other tasks of everyday
      life that strain the spine).

      In the ABC-TRACC study, the objective is to compare the time needed for patient to get a good
      motor control on his transversus abdominal muscle if he is using the Blueback® Physio during
      his sessons or not.
