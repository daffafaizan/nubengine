      cannot be achieved at the same time. However, image processing algorithms can help an x-ray
      system to acquire images with lower dose without influencing image quality or achieving
      higher image quality with equal dose.

      In order to introduce a dose reduction technology the most important aspect is to validate
      the diagnostic image information. Philips has developed a new algorithm that is capable to
      process images with similar image quality but acquired at lower dose.
