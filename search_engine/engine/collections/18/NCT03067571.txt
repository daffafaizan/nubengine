      I. To assess response rate as determined by the International Working Group recommendations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and tolerability. II. To assess time on treatment. III. To assess overall
      survival. IV. To assess progression free survival. V. To assess long-term response rate.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore biomarkers predictive of response or resistance to therapy including expression
      of CD38 at study entry and at relapse and response rate based on CD38 expression level.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 3.25-6.5 hours on days 1, 8, 15 and 22
      of cycles 1-2, on days 1 and 15 of cycles 3-6, and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year, every 6
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
