      surgery (aged 20-80) will undergo ischemic conditioning, consisting of 4 cycles of 5-min
      ischemia with pressure of 200 mmHg on upper extremity followed by 5-min reperfusion with no
      pressure. During ischemic conditioning, changes in tissue microcirculation (baseline tissue
      saturation, occlusion slope during ischemia, and recovery slope during reperfusion) will be
      observed using tissue oxygen saturation sensor attached to the thenar muscle of the hand. For
      cardiac surgery patients, the study will be conducted before anesthesia induction on the
      surgery day to exclude any potential effect of anesthetics.
