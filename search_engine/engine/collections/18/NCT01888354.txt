      subject will be seen for MS relapse or exacerbation in the Neurology Clinic during a routine
      or semi-emergent visit. Patients will be offered an FDA approved treatment (ACTHar Gel) for
      MS attacks under a standard 14 day SQ protocol (standard 14 day SQ protocol (80 IU x 14 days)
      or a 5 day SQ protocol - (5 day subcutaneous protocol (80 IU x 5 days). Both protocols are
      within package insert guidelines. The subjects will be evaluated for Extended Disability
      Status Scales (EDSS), a standardized measure of clinical status in MS and the initial visit
      and 28 days later (and 90 days later). We will compare the change in EDSS outcomes between
      day 0 and day 28 (day 90) to determine if the 14 days is superior to 5 day protocol may be
      clinically equivalent. Patients will also be evaluated for walking, upper extremity function
      (9 hole peg test), cognition and vision.
