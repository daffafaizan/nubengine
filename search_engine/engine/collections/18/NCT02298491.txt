      nervous system (CNS) in approximately 5% of patients. The hallmark of the disease is the
      development of chronic inflammation with formation of non-caseating granulomas that can
      involve the brain parenchyma and meninges and appear as contrast-enhancing mass lesions on
      magnetic resonance imaging. The granulomas are primarily comprised of proinflammatory T cells
      (Th1 cells and Th17 cells) and macrophages which accumulate during the early stages of
      granuloma formation. The inflammation that is generated by these cells is modulated by
      anti-inflammatory responses mediated by Th2 cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells that later
      appear and populate the outer regions of the granuloma. The presence of Treg cells are of
      particular interest since these cell are also detected in high numbers in peripheral blood
      and the immune suppression that results may underlie the occurrence of anergy in patients
      with the disease. The treatment of CNS sarcoidosis involves the use of either corticosteroids
      or potent immunosuppressive agents, both which can induce severe long-term side effects. The
      adverse effects of steroids may be avoided by treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone
      (ACTH), which is available for patient use as H.P. Acthar® Gel. The efficacy of H.P. Acthar®
      Gel in the treatment of CNS sarcoidosis and the impact on quality of life have not been
      previously examined. In addition, little is known regarding the expression of immune markers
      in CNS sarcoidosis and the association of such markers with disease activity and response to
      treatment. These issues, therefore, will be explored in the context of this proposal.
