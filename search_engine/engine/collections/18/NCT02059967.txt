      Patients undergo IGART using active breathing control (ABC) 5 days a week for 7 weeks, for a
      total of 33 fractions with simultaneous integrated volume adapted boost (SIVAB) during
      fractions 26-33. Patients also receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once a week for 6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
