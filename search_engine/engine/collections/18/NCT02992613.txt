      groups at minimum 2 year postoperatively. The investigators hypothesized that the
      Ultra-Congruent(UC) insert would provide similar functional outcomes without increasing the
      incidence of adverse events.

      The study design is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty patients planed to
      undergo simultaneously bilateral total knee arthroplasty are randomised to be used
      Ultra-Congruent(UC) insert on one leg and posterior-stabilized(PS) insert on the other. The
      clinical outcome is comparative preoperative, postoperative 6weeks, 3months, 6months and
      1years. And clinical score consists of Range of Motion (ROM), WOMAC (Western Ontario and
      McMaster University Arthritis Index ) pain scale, Knee Society Score, Anterior and posterior
      stress view on X-ray.
