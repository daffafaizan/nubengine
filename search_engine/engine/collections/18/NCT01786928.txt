      such as increased dyspnea, productive cough with altered sputum, and fever. With disease
      progression, exacerbations are frequent and have a negative impact on health related quality
      of life and pulmonary function as well as increase mortality. More severe exacerbations
      require hospitalization resulting in enormous health expenditures, severely reducing daily
      life activities and declining peripheral muscle strength that can be only partially reversed
      after 3 months. Despite many features have been pointed out as responsible for the decrease
      in muscle strength during hospitalization, physical inactivity seems the most important.

      Resistance training is an interesting therapeutic option to prevent and/or reverse muscular
      dysfunction due to immobilised in healthy subjects and stable COPD patients because induces
      hypertrophy of type II fibers, increases muscle strength and exercise tolerance. In addition,
      provokes lower dyspnea perception during effort compared with other exercise training.
      Despite these benefits for stable COPD, the impact of a resistance exercise program during
      hospitalization remains poorly known.
