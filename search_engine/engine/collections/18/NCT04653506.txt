      overuse of opioid medications, and even impaired breastfeeding ability. Non-opioid analgesia
      may play an essential role in reducing pain and improving the postpartum period including the
      ability to breastfeed and caring for the newborn.

      This study will compare non-opioid treatment - 1000 mg Paracetamol versus 400 mg Ibuprofen in
      order to determine the optimal pain relief treatment in the early postpartum period that may
      decrease the use of opioid analgesia.

      The investigators will evaluate the pain by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) index in the
      early postpartum period. The evaluation will conduct at 4-time points - while the women
      taking the pain relief (time 0), an hour later (time 1), 4, and 6 hours later (time 4 and
      time 6).

      The investigators will compare the analgetic effect of each drug and evaluate the need for
      additional analgesia whether opioid or not.

      Furthermore, the investigators will examine when women sought pain relief and whether pain
      relief contributes to the ability of Breastfeeding.
