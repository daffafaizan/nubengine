      tumor response in patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube,
      or primary peritoneal cavity cancer treated with temsirolimus.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary I. Determine the duration of PFS and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.
