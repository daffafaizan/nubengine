      rate, height, weight and waist circumference. A brief medical History will be taken, followed
      by an abbreviated physical exam. A blood test to check your vitamin D level and routine
      chemistry including a complete lipid profile, liver and kidney function will be completed.

      Based on your fasting glucose and/or resting blood pressure you will be in one of the three
      arms: prediabetes (arm 1), prehypertension (arm 2) or co-existing prediabetes and
      prehypertension (arm 3). After determining the arm of the study you are in, you will be
      randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or vitamin D supplementation.

      If you are in the first arm with prediabetes (fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL), the primary
      outcome measure will change in fasting glucose at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and every 3 months until
      you are in the study up to 5 years. If you are in the second arm with prehypertension
      (resting blood pressure 120-139/80-89 mm Hg), the primary outcome measure will change in
      resting blood pressure at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and every 3 months until you are in the study up
      to 5 years. If you are in third arm with prediabetes and prehypertension, both these measures
      will be taken at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and every 3 months until you are in the study up to 5
      years. A repeat blood test to check vitamin D levels will be done at 8 and 16 weeks (and
      periodically as necessary) during the study.

      Other measures will be taken as are routine in your doctor's office.
