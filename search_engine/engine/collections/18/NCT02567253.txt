    
      Stage III ovarian cancer (OC) remains an important cause of cancer related mortality in
      women. After successful initial treatment, most patients eventually develop recurrent
      peritoneal disease which can only arise from peritoneal minimal residual disease (pMRD) left
      after primary cytoreductive surgery (CRS). Intensification of locoregional therapy through
      intraoperative intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (IPEC) immediately following CRS may prevent or
      delay peritoneal recurrence. Although IPEC, usually under hyperthermic conditions, is
      increasingly used in OC, its efficacy and the potential benefit of hyperthermia are at
      present unknown.The primary aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties of IP cisplatin administered under normothermic or hyperthermic
      conditions, and at different dosing schedules. Additional endpoints include surgery related
      morbidity and mortality, quality of life, overall survival, disease free survival, peritoneal
      recurrence free survival, peritoneal cytology, and exploration of potential biomarkers.
