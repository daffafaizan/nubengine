    
      "This study is conducted on the basis of the completed multi-dose, dose escalation, Phase IA
      trial in Australia, is a dose-finding, dose expansion and food effects study of BGB-283
      capsules in Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor to determine the
      tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetic profiles, preliminary efficacy, food effects under
      high-fat meal on the absorption and metabolism of BGB-283, and preliminary anti-tumor
      efficacy.

      The study was conducted in three phases: Stage I for dose escalation, Stage II for dose
      expansion and Stage III for food effects on pharmacokinetics under high fat meal.

      Stage I Dose escalation: In a open-label, dose-escalation design, dose escalation will be
      performed with the '3 + 3' scheme and the dosage levels of BGB-283 capsules will be gradually
      increased.

      Stage II Dose expansion: 20 mg/qd and 30 mg/qd are considered as effective and safe doses,
      based on preliminary results from Phase IA clinical studies in Australia. To further
      understand the preliminary pharmacodynamic results of BGB-283 in Chinese patients with
      malignant melanoma, 20mg/qd dose expansion study in B-RAF mutated malignant melanoma will be
      further explored if it has been proved to be a safe dose in Chinese population according to
      the '3 + 3' scheme.

      Stage III uses multi-center, open, two-group crossover self-control design to compare the
      high-fat meal effect on pharmacokinetics."
