      In mice, Metformin leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, reduction of levels of cyclic
      AMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activity, therefore blocking glucagon-dependent glucose output
      form hepatocytes. Glucagon plays an important role in the increased catabolic state seen in
      insulin deficiency. Hyperglucagonaemia states have been shown to accelerate proteolysis and
      leucine oxidation in insulin-deficient humans. Patients with insulin resistance and increased
      levels of glucagon have an increased in energy expenditure which may contribute to the
      catabolic state associated with this condition. We hypothesized that treatment with Metformin
      for 2 weeks will significantly inhibit glucagon-induced endogenous glucose production in
      insulin resistant individuals. We also hypothesized that glucagon-induced alterations in
      whole body protein metabolism and the increases in O2 consumption associated with
      hyperglucagonaemia states will be significantly inhibited by Metformin in these individuals.
      This would open the door for the development of other antidiabetic drugs with antagonism of
      glucagon as their principal mechanism of action.
