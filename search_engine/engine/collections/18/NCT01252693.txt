      patients will enter the study. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two
      treatment arms (Ozarelix or Goserelin). Eligible patients randomized to the ozarelix group
      will receive two SC injections of ozarelix 65 mg in the abdomen on Day 1 (left lower
      quadrant, LLQ and right lower quadrant, RLQ), followed by a SC injection of 65 mg of Ozarelix
      (abdomen LLQ) on day 8 and will receive 2 additional SC injections of Ozarelix on days 28 and
      56 (alternating injection sites). Eligible patients randomized to Goserelin will receive one
      3.6 mg SC injection in the abdomen (LLQ or RLQ), followed by a 3.6 mg SC injection on Days 28
      and 56 (alternating injection sites). Ozarelix will be reconstituted and administered as a 65
      mg injection. Patients will receive two Ozarelix 65 mg subcutaneous injections (SC) on Day 1,
      and one 65 mg SC injection on day 8, followed by one 65 mg injection on days 28 and 56. The
      patients will receive one Goserelin 3.6 mg SC injection at baseline, Day 28 and Day 56.
