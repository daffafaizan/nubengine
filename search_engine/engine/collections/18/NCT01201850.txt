    
      Treatment Plan:

      For patient consented and enrolled on study, bevacizumab will be administered at a dose of 10
      mg/kg IV every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses (3 doses/cycle).

      Patients are expected to receive at least 1 cycle (6 weeks) of study treatment unless an
      unacceptable drug reaction occurs. Patients will receive a second cycle of treatment as long
      as treatment is tolerated. Response assessment will be performed every 6 weeks (three
      doses/cycle of study drug) including clinical and radiological assessment. Secondary measures
      including documentation of total equivalent steroid dose, length of time on steroids, and
      quality of life using the modified McMaster Health Instrument scale will also be collected
      while on treatment and 30 days after finishing treatment.

      Safety will be assessed by routine physical and laboratory evaluations. Adverse events will
      be recorded and the severity graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (version 4.0).
