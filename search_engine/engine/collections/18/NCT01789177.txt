      flow measurement returns to baseline or predicted values following laparotomy with or without
      the assistance of modified incentive spirometry. The secondary objective is to assess the
      effectiveness of modified incentive spirometry in preventing postoperative pulmonary
      complications in patients following laparotomy. Specifically, this study will track length of
      stay, mortality, and evidence of pulmonary infection in both treatment and non-treatment
      arms.
