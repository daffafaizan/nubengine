      natural history and immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. To calculate the degree and
      duration of antiretroviral effect necessary to eliminate infection, characterization of
      residual cellular and tissue HIV reservoirs following high-level viral suppression is
      necessary. The ERADICATE study will evaluate the hypothesis that complete viral inhibition is
      possible, regardless of HIV disease stage, and leads to HIV eradication from tissues over
      time.

      Patients are divided into 1 of 5 groups based on the stage of HIV infection. Patients receive
      oral stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), indinavir (IDV), and nelfinavir (NFV) twice daily for
      24 weeks. All patients undergo basic blood sampling to follow HIV-1 RNA levels and absolute T
      cell subset numbers daily for 5 days; then 3 times a week for 3 weeks; 2 times a week for 4
      weeks; every 2 weeks for 12 weeks; and monthly thereafter for a total of 3 years. In
      addition, the following tissues are sampled at baseline and after 2 weeks and 6 months on
      therapy: 1) lymph node; 2) tonsillar; 3) perirectal lymphoid; 4) cerebrospinal fluid; 5) and
      semen.
