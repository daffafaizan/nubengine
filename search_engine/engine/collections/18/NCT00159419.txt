      Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)." OI is an inherited disorder of collagen synthesis. Collagen is
      the major structural protein of the matrix of tendons, skin, and bones. Affected persons have
      low bone mineral density (and experience multiple fractures and progressive bony deformity).
      In its most severe form, the disorder is lethal in infancy. We plan to characterize the
      changes effected by oral bisphosphonate therapy and compare them to a regimen of intravenous
      bisphosphonate therapy in a group of children with OI.

      Additionally, we have begun to treat patients with OI and other conditions of low bone
      mineralization for age who are not eligible for the standard protocol (too young, history of
      abdominal pain, etc.) with bisphosphonate. We also plan to screen the parents and siblings of
      our patients diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta, in order to determine if they also have
      osteoporosis.
