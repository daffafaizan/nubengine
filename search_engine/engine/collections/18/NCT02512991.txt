      infarction (STEMI) has been the preferred therapy in Denmark over fibrinolysis (thrombolysis)
      if performed within 120 minutes. Nevertheless, centralisation of designated PCI-centres may
      lead to systems delays as transport distance may be longer instead of just choosing
      thrombolysis at the nearest hospital.

      As every minute counts when trying to minimize the ischemic injury and size of infarction
      following an acute coronary event, timely transportation by helicopter may facilitate overall
      prognosis.

      As a part of a national initiative to improve prehospital care of patients with time critical
      illness such as myocardial infarction (MI), the first Danish Helicopter Emergency Medical
      System (HEMS) was implemented in the eastern part of Denmark May 1st 2010.

      An initial study on 450 patients investigating short-term effects, found that HEMS
      significantly reduced time from the first electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis on-scene to
      arrival at the cardiac catheterisation laboratory (CCL) despite longer transport distances.
      Investigators also found a lower, but insignificant 30-day mortality in HEMS patients,
      adjusted OR=0.40 (95% CI=0.12-1.39, p=0.14).

      The aim of the present study is to investigate long-term effects of HEMS in relation to
      mortality and labour market affiliation.
