    
      This is an open-label Phase I study of plasma, genitourinary, rectal, and pharyngeal
      pharmacokinetics of a single 1000mg oral dose of solithromycin. A total of 28 subjects (14
      male, 14 female) will be enrolled and will receive a single 1000mg dose of solithromycin
      after a 12 hour overnight fast (water permitted). Solithromycin is a fluoroketolide
      antibiotic under investigation for oral and parenteral use and will be administered orally.
      The study duration is approximately 18 months. Study Objectives: The primary objective is to
      determine the pharmacokinetics of solithromycin in plasma, vaginal, cervical, seminal,
      rectal, and pharyngeal fluid samples after a single 1000mg oral dose. The secondary objective
      is to determine the safety and tolerability of a single 1000 mg oral dose of solithromycin in
      healthy adult subjects.
