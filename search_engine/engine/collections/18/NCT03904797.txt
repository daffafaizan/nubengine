      palsy, Down syndrome, complex chronic conditions) and delays access Early Intervention
      Colorado (EI-CO) annually. A primary goal of EI-CO is to employ a family-centered care
      approach to help children optimally function at home and in the community. Hence, early
      intervention is a common source of rehabilitation (i.e., physical, occupational, speech and
      language therapy) for EI-CO eligible families.

      However, the effects of EI-CO are poorly understood. Numerous challenges exist with obtaining
      EI-CO outcomes data, including a paucity of validated and feasible functional outcome
      measures for use in EI outcomes reporting. These challenges have resulted in inadequate
      knowledge about EI service use and outcomes to guide service delivery. Despite these
      challenges, recent policy changes have resulted in EI-CO service providers being pressed to
      ensure high quality care with limited resources and evidence to guide their clinical
      decision-making about effective and efficient interventions. This proposal addresses the need
      to fill critical knowledge gaps about the adequacy of EI services with an eye toward
      improving care quality.

      This study involves families who have/are receiving EI-CO services through Rocky Mountain
      Human Services (RMHS), the largest EI program in Denver Metro. The purpose of this study is
      to test the feasibility, acceptability, and value of collecting electronic patient-reported
      outcomes (e-PRO) data to engage families when their child is due for an annual evaluation of
      progress. To further demonstrate the value of e-PRO data collection, these data will be
      paired with program data to estimate the association between EI-CO service use and functional
      outcomes.
