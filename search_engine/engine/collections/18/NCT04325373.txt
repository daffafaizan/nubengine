      (aortitis or mycotic aneurysm). AAA and its surgery are associated with pro-thrombotic
      modifications of hemostasis, which persists in the post-operative period. Pro-thrombotic
      reactions occur in the intraluminal thrombus. Inflammatory cells recruitment is mediated by
      adhesion molecules from the activated endothelium, such as "vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1" (VCAM-1), "intercellular adhesion molecule-1" (ICAM-1), P-selectin and
      E-selectin.

      In the setting of infection, neutrophil death process occurs, the NETosis, with the
      liberation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs), containing DNA and histones. NETs are
      associated with thrombosis and various studies have already quantified NETosis biomarkers in
      plasma from patients with thrombotic disease, such as MPO-DNA (DNA coupled myeloperoxidase).

      In the clinical perioperative setting, patients with aortitis scheduled for AAA surgery
      shwoed exhibit thrombotic events.

      The hypothesize was that patients with aortitis have an inflammatory and hemostatic
      activation different from patients who develop AAA in atherosclerotic condition, and that
      inflammation is a risk factor of postoperative thrombotic events.
