      the EMBLEM S-ICD system by following the proposed BSC Patient Screening Steps in 10 sites in
      Korea. All patients will be follow-up as standard of care to collect acute procedural and
      device related complications as well as long-term, device related, clinical and patient
      reported outcomes. Follow up data will be systematically collected over 24 months
      post-implant.
