    
      DMD is a rare, serious, debilitating, and ultimately fatal, disease for which there is an
      urgent need to develop safe and effective therapies. In order to efficiently meet this
      urgency and the needs of the subject community, the study evaluates the efficacy and safety
      of casimersen, eteplirsen, and of golodirsen administration over approximately 1 year in DMD
      subjects with duplication mutations amenable to treatment by exon 45, 51 or exon 53 skipping.
      Skipping of a single copy of the duplicated exon is expected to result in a wild-type (WT)
      DMD transcript allowing the expression of a WT, full length dystrophin protein. Successful
      skipping of a single copy of the duplicated exon in in vitro and in vivo models has been
      reported in the literature. Casimersen, eteplirsen, and golodirsen have the potential to be
      disease-modifying treatments for boys with DMD mutations amenable to exon 45, 51 and exon 53
      skipping, respectively.

      The totality of the non-clinical data with these PMOs as well as AVI-4225 (targeting exon 23)
      and eteplirsen suggests that PMOs are well tolerated in the non-clinical setting. Moreover,
      treatment with eteplirsen (at 30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) has been well-tolerated by boys with DMD
      deletion mutations amenable to skipping exon 51. The relatively low expected risk for
      subjects exposed to casimersen, eteplirsen, or golodirsen and the urgent medical need for a
      treatment for this subject population support the conclusion that the potential benefits of
      exposing subjects to casimersen, eteplirsen, or golodirsen outweigh the potential risks.
