    
      RENEW's Surveillance Monitoring system is made up of two main components:

      a patient-worn wireless vital signs monitor (Aingeal) that transmits data over Wi-Fi to a
      central station software platform (Surveillance Station). The Aingeal device measures single
      lead ECG, heart rate, respiration waveform and rate, and skin temperature. A snapshot of data
      is transmitted by the devices intermittently to the Surveillance Station, enabling vital
      signs trends to be plotted. This proposal describes the evaluation of RENEW's Aingeal device
      in a paediatric outpatient population in KK Women's and Children's Hospital ("KKH"), the main
      tertiary women and children hospital in Singapore. In the paediatric population, assessment
      of RENEW's Aingeal device will include the accuracy of the device at deriving heart rate from
      single lead ECG and at deriving respiratory rate when compared against a commonly used vital
      signs monitor. User acceptance of Aingeal and the Surveillance System will be considered
      within the clinical settings.
