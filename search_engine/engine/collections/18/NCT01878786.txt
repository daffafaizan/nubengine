      dose tacrolimus compared to early conversion to CNI-free regimen and MMF/MPA with standard
      dose tacrolimus in de novo renal transplant recipients of ECD/DCD kidneys. Given tacrolimus
      and MMF/MPA is a widely prescribed immunosuppressive regimen in the United States,
      comparisons of tacrolimus and MMF/MPA regimens to investigational therapies and treatment
      regimens are needed. Also, considering the fact that ECD/DCD is a fast growing fraction of
      donors, evaluation of various regimens' effects on rather delicate ECD/DCD kidneys is
      necessary.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate concentration-controlled everolimus and
      low dose tacrolimus compared to MMF/MPA with standard dose tacrolimus at 24 months
      post-transplant with respect to the composite efficacy failure rates (treated biopsy proven
      acute rejection episodes (BPAR), graft loss, death, loss to follow-up) in de novo renal
      transplant recipients.

      The key secondary objective is to compare renal function of the everolimus treatment arms to
      the MMF/MPA treatment arm at 12 and 24 months post-transplantation. Renal function will be
      measured by the calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), using the MDRD (Modification of
      Diet in Renal Disease) formula (20).
