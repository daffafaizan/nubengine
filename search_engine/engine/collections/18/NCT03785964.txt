      growing soft tissue tumors. Although considered benign because of their inability to
      metastasize, desmoid tumors can cause significant morbidity and occasionally mortality in
      patients.

      Nirogacestat (PF-03084014) is a potent, small molecule, selective, reversible, noncompetitive
      inhibitor of Î³-secretase (GS) with a potential antitumor activity.

      Nirogacestat is being investigated for the treatment of desmoid tumors due to its ability to
      bind to GS, blocking proteolytic activation of Notch receptors. Previous clinical study data
      have shown that Notch signaling plays an important role in cancer development. Hence,
      inhibition of Notch signaling is an important strategy for therapeutic treatment.
