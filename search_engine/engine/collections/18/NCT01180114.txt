      and familiesÂ´ ability and interest in participating in a family-level economic empowerment
      intervention focused on savings and family income generation, and their response to this
      family-focused economic empowerment approach alongside additional intervention components,
      including savings for youth education and adult mentorship. (2) Based on formative data (Aim
      #1), to adapt the intervention and examine issues related to feasibility and preliminary
      outcome on a small scale in order to prepare for a larger study.

      The intervention, SUUBI-MAKA, uses a novel approach by focusing on economic empowerment of
      families caring for children orphaned due to AIDS. The intervention has three key components
      (1) it promotes family-level income generating projects (micro-enterprises) which we believe
      will enhance economic stability, reduce poverty, and enhance protective family processes for
      youth orphaned by AIDS. (2) It promotes monetary savings for educational opportunities for
      AIDS-orphaned children. (3) It provides an adult mentor to children. The intervention will be
      evaluated via a two-group randomized trial. The two groups are SUUBI-MAKA or Usual care for
      orphaned children. The participating children will be nested within 20 primary schools that
      will be randomly assigned such that all children from a particular school receive the same
      intervention.
