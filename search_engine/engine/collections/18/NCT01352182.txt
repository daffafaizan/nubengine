      clinical trials have demonstrated clinical benefit in sepsis. Severe sepsis is a systemic
      inflammatory syndrome in response to infection that is associated with acute organ
      dysfunction. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) is
      involved in the regulation of the sepsis-induced inflammatory response. The central
      hypothesis is that pioglitazone reduces the inflammatory responses in children with severe
      sepsis and septic shock.
