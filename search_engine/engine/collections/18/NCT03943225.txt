    
      The do not resuscitate (DNR) order is a decision taken by the patient or other people about
      medical care in the end stages of life to withhold CPR in event of respiratory or cardiac
      arrest and allow natural death to occur. There is currently no related article of law to DNR
      order in Turkey. A questionnaire with 25 questions has been distributed to health workers and
      non-health workers.

      It was aimed to evaluate the health workers(HW) and the non health workers'(NHW) knowledge,
      attitude, and behavior related to the do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order in Turkey.
