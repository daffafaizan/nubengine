    
      This is an open label, Phase I-II, first in human (FIH) study for SKB264 as monotherapy in
      patients who have locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumor that is refractory
      to all standard therapies. TROP2 (trophoblast antigen 2) assessments will not be performed
      prior to enrollment but it will be assessed retrospectively. Confirmation of TROP2
      (trophoblast antigen 2) expression by immunohistology or other means is not required, but the
      Sponsor will request fresh tumor biopsy or tissue specimens from archived materials for
      determination of TROP2 (trophoblast antigen 2) expression retrospectively. The patient must
      be, in the judgment of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy
      whose tumor is refractory to standard therapies. Patients will receive study drug as a single
      IV infusion at the prescribed dose level at each administration. Cycles will continue until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The study is divided into 2 parts (Phase I and
      Phase II).
