      US population over 85 years of age, and is the most common cause of dementia. Clinical signs
      and symptoms of AD include cognitive impairments, especially memory and emotional
      disturbances. In order to accomplish this goal of prevention, a population at risk must be
      identified. Evidence suggests that both TBI and PTSD increase risk for cognitive decline, AD,
      and dementia.

      TBI and PTSD are common problems resulting from military service. Thus far, there have been
      no prospective studies using imaging and biomarkers, which directly measure changes in the
      brain and AD pathology to study the effects of TBI and PTSD. This proposed study will provide
      novel data to test these hypotheses. The results will have major implications for
      identifying, subjects at increased risk for AD, a possible need for early detection of AD in
      military Veterans with histories of TBI and PTSD, and a possible need to employ prevention
      and treatment measures to avoid accelerated development of AD in US military Veterans. This
      study is a first step toward a larger, more comprehensive study of dementia risk factors in
      Veterans. The results will lead to a design and statistical powering of a prevention trial.
      Therefore, this project could be the first step toward the prevention of AD in Veterans, and
      in the general population.
