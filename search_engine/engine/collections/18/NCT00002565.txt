      I. Compare, in a randomized setting, the time to treatment failure and the survival of
      patients with poor-prognosis intermediate-grade or immunoblastic lymphoma treated with the
      standard regimen of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) versus the
      new alternating triple therapy (ATT) of IdSHAP (idarubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,
      methylprednisolone), BIdCOS (idarubicin, vincristine, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide,
      methylprednisolone), and MINE (mesna, ifosfamide, mitoxantrone, etoposide).

      II. Compare the complete response rate achieved with ATT versus standard CHOP.

      III. Assess the feasibility of delivering full standard doses of chemotherapy to patients
      over 60 years of age who receive granulocyte colony stimulating factor support.

      IV. Compare the predictive capability of the M.D. Anderson Tumor Score System versus the
      International Index System.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. The following acronyms are used: ARA-C Cytarabine, NSC-63878 BLEO
      Bleomycin, NSC-125066 CDDP Cisplatin, NSC-119875 CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 DHAD
      Mitoxantrone, NSC-301739 DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating
      Factor (source unspecified) IDA Idarubicin, NSC-256439 IFF Ifosfamide, NSC-109724 MePRDL
      Methylprednisolone succinate Mesna Mercaptoethane sulfonate, NSC-113891 PRED Prednisone,
      NSC-10023 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 VP-16 Etoposide, NSC-141540

      Arm I: Sequential 4-, 5-, and 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. IdSHAP: IDA/CDDP/ARA-C/MePRDL;
      followed by BIdCOS: BLEO/IDA/CTX/VCR/MePRDL; followed by MINE: Mesna/IFF/DHAD/VP-16.

      Arm II: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. CHOP: CTX/DOX/VCR/PRED.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 218 evaluable patients will be accrued over approximately 31 months to
      this multicenter study. If either arm is significantly inferior at interim analyses after 31
      and 60 treatment failures, consideration will be given to early closure.
