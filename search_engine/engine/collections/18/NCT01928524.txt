    
      The primary aim of this dose-finding study is to determine the maximum tolerated doses of
      docetaxel, oxaliplatin and S1 given every second (DOS2w) or third (DOS3w) week as first-line
      treatment in patients with advanced gastro-esophageal cancer. Secondary end points are to
      evaluate toxicities according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4, response rate, progression-free survival and
      overall survival

      Primary Outcome Measure:

      To determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the the combination regimes (DOS2w) and
      (DOS3w).

      The investigators have planned to examine 4 dose levels of (DOS2w) and 3 dose levels of
      (DOS3w).

      Methods:

      This dose-finding study is planned to include a total of 24 patients with advanced
      gastro-esophageal cancer, adenocarcinoma.

      12 patients will be included in (DOS2w) at four at progressively higher dose levels.

      Chemotherapy will be repeated day 1 every second week to a maximum of nine courses.

      12 patients will be included in (DOS3w) at three progressively higher dose levels.

      Chemotherapy will be repeated day 1 every third week to a maximum of six courses.

      In both (DOS2w) and (DOS3w) dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated after the first
      course. In case of DLT among one of the three patients during the first course of treatment
      additional three patients will be added at the respective dose level. Dose escalation is
      continues if 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience DLT.

      Patients will be evaluated with a ct-scan at baseline and after every three or four cycles to
      exclude progression and evaluate response. Response is assessed by the investigator according
      to RECIST version 1.1.
