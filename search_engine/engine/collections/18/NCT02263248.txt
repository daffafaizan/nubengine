      buprenorphine (BPN) as a novel treatment for late-life treatment resistant depression
      (LL-TRD). The investigators aim to use a clinical trial methodology common to all three
      sites, and to examine the mechanism of action (MOA) of BPN using translational neuroscience
      methods. Over Â½ of seniors with depression fail to respond to traditional
      antidepressants.19,20 Modulation of the opiate system with BPN offers a novel mechanistic
      approach to improve the lives of patients with LL-TRD, with a safety profile potentially
      superior to current augmentation strategies such as antipsychotics, lithium, ECT, and
      surgical interventions (e.g., deep brain or vagal nerve stimulation).
