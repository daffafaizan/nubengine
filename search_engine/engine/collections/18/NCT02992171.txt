      intervention to meet the primary palliative care needs of patients with advanced hematologic
      malignancies.

      Aim 1 is a case series to develop and refine the intervention. During this time, we will
      develop initial interventionist training materials, study protocols, and a web-based outcomes
      database; train 2 hematology-oncology nurses; enroll 10 patients with advanced hematologic
      malignancies and their informal caregivers to receive intervention visits; conduct debriefing
      interviews; iteratively refine the intervention based on nurse, oncologist, patient, and
      caregiver feedback; and prepare the protocol for Aim 2. Aim 2 is a pilot study to assess the
      feasibility and acceptability of administering the intervention and assessing outcomes. We
      will recruit 30 patients and their informal caregivers to receive the intervention developed
      in Aim 1 and collect measures of quality of life, symptom burden, anxiety and depressive
      symptoms, caregiver burden, and healthcare utilization at baseline and monthly for up to
      three months. Trial outcomes will include: rates of enrollment, study completion, and outcome
      completion; intervention fidelity; and self-reported measures of study burdensomeness and
      effectiveness among patients, caregivers, and clinicians.
