      HIV-infected pregnant women who were on ZDV prophylaxis for more than two weeks and gave
      informed consent. If eligible, women completed a baseline check-up. Women meeting selection
      criteria were randomly assigned to receive one of three study regimens, in addition to ZDV
      prophylaxis:

        1. One dose maternal NVP treatment at onset of labor, and one dose of infant NVP treatment
           48-72 hours after birth

        2. One dose maternal NVP treatment at onset of labor, and one dose of infant placebo 48-72
           hours after birth

        3. One dose maternal placebo at onset of labor, and one dose of infant placebo 48-72 hours
           after birth. This was the reference study arm.

      Follow-up of women and infants was carried out on an outpatient basis except for delivery and
      the first three days after delivery.

      AMENDMENT

      After the first interim analysis, enrollment in Placebo-Placebo arm was terminated on May 2,
      2002, according to the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The target
      sample size was increased to 660, instead of 510, in each of the two remaining arms (N-N and
      N-P) to ensure enough power to test for non-inferiority between these arms with a limit of
      2.5%.
