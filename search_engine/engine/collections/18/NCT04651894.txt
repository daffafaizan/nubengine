      population coming for frailty and cardio vascular evaluation : clinical data of 148 patients
      hospitalized from April 2018 to December 2019 (20 months) of the Measurement of the
      ARterial-Cardiac AGEing and prevention evaluation of FRailty (MARCAGE.FR) geriatric day
      hospital of Nancy were retrospectively analyzed. Eligible patients were those who had
      benefited from an EndoPAT® measurement and arterial stiffness evaluation and aged over 60
      years. Exclusion criteria to analyze aortic pulse wave velocity was the presence of atrial
      fibrillation and for EndoPAT® a poor quality of the signal. 105 among these 148 patients were
      finally selected as they present EndoPAT® good signal (reviewed by two operators).

      All subjects arrived in a fasting state at the geriatric day hospital where anthropometric,
      frailty evaluation, hemodynamic and transcutaneous measurements of aortic pulse wave velocity
      (AoPWV) were performed at rest. Some of them had a cerebral Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      examination. Participants were requested not to smoke or drink tea or coffee for 30 minutes
      and to sit quietly for 10 minutes at least, before blood pressure and other hemodynamic
      parameters were measured. Individuals were considered hypertensive if they had systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) values > 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values > 90 mm Hg or
      if they were previously diagnosed as hypertensive and treated with one or more
      antihypertensive drug.
