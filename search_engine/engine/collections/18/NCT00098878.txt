      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients with stage IC-IV ovarian epithelial,
           fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer treated with flat-dose vs intra-patient
           dose-escalated carboplatin as first-line chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall clinical response rate and CA 125 response in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a flat dose of carboplatin on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive intra-patient dose-escalated carboplatin on day 1. In both
           arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each treatment course, and then at 2 months
      post-chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,300 patients (650 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
