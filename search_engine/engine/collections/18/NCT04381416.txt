      duration, or schedule, is experienced by 10-35% of women, and can markedly impact everyday
      activities, can lead to iron deficiency and in severe cases, can necessitate emergency
      medical care.

      While pharmacologic treatment options exist, some women desire a treatment that requires less
      maintenance or is definitive. Endometrial ablation is a minimally invasive approach applied
      to manage AUB and can be performed using resectoscopic instruments or with a
      non-resectoscopic approach, in which the device is inserted into the uterine cavity and
      delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining. Non-resectoscopic endometrial
      ablation has become an accepted office-based procedure, but requires training in
      administration and response to complications of conscious sedation and of assisting
      personnel.

      The IUB SEADâ„¢ device is a novel Spherical Endometrial Ablation Device, developed to allow for
      a simple, office-based chemical endometrial ablation to treat AUB. The suggested procedure is
      expected to be simpler than the currently available ablation methods and to result in a
      clinically meaningful delay or abolishment of the need for hysterectomy
