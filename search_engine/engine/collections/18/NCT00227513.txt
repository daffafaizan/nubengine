      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat (SAHA) and bortezomib in patients with
      metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily on days 1-14 in step A. Patients receive
      oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily on days 1-4 and 8-11 in Step B and bortezomib IV over 3-5
      seconds on days 2, 5, 9, and 12 during the first course and on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 during
      subsequent courses in both steps A and B. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 6 additional patients receive
      bortezomib at the MTD. Subsequent cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA
      until the MTD of that drug is determined.
