      tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination.

      The ancillary study is a sub-study within START. This is an exploratory investigation of the
      immune response in peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination. The
      main objective is to evaluate whether administration of single-shot, low-dose
      cyclophosphamide followed by tecemotide (L-BLP25) vaccinations induces specific immune
      response in peripheral blood to BLP25 (the mucinous glycoprotein 1 [MUC1] antigen) as well as
      a modulation of cellular and soluble components of the immune response in subjects with
      unresectable stage III NSCLC.

      Twenty-five of the European START sites will participate in the ancillary study.

      Sample size: up to 60 to 80 subjects

      All inclusion criteria specified in the START clinical trial protocol except for hemoglobin
      >= 100 gram/Liter (g/L)

      All exclusion criteria are the same as specified in the START clinical trial protocol

      Schedule of events: Blood samples will be taken at baseline, visit week 4, 8 13 and 25 (80
      milliliter (mL) whole blood each)
