    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  Determine the feasibility of manufacturing autologous T cells transduced with
           14g2a-CD8-BBz-iCasp9 retroviral vector expressing GD2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor
           (GD2CART) for administration in subjects with H3K27M+ diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
           (DIPG) or subjects with spinal H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (DMG) using a
           retroviral vector and dasatinib in the Miltenyi CliniMACS ProdigyÂ® system.

        -  Assess the safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase
           2 dose (RP2D) of GD2CART in subjects with H3K27M+ DIPG administered after
           cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-based lymphodepletion regimen using the following dose
           escalation schedule: DL1: 1e6 transduced T cells/kg; DL2: 3e6 transduced T cells/kg;
           DL3: 10e6 transduced T cells/kg.

        -  Assess the safety of the MTD/RP2D of GD2CART in subjects with spinal H3K27M mutant DMG.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  In a preliminary manner, assess clinical benefit of GD2CART at the RP2D in subjects with
           H3K27M DIPG or spinal H3 K27M-mutant DMG.

        -  If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to GD2CART,
           assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate clearance of the
           genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity.
