        -  To investigate the association between ERCC1 expression and clinical outcomes (response
           rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival) in patients with recurrent and/or
           metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who received cisplatin with
           versus without cetuximab on clinical trial ECOG-E5397.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for ERCC1 expression by IHC. ERCC1 levels
      (low or high) are assessed by an H-score and AQUA, a quantitative IHC analysis. Each
      patient's ERCC1 level result is then compared with the patient's clinical outcome.
