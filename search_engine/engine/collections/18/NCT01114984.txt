      procedures. According to previous studies, anywhere from 20-60% of breast surgery patients
      report mastalgia as an adverse outcome of surgery (1, 2). Although the exact mechanism has
      not been well defined, the pain is generally neuropathic in nature and described as a burning
      sensation, electric and shock like, with a stabbing quality (2,3). The large majority of
      post-operative mastalgia is therefore believed to be secondary to nerve damage, particularly
      injury to the intercostobrachial nerve, and less commonly the long thoracic, medial and
      lateral pectoral, and/or the thoracodorsal nerves. Other reported causes of post-operative
      breast pain include scarring pain, lymphedema, radiation plexopathy, and hematomas (1-5).

      Increasing rates of breast surgeries, whether elective, diagnostic, prophylactic, or
      therapeutic, warrant a more detailed examination of this pain-syndrome, particularly as
      previous research in the area is rather limited and narrow. A better understanding of the
      potential mechanisms causing pain, as well as more accurate and current incidence rates, and
      comparisons of adverse outcomes among the various options available to patients can help
      guide physicians towards improved clinical practices and patients towards more informed
      decision-making. Therefore, we designed this prospective cohort study to better understand
      the underlying mechanisms which may cause post-operative pain after various types of breast
      surgeries including breast biopsy, lumpectomy, mastectomy, mastectomy with reconstruction,
      cosmetic augmentation, and breast reduction, as well as to compare and contrast incidence,
      quality, and distribution of the post-operative pain caused by these various surgical
      procedures.
