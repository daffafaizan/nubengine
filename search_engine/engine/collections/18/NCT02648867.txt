      incidence of adverse outcomes for mother and neonate. More than 80% of laboring women in the
      US have epidurals for labor pain management. The length of second stage labor is increased in
      women receiving regional anesthesia for pain management during labor and delivery compared to
      women without anesthesia. This increased length of labor is largely due to lack of maternal
      sensation resulting in decreased physiologic feedback on the efficacy of maternal expulsive
      (pushing) efforts. Continuous maternal feedback regarding fetal decent during labor may
      result in more effective maternal expulsive efforts reducing the length of second stage and
      improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study will assess the ability for continuous
      electronic feedback to reduce the length of second stage labor and improve maternal and fetal
      outcomes.

      The study device consists of a modification of the standard fetal scalp electrode and a
      separate apparatus designed to detect movement of the fetal head by detecting movement of the
      FSE. As the patient pushes, the amount of fetal movement will be measured and recorded. The
      movement will be recorded by a laptop computer which will provide optical and auditory
      feedback to the patient about descent of the fetal head with maternal expulsive efforts.
