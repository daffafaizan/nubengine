      molecular mechanisms of ASD are not clear and successful treatments are still under research.
      Autism Spectrum Disorder can occur due to exposure to environmental pollutants which lead to
      epigenetic changes like DNA methylation, acetylation and post-translational modifications.
      However, the role of epigenetic changes in Autism Spectrum Disorder is still debated.

      Epigenetic mechanisms represent a link through which environmental factors interact with the
      genetic factors resulting in modification of Autism Spectrum Disorder risk through changes in
      gene expression. DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are two major epigenetic
      mechanisms that regulate the gene expression at successive stages of brain development.

      Brain derived neurotrophic factor is responsible for brain development. Altered BDNF levels
      and expression may be closely associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. . Glial fibrillary
      acidic protein is the hallmark intermediate filament protein in astrocytes, the main type of
      glial cells in the central nervous system. Interestingly, Glial fibrillary acidic protein is
      a marker of astroglial activation and the recent data indicated that Glial fibrillary acidic
      protein could be implicated in the pathophysiology of autism. However, the underlying
      mechanisms for the role of brain derived neurotrophic factor and glial fibrillary acidic
      protein in autism spectrum disorder are poorly understood.
