    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive arginine butyrate IV over
      6-14 hours on days 1-5 of weeks 1-4 and 7-10. Patients then receive maintenance arginine
      butyrate IV over 6-14 hours on days 1-4 of weeks 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25.

      Patients who have no medical contraindications (e.g., paraspinal extramedullary
      hematopoiesis, hypertension, or poorly controlled congestive heart failure) may continue
      therapy. Patients receive arginine butyrate IV over 6-14 hours on days 1-4 of weeks 27, 29,
      31, 33, 35, 37, and 39 and epoetin alfa intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) three
      times weekly on weeks 27-40.

      Patients may continue to receive epoetin alfa IM or SC alone three times weekly on weeks
      41-52. Patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL) may receive epoetin alfa
      alone on weeks 1-12 before arginine butyrate induction therapy.

      Patients who complete therapy at week 26 are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months. Patients
      who complete therapy at week 40 are followed monthly for 2 months.
