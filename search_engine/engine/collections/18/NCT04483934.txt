      treatment of trophic ulcers using injection of autologous dermal fibroblasts in the wound.

      The positive outlook for the effectiveness of photodiode therapy with dermal fibroblasts is
      due to the following:

        -  the ability of fibroblasts to stimulate tissue regeneration

        -  positive results of preclinical studies of the method of treatment of long-term
           non-healing wounds in animals (rats).

      Twelve patients were included in the study. Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from the skin
      patients, cultured and then transplanted back to the wound.

      The therapeutic dose of cells was 50k per cm2 of the wound area. Follow up patients
      monitoring was performed at 1, 2 and more months after injection.
