      including frozen shoulder, bursitis, and rotator cuff lesions. Actually, shoulder pain or
      shoulder disorder can be the first sign of PD. The prevalence and severity of shoulder
      disorders in Parkinson's disease are not totally clear. In a retrospective study, Stamey
      found shoulder pain was present in 11% of patients with PD.

      Over the past ten years ultrasound (US) has become popular in the evaluation of shoulder
      disorders. It allows for the detailed assessment of a wide range of changes involving
      different anatomic structures of the shoulder joint, including rotator cuffs, biceps tendon,
      and subdeltoid bursa. Koh et al found among 33 PD patients, 22 patients had abnormal US
      findings on the dominant side, and all 22 patients with abnormal US finding had a tendon tear
      and 9 patients had frozen shoulder. However, there were no control group in Koh' s study, and
      diagnosis of frozen shoulder with US findings is still controversial.

      The purposes of this study are to evaluate patients with PD with a combination of physical
      examination and US study of the shoulder, and to compare the frequency and type of shoulder
      lesion in US between patients with PD and normal subjects. The investigators also plan to
      test the correlation between shoulder disorders or US abnormality and the severity of PD.
