      treated with the Certain Prevail dental implants. Restorations will consist of single tooth
      replacements, short and long fixed bridges, and overdentures and full dentures. All implants
      are placed using a single stage approach and temporalization occurring after two months of
      healing (early loading). Each center will strive to enroll a total of 20 patients.
