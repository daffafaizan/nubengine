      pericardial tissue. The tissue is created by treating bovine pericardial tissue with Edwards
      Integrity Preservation. It incorporates a stable capping anticalcification process, which
      blocks residual aldehyde groups known to bind with calcium. Tissue preservation with glycerol
      allows the valve to be stored without a traditional liquid-based solution, such as
      glutaraldehyde. Therefore, valve is stored under dry packaging conditions and consequently
      does not require rinsing prior to implantation.

      The novel tissue preservation technology significantly improves hemodynamic and
      anticalcification properties compared with the standard Perimount valve in an ovine model. In
      this registry, data is collected over a period of 5 years to demonstrate these properties in
      a clinical real-life setting. Clinical outcomes, hemodynamic as well as safety parameters and
      quality of life data are documented into e-CRF at baseline, surgery, pre-discharge, 3-6
      months and annually up to year 5.

      The required sample size was calculated using the online calculator at
      http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm. It was estimated, from COMMENCE Trial dataset that
      freedom from time-related valve safety events at 1 year (composite endpoint according to
      VARC-2) is around 0.915. The following table illustrates 95% CIs at different levels of risk:

      Sample Size Observed freedom from event 95%CI 400 0.900 ± 0.0294 400 0.910 ± 0.0280 400 0.915
      ± 0.0214 400 0.920 ± 0.0266 400 0.930 ± 0.0250

      20% of registry sites will be monitored with 100% source data verification
