      increases operative bleeding risks/rates. Many surgeons treat these patients with
      preoperative SSKI which is believed to decrease the vascularity, which in turn may decrease
      bleeding risks. However, there has been no quantitative data published on whether this is a
      real effect with true clinical benefit, in either animal or human models with SSKI. There
      have been some studies in Europe studying Lugol's solution, a different formulation of
      iodine, which show some decreased vascularity using color Doppler or measurements of CD34
      cells.
