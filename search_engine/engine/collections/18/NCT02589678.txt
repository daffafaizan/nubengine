      and Ndola, Zambia are willing to participate and can be retained in future HIV vaccine
      trials. 150 women will be enrolled that are either sex workers or single women that were
      identified at infant vaccination clinics (at risk due to a recent pregnancy indicating
      unprotected sexual contact outside of marriage or cohabitation). Two licensed vaccines will
      be administered as proxies for HIV vaccine administration. The clinic and laboratory
      procedures will simulate HIV vaccine trial procedures and will therefore inform recruitment
      and retention strategies and HIV incidence among high risk women in future HIV vaccine
      trials.
