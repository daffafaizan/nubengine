      symptom has been reported to be a specific presentation of patients with pulmonary embolism.
      However, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with syncope remains debated. This
      prospective cohort study will recruit patients presenting to the emergency department with a
      syncope, who will systematically undergo formal workup for pulmonary embolism. The main
      objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in ED patients with
      syncope
