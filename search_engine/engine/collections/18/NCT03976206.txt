      area, followed by skin pathology to compare the improvement of skin aging. Two 0.5 Ã— 1 cm
      fragments of skin and subcutaneous tissue was removed from bilateral preauricular areas for
      morphologic analysis by optical and electron microscopy. Histologic analysis of skin biopsy
      specimens was performed by hematoxylin and eosin, picrosirius red (for visualization of
      collagen), and orcein (for visualization of elastic fibers) staining.
