      associated with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS). SBS is usually caused by the significant
      resection or loss of function of the ileum, leading to reduced reabsorption of bile acids and
      subsequent osmotic diarrhea. The new ECC formulation could release cholestyramine in the
      remaining segment of the small intestine in SBS patients, delivering and binding bile acids
      before they induce diarrhea in the colon. The proposed advantages of this formulation are: a)
      to prevent drug-drug interactions in the proximal GI tract, b) to preserve the fat digestive
      properties of bile acids in the duodenum and 3) to offer a more palatable dosage form to
      patients. Moreover, since distal delivery of cholestyramine is expected to be more effective
      in diarrhea prevention/reduction in SBS, lower doses than the ones used with non-enteric
      coated cholestyramine may be sufficient. Two doses of ECC will be studied for efficacy,
      safety and tolerability in well-defined non fully-colectomized, adult SBS patients suffering
      from diarrhea.
