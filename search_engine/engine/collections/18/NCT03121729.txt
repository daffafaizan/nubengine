      all malignancies. It is very important for treatment of gastric cancer to enhance the quality
      of treatment, increase patients' survival rate and improve the life quality. Now, "Gastric
      Cancer, Version 3.2016, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology" and "Japanese gastric
      cancer treatment guidelines 2014 (ver. 4)" recommended surgical resection for gastric cancer.
      As a result, increasing the quality of surgery and improving the perioperative measures have
      a great influence on patients received a gastrectomy. Before, patients discharged on 7-10
      days after gastrectomy and recovered 4-8 weeks after surgery. So, it is significant for
      patients to recover from surgical trauma in order to receive other anti-cancer therapies
      after gastrectomy. Investigators spent over ten years studying enhanced recovery after
      surgery programs for gastric cancer and have got some successful experience. Investigators
      found enhanced recovery after surgery can accelerate patients' recovery without increasing
      complications.

      This study is the first multi-center study of enhanced recovery after surgery for gastric
      cancer all over the world. During this period, the study is aimed to evaluate the safety of
      applying enhanced recovery after surgery for gastric cancer.
