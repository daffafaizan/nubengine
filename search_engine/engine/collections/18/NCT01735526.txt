      reductions of absolute lung volume and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) are
      frequently detected even in the absence of overt idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS)[PMID:
      22221781]. Two months after allo-HSCT, we have recently shown an increase in lung tissue
      density determined by quantitative CT scan [PMID: 22898044]. It can be hypothesized that
      these parenchymal changes might be due to an occult intersitial lung disease associated with
      infections, acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD), myeloablative conditioning regimens or
      any combination of these [PMID: 21531955]. To test this hypothesis, we will simultaneously
      measure the lung diffusing capacity for nitric oxide (DLNO) and DLCO. Assuming, for clinical
      purposes, that the reaction rate of NO with blood hemoglobin is infinite so that DLNO = DMNO
      = DMCO*alpha (alpha = NO/CO diffusivity ratio), as to partition the effect of HSCT on
      membrane diffusing capacity (DM) and pulmonary capillary volume (Vc) we will use the
      DLNO/DLCO ratio [PMID:16478855]. As we hypothesize that GHVD should be intuitively absent
      amongst autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) recipients, we will compare the changes in DLNO/DLCO
      ratio showed by the latter group with those of subjects undergoing allo-HSCT.
