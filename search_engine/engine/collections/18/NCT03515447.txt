      investigators decided to off-label administered Romiplostim in patients with thrombocytopenia
      below 100 Giga per liter. The purpose was to reduce platelets transfusion side effects.
      Romiplostim was used off treatment algorithm was based on previously published data in
      idiopathic, thrombocytopenia, cirrhotic and hematological patients. The first subcutaneous
      injection of 1.5 to 2 μg/kg of romiplostim was administered in the postoperative periods. An
      algorithm based on patient weight and platelet count evolution was established to determine
      romiplostim doses to administered weekly. Romiplostim posology was adjusted between 2 and
      5μg/kg according to platelet count with a maximum of 4 administrations in the ICU. If
      platelets remained below 50 Giga per liter after 2 injections, bone marrow analysis after
      hematologist referral was discussed. Platelet count until day 15 after the last injection was
      monitored to detect thrombocytosis.

      In January 2016, the investigators decided to retrospectively assess Romiplostim
      implementation in the standard of care in the ICU through a Healthcare quality improvement
      project in a before/after design.
