        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of karenitecin in patients with recurrent malignant
           glioma who are receiving or not receiving anticonvulsants known to be metabolized by the
           P450 hepatic enzyme complex.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess the preliminary evidence of therapeutic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      use of anticonvulsants known to be metabolized by the P450 hepatic enzyme complex (yes vs
      no).

      Patients receive karenitecin IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of karenitecin according to the continual
      reassessment method until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose associated with a dose-limiting toxicity rate of 33%.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
