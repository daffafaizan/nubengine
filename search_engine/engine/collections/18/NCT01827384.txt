      I. Evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study
      agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment regimens corresponding to one of their
      mutation/amplification categories.

      REGIMEN I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and
      temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN II: Patients receive adavosertib PO BID for 5 doses starting on day 1 and carboplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug as of March
      2018)

      REGIMEN III: Patients receive everolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug
      as of March 2018)

      REGIMEN IV: Patients receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug
      as of March 2018)

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days. Patients with
      unacceptable toxicities that have not resolved by day 30 are followed up biweekly until
      stabilization or resolution.
