      supply and demand struggle or capacity management challenge for health care facilities. This
      is now recognized as a major public health issue. The impact is readily seen as overcrowding
      in emergency departments. At present 76% of hospitals' emergency departments (ETDs) are at or
      over capacity with 33% reporting ambulance diversions, the most common sign of overcapacity
      within a health care facility. Compounding the physical capacity problem is the "human
      capacity strain" as admitted patients remain in the ETD for prolonged periods waiting for
      beds. Delayed admission to patient care units significantly strains the financial resources,
      impedes "patient flow" ultimately impacting the quality of care, patient satisfaction and the
      "bottom line." Discharge before 11 am optimizes the availability of hospital beds to meet
      admission demands thereby avoiding a surge over capacity or "patient back log", ambulance
      diversions in ETD; the post anesthesia recovery unit, admissions office and critical care
      units. Conversely competing needs for the attending physician's physical presence off of the
      hospital premises; off of the unit (private practice and meetings) often delays patient
      discharge from before 11 am to the afternoon and evening.
