    
      Subjects with ischemic heart disease due to stenotic lesions in either native coronary
      arteries or coronary artery bypass grafts undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      with stent placement and no contraindications to prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy are
      eligible to be enrolled in the study.

      All enrolled subjects will undergo PCI with stent placement. All enrolled subjects will be
      treated with either an FDA-approved drug eluting stent(s) (DES) or an FDA-approved bare metal
      stent(s) (BMS) (per their respective Instructions for Use) and assigned to 12 months of open
      label FDA-approved thienopyridine treatment in addition to aspirin. Operators will select the
      thienopyridine according to the package insert. Thienopyridine treatment dose will be
      according to the standard of practice and prescribing information for the selected
      medication. Aspirin treatment will be 75-325 mg for the first 6 months after the procedure
      and 75-162 mg subsequently, to be continued indefinitely. All DES or BMS subjects who are
      treated with 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy post index procedure and who are event
      free per protocol will be eligible for randomization to either placebo (12 m DAPT Study arm)
      or an additional 18 months of thienopyridine treatment (30 m DAPT Study arm). Both arms will
      continue aspirin therapy.

      Up to four (4) separate post-market approval studies will be allowed to incorporate the
      randomized design of the DAPT Study for a subset of subjects who may then be contributed for
      the DAPT Study analyses.
