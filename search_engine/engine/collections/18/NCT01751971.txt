      two separate nights. Loop gain is measured from routine polysomnography using a novel
      mathematical method. A value of loop gain >1 reflects unstable breathing, and a value less
      than but approaching 1 denotes a system more prone to oscillate. Loop gain is measured as the
      changes in ventilatory drive/effort that arises subsequent to changes in ventilation (e.g.
      due to obstructive apnea). A simple chemoreflex model (gain, time constant, delay) is fit to
      surrogate ventilation data (derived from airflow) during sleep. The best model is one that
      best matches the elevated ventilatory drive (measured as ventilation in the absence of
      airflow obstruction) based on the prior apneic/hypopneic fall in ventilation. Loop gain is
      calculated from this model. We aim to use loop gain measured on and off oxygen to determine
      whether a strong response (reduction in apnea severity) can be predicted by a higher loop
      gain (in the sham arm) using our method. We also assessed whether assessing upper airway
      anatomy/collapsibility, dilator muscle responsiveness, and the arousal threshold helped to
      predict responses to treatment.
