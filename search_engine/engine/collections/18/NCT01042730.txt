      death and cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. However, whether
      aggressive cholesterol lowering therapy, using high dosage of statins, is more effective than
      moderate cholesterol lowering therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients
      with coronary artery disease has not been studied in Japan.
