    
      This study consists of two parts: Part 1 is an open-label, multiple ascending dose (MAD)
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074 in healthy
      subjects. The safety and tolerability will be assessed at each dose level before progressing
      to the next higher dose. Part 2 is an open label, randomized, parallel study to assess the
      safety and tolerability, the effect of renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074,
      as well as the PK/PD relationship in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment.
