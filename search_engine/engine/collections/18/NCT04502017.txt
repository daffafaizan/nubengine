      (LAA) occlusion are still scarce. The classical AT strategy after LAA occlusion includes
      6-weeks of warfarin + aspirin followed by dual anti platelet therapy with clopidogrel (75 mg)
      and aspirin (81-325 mg) until 6 months of follow-up, then aspirin alone is continued
      indefinitely. Nonetheless, a significant number of patients continues to suffer from
      device-related thrombosis which carries a high risk of thromboembolic events. Other AT
      strategies have been tested in order to reduce the risk of thrombus-formation on device.
      Among them, replacement of clopidogrel with half-dose oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients
      with genetic resistance to this drug has been recently reported to reduce the incidence of
      DRT. Additionally, reduced dose of novel OAC was demonstrated to lead to lower thrombin
      generation compared to DAPT.
