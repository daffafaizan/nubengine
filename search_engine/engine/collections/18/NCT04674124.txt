    
      This study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing an online mindfulness based
      course (10ofZen) with a treatment as usual group (delayed 10ofZen course materials).
      Participants will be informed about the study and asked to undertake a screening
      questionnaire to ensure the eligibility criteria is met. Following this, participants will be
      invited to give online consent. A battery of self-report measures will be administered online
      at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 10) and at follow-up (week 14). A sleep measure
      will also be undertaken and used as a co-variate during data analysis. At the end of
      participation in the research study, all participants will gain access to the course
      materials, including audio recordings of meditations and any written materials used within
      the course.
