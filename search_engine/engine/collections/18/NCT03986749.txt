      considering also the inflammatory status of the bursa, will be systematically investigated
      for the first time. The influencing role of the inflammatory status of the bursa, of the RC
      tendon and the synovial membrane at the time of the operation on the tendinous healing rate,
      the patient-relevant outcome factors and the revision rate will be assessed. In a further
      approach, basic knowledge about the role of bursa inflammation and its influence in the
      development and regeneration of tendon pathologies shall be gained. The findings of the whole
      project could lead to improve tendon healing in the reconstruction of the rotator cuff,
      taking advantage of augmentation potential of the subacromial bursa.
