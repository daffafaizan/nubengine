      at present no drug therapy leads to long-term remission for all patients with RA. People may
      still continue to experience physical, psychological and functional consequences which could
      benefit from rehabilitation.little research exists on the effects of exercise for people with
      RA taking anti-TNFalpha therapy medication.

      It is proposed to conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of group
      exercise therapy in a gym setting or in a hydrotherapy pool compared to a control group.
