      painful bone metastases, about 2 out of every 5 patients (about 40%) experience pain flare.
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether pain flare is prevented by receiving 8mg
      dexamethasone at least one hour prior to radiotherapy and once daily for the following 4
      days. To do this, half of the patients in this study will get dexamethasone and the other
      half will receive a placebo (a substance that does not do anything). Using a placebo is the
      best way to see if a new therapy is effective and to clearly see the potential side effects
      and impact on quality of life.
