      involve regional lymph nodes. Nodal metastasis is an adverse prognostic indicator and results
      in poor outcome, irrespective of the use of systemic chemotherapy or radiation. The ' gold
      standard ' treatment for UUT-UC is RNU.

      Extended pelvic lymph node dissection in bladder carcinoma provides staging and, in selected
      patients, a survival beneﬁt. Recent studies showed the therapeutic beneﬁt of RPLND in
      advanced stage urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, but there is still a lack of
      prospective studies. Thus, the current guideline recommends lymph node dissection for
      invasive UCUT on the basis of insufﬁcient evidence. But no prospective studies have
      standardized the ideal extent of RPLND or the optimum number of total lymph nodes that should
      be removed in patients with UUT-UC. Also more and more interest has been paid to establish
      standardized node dissection templates.

      Also laparoscopic extended RPLND is still a technical challenge in urology, considering the
      high rate of severe complications and difﬁculties in manipulation. In Renji Hospital,
      laparoscopic extended RPLND at time of nephroureterectomy was performed via an
      extraperitoneal approach, avoiding interference with abdominal organs and achieving better
      exposure.

      The aim of the present study was to determine the safety and feasibility of performing an
      extraperitoneal laparoscopic extended RPLND at the time of RNU for UTUC in a prospectively
      collected cohort of patients.
