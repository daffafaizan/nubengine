      older), buccal mucosa samples (ages 8 and older), normal tissue (ages18 and older) bone
      marrow (ages 18 and older) and/or leukapheresis cells (ages 18 and older) from healthy
      volunteers, including pregnant women (ages 18 and older, blood and/or buccal mucosa only). To
      be enrolled on this study, pregnant women must not carry the diagnosis of an immune-mediated
      or inflammatory disease, or have signs or symptoms of an immune or inflammatory disease;
      otherwise they may be eligible for participation on CHI protocol 10-H-0162 in the affected
      adult cohort. Samples will be used as controls for clinical and translational research in the
      Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases (CHI). These control
      samples are indispensable for many of our laboratory research projects, including
      understanding the pathophysiology of a wide variety of immune-mediated and inflammatory
      diseases.

      The primary objective is to provide a mechanism for collection, tracking, storing,
      dispensing, analyzing and disposing of these laboratory research samples from healthy
      volunteers.

      There is no primary endpoint.
