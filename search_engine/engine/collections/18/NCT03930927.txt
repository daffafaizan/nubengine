      of lesions via remineralization. . Remineralization is the process of restoring minerals -
      again, in the form of mineral ions - to the hydroxyapatite latticework structure. It is
      three-dimensional, and the lost ions must be replaced with ions having the exact same shape,
      size and the same electrical charge as those lost from the lattice.

      Fluoride and self-assembling peptides have been used as adjuncts to enhance remineralization.
