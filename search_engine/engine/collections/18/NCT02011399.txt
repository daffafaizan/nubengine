      The investigators want to keep users motivated and determine the best way to provide
      effective training. Healthy users will be trained to control a computer by wearing an
      electrode cap that is connected to a computer. They will have their levels of motivation and
      interest measured while learning to use the Mu rhythm. Two different types of learning
      programs will be used to determine which is most effective for Mu rhythm training. This
      method will be used for device control by people with severe physical impairments, who may be
      able to communicate or carry out other desired tasks using a BCI.
