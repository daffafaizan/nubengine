      targeted lateral node which was matched with the enlarged one in imaging from the specimen.
      Then the nodes would be send for pathological examination. Then we would extract the
      radiomics parameters of the nodes from the pretreatment CT and MRI with ITK-SNAP software.
      According to the pathological status, lymph nodes and corresponding radiomics parameters
      would be divided into positive and negative groups. Then significant parameters would be
      selected by R software. Then the prediction model with nomogram would be developed. 70% nodes
      would be used for for model development and the other 30% would be used for validation.
