      treatment. Its therapeutic effects have been variously documented.

      Objective: The study aimed to investigate the reactivity of electroencephalography (EEG) and
      the clinical response of patients with disorders of consciousness and explore the
      neuromodulatory effects of highfrequency tDCS in DOC.

      Method:In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial,real or sham tDCS were applied to
      the left dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) cortex of participants with disorders of
      consciousness for two weeeks. Evaluations were blindly performed at baseline, immediately
      after the end of the 14-days treatment and 1 week later with the JFK Coma Recovery
      Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scale and EEG.
