      III multiple myeloma treated with thalidomide, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone. II. Determine
      the safety and toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20, doxorubicin IV on
      day 1, and oral thalidomide daily. Treatment repeats every 30 days for 4 courses in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 1 year.
