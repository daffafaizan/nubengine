      differences. The prevalence of infertility in women of reproductive age has been estimated to
      be one in every seven couples in the western world and one in every four couples in
      developing countries. Geographical, sociocultural / religious and ethnical dissimilarities
      contribute to these global variations in infertility prevalence. Infertility has a major
      impact on family stability in many cultures, especially in developing countries, where
      childlessness can impact sociocultural status.

      So far, most fertility treatments are based on studies performed in Western countries and
      therefore mostly performed in Caucasian population and research regarding infertility causes
      and optimal treatments in other populations is scarce. The aim of this prospective study is
      therefore to analyze the differences in the basic parameters of the populations analyzed,
      considering the country of origin and ethnicity undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment as well as the
      stimulation outcome in regards to stimulation dosages and oocyte yield.
