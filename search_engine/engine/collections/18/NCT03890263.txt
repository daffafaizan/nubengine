      have increased over three decades with the aim of reducing the burden of chronic pain.
      Unfortunately, increases in opioids have not improved functional outcomes for people with
      pain and opioid related side-effects and deaths have accompanied the rise in use. Opioid
      deprescribing (reducing the dose or transitioning off of opioids) has the potential to
      improve health outcomes for people on opioids for chronic pain. One of the evidence based
      approaches to deprescribing includes providing an interdisciplinary pain program for
      individuals to help manage their pain as they reduce their dose or transition off of opioids.

      Unfortunately, the inability to access multidisciplinary pain programs is a barrier faced by
      most people living with pain and their primary care providers. Self-management support has
      been shown to improve pain and function for people with chronic pain and may be more feasible
      to offer in primary care to support people as they try to reduce their dose or transition off
      of opioids. Evidence on the outcomes of pairing self-management support with opioid
      deprescribing is lacking, however. This study will evaluate the outcomes of the combination
      of chronic pain self-management support with opioid deprescription, improve our understanding
      of the experiences and perspectives of patients and healthcare providers with this approach,
      and determine the characteristics of people on opioids in primary care to inform future
      research and implementation of this approach. If effective, this approach could be
      implemented more widely. The results of this study, therefore, have the potential to improve
      health outcomes for people taking opioid medications for chronic pain.
