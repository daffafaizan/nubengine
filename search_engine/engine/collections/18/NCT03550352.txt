    
      Adults with well-controlled HIV (viral load suppressed for at least 3 years on effective
      antiretrovirals) will be randomized to receive Tilray oral capsules containing THC and CBD in
      oil format in 2 different ratios of THC and CBD: CBD Low dose TN-TC11LM oral capsules (THC
      2.5 mg / CBD 2.5 mg) vs. High CBD dose TN-TC19LM oral capsules (THC 5 mg / CBD 45 mg).
      Participants will titrate up the number of capsules consumed based on their own individual
      tolerability, to a specified maximum daily dose, for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks.

      Participants will be assessed regularly via history and physical exam as well as through
      safety blood work monitoring (hematology and chemistry profiles, liver enzymes, renal
      function, HIV viral loads, CD4 and CD8 counts). Effect on mood and quality of life will be
      determined by WHO-QOL-HIV-BREF, EQ-5D and Profile of Mood States questionnaires. Blood work
      for immune activation and inflammatory profiles, as well as HIV reservoir, will also be drawn
      at regular intervals.

      This pilot study will provide information on feasibility (ie, time to recruitment of
      participants, whether participants continue the study for the full 12 week duration and
      complete the follow-up visits and questionnaires, whether treatment is safe and
      well-tolerated). It will also provide some preliminary data on the ability of TN-TC11LM and
      TN-TC19LM oral capsules to reduce inflammation and possibly influence HIV persistence.
