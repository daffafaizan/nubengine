    
      This blinded multicentre split body randomized controlled phase 2 trial aims to include 50
      patients â‰¥ 6 years old who have a primary CMLM without an underlying malformation.

      The CMLM will be divided into 2 equal areas of the same severity that will be randomly
      allocated to 0.1% topical sirolimus or topical vehicle for 12 weeks. During the double-blind
      12-week period, both topical products will be applied by a nurse to avoid inter-group
      contamination and for better compliance.

      At the end of the 12-week period, the patient/parent will treat the whole area of CMLM with
      0.1% topical sirolimus on remaining lesions, for 8 more weeks. Patients will also be seen at
      week 20 (treatment will be stopped) and at month 12 to evaluate long-term efficacy.
