      after initial external beam radiotherapy will undergo mpMRI for identification of the site of
      recurrence. A planning transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) will be obtained for fusion with the
      mpMRI and transposition of the target volume (GTV=gross tumor volume). A margin of 4.5 cm
      will be added to the GTV to create a focal planning target volume (PTV). The margin may be
      cropped at the interface with critical organs. Two fractions of HDR brachytherapy will be
      delivered, each from a single implant, 2 weeks apart. Following treatment patients will be
      monitored for toxicity and quality of life using the Expanded Prostate cancer Index (EPIC)
      questionnaire as well as the International Prostate Symptom score. Efficacy will be evaluated
      by monitoring the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and repeat mpMRI at 2 years.
