      learning and interobserver agreement, in order to establish if the method is reliable to use
      in further research about objective postpartum description of perineal tears.

      Methods: To educate the examiners, the method was shown and described by an experienced
      examiner. The examiners then measured the anovaginal distance in one woman repeatedly with
      until similar results (+/- 5 mm ) were achieved. The woman was in the lithotomy position and
      a vaginal ultrasound probe was used. The AVD in another 40 women was then measured and
      documented by two examiners, right after the other, who were blinded to the otherÂ´s results.
      The distance was measured between the mucosal margin of the internal anal sphincter and the
      vaginal probe. Interobserver agreement was calculated using Kappa-score.
