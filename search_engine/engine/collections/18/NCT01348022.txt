      of coronary stenting with the everolimus-eluting Xience V stent (EES) compared with the
      historical control (PRE-COMBAT-1) of bypass surgery and sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) for the
      treatment of an unprotected LMCA stenosis. The primary alternative hypothesis is that the
      experimental starategy (coronary stenting with the everolimus-eluting stents) is not inferior
      to the standard strategy (CABG) or SES.

      All consecutive patients with unprotected LMCA diseases at participating centers, who are
      treated with Xience V stent, will be evaluated for the entry into the study.
