    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, three arm study in adult men
      with biopsy confirmed NASH. The study is aimed at evaluating efficacy and tolerability of
      LPCN 1144 in adult men with NASH. The study will be conducted across multiple centers in the
      United States.

      Approximately 75 subjects will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following
      treatments:

        -  Treatment A: Oral LPCN 1144 Formulation A

        -  Treatment B: Oral LPCN 1144 Formulation B

        -  Treatment C: Oral matching placebo

      Subjects will undergo a screening period to determine study eligibility. As a part of
      screening, liver biopsies will be performed for subjects who have not had a liver biopsy
      within 6 months of Day 1, and fat fraction will be measured by MRI-PDFF in all subjects.
      Adult male subjects with histologic evidence of NASH will be enrolled into the study.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the three treatment arms. The treatment phase
      will be for a duration of 36-weeks with assessments of liver biopsies, hepatic fat fraction,
      liver enzymes, lipid levels and other safety parameters. Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed throughout the study.
