      defibrillators can be of great value. It allows implantable devices that have thus far been
      used exclusively for arrhythmia detection and treatment, to be used for diagnostic purposes
      in similar ways as the ECG. The advantage of the reconstruction process is that it provides
      real-time continuous monitoring, which can be used for multiple purposes, including but not
      limited to:

        1. Ischemia detection

        2. Myocardial Infarction detection

        3. Electrolyte abnormalities detection

        4. Assessment of effect of medications

        5. Improved rhythm discrimination
