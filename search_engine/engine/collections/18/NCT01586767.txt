      Proton Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. The subjects may also receive concurrent
      standard chemotherapy every week during their radiation therapy. This chemotherapy is
      considered standard treatment for their cancer and is not being done for research purposes.

      In addition to daily radiation treatments, subjects will have the following tests every week:
      review of side effects; physical exam, including weight, height, neurological exam and vital
      signs; and blood tests, only for those subjects also receiving chemotherapy.

      Subjects will be followed for 5 years after the completion of study treatment. The first
      follow-up visit will be 6-8 weeks after completion of study treatment. Additional follow-up
      visits will be performed every 3 months during the first 2 years following completion of
      radiation then every 6 month during years 3-5. At each follow-up visit, subjects will receive
      a physical exam, chest CT scan (at 1st follow-up visit then at least every 6 months), a CT or
      MRI tumor assessment (at 1st follow-up visit then at least every 6 months), quality-of-life
      questionnaire, hearing test, neuro-ophthalmology test, and neurocognitive test.
