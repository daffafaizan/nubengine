      stroke (IS). The purpose of this protocol will investigate the expression pattern of circular
      RNA (circRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) by next-generation
      sequencing in patients with acute ischemic stroke and healthy control. The candidate
      circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be verified as biomarkers for the detection and prognosis of acute
      ischemic stroke. Distinctive expression patterns of circRNA/miRNA/lncRNA will be identified
      by the next-generation sequencing and individual quantitative real time polymerase chain
      reaction (qRT-PCR). A diagnostic or predictive model will be established using logistic
      regression. The panel of these altered ncRNAs may be associated with acute IS and could serve
      as a novel diagnostic or predictive method.
