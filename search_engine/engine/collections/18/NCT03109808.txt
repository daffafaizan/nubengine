        -  First, a personalized video of the patient's oral hygiene routine (toothbrushing and
           interdental hygiene) is recorded and made available to him-her via a cloud-based system.
           The patient is instructed to view it with his-her smartphone and/or tablet when brushing
           his-her teeth.

        -  Second, the patient is registered in a text-based recall system. This recall system will
           remind him-her the oral hygiene regimen suited to his-her personal situation and
           contains a link to his cloud-hosted video. 12 text messages for each patient will be
           sent over the course of the study (8 weeks). This is a two-way system as patients will
           be inquired about their compliance to oral hygiene. If the patient declare compliance,
           he-she will be congratulated (positive reinforcement). If the patient declares
           non-compliance, he-she will be informed he-she will be offered additional counselling at
           the next appointment.
