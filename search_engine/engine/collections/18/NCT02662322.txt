      like peripherical intravenous catheterization (PIVC). However, suggestions for negative
      perceptual experiences causes more pain and anxiety. During This does not improve at all the
      real-life experience of the act. On the contrary, the use of gentler words improves pain
      perception and subjective patient experience. Furthermore, hypnosis has been demonstrated as
      efficient and the pain perception seems to be modulate by hypnotic suggestions.
