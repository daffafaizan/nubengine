      with docetaxel. Part 2 will test increasing doses of ASP9853 combined with paclitaxel. Each
      part will determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose for ASP9853 in
      combination with each taxane. Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of ASP9853 in
      combination with docetaxel or with paclitaxel also will be explored.
