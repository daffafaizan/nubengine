      shows that it has 85% homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45), but its
      genetic characteristics are similar to SARSr-CoV. There is a clear difference from MERSr-COV.
      Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province has successively found multiple cases of
      patients with pneumonia infected by a new type of coronavirus. With the spread of the
      epidemic, as of 12:00 on February 12, 2020, a total of 44726 confirmed cases nationwide
      (Hubei Province) 33,366 cases, accounting for 74.6%), with 1,114 deaths (1068 cases in Hubei
      Province), and a mortality rate of 2.49% (3.20% in Hubei Province).

      In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or
      treatment of lung injury caused by COVID-19 can be an alternative target for current
      treatment. Xiyanping injection has anti-inflammatory and immune regulation effects. In the
      early clinical practice of treating severe H1N1, it was clinically concerned, and combined
      with conventional treatment, and achieved good results.
