    
      This is a non-interventional, observational study with the primary objective to assess and
      describe "real world" patterns of care in the treatment of patients with unresectable or
      metastatic melanoma. A sample size of 1,600 prospective patients will provide sufficient
      information to explore this primary objective. There will be no forced number of patients
      enrolled into a specific treatment cohort. Setting or controlling specific treatment
      enrollment cohort counts would invalidate the results of the primary objective of the study.
      No primary hypothesis is being tested.
