      fibrosis of the skin, blood vessels, and visceral organs. The degree of skin involvement is a
      very important outcome measure in patients with this disease. The pathogenesis of SSc
      involves immunologic mechanisms, vascular damage, and excessive accumulation of extracellular
      matrix component in the skin. One reason for these changes is meant to be an increased
      release of endothelin-1, a peptide which has vasoconstrictor effects and possesses mitogenic
      activity on cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, cell types that are
      involved in SSc pathogenesis. Interestingly, endothelin-1 levels are raised in patients with
      SSc and RaynaudÂ´s disease, particularly, in the subset of patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc
      who have widespread dermal sclerosis. However, skin fibrosis in SSc is a poorly studied, rare
      condition for which there are no approved therapies. Bosentan is a dual endothelin receptor
      antagonist, that competes with the binding of endothelin-1 to both receptors (ET-A and AT-B).
      It was recently shown to be effective in the treatment of idiopathic as well as pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc, but it has also been proved in two multicenter randomized
      prospective placebo-controlled double-blind studies in Europe and the US (RAPIDS-1 and
      RAPIDS-2) that there is a beneficial effect of bosentan in preventing digital ulcers in these
      patients. Furthermore,it has been suggested that bosentan has also a positive effect on skin
      fibrosis. In this study, skin fibrosis will be measured using 20-MHz-ultrasound, the Rodnan
      Skin Score, and investigation of the fist closure of each patient during treatment with
      bosentan over 24 weeks.
