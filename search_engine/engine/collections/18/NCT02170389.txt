      I. To assess the immune-modulatory systemic and intratumoral effects of AGS-003 (renal cell
      carcinoma/cluster of differentiation [CD]40L ribonucleic acid [RNA]-transfected autologous
      dendritic cell vaccine AGS-003) as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with localized renal
      cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility that total tumor RNA processing-related activities meet
      specifications for AGS-003 manufacturing utilizing a core needle biopsy procedure for tumor
      harvesting prior to nephrectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 3 injections of renal cell carcinoma/cluster of CD40L RNA-transfected
      autologous dendritic cell vaccine AGS-003 intradermally (ID) once every 7 days during weeks
      6-8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo
      partial or radical nephrectomy on week 10.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
