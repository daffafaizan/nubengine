    
      -  Mammography, breast US, contrast-enhanced MRI, and DWI will be performed on the same day
           or within 1 month at baseline and then after 1 year, and images will be interpreted
           independently according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) by
           experienced radiologists.

        -  Each eligible woman, who provides informed consent for this study, will undergo
           mammography, breast US, contrast-enhanced MRI, and DWI at a 3T MR scanner.

        -  Contrast-enhanced breast MRI will be performed before and after a gadolinium-based
           contrast agent injection.

        -  Before contrast injection, DWI with b-value of 0, 800 and 1200 s/mm2 will be performed
           and will transfer into the server.

        -  A total of 890 high-risk women for breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.

        -  The BI-RADS 3 or higher is defined as test-positive. The reference standard will be a
           biopsy or at least 1 year of follow-up.
