      potentially be enrolled in this randomized controlled trial of LISA premedication. Written
      informed consent will be acquired from parents or legal guardians. After the consent, infants
      needing the LISA will receive premedication as follows: caffeine citrate according to the
      clinical routine at study site, and randomly, either ketamine or sublingual glucose 30%. This
      study is a pilot study and 60 patients that will be randomized 1:1. Ketamine will be given in
      slow intravenous injection over 60 seconds. Glucose 30% will be given sublingually in the
      volume of 1 mL. After two minutes (from the end of administration of the study drug or
      reference drug), laryngoscopy will be started. To assess the effectiveness of both types of
      sedation, patients will be assessed using two pain assessment scales - the COMFORT scale and
      the FANS scale. 10 minutes before the procedure, the first assessment in the COMFORT and FANS
      scales will take place. The next assessment on both scales will take place during the
      procedure.
