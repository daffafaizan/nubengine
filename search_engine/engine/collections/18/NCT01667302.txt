      chemotherapy is controversial. Some studies demonstrated the advantage of upfront
      radiotherapy. Therefore, we designed this single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of radiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with DICE regimen plus
      peg-asparaginase which was proved to be effective in NK/T-cell lymphoma.
