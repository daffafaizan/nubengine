      transplantation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      VentrAssist LVAD in providing circulatory support in individuals who are awaiting heart
      transplants.

      The VentrAssist LVAD is a centrifugal flow pump. Its small size and mechanical simplicity
      offers benefits not available with currently approved LVADs, including facilitating a more
      limited implantation procedure, which could reduce surgical morbidity and mortality.
