      administration of 2 mg buprenorphine/0.5 mg naloxone tablet(s) and/or an 8 mg
      buprenorphine/2.0 mg naloxone tablet(s). The starting dose on day 1 is 4 mg/1 mg BUP/NX with
      an additional 4 mg/1 mg, if needed, escalating in a step-wise manner to 16 mg/4 mg BUP/NX on
      day 3 and tapering to 2 mg/ 0.5 mg BUP/NX by days 12 to 13. Patients randomized to the
      clonidine arm will receive oral clonidine (0.05 to 0.1 mg depending upon weight) every 4 to 6
      hours for 24 hours not to exceed 0.6 mg total on day 1. On day 2, a clonidine transdermal
      patch will be applied (0.1 mg/day/7-day patch with number of patches adjusted by weight).
      Oral clonidine will continue to be given on the second day of detoxification and increased to
      0.2 mg every 6 hours or 0.1 mg every 3 hours not to exceed 0.8 mg over 24 hours. Patches will
      be worn all 13 days of detoxification. The dose of clonidine will be adjusted according to
      the proposed detoxification schedule, patient's weight, tolerance, and systolic blood
      pressure. Patients will receive counseling according to procedures in existence at each CTP
      throughout the study. Self-help detoxification handbooks will be distributed to all study
      participants.
