      I. To determine whether the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that are producing granzyme
      B (denoted pGrzB) as measured ~28-35 days after initiation of sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate)
      therapy correlates with overall survival, defined as the number of months between the start
      of sorafenib treatment and death from any cause.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether higher pGrzB levels will correlate with better sorafenib tolerance,
      manifested by fewer dose reductions, dose interruptions and adverse events.

      II. To determine whether improved immune function may also result in greater recognition of
      hepatitis viral antigens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days or after the 6 month time
      point if continuing sorafenib tosylate and then periodically thereafter.
