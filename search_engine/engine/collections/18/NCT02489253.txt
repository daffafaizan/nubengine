      500 in the UK. Previous Studies showed that risk of heart attack in these patients is at
      least 50% higher in men and 30% higher in women compared to the general population as they
      have high blood cholesterol since birth. We propose to develop a screening model based on
      non-invasive visualisation of the heart blood vessels (coronary arteries) by CT scan,
      ultrasound of the neck vessels (carotid arteries) and blood tests to access the extend of
      cholesterol deposit in the blood vessels in these patients. Participants with confirmed
      diagnosis of FH would be recruited from FH database registry at Royal Free Hospital. They
      would have a CT coronary angiogram, an ultrasound of carotid arteries and a blood test. The
      study is divided into overlapping stages of recruitment and data collection and data
      analysis. If CT scan shows more than 70% obstruction in their coronary arteries, they would
      be offered a coronary angiogram and an intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography for
      assessment of their blood vessel blockage.
