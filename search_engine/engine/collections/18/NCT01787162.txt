      pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD). MPD may cause PH
      through different mechanisms as: high cardiac output, asplenia, direct obstruction of
      pulmonary arteries by megakaryocytes, chronic thromboembolic endothelial pulmonary
      hypertension (CTEPH), porto-pulmonary hypertension (POPH). However, the exact prevalence of
      PH in this group of disorders is not known.

      This study is designed to identify the pulmonary vascular changes and describe the prevalence
      of pulmonary hypertension (defined in this study as mean pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (mPAP) ≥25mmHg as assessed by right-heart catheterization (RHC) or systolic pulmonary
      arterial pressure (sPAP) ≥37mmHg (2.9 m/s) assessed by echocardiography.
