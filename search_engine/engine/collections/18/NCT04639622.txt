        -  to improve characterization of symptomatic FTD patients or presymptomatic subjects at
           risk of genetic FTD

        -  to develop markers indicative of the optimal time to start disease-modifying therapy,
           based on the proximity to clinical onset.

        -  to develop markers of disease progression that can be used as outcome measures.

        -  to derive sample size estimates for clinical trials.

      Participants will include those affected with the disorder as well as at-risk members of
      families (both mutation carriers and non-carrier first-degree relatives who will serve as a
      control group).

      All participants will be assessed longitudinally with a set of clinical, neuropsychiatric,
      cognitive, imaging and biosample protocols.
