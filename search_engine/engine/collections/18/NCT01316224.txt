      significant portion (5%-40%) of participants with psoriasis develop PsA, a chronic
      inflammatory arthritis that causes progressive joint damage, reduced functionality and
      increased mortality risk. Skin disease typically manifests before arthritis in more than 80%
      of PsA participants, and psoriasis symptoms usually precede joint symptoms by an average of
      10 years. Participants with psoriasis who have comorbid PsA incur substantially increased
      cost of care and experience greater impairment of physical functioning and quality of life
      compared with participants with psoriasis alone.
