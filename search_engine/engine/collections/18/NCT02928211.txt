        -  Sapphire II Fluorescent Eye Measurements (Visits 1-3): Prior to first administration of
           ointment and then 24 +/- 2 hours, 28 +/- 30 minutes and 48 +/- 2 hours following first
           ointment administration

        -  Amyvid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Amyloid Scan (only required for MCI and mild
