      and management of miscarriage and can be painful for patients before and after the procedure.
      Most procedures are performed while the patient is awake or with minimal sedation in the
      clinic setting, and a key component of pain control is the paracervical block, or injecting
      lidocaine into the tissue around the cervix. A paracervical block with 20cc of 1% buffered
      lidocaine has been proven to provide superior pain control than a sham paracervical block.
      However, many providers often use similar doses of lidocaine in a higher volume to improve
      pain control. At University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and University of California, Los
      Angeles (UCLA), some providers routinely use a 20cc of 1% buffered lidocaine block and some
      routinely use a 40cc of 0.5% buffered lidocaine block. This practice has not been studied in
      a randomized controlled trial. The purpose of this study is to compare pain control during
      D&C with a 20cc 1% buffered lidocaine with vasopressin paracervical block compared to a 40cc
      0.5% buffered lidocaine with vasopressin paracervical block.

      An inclusion criterion for this study is that patients must specifically be referred to
      family planning clinics at UCSD and UCLA for an in-clinic D&C. Therefore, the D&C is a
      required procedure for both study groups. The only difference in care between the study
      groups will be which paracervical block they receive.
