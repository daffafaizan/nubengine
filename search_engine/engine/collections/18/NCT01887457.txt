      haematological malignancy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Voriconazole is routinely used as a first-line agent for the treatment of invasive
      aspergillosis, invasive fusariosis and scedosporiosis. Voriconazole has extreme
      pharmacokinetic variability. Adult patients with a trough concentration of < 1 mg/L have a
      lower probability of clinical response whereas patients with trough concentrations > 6 mg/L a
      higher probability of toxicity.

      Therapeutic drug monitoring for dose adjustment is advocated but there are no algorithms that
      enable voriconazole dosage to be reliably adjusted to achieve desired trough concentrations
      in a timely and optimally precise manner.

      Novel ways to deliver optimised antifungal therapy are urgently required and this trial will
      evaluate whether giving a patients a tailored dose of voriconazole is safe and effective.

      Plasma concentrations will be taken in real time and inputted in dose software that will
      calculate an optimum dose for the required trough concentration of 1-3 mg/L.

      The software has been developed using data from phase I and III trials of voriconazole.
