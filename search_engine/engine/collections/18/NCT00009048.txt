      serotonin 5-HT1A receptors on the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated
      motor response complications in patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease. In a
      controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of EMD 128130 will be assessed
      through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of
      frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
