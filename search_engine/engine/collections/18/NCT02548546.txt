    
      Patients with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, (AAA), will be identified within the vascular
      surgery practice. Those patients who meet standard indications for surgery including
      symptomatic AAA, size >5.0-5.5 cm, or rapidly enlarging >0.5 cm per 6 months will have
      standard pre-operative work-up which includes magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and
      Echocardiogram (ECHO). These pre-operative studies will be modified for the study patients to
      include electrocardiogram(ECG)-gating (coupled with MR angiogram) and 2-Dimensional
      speckle-tracking ultrasound of the abdominal aorta. Patients in the study will be followed
      for 1 year. Measurements will be analyzed for any relationship between aortic wall properties
      and clinical outcomes such as aneurysm growth, rupture risk or aortic dissection. This study
      will be comparing 3 groups of patients: no surgery (surveillance), open surgery, and
      endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).
