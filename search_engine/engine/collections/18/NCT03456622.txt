      adopting our products, and the Beyond Compliance Advisory Group, all of whom are looking to
      ensure the safe and stepwise introduction of new or modified implants to the market in the
      interest of patients.

      The G7 Acetabular Cup System is Biomet multi-bearing acetabular platform with a wide range of
      acetabular shell options recently launched. There is a need to provide evidence on the safety
      and performance of this cup to support the product in different markets.

      The purpose of this multicenter study is to assess the clinical performance of the G7
      acetabular system under standard condition of use. The data will help Biomet to gain 3A ODEP
      rating in 4 years and up to 10 year rating
