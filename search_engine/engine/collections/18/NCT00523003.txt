      body mass (LBM), this study was designed to determine effects of a protein- enriched meal
      replacement (MR) on weight loss and LBM retention by comparison to an isocaloric
      carbohydrate-enriched MR within customized diet plans utilizing MR to achieve high protein or
      standard protein intakes.

      Methods: Single blind, placebo-controlled, randomized outpatient weight loss trial in 100
      obese men and women comparing two isocaloric meal plans utilizing a standard MR to which was
      added supplementary protein or carbohydrate powder. MR were used twice daily (one meal, one
      snack). One additional meal was included in the meal plan designed to achieve individualized
      protein intakes of either 1) 2.2 g protein/kg of LBM per day [high protein diet (HP)] or 2)
      1.1 g protein/kg LBM/day standard protein diet (SP). LBM was determined using bioelectrical
      impedance analysis (BIA). Body weight, body composition, and lipid profiles were measured at
      baseline and 12 weeks.
