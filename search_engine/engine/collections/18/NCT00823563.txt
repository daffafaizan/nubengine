      coronary arteries on angiography, which ultimately imparts a significant morbidity/mortality
      and economic burden. Recent evidence suggests that women commonly have endothelial and
      microcirculatory dysfunction, as well as diffusely distributed atherosclerosis--disorders
      that can cause chest pain, but will not be seen on angiography. This presents an intriguing
      basis for pathophysiologic differences between women and men, but there are no studies that
      actually compare the presence of such findings in women with that of men. The objective of
      this research project is to determine if the incidence of such pathophysiologic differences
      is truly higher in women than it is in men.

      We hope to determine if there is a higher incidence of diffuse atherosclerotic plaque,
      endothelial dysfunction, and/or microcirculatory dysfunction in women compared with men. If
      this sex difference exists, it has significant implications for how we should be testing and
      treating women with chest pain but angiographically normal coronary arteries.
