      attention to the common effect after called phantom limb amputation. That term refers to the
      phenomena covering the sensations that occur in the affected limb and whose prevalence rate
      is an important part of amputees subjects. Developed theories about their origin focus their
      attention on the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. Thus, the
      imaginary movement is a complex cognitive, sensory and proprioceptive process leading to a
      mental representation of movement and it is a widely used technique in neurological
      rehabilitation and complex pain syndrome.
