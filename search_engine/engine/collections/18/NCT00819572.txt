      been identified as a major pro-inflammatory component inducing and perpetuating peripheral
      hyperalgesia and cartilage degeneration in various preclinical studies. DLX105 is an antibody
      fragment of comparably low molecular weight, associated with an exceptional local
      biodistribution pattern upon intra-articular injection. In addition, due to its short
      systemic half life as compared to conventional monoclonal antibodies, systemic exposure to
      DLX105 upon intra-articular administration is low. This study is designed to determine the
      safety and local tolerability profile of single intra-articular injections of ESBA105 as well
      as to define DLX105's effect size and effect duration in reducing pain of patients suffering
      from severely painful osteoarthritis of the knee. The study will be conducted in two
      sequential parts. In a first part, 4 different doses of DLX105 will be compared in a
      sequential, escalating scheme against placebo treatment in a total of 24 patients. In the
      second part of the study, two doses of DLX105 chosen based on safety data from the first part
      will be compared to placebo treatment in a total of 102 patients.
