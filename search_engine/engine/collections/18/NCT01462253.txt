    
      The proposed treatment schedule consists of a combination of Clofarabine plus
      Cyclophosphamide administered over 5 consecutive days (Treatment scheme). This is an open,
      nonrandomized prospective phase II trial aimed to evaluating (1) activity of this combination
      in terms of CR rate.

        -  STEP 1. All eligible patients will be screened for the availability of an HLA-matched or
           partially mismatched compatible HSCT donor, of both family related - or unrelated type
           (early activation required), including cord blood and haploidentical siblings. Moreover,
           pre-treatment investigation will include collection and storage of patient ALL cells for
           specific biological studies relating to sensitivity and response to study
           chemotherapeutic combination.

        -  STEP 2. Cycle 1 will be applied to all eligible patients once all enrollment criteria
           are confirmed.

        -  STEP 3. After cycle 1, response will be evaluated.

        -  STEP 4. After remission induction cycle 1, only responsive patients (CR or PR, see below
           for definitions) could be given cycle 2, according to the opinion of the responsible
           physician and with a minimum intercycle interval of 4 weeks from day 1 of cycle 1. All
           NR patients will be declared off study and will not be given a second course with study
           combination. The suggested treatment following cycle 2 (or cycle 1 if cycle 2 is
           omitted) is HSCT.
