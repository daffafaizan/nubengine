      standard clinical care is conducted after injection of intravenous contrast agent.

      The study population will include those patients already undergoing endoscopic ultrasound for
      standard pancreatic indications at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The primary procedures will
      include conventional EUS to evaluate a pancreatic lesion as part of standard of care, IV
      contrast agent during the procedure if deemed necessary by the investigator, collection of
      time intensity curves for pancreas and lesions from the EUS processor. The study includes one
      standard of care visit for EUS, and the enrollment period will be 24 months. All enrolled
      patients will be followed by chart review or phone call for a period of 12 months.

      All of the subjects will be undergoing an EUS for standard of care. These patients will also
      receive an IV contrast agent (Lumason) during the procedure, which is not part of standard of
      care, and is for research use only. FNA will be performed only on those patients deemed to
      require FNA based solely on the standard EUS.

      If the aims of the study are achieved, it ill confirm that contrast-enhanced EUS can be used
      to differentiate various pancreatic lesions and, in future, may aid in risk-stratification of
      precursor lesions for pancreatic cancer.
