        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of sirolimus in patients with glioblastoma
           multiforme.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival and
           objective response, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral sirolimus for 5-7 days before surgery. Patients then
           undergo surgical resection. Patients resume oral sirolimus once daily after full
           recovery from surgery. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sirolimus until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive oral sirolimus as in phase I at the dose determined in that
           phase.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-12 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study within
      3-12 months. A total of 32 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study.
