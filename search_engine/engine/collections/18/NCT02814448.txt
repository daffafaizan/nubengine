      thermocoagulator provide a non-inferior depth of cervical tissue necrosis compared with
      traditional CO2-based cryotherapy and to test single versus double freeze applications. The
      secondary objectives of the study are to determine if the CryoPen® or thermocoagulator
      achieves a depth of necrosis of 3.5 mm, the accepted depth required for eradicating 95% of
      cervical precancer, and to observe the relationship between depth of necrosis and variations
      in cervical anatomy.
