    
      The aim of this study will be to investigate the effects of using physical therapy resources
      in the postoperative morbidly obese individuals undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric by-pass with
      regard to: lung volumes and capacities, prevalence of atelectasis, thoracoabdominal mobility
      and evaluation of peak flow of cough, evaluated pre and post operative.

      Individuals with BMI between 40 and 55 Kg/m², aged between 25 and 55 years, underwent the
      surgical procedure Roux-en-Y type gastric by-pass by laparotomy and normal preoperative
      pulmonary function will be included.

      The volunteers will be divided into seven different groups, according to the treatment
      received during hospitalization after surgery:

      G control: subjects treated with conventional physiotherapy according to the routine service
      of physiotherapy of the hospital; G Voldyne: subjects treated with incentive spirometry,
      Voldyne Model 5000® (Sherwood Medical, USA); G CPAP: subjects treated with "continuous
      positive airway pressure"; G EPAP: subjects treated with "expiratory positive airway
      pressure"; G IPPB: subjects treated with "intermittent positive pressure breathing"; G BIPAP:
      subjects treated with "bi-level positive airway pressure"; G BS: subjects treated with
      "breath stacking" (siliconized mask connected to a unidirectional valve allowing only
      inspiration).

      The application of resources will be held twice a day in the immediate and in the first
      postoperative sessions in 6 sets of 15 reps or 30 continuous minutes, with an interval of 4
      hours between sessions. The researcher will remain alongside the volunteers, following them
      and monitoring vital signs and respiratory comfort.
