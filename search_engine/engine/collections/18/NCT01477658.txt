    
      This is a prospective cohort study that will include patients younger than 18 years-old at
      initial pacemaker implantation due to advanced AVB.

      The design of the study will involve the following stages:

        1. Screening and enrollment: patients will be selected consecutively during ambulatory care
           at our Institution or by the database of the Surgical Unity of Cardiac Pacing;

        2. Clinical and laboratory evaluation: patient history, clinical evaluation, serum levels
           of neurohormonal and inflammatory biomarkers of heart failure, clinical and laboratory
           investigation of autoimmune rheumatic diseases, quality of life (SF-36, CHQ-PF50) and
           six-minute walk test;

        3. Evaluation of ventricular function and cardiac synchronicity: Tissue Doppler (TDI) and
           real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE);

        4. Follow-up: patients will be monitored during 24 months.

      The main end-points are:

        -  Clinical and functional changes (NYHA functional class)

        -  Heart failure hospitalization

        -  Quality of life

        -  Overall and cardiac mortality

        -  Cardiac resynchronization therapy and heart transplantation
