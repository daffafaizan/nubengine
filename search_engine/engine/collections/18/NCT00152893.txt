      will be supplemented for 16 weeks with either chromium nicotinate 400 ug/day or placebo and
      then crossover to the opposite treatment for another 16 weeks. Each soft gel capsule of
      chromium contains 200ug of chromium and patients will take 1 capsule twice a day or its
      placebo. Placebo contains di-calcium phosphate in a soft gel capsule and its appearance is
      similar to the chromium capsules.
