      I. To show that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) to the pancreas
      is effective at direct ablation of advanced or locally advanced and small volume metastatic
      pancreatic tumors in a multicenter setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the predictability of tumor necrosis as a function of delivered energy, based
      on pre-PDT contrast computed tomography (CT) scans.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the safety of chemotherapy given two days after PDT.

      QUARTERNARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Demonstrate that cancer biomarkers in pre- versus (vs.) post-PDT are surrogate markers of
      response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive verteporfin intravenously (IV) and after 60 minutes undergo EUS-guided PDT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, and at 3, 6, and 12
      months.
