      versions of the running poles. Preliminary results, after 3 months of testing, indicate the
      poles are safe and effective. Phase 2 will use improved versions of the poles, which are
      currently in development, with a group of around 125-150 subjects over a longer length of
      time (12 months). Changes in walking gait quality, balance, strength, body composition,
      exercise adherence, and subjective perceptions of wellness will be assessed before, during,
      and after the 12 month exercise session.
