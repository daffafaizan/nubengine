      that overall appear to cause return of proper immune function and regulation rather than a
      nonspecific immune suppression. PIF acts on both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune
      system in a dynamic, diverse and synergetic manner "per need". In the pregnancy setting, PIF
      maintains basal immunity required for embryo and maternal survival, and aids in tolerance for
      self by blocking activated T cells proliferation that would otherwise harm the embryo. The
      activity of PIF appears to have a dual complementary mode of action that is dependent on
      whether the immune system is in the basal or the stimulated immune state. The sPIF
      concentrations that were used are in the same range as those that are present in maternal
      circulation of viable pregnancy. sPIF targets three major intracellular proteins that pivotal
      in autoimmune control.
