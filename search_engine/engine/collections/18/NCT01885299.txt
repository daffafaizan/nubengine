    
      The Registry is designed to help SRS/SBRT (Stereotactic Radiosurgery/Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy) users to understand utilization of and key treatment outcomes for these
      treatment approaches. Some of the objectives include:

      Allow participants to record information about usage of SRS/SBRT in everyday practice,
      including patient characteristics and disease information, treatment plans and outcomes
      Provide participants with ready access to data for publication of their own experience and as
      a tool for establishing collaborations with other participating sites Facilitate quality
      improvement efforts for individual treatment providers Understand the effectiveness of
      different treatment plans for different types of lesions, diseases and treatments

      The Registry tracks select outcomes for each condition treated by SRS/SBRT (for example, PSA
      for prostate cancer); the Registry also provides individual participants the ability to add
      additional outcomes for each and any condition of specific interest to their institutions.

      The Registry is hosted by Vision Tree, Inc who is an independent vendor of electronic
      registries; they are responsible for HIPAA compliance, including all security mechanisms.

      Patients will be enrolled prospectively. Some retrospective patient data is likely to be
      included in order to capture both short and longer term outcomes data.
