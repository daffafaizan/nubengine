      hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH), usually by a pituitary tumor or hyperplasia. When it
      occurs prior to the complete fusion of growth plates, it leads to pathological tall stature,
      and it is called gigantism. After the fusion of the growth plates, it is called acromegaly.
      It may be associated with debilitating cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes. Children and
      adolescents with gigantism are currently treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and
      medications, such as octreotide, to reduce hypersecretion of GH; however, these treatments
      may lack efficacy and have significant side effects. Pegvisomant is a genetically engineered
      GH-receptor (GHR antagonist that blocks the action of GH. In adults with acromegaly,
      pegvisomant has been shown to effectively reduce serum insulin-likegrowth factor type 1
      (IGF-1) concentrations and lead to clinical improvement. However, experience in children and
      adolescents is limited to a small number of case series. We propose the initiation of a new
      protocol at the NICHD, NIH, to treat children and adolescents with GH excess that is
      refractory to surgical therapy and/or radiation therapy, or in children and adolescents where
      the above therapies are contraindicated.
