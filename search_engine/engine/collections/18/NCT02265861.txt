      the 3hs time point (p<0.05), while there is no difference with VEGF at all other time point
      among the four groups. As for AT-Ⅱ, before and after the ovary stimulation, at all time
      points, the AT-Ⅱ levels in serum of patients with different phenotypes of PCOS by Rotterdam
      criteria are all higher than the controls without PCOS. After the ovary stimulation, AT-Ⅱ in
      typical PCOS patients is obviously increased at 3hs time point, p<0.05. The response of VEGF
      and AT-Ⅱ to HCG in women with typical PCOS is higher in 24 hours after the stimulation during
      the early follicular phase. The response to the stimulation is different in patients with
      different phenotypes of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria. Serum VEGF and AT-Ⅱ levels as a possible
      contributor to a great risk of developing OHSS in patients with typical PCOS during the early
      follicular phase in 24 hours after the ovary stimulation.
