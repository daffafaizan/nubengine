      to a control group. Investigators will examine feasibility of participant recruitment,
      retention and adherence; fidelity of intervention delivery; and intervention materials.
      Investigators also aim to evaluate the acceptability and safety of a hatha and restorative
      yoga intervention compared to a control group. Investigators will examine the acceptability
      of intervention location and strategies, class format, enjoyment of sessions, and safety of
      the intervention. Finally, investigators aim to test feasibility and appropriateness of the
      targeted outcomes for subsequent trials. Expected outcomes will be properly measured, but no
      comparisons between intervention and control groups will be made.
