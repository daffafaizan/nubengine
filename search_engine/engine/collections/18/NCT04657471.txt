    
      In all participating Emergency Departments, patients with highly suspected or confirmed
      COVID-19 are evaluated for potential inclusion. Clinical, biological, and imaging data that
      may be involved in decision-making about hospitalization, including all criteria of the
      revised HOME-CoV score, are collected. The revised HOME-CoV score is calculated. Patients
      with a score <2 qualify for home treatment. They qualify otherwise for hospitalization. For
      patients with a score > 4, hospitalization in a unit allowing monitoring of vital parameters
      is recommended. The qualification for home treatment or for hospitalization can be overruled
      by the physician-in-charge in case of major medical or social reasons. A justification
      explaining the cause of overruling is required.

      A phone-call follow-up is performed on Day 7 and the patients' clinical status according to
      the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement of COVID-19 from the World Health Organization
      (WHO-OSCI) is collected.
