      diagnosis that largely relies on subjective patient report with no reliable objective
      biomarkers for diagnosis. Traditional clinical brain imaging has not been found useful for
      concussion as the pathology is generally not visible on conventional acute MRI or CT. The
      proposed study addresses this gap in concussion diagnosis and management by examining the
      sensitivity of magnetoencephalography (MEG) for identifying areas of brain injury through
      detection of abnormal neural activity (slowing) in adolescents with concussion compared to
      healthy controls. Adolescents with a concussion will complete neuroimaging (MEG and MRI) and
      neuropsychology assessments at two time points within ten days and then again 4 months
      post-injury. Healthy controls will complete neuroimaging and neuropsychology assessments at a
      single time point.
