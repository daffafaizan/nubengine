    
      DESIGN / PHASE Prospective, single-center, randomized, parallel group, controlled, phase II
      study.

      PATIENTS / GROUPS 40 patients in 2 groups 20 patients per group Randomization ratio 1:1, no
      stratification

      INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG Oral MED 1: Certican® initial dose: 1,5-3 mg day target trough level:
      3-8 ng/mL (first levels will be performed after 3 days and then adjusted until - according to
      the judgment of the clinical investigator - a stable degree of immunosuppression is reached;
      thereafter Certican® trough levels will be performed at the scheduled appointments)

      COMPARATIVE DRUG No therapy (add-on design

      CONCOMITANT MEDICATION Allowed The concomitant immunosuppressive medication will be adjusted
      to the additional administration of Certican®. For example, if the patient already receives
      cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, this will be adjusted, according to the current
      recommendations4 at the judgment of the clinical investigator

      TOLERABILITY / SAFETY ENDPOINTS:

      Rejection Hematocrit Platelet count WBC count Wound healing disorders Blood lipids
      (cholesterol, triglycerides) Infections (other than CMV)

      PHARMACOKINETIC / PHARMACODYNAMIC ENDPOINTS Certican® (everolimus) trough levels

      STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY Primary Endpoint: CMV-load (copies/mL)

      Null and alternative hypotheses:

      H0 Treatment with Certican® (everolimus) in combination with valcyte® (valganciclovir) or
      cymevene® (ganciclovir) is equal to valcyte® (valganciclovir) or cymevene® (ganciclovir)
      alone in reducing the CMV-load in renal transplant patients with CMV-disease H1: Treatment
      with Certican® (everolimus) in combination with valcyte® (valganciclovir) or cymevene®
      (ganciclovir) is superior to valcyte® (valganciclovir) or cymevene® (ganciclovir) in reducing
      CMV load (copies/mL) in renal transplant patients with CMV-disease Type-I and -II errors -
      power. α=0.05 ß=0.2 (power 0.8) Statistical methodology ANOVA of repeated measures
      (CMV-copies/mL), one-sided t-test of CMV load at distinct time-points, one-sided t-test of
      the time (in weeks) until CMV-load reaches ≤600 copies/mL Sample size calculation Based on a
      one-sided testing and a σ of 0.2 in relative changes of CMV-copies, an α=0.05 And a ß=0.2 a
      sample size of 20 patients per group was determined. Main analysis set Per-protocol
      (efficacy) and intention to treat (ITT) for safety Other endpoints Bonferroni corrected
      t-tests will be performed for CMV-copies/mL at each time point of the follow-up period. The
      time to copies ≤ 600 will also be analyzed by a t-test. All other secondary endpoints and
      subgroup analysis will be performed in explorative intention (descriptive statistics).
