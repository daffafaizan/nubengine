      clinicians find them difficult to implement in older people, particularly those with medical
      illnesses or disability. As a consequence evidence-based psychotherapies are utilized by a
      small number of specialized clinicians and offered to small number of select patients.

      ENGAGE approaches these problems with a four prong strategy: 1) It developed a brief
      treatment program consisting of psychotherapeutic components of known efficacy. 2) Among
      them, ENGAGE selected components most pertinent to older adults. 3) ENGAGE distilled and
      simplified these components so that they can be accessible to most depressed older patients
      and taught to large numbers of clinicians. 4) To further simplify and personalize its
      administration, ENGAGE relies on a stepped approach focusing on engagement in rewarding
      social and physical activities (a form of behavioral activation), and when needed, adding
      techniques for management of emotionality (emotional control), negativity bias, and apathy.
      The self-correcting and least restrictive nature of stepped care approaches has appeal from
      patient cost/time efficiency and personalized treatment perspective. This project aims to
      further develop ENGAGE, to study the feasibility of training professionals (master's level
      social workers) offering care to depressed elderly patients in the community, to obtain
      preliminary data of its efficacy compared to community-based therapy (CT), and to prepare for
      an effectiveness (R01) study.
