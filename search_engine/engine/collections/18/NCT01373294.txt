      of age or older throughout the United States for this study.

      This is a multi-center study combining two marketed drugs, one of which has not been used
      previously in people with transitional cell cancer. Lenalidomide (RevlimidÂ®) is a drug that
      alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels
      that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of
      cancer cells. Lenalidomide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with
      dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior
      therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. Lenalidomide is currently being tested in a
      variety of cancer conditions. It is not approved by the FDA for use in people with bladder
      cancer, so in this case it is considered experimental.

      The other drug used in this study is Bacille Calmette-Guerrin (BCG). BCG is approved by the
      FDA for use in people with bladder cancer.
