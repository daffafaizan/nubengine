      Systemic chemotherapy has contributed to the only choice for more than 50% NSCLC patients.
      The genetic abnormalities lead to different therapy response to the same chemotherapy scheme
      in NSCLC patients. At present, early assessment and prediction is the key for optimize NSCLC
      therapy. 18F-FDG PET/CT is a noninvasive cell metabolism reaction molecular imaging
      technology which can assess cancer glucose metabolism sensitively and react cancer
      proliferation to some degree. Hence 18F-FDG PET/CT may be used to assess NSCLC therapy
      response noninvasively. It is a reliable method to individualize NSCLC treatment clinically
      by define the appropriate metabolism response cut-off values and assess time points of
      18F-FDG PET/CT in predicting different genetic NSCLC patients.The subject is going to use
      18F-FDG PET/CT to assess different genetic NSCLC metabolism after cisplatin chemotherapy and
      targeted therapy, define the assessment criteria for the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in NSCLC
      treatment respone and at last build multi-centre clinical trial platform of molecular
      classification and molecular imaging for cancer chemotherapy assessment.
