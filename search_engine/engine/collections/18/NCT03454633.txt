      bloodless and still operative field. But the side effect of hypothermia also draws people's
      concern. With the development of surgical techniques and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
      management, the temperature of HCA has been raised from deep hypothermia (14.1-20 degree) to
      moderate hypothermia (20.1-28 degree), and it has been a primary choice for many surgeons
      around the world. Some of surgeons still tried to push the limit and started using mild
      hypothermia (28.1-34 degree), and satisfactory outcome was obtained. However, the optimal
      temperature of HCA has not yet been determined.

      In this randomized controlled study, 80 informed and consenting patients who are scheduled
      for total arch replacement with concomitant proximal aortic reconstruction will be randomized
      to mild (28.1-34 degree) or moderate (20.1-28 degree) hypothermia during circulatory arrest.
      Clinical outcomes of both groups will be analyzed to determine the optimal temperature for
      HCA.
