      a stable baseline is established, but not less than 2, 4, and 6 weeks for patients
      respectively), weekly during treatment, and at post-treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) will be competed at pre-baseline, pre-treatment, and post-treatment. Treatment will
      entail daily (5 days/week) sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation using the
      Neurostar Therapy System for 6 weeks employing right-sided, low frequency stimulation (1 Hz,
      900 pulses/session for 30 sessions, 27,000 total pulses, intensity at 90% of the passive
      motor threshold) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Neuronavigation will direct
      coil placement over the DLPFC based upon structural MRI.
