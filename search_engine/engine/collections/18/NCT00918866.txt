      hemodynamic effects caused by the administration of DEFINITY速 in patients who are to undergo
      right heart cardiac catheterization for clinical reasons. Using a right heart catheter for
      direct measurements of pulmonary artery hemodynamics will allow accurate assessments of
      potential alterations of the pulmonary vasculature. This will be further investigated by the
      inclusion of two patient populations, one with a baseline pulmonary artery pressure < 35
      mmHg, and one with elevated baseline pulmonary artery pressure. The addition of immune
      parameter measurements will assess a potential link between systemic and pulmonary
      alterations and potential immune reactions following DEFINITY速 administration.

      The inclusion of patients in this study is not based on a required echocardiogram with
      DEFINITY速 administration because patients would be exposed to an unjustifiable risk of
      invasive right heart catheterization and are unlikely to consent to such a procedure.
      Therefore, patients undergoing heart catheterization for clinical reasons, or patients who
      are undergoing pulmonary artery hemodynamic assessments will be enrolled and receive
      DEFINITY速 in this study.
