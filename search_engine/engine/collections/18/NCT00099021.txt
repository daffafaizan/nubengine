      I. Determine whether pioglitazone (pioglitazone hydrochloride) reverses leukoplakia in
      patients with hyperplastic or dysplastic oral cavity or oropharyngeal leukoplakia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the development of carcinoma.
