      in middle-aged adults and examine the modulating influences of carotid atherosclerosis. The
      specific aims will be accomplished in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by examining
      cognitive test performance and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to a working
      memory task in middle-aged and older adults and participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment
      pre- and post- six-week long intervention of LLLT or placebo. In addition, the investigators
      will examine if carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) moderates the therapeutic effects
      of LLLT.
