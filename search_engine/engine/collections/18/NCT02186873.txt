    
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) study of
      golimumab compared with placebo in participants with active ankylosing spondylitis. The study
      comprises of 4 phases: Screening phase (up to 6 weeks), Double-blind placebo-controlled phase
      (Week 0 to Week 16), Active treatment phase (Week 16 to Week 52), and Safety follow-up phase
      (8 weeks from last study drug administration). Total duration of the study will be 60 weeks
      per participant. Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned to either Treatment group 1:
      Placebo or Treatment group 2: Golimumab. Participants randomized to Placebo group, will
      receive intravenous infusions of placebo at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. At Week 16, all participants
      receiving placebo will begin receiving intravenous infusions of golimumab (2 mg/kg) at Weeks
      16, 20 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52. Participants randomized to Golimumab
      group, will receive intravenous infusions of golimumab 2 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 4 and thereafter
      every 8 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 16, participants randomized to golimumab group will
      receive a placebo infusion to maintain the blind. The efficacy will be assessed primarily by
      measuring percentage of participants who achieve a 20 percent improvement from baseline in
      the assessment in ankylosing spondylitis (ASAS) at Week 16. Participant's safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
