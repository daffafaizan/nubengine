      hearing impaired patients in the ED setting will improve in-ED understanding and preparation
      for discharge. The proposed intervention, the Hearing Impairment, Strategies and Outcomes in
      VA Emergency Departments (HearVA-ED) will be conducted in the Emergency Departments of the
      Manhattan and Brooklyn VAs of the New York Harbor Healthcare System and will recruit hearing
      impaired ED patients who are 60 years and older and have been admitted to the ED with a low
      acuity triage score indicating a high likelihood of discharge home. The investigators will
      identify hearing impairment by using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly survey
      (HHIE-S). The investigators will randomize consenting patients who fail the screening to
      either receipt of a simple hearing assistance device (a "PockeTalkerTM") during their ED stay
      or usual care. The investigators will test whether the provision of a PockeTalkerTM is
      feasible in this environment (by measuring the amount of device use), whether providing the
      device improves self-reported quality of hearing and understanding during the ED stay, and
      whether use of the device improves the quality of preparation for post-discharge care. If
      this randomized controlled trial demonstrates beneficial effects for in-ED use of a simple
      hearing assistance device for hearing impaired patients, this strategy can be disseminated
      throughout the VA healthcare system.
