      used in recent studies comparing the efficacy of various visual aids. It has the benefit that
      it is quick and easy to perform, does not need expensive equipment, and can be completed
      without unnecessary radiation or fluorescence (Ismail, et al., 2007). In the current study,
      ICDAS-II was set as "gold standard" due to validated relationship between its codes and the
      histological depth of a carious lesion as in many other studies. In addition, several studies
      have shown good reproducibility and accuracy of ICDAS-II for caries detection in permanent
      teeth especially caries lesions in the outer half of the enamel (Gugnani, et al., 2010).
      Bitewing radiographs are used to determine the depth of caries involvement. Most often,
      bitewing examination is affiliated with the diagnosis of interproximal caries. It is strongly
      recommended that these radiographs be used in the diagnosis of occlusal caries into dentin
      (Pitts NB et al., 1991).
