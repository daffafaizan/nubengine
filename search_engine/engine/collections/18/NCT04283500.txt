      administered, has the potential to mitigate barriers to treatment initiation. ED providers
      can treat patients with BUP for opioid withdrawal since DEA registration (X-waiver) is not
      required unless they wish to issue a prescription. Current BUP induction protocols, developed
      for inpatient and ambulatory care settings as well as for unobserved self- administration via
      prescription, usually recommend a first day dose of 8mg given in divided doses of 2- 4mg.
      However, patients discharged with â‰¤ 8mg SL total dose may experience return of withdrawal
      symptoms and/or opioid craving within only 4 hours.Treatment with a loading dose of 32mg in
      the ED may provide the necessary bridge treatment, relieving symptoms of withdrawal until a
      patient is able to attend a follow up appointment for further treatment.
