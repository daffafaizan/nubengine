      ED patients requesting or requiring HIV testing are referred to C&T sites that are usually
      available only during regular business hours. Patient compliance with these referrals has
      been disappointing.

      To improve ED access to HIV testing, we developed a video alternative to in-person pre-test
      counseling to provide the fundamental elements of the counseling. The video was based on the
      educational elements required by the New York State Department of Health (DOH) for HIV
      pre-test counseling. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the educational video
      performed as well as live counselors in conveying the information needed for inner city ED
      patients to consent to HIV testing. The present study was designed to compare HIV testing
      rates in ED patients offered video-assisted informed consent for HIV testing versus the
      standard referral for live C&T the next business day.
