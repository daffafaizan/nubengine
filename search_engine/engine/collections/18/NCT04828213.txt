      expansion (RME) on soft tissue with stereophotogrammetry. Methods: 32 patients (15 males, 17
      females) who met inclusion criteria were divided into two groups. In the first group,
      tooth-borne RME appliance (Hyrax) was applied to 16 patients (9 males, 7 females mean age
      13.4 ± 1.3 years) and in the second group, tooth-bone-borne RME appliance (Hybrid Hyrax) was
      applied to 16 patients (6 males, 10 females mean age 13.05 ±1.24 years). A simple
      electronically generated randomization was performed before trial commencement using the
      Random Allocation Software program. Allocation concealment involved numbered, sealed, and
      opaque envelopes prepared before trial commencement. One envelope was sequentially opened for
      each participant during recruitment. Each envelope contained a card with the name of 1
      expander. The initials of the name of the participant, the type of expander, and the date of
      allocation were identified in the external surface of the envelope. One operator was
      responsible for the randomization process, allocation concealment, and implementation. The
      primary outcomes of this study was assessment of changes in soft tissues before RME (T0) and
      post-retention (T1) period by stereophotogrammetry. Independent and dependent sample t tests
      were used to compare intra- and inter-group differences at P<0.05 significance level.
