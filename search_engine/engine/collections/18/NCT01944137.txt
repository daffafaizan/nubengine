    
      -  Participants with NSCLC, CRC or breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant
           chemotherapy will be asked to fill out self-report questionnaires at their first
           chemotherapy administration visit, in order to measure patient-reported symptoms,
           psychological distress, and satisfaction with oncology care.

        -  Participants will then be randomized into one of the two study groups: standard care
           with proactive phone calls from nurse practitioners or standard care alone.

        -  Participants assigned to the standard care group will be treated by their care team as
           would any other cancer patient.

        -  Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive four proactive phone calls
           from nurse practitioners designed to discuss symptom burden and management. Proactive
           phone calls will occur 2-4 days after chemotherapy administration and 5-7 days after
           chemotherapy administration, during cycles 1 and 2.

        -  Participants will be asked to fill out the same set of questionnaires during their
           second and third chemotherapy administration visits, to assess patient-reported
           symptoms, psychological distress, and satisfaction with oncology care.

        -  Medical records will be reviewed at 24-weeks following the first chemotherapy
           administration visit, to evaluate frequency of urgent outpatient cancer center visits,
           emergency department visits, and hospital admissions that occurred during the study
           period.
