      Same day combination therapy with PDT, 500 microgram dose (0.05cc) intravitreal dexamethasone
      injection (10mg/ml vial), and a single 0.5 mg intravitreal Ranibizumab injection. This will
      be compared to Group 2 monotherapy: one intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg Lucentis given every
      four weeks on a set dosing schedule. Sixty consecutive patients will be enrolled into this
      clinical trial utilizing the current standard of care guidelines as used at Bay Area Retina
      Associates. Angiography, fundus photography will be performed at the initial visit and
      quarterly follow-up visits. Only OCT testing will be performed at all other follow-up visits.
      Both groups will be re-evaluated for safety at 12 and 24 months.

      Group 1 Following the initial treatment, all future re-treatments with Lucentis will be
      determined on a PRN basis. The decision will be based on clinical examination and imaging
      evidence of lesion activity. Any evidence of subretinal fluid or cystoid edema on OCT or
      clinical examination, or evidence of leakage on angiogram will result in re-treatment. If
      after three consecutive Ranibizumab injections in Group 1, there is any evidence of lesion
      recurrence or growth of the neovascular membrane associated with visual decline or persistent
      subretinal fluid, the patient will be treated with repeat PDT/IVD/Lucentis The decision to
      retreat Group 1 with ranibizumab at each monthly follow-up visit will be dependent on
      clinical exam, OCT measurements or angiographic findings as documented below.

      Group 2 Subjects will receive one intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg Lucentis every four weeks
      until week 48 or as indicated on the FDA approval label.
