    
      Rationale: Current treatment strategies for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD, have
      focused on lifestyle management through a combination of diet and exercise but there are no
      recommendations for dietary changes that have been proven superior to others. Preliminary
      data showing an improvement in liver enzymes and fibrosis in mice has demonstrated a novel
      use of rebaudioside, the non-caloric sweetener (NCS) Stevia leaf's extract, potentially
      identifying this NCS as a therapeutic intervention where currently there are no targeted
      treatments.

      Intervention: All participants will receive standard of care for diet and nutrition.
      Additionally, participants will be randomized to one of four 8-week liquid diet
      interventions:

        1. Standard of Care

        2. Water Delivery

        3. Water with Rebaudioside (Stevia Natural Sweetener)

      Objectives and Purpose: To determine whether rebaudioside consumption can be used as a
      treatment for adolescents with NAFLD by demonstrating a decrease in ALT levels.
