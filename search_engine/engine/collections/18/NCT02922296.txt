      anemia; hemoglobin SS) or to compound heterozygous forms like hemoglobin SC disease and
      hemoglobin S-Î² thalassemia. Past studies suggested a low prevalence of diabetes in patients
      with SCD.10 Improvements in treatment and care have increased the life span of patients.
      This, along with the wide availability of high calorie diets and increasing adiposity in SCD
      raises that possibility that the prevalence of diabetes is increasing in SCD. Our study is
      designed to characterize the changes in metabolism that occur in sickle cell disease and to
      identify clinical, genetic and genomic risk factors for the development of diabetes. Our
      hypothesis is that non-overweight subjects with SCD have relative protection from diabetes
      and metabolic syndrome, but that those individuals who do become overweight have a dramatic
      increase in the rates of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Lean SCD subjects will not have
      simply a neutral, but an overtly anti-diabetic phenotype (e.g. better glucose tolerance and
      lower metabolic syndrome markers). The two main study aims are as follows; Aim 1. Define the
      metabolic status of adult SCD subjects according to normal or increased BMI.

      Aim 2. Determine genetic and genomic predictors of overweight, metabolic syndrome and
      diabetes in SCD subjects.
