      exposure-based treatment for perfectionism (ETP). Individuals with elevated perfectionism
      will be randomly assigned to ETP or a waitlist (WL) control condition. ETP will consist of
      three tasks in which they will repeatedly make mistakes, repeated for five sessions over a
      two-week period (one session every 3 days).
