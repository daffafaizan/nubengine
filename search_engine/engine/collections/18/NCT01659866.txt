    
      This study is a prospective, nonrandomized trial evaluating the efficacy of directed
      antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSP)
      compared with ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, the current standard of care. Northwestern
      University will be the lead site. After signing informed consent, study participants will
      complete a pre-biopsy questionnaire to record demographics and assess for known risk factors
      for infection and will have a rectal swab obtained. Patients whose swabs indicate
      colonization with ciprofloxacin-susceptible gram-negative bacteria (CS-GNB) will receive
      ciprofloxacin as pre-procedure prophylaxis and those whose swabs indicate colonization with
      ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) will receive pre-procedure
      antimicrobial prophylaxis based on study protocol.

      All patients will be contacted by phone twice after their biopsies, at approximately 7 and 30
      days, to detail post-procedure infectious complications including fever, urinary tract
      infection, bacteremia and sepsis. Subjects who experience infections will have additional
      information regarding the infectious complications and cost of therapy abstracted from their
      medical record. The TRUSP results will also be recorded. Bacterial isolates from the rectal
      swabs will be archived.
