    
      The over-arching goal of this study is to develop a portable model for ED cancer treatment
      guidelines and management using evidence based protocols in a population at high risk for
      poor cancer -related outcomes by identifying & overcoming specific barriers to enhanced
      survivorship. Based on the demographics of ED population (currently, 70% racial/ethnic
      minorities), the majority of participants will be underrepresented (African-American and
      Hispanic) and low-income individuals. The investigators propose a feasibility study of 150
      patients in the ED over a 1 year period.

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of ED Risk-Stratified, Evidence-Based Treatment protocols
      on the primary outcome of ED utilization rates and subsequent acute inpatient admissions at 6
      -months post-intervention.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of an ED-based Cancer Patient Navigator on the secondary
      outcomes of patient engagement and primary care engagement at 6 -months post-intervention.

      Aim 3: Examine barriers and facilitators to compliance for cancer survivorship
      recommendations that occur in an ED setting at 6-months post intervention.
