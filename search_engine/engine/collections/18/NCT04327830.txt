      collaborate with and support patients in decision-making. Older adults receiving home care
      need support with decision-making (e.g., information on risks and benefits of options). This
      study will explore what older adults and their caregivers need for making better
      health-related decisions at home, and what health and social care providers need for
      supporting their home care clients with decision-making.

      Methods and analysis This two-phase sequential exploratory mixed methods study will be
      conducted in a pan-Canadian healthcare organization, St Elizabeth Health Care. First, the
      investigators will create a participant advisory group (one older adult, one caregiver and
      two care providers) to advise us throughout the research process. In Phase 1 (qualitative),
      the investigators will recruit a convenient sample of older adults and caregivers receiving
      home care to participate in open-ended semi-structured interviews to discuss what
      health-related decisions they face at home and what they need for making better decisions
      (e.g. types of knowledge, sources of support). In Phase 2 (quantitative), interdisciplinary
      health and social care providers (e.g., nurses, personal support workers, occupational
      therapists, physiotherapists) will be invited to answer an online survey to share their views
      on the decision-making needs of older adults and their caregivers. The survey will include
      close-ended questions informed by findings from the qualitative interviews in Phase 1.
      Finally, qualitative and quantitative results will be triangulated from the perspective of
      older adults, caregivers and health and social care providers. Results will be reported using
      EQUATOR guidelines.
