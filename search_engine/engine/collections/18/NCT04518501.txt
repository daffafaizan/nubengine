      Most patients have relapses, and responses to subsequent therapies are generally short-lived.
      Currently, the population that can benefit from PARPi is mainly focusing on BRCAm, then
      homologous-recombination deficiency patients. Limited data revealed the ORR was only 3-4% in
      homologous recombination proficiency patients with PARPi therapy. New treatments are urgently
      needed to improve patient outcomes.

      The investigators' studies have shown that combination therapy with Olaparib and Arsenic
      trioxide demonstrated a synergistic anti-tumor effect in BRCAness/HR-proficiency ovarian
      cancer cells:

      Firstly, CCK8 and clone formation assays showed that the combination of Olaparib and Arsenic
      trioxide produced notable tumor cell growth inhibition than either single agent in SKOV3 and
      CAOV3 cells.

      Further, the combination therapy resulted in significantly increased level of Î³-H2AX and
      decreased level of RAD51 by IF.The investigators also found that combination therapy could
      remarkably induced cell apoptosis, which is associated with induction of cleave-PARP and
      reduction of p-AKT, when compared with either single drug. (Data not published) Therefore,
      the investigators hypothesis is that for those relapsed patients who have received at least
      once platinum-based chemotherapy and who carried homologous-recombination proficiency,
      patients with combinate therapy will get 25% of ORR. And Olaparib in combination with Arsenic
      trioxide therapy is well tolerated.
