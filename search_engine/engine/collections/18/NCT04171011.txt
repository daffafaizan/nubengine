      decrease complications and improve recovery following esophagectomy. The current study is
      intended to evaluate the feasibility and safety of stimulating the exposed nerves in
      esophagectomy patients.

      During minimally invasive esophagectomy, a neurovascular bundle (NVB) is exposed or partially
      exposed as part of the obligatory lymph node dissection. At the point in the esophagectomy
      when the NVB is being isolated, a lead will be applied laparoscopically to the NVB and
      connected to an external pulse generator. An ultrasound transducer will be introduced to the
      abdomen and placed on the NVB to visualize splenic arterial blood flow. The NVB will be
      stimulated while physiologic responses are observed. Blood samples will be taken before, and
      at certain pre-defined time points after, stimulation and recovery. The lead and ultrasound
      transducer will be removed after completion of stimulation, and the esophagectomy surgery
      will continue. Surgeon experience applying and removing the cuff electrode will be
      documented, in addition to the responses to NVB stimulation. Post-operative safety will be
      followed through 7-days (or day of discharge if earlier).
