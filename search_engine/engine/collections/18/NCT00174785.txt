    
      This is a prospective, multinational, double-blind, randomized, multi-center,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial evaluating the effects of dronedarone versus placebo
      (ratio 1:1) over a minimum treatment duration of 12 months and a mean follow-up duration of
      1.75 years (in AF/AFL patients). Patients can be included in the study while in atrial
      fibrillation/flutter or in sinus rhythm if conversion has occurred either spontaneously or
      following a procedure such as electrical cardioversion (or overdrive pacing) or
      administration of an antiarrhythmic drug.After randomization all patients will be followed
      until the common study end date; the last patient included in the study will be followed for
      1 year. Visits will be at baseline, after 7 days, after 14 days, after one month, after three
      months and then every three months until end of the study. At each visit patients will be
      asked for the occurrence of hospitalizations or other events since the last visit. The study
      will be monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for safety, tolerability
      and efficacy.
