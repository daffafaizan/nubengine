      activity. We hypothesize that subtle differences in different molecules of innate immunity
      may contribute to either the predisposition or clinical course of infection with
      Blastomycosis Dermatitidis. To test this hypothesis, we propose to analyze the allelic
      frequencies of 15 different genes (mannose binding lectin, Fc-gamma receptor Ila and IIb,
      Fc-gamma receptors IIIa and IIIb, myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta,
      interleukin 1A and 1B, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-10, NRAMP-1,
      chitotriosidase, and chemokine receptor 5) and their intragenic polymorphic forms and to
      compare this data to the incidence and severity of Blastomycosis Dermatitidis infection. With
      this study we hope to identify a group of molecules of innate immunity which influence the
      risk and severity of invasive Blastomycosis Dermatitidis infection.
