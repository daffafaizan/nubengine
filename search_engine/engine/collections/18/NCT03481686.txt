      molecule, once a week to once a month. They have improved the management of pre-dialysis
      patients, increased their hemoglobin and decreased transfusion needs, improving their
      morbidity and mortality and quality of life.

      They are administered in pre-dialysis or post-renal transplantation most often by
      subcutaneous injection, which can be done by the patient himself, a member of his family or a
      nurse. Self-administration of ASE has been encouraged for many years, notably with pens for
      injection, but only few pilot studies show the feasibility of these auto-injections of ASE
      and patient satisfaction.

      In 2012, the investigators conducted a practice study whose main objective was to have a
      picture of ESA injection practices for pre-dialysis patients. It is an observational,
      epidemiological, prospective and multicentric study, carried out by a questionnaire completed
      by the nephrologist during a consultation.

      At the end of a 6-month collection period, 143 records were collected. All the patients
      questioned were followed for chronic renal insufficiency, not yet dialysed and not
      transplanted.

      The majority of patients enrolled in this study were in the maintenance phase for ASE
      prescription (86% versus 14% in the correction phase), the mean age was 66.4 +/- 16.9 years.
      In 70.2% of cases the injection is done by a nurse, compared to 24.8% of injections made by
      the patient himself and 4.9% by his spouse. For 86.7%, the injection was done at home, and
      for 60% without other associated care. The nurse therefore came only for the injection of
      ASE. Not surprisingly, at an equal ASE cost, the resort to a nurse is significantly more
      expensive.
