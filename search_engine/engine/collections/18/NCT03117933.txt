    
      Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor which targets BRCA1/2 mutated tumour cells and cediranib is an
      anti-angiogenic drug which reduces blood supply to the tumour, suppressing tumour viability.
      Phase I/II trials of both drugs have shown these are well tolerated alone or in combination
      in ovarian cancer.

      The trial aims to compare the efficacy of the combination and of olaparib alone with
      paclitaxel chemotherapy and whether the olaparib/cediranib combination is better tolerated
      thus improving quality of life. Secondly standard paclitaxel chemotherapy must be
      administered weekly at hospital whereas the olaparib/cediranib combination can be
      administered at home potentially also improving patient quality of life.

      Participants' tumours will be resistant to platinum based therapies. Participants will be
      randomised into one of the 3 treatment arms after stratification for prior
      PARP/anti-angiogenic treatments/BRCA status. Participants will be on trial up to 18 months.
