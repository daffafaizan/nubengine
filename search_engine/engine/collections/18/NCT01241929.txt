    
      A.1. Aim 1: To recruit 150 subjects with advanced cancer and randomly assign these subjects
      to one of two advance care planning (ACP) modalities: 1. a video visually depicting CPR
      (intervention) or 2. a verbal narrative describing the CPR.

      Hypothesis 1: It is feasible to recruit and randomize 150 subjects with advanced cancer.

      A.2. Aim 2: To compare the care preferences for CPR among 150 subjects randomized to video
      vs. verbal narrative intervention.

      Hypothesis 2: Subjects randomized to the video intervention will be significantly more likely
      to opt NOT to have CPR compared to those randomized to the verbal narrative.

      A.3. Aim 3: To compare knowledge assessment of CPR for 150 subjects randomized to video vs.
      verbal narrative intervention.

      Hypothesis 3: When compared to subjects randomized to the verbal narrative arm, subjects in
      the video group will have higher knowledge assessment scores when asked questions regarding
      their understanding of CPR.
