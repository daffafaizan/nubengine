      available to the poorest populations are urgently needed in Bangladesh in areas where the
      disease is endemic. Paromomycin IM Injection (PMIM) was approved for the treatment of VL in
      August 2006 by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), and it offers an attractive
      alternative to treatments that are currently available.
