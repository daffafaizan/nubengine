      multiple myeloma (MM) and smoldering myeloma (SMM). Since the new definition of SMM proposed
      excludes "ultra-high risk SMM", the evolution profile of SMM will change. Therefore,
      investigators need to update their knowledge of SMM to optimize the management of patients.
      This project is expected to describe more precisely the new landscape of SMM.

      The results will help to establish new recommendations for the standard care of SMM and
      especially for defining accurate follow-up and risk stratifying.
