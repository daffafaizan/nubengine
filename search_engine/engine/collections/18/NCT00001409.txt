    
      Open-label, comparative, sequentially randomized treatment with genetically unmodified or
      modified ex vivo-expanded T-lymphocytes in patients with HIV infection who possess a
      seronegative syngeneic twin. Genetic modification consists of introduction of a gene for
      HLA-unrestricted "universal" receptors specific for the gp120 HIV envelope protein. Treatment
      is divided into Periods I and II.
