      rate of employment and a high incidence of depression. There currently exists no medical
      therapy recognized as consistently efficacious in HHT. Reports of the efficacy of thalidomide
      in HHT, as well as interim results of a pilot trial of pomalidomide in HHT provide evidence
      of efficacy with minimal toxicity. The favorable efficacy:toxicity ratio of pomalidomide
      suggest that it may benefit patients with HHT.

      This study is designed as a Phase II placebo-controlled double-blind study of pomalidomide in
      HHT patients with moderate to severe epistaxis who require parenteral iron infusions or blood
      transfusions. A total of 159 patients will be randomized 2:1 to treatment with oral
      pomalidomide or matching placebo for 24 weeks.

      Primary Objective: To determine efficacy of pomalidomide compared to placebo for the
      reduction in severity of epistaxis after 24 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary Objectives: To determine the safety and tolerability of pomalidomide for the
      treatment of HHT; to determine if pomalidomide treatment improves quality of life in HHT; to
      determine whether a continued response to pomalidomide is evident 12 weeks after treatment
      discontinuation; to develop a biorepository for future studies to define biomarkers
      predictive of pomalidomide response and allow investigations into the biology of HHT and
      mechanisms of pomalidomide.
