      trial will be conducted in Israel at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.

      Subjects will undergo similar study procedures and evaluations; however each patient will
      receive his or her own individually targeted dose of EPO delivered via EPODURE Biopumps. The
      targeted dose may vary between 20IU/kg/d to 65IU/kg/d based on each patient's weight, the
      historical average EPO amount administered and historical Hb levels including at least the 3
      months prior to inclusion in the study. The objective is maintaining Hb levels within the
      target range of 10-12 g/dl.
