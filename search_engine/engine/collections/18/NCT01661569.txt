      Therapies such as MBSR (mindfulness-based stress reduction) typically consist of 8 group
      sessions led by an experienced practitioner, plus home practice and one full day of
      meditation. In this study we aim to investigate whether a mindfulness programme delivered as
      a series of podcasts on a mobile phone app could lead to gains in well-being and a reduction
      in stress.
