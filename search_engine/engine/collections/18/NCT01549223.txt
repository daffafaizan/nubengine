      diverse, empiric, and vague. A stepwise, standardized, checklist driven algorithm for the use
      of oxytocin and other uterotonic agents during cesarean delivery is needed to guide
      practitioners in a clear and concise manner. This algorithm should encompass laboring and
      non-laboring women, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic uses of oxytocin and other
      uterotonic agents.

      More specifically, the investigators believe that the following points should be incorporated
      into a protocol: 1) oxytocin should be used in initial doses of less than 5 IU; 2) oxytocin
      should not be administered as a rapid IV bolus; 3) an initial rapid infusion of oxytocin
      should be followed by a maintenance infusion; 4) higher initial and infusion doses of
      oxytocin offer no clinical benefit and should be avoided; and 5) if it appears that oxytocin
      is not producing effective uterine contractions, other uterotonic drugs acting via different
      pathways should be considered in a standardized way.
