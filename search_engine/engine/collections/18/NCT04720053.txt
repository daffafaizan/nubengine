      demonstration of the mindfulness sessions. Participants will be asked to complete study
      surveys/questionnaires. During the first part of study, participants will be asked to
      complete the intervention. After completion of the intervention they will enter a follow-Up
      Phase, where they will be contacted and asked to complete surveys and gauge satisfaction with
      the study.
