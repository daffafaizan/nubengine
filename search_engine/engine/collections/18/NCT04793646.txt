    
      Study design: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled study of
      N-acetylcysteine (600 mg orally every 12 hours in the form of syrup) lasting 12 weeks for the
      treatment of sicca syndrome symptoms due to pSS.

      Patients: Sixty adult female patients (aged >=18 years), with a well-established diagnosis of
      pSS (2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/ European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
      and/or 2002 American-European Consensus classification criteria) and follow-up regularly at
      the Sjögren Syndrome Outpatient Clinic of the Rheumatology Division of Hospital das Clínicas
      da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (HCFMUSP).

      Sample size: There is only a controlled study of NAC for treatment of SS, which included a
      heterogeneous population with a total of 26 patients and who observed superiority to placebo
      in the sicca symptoms control. Based on this study, the investigators will work with a
      convenience sample of 60 patients.

      Clinical evaluation: It will be carried out at study inclusion, 4 weeks and 12 weeks through
      clinical instruments widely accepted in the literature.

      Laboratorial evaluation: ROs will also be assessed throughout the study.
