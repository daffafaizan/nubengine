      Mind, Enjoyment) App Pilot Project RCT Study are 300-500 middle school students. Two schools
      will be recruited and randomized to each group. Schools will either be assigned to app
      intervention group or waitlist control group. The students in the intervention group will use
      the App for one month. Daily and Weekly tasks related to SME will be assigned through the
      App, and information related to mental health will be provided. The waitlist control group
      will be able to use the App after we finish all the assessments.

      There will then be 4 assessments (pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, one month
      and three months after) to evaluate the effects of the intervention programme. In the
      assessments, students will be asked to complete a questionnaire to measure the changes in SME
      (sharing, mind and enjoyment) related behaviors, changes of knowledge and attitude towards
      the anxiety disorder, changes of happiness and well-being.
