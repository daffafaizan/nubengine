      energy burning) increases in response to ingestion of a meal.

      BAT is one of two types of fat, (the other being white fat), which is found in humans and
      other mammals. In this study we aim to further our understanding of how BAT works in humans.
      Studies in animals show that in addition to cold exposure, BAT is also activated by ingestion
      of a meal, and to different amounts depending on the meal composition, and more importantly,
      total energy content. However we have only a very limited understanding of BAT function in
      response to meals in humans. Since BAT function is defective in obesity, and its activity and
      function are impacted by diet, here we will find out whether a single high energy meal
      composed entirely of lipid (fat) can increase BAT activity. In future these findings and
      those of subsequent studies may have important implications for the management of obesity and
      related diseases.

      A total of 20 people will participate in this project. Participation will involve a total of
      3 visits, including a screening visit, 2 experimental visits consumption of the treatment
      meal on one visit, and the placebo (dummy) on the other in a randomised order.
