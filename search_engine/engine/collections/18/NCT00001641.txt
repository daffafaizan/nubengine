      connective tissue disorders, concentrating on the Marfan, Stickler, and Ehlers-Danlos
      syndromes. Although each of these conditions has been known for many years, the full spectrum
      of the associated phenotypes continues to be expanded and the genetic etiology of these
      conditions has not been completely elucidated. In addition, many patients have features
      overlapping two or more of the described syndromes, precluding unequivocal diagnosis. The
      goals of this study are to further define and characterize the full phenotype and natural
      history of these disorders, and to perform genetic linkage, gene identification, mutation
      detection, and genotype/phenotype correlations in affected individuals and families.
      Individuals suspected to have Marfan, Stickler or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or a closely related
      disorder, as well as interested family members, will be enrolled. Participants will undergo
      genetic analyses and periodic clinical assessment. The expected outcomes will be improved
      clinical descriptions of the conditions and gene and mutation identification with analysis of
      genotype/phenotype correlations.
