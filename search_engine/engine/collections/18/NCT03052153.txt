      complications leading to increased morbidity and mortality. During lung transplant surgery,
      trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) is routinely used to identify cardiac anatomy and
      measure blood flow through the pulmonary veins. This blood flow is assessed both before and
      after the lung has been transplanted. Blood flow through these small caliber vessels can be
      impacted by many variables with a resulting reduction in blood circulating to the lung,
      although currently there is no agreement on an acceptable level of flow. This study will look
      at retrospective data from lung transplant surgeries undertaken at this institution since Jan
      1st 2014 until November 18th 2016 with the goal of determining if an association exists
      between levels of blood flow through the pulmonary veins and the incidence of graft
      dysfunction post operatively.
