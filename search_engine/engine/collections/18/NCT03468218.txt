    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with recurrent/metastatic (RM)
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who receive the combination of
      pembrolizumab and cabozantinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with the combination
           of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib.

        -  To further define the toxicities associated with these regimens in patients with SCCHN.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and cabozantinib
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 2 years.
