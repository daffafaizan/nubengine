      radiotherapy in elderly patients or patients with poor performance status who have brain
      metastases. II. Determine the neurologic function in these patients after receiving this
      treatment regimen. III. Determine the quality of life in these patients with this treatment
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic head frame placement, followed by stereotactic
      radiosurgery using Gamma Knife, on day 1. Quality of life is assessed one week prior to and
      one week after treatment, and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months. Patients are followed at
      one week, at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months, every 4 months for one year, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 52 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
