      monitoring, glucose level monitoring and symptoms of infection. HR and BP was measured
      continuously for 3 consecutive days (the day before, the day of IVMP and the day after IVMP)
      during 1st, 6th and 12th IVMP pulse, using 24-hour Holter ECG and ABMP. Serum laboratory
      tests for potassium, epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured 3 times the day before and
      the day of first IVMP pulse and 1 time the second and sixth day after 1st IVMP. Additionally,
      urine samples for potassium were collected 5 times the day of first IVMP pulse and 1 time the
      second and sixth day after 1st IVMP.
