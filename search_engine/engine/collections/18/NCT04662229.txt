    
      Single-blind randomized clinical trial of n = 12 healthy subjects. 4 assessments of the grip
      strength of the non-dominant hand will be made using a digital dynamometer, by a blinded
      investigator. A V0-pre-intervention, a V1-post-intervention, a V2 at 24 hours and a V3 at 10
      days after the intervention. Subjects will be randomly assigned by EPIDAT 3.1, to an
      experimental group or a control group, with n = 6 each group. In the experimental group, an
      ultrasound-guided percutaneous electrical stimulation will be performed. With a pointer, a
      symmetrical biphasic low-frequency current of 10 Hz and 240 microseconds will be applied to
      the median nerve and ulnar nerve, until reaching the excitomotor threshold, with applications
      of 10 seconds and rests of 5 seconds until reaching a stimulation of 1 minute. total over
      each nerve. In the control group, the same invasive procedure will be performed, but no type
      of electrical stimulation will be applied.

      Statistical analysis will be performed by another blinded assessor, using IBM SPSS Statistics
      24. A two-factor ANOVA (intervention-time) with Bonferroni correction will be performed.
