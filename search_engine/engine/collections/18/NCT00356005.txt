      treatments for a disease that kills more than one million people every year. Azithromycin is
      a macrolide antibiotic that is particularly attractive due to its safety in children and
      experience with use in pregnancy. Recent trials suggest that azithromycin has a strong
      potential as an antimalarial. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of
      azithromycin combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in
      Bangladesh.
