      was seen to be invaded by the placenta, and the pathological examination of the removed
      uterus showed the villi attached to the myometrium without intervening decidua (accreta),
      invading into the myometrium (increta) or reaching the serosa (percreta).

      -Complete imaging using all diagnostic techniques (gray-scale, color Doppler) by both
      transabdominal and transvaginal by two expert operators, then an offline analysis of the
      acquired images & volumes was done Ultrasound examination was performed using a 2D ultrasound
      system equipped with a 4-8-MHz trans-abdominal transducer and a 12 MHz transvaginal
      transducer The transvaginal ultrasound was performed by a highly experienced operator whereas
      the transabdominal ultrasound was performed by a less experienced one and both were blinded
      from the results of each other Placenta was examined while the bladder was partially full
      about 300 ml for adequate visualization and precise localization

      The Examined placenta is considered to be suspicious of abnormal invasion in case of having
      one or more of the unified descriptors described by the European working Group on Abnormally
      Invasive Placenta "EW-AIP":
