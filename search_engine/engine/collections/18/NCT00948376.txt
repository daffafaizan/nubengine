      and is characterized by short ribs often responsible for an early death due to respiratory
      distress, trident acetabular roof and short long bones.

      In the course of the disease, renal, liver and eye complications may occur. However, their
      frequencies are unknown.

      ATD is transmitted with an autosomal mode of inheritance and up till now only one gene has
      been identified, namely IFT80, which accounts only for a small part of ATD.

      The aim of our project is to prospectively analyze at a clinical and molecular level a series
      of 50 ATD patients and 20 fetuses to further define the natural history of the disorder and
      to contribute to the identification of its molecular basis.
