    
      This is a Phase I study of up to 100 healthy children, ages 6 months to 10 years of age, who
      will receive either Flumist® live, attenuated influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent (LAIV4)
      or the current Fluzone® inactivated influenza vaccine, quadrivalent (IIV4). The volunteers
      will be enrolled into one of 3 Groups. Volunteers will return each year until 2018-2019 for
      annual flu immunizations and study visits. Questionnaires will be administered annually to
      record demographic characteristics, vaccination history, exposure to animals, day care and
      medically attended illness. There are no exclusions for gender, ethnicity or race.

      Volunteers in the Non-twin Flu/MMRV naive group will also receive the measles, mumps, rubella
      and varicella (MMRV) vaccine at approximately 12-15 months of age (to be administered by the
      volunteers' personal pediatrician, not as a study vaccine). They will then come for a study
      visit to collect blood 60 days later.

      Each twin is counted as a single participant. All reporting numbers reflect the number of
      participants, not the number of twin pairs.
