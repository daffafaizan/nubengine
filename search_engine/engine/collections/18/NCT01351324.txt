      prospectively genotyped for the eNOS Glu298Asp polymorphism, of which 35 were Asp298 and 150
      were Glu298 homozygotes. Three subjects in the Asp298 group were unable to participate, two
      were unsuitable according to selection criteria and one subject subsequently withdrew from
      the study. Subjects homozygous for Asp298 (n=29) and Glu298 (n=30) were therefore selected,
      balanced for gender, age and BMI.
