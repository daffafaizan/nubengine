    
      Neck pain (NP) is a considerable health problem, affecting both young and elderly
      individuals. Of particular concern is the negative impact NP may have on the functional
      ability of the geriatric population, already challenged by decreased mobility and balance
      associated with ageing. Chiropractic manual treatment and rehabilitative exercise have
      demonstrated potential for the treatment of NP in younger individuals, but have yet to be
      rigorously tested in the elderly.

      The broad, long-term objective of this research is to identify effective therapies for
      patients, 65 years and older, who suffer with chronic neck pain and to enhance their
      functional capacity.

      Primary Aims

      â€¢ To determine the relative clinical effectiveness of 1) chiropractic manual treatment and
      home exercise, 2) supervised rehabilitative exercise and home exercise, and 3) home exercise
      alone in both the short-term (after 12 weeks) and long-term (after 52 weeks), using
      patient-rated neck pain as the main outcome measure.

      Secondary Aims

        -  To estimate the short- and long-term relative effectiveness of the three interventions
           using:

             -  Patient-rated outcomes: neck related disability, general health status, patient
                satisfaction, improvement, and medication use measured by self-report
                questionnaires;

             -  Objective functional performance outcomes: neck motion, strength and endurance, and
                functional ability measured by examiners masked to treatment group assignment;

             -  Cost measures: direct and indirect costs, and cost utility of treatment measured by
                questionnaires, phone interviews, and medical records.

        -  To describe patients' perceptions of treatment and the issues they consider when
           determining their satisfaction with care.

      This project is a collective effort by a multidisciplinary team, with an established record
      of collaborative research in the area of neck and back pain. The results of this study will
      provide valuable information for elderly neck pain sufferers and the clinicians who treat
      them.
