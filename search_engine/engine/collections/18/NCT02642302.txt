      (HIIT) sessions in cycle ergometer. Both the first and the last week will serve to stabilize
      the basic values and also repeated after training. So, every other day will be held: 1) risk
      stratification for coronary artery disease, anthropometric measurements, cardiopulmonary test
      maximum effort; 2) stabilization of cardiopulmonary test values, determining the aerobic
      dependent variables: VO2max, peak power - PP, occurrence of power VO2max - PVO2MÃ¡x, maximum
      heart rate - HRMax, as well as familiarization with the HIIT protocol; 3) anaerobic
      performance test of 30 seconds determining the anaerobic dependent variables: peak lactate -
      LA, anaerobic power peak - PP, average power - PM. After the dependent variables have
      established, the subjects will be randomly distributed among three groups: two experimental
      and one control, and subjected to 30 sessions of HIIT (all out)with 30 seconds of stimulation
      in cycle ergometer, differentiated only by the recovery time (60 seconds and 120 seconds).
      The control group had only one continuous aerobic exercise (50-55% VO2max) with an average
      time similar to other training.
