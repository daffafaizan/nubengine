      prescribed by their regular healthcare provider. No additional study medication will be
      administered. This study will enroll patients who have been previously diagnosed with COPD.
      This study will look at the medical history and other diseases that have been diagnosed in
      people who also have COPD.

      The study will enroll approximately 3000 patients.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Italy. The overall time to participate in this
      study is at a single, regularly scheduled visit at the pulmonologists office. There will not
      be any follow up assessments.
