    
      Primary Purpose: Compare the ability diagnostic of non-invasive sampling swab corneal versus
      the gold standard, (invasive vaccinostyle uptake) for the systematic search for pathogens
      tedious in corneal specimens.

      Hypothesis:

      The diagnostic strategy using a microbial testing of cornea method has a sensitivity of 90%
      and a specificity of 80% or more over the policy diagnostic using a sampling by vaccinostyle
      method.

      Primary outcome measures: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values,
      Diagnostic odds ratio.
