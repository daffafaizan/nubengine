      of patients with recurrent implantation failure. The mechanisms that induce that improvement
      remain unknown.

      We want to analyse if the endometrial induce injury could be useful in cases of standard
      patients who require assisted reproductive techniques.

      For that purpose we will start a randomized controlled trial with the ideal background in
      implantation in ART, the egg donation programme.
