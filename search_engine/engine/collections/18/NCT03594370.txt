      impression cytology are noninvasive, rapid and easily repeatable technique to investigate
      ocular surface disorders. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) enables morphological and
      quantitative analysis of ocular surface microstructure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      allows for imaging of the morphology of biological tissue with micrometer scale resolution at
      imaging depths of 1 to 2mm below the tissue surface. [1,2] Anterior segment OCT (ASOCT) has
      been developed to evaluate corneal diseases[3-8] in different layers. Keratography includes
      noninvasive meibography and tear interferometry. The former demonstrates the morphology of
      meibomian glands whereas the later observes quality and quantity of the lipid layer of the
      tear film. Impression cytology shows the morphology of the corneal and conjunctival
      epithelial cells, their staining behavior, and nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio could be observed in
      detail.

      Here the investigators proposed this clinical trial to collect cases of different etiologies
      of ocular surface diseases. With at least one of these four non-invasive examination
      modalities, the investigators aim to analyze and compare the detecting results. The
      investigators especially focus on the possibility of using ASOCT to predict the condition of
      limbal epithelial stem cells, aiming to use this patient-friendly tool to detect the
      patient's limbal conditions.
