      pancreas and liver for any indication will be included. Further inclusion criteria are: age
      between 18-75 years, ASA score < 4, and a signed informed consent. Patients are stratified
      into two subgroups (laparoscopic and open surgery) and will be randomized 1:1 for an
      autofeedback of their step-count using an activity tracker wristband or for the control group
      without autofeedback. Sample size (n = 29 patients in each of the four groups, overall n =
      119) is calculated on an assumed difference in step-count of 250 steps daily (intervention
      versus control group). The primary study endpoint is the step-count during the first five
      postoperative days; secondary endpoints are the percentage of patients in the two groups, who
      master the predefined mobilization (step-count) targets, the assessment of additional
      activity data from the devices, the assessment of the preoperative mobility, length of
      hospital and intensive care unit stay, number of patients who receive physiotherapy, 30-day
      mortality, and the overall 30-day morbidity.
