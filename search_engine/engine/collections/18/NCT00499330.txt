    
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to tumor
      size (< 1 cm vs 1-1.5 cm vs > 1.5-2.0 cm) (based on the maximum dimension determined from the
      preoperative CT scan), histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs adenocarcinoma vs other), and
      smoking status (never smoked [smoked < 100 cigarettes over lifetime] vs former smoker [smoked
      > 100 cigarettes AND quit ≥ 1 year ago] vs current smoker [quit < 1 year ago or currently
      smokes]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. For more information, please see
      the Arms section.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine whether DFS after sublobar resection (segmentectomy or wedge) is non-inferior to
      that after lobectomy in patients with small peripheral (≤ 2 cm) NSCLC.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine whether overall survival (OS) (after sublobar resection) is non-inferior to
           that after lobectomy.

        2. To determine the rates of loco-regional and systemic recurrence (exclusive of second
           primaries) after lobar and sublobar resection.

        3. To determine the difference between the two arms of the study in pulmonary function as
           determined by expiratory flow rates measured at 6 months post-operatively.

        4. Imaging Substudy: To explore the relationship between characteristics of the primary
           lung cancer, as revealed by pre-operative CT and PET imaging, and outcomes; a
           determination of the false-negative rate of the pre-operative PET scan for
           identification of involved hilarand mediastinal lymph nodes; and an assessment of the
           utility of annual follow-up CT imaging after surgical resection of small stage IA NSCLC.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 5 years.
