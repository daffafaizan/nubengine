      consent to participate in this study and meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will
      be eligible to enroll into this study. The eligible patients will be randomized into one of
      two study arms: 1) the CCRT- PG2 arm; and 2) the CCRT alone arm. All eligible patients will
      receive the standard preoperative CCRT during study period and standard surgery 6 weeks after
      completion of radiation therapy.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PG2 concurrent with CCRT
      for relieving fatigue. Patient's fatigue status will be measured by the BFI-T.

      The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of PG2 to improve the quality of life of
      patient during CCRT. Patients' quality of life will be assessed by the Functional Assessment
      of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G7 v.4). Patients' appetite will be assessed by VAS appetite
      score. The effect of PG2 on tumor response post CCRT, DFS and OS of patients will also be
      evaluated.

      Peripheral blood samples and tumor biopsy samples will be collected from all subjects at
      screening period, during CCRT and post CCRT period to perform Immune biomarker assessment in
      the add-on study.
