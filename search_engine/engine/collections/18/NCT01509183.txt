      system into a healthcare organization, and to provide sufficient information to inform
      decision making for potential future adopters. The researchers believe that the Propeller
      Health system has the potential to improve asthma control by providing rescue inhaler
      actuation data and tailored asthma management tips to patients with uncontrolled asthma, and
      rescue inhaler actuation data to their providers. Improvements in asthma control should be
      reflected in reductions in healthcare utilization for asthma, and potentially for general
      healthcare utilization. Reductions in utilization would result in lower healthcare costs. The
      study has been designed to capture data on individual subject asthma control, and changes in
      utilization and costs over a one-year introduction period.
