      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with AG-120 (ivosidenib) with advanced solid tumors (including
      central nervous system [CNS] tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor
      activating genetic alterations in the IDH1 pathway.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with AG-120
      (ivosidenib) with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic
      disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in the IDH1 pathway.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of AG-120 (ivosidenib) in children and
      adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      III. To provide preliminary estimates of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AG-120
      (ivosidenib) in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to AG-120 (ivosidenib) and
      specifically, whether tumors that harbor different missense mutations or fusions will
      demonstrate differential response to AG-120 (ivosidenib) treatment.

      II. To explore approaches to the profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through
      evaluation of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ivosidenib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Cycles repeat every 28 days for up
      to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
