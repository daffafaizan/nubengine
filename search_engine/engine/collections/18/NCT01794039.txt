      I. To assess the confirmed response rate of the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone
      in patients with relapsed myeloma who have previously become refractory to lenalidomide. (Arm
      A) II. To assess the confirmed response rate of the combination of pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed myeloma who have previously become refractory to
      lenalidomide. (Arm B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity in each arm in patients with relapsed myeloma who have previously
      received lenalidomide.

      II. To assess the response rates with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients relapsing on
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone. (Arm A) III. To assess time to progression and overall
      survival with each approach.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing progressive disease may crossover to arm B.

      ARM B: Patients receive pomalidomide PO daily on days 1-21 and dexamethasone as in arm A.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
