      adequately tested.

      The novel TherMax blood warmer for the newly introduced PrisMax System heats blood and
      replacement solutions via a dry heat plate system. In contrast, the PRISMAFLO IIS Blood
      Warmer for PRISMAFLEX System uses an electric heating sleeve on a standard CRRT filter set.

      Data on adverse events (AE) during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been
      studied and one of the most common AE was hypothermia, reported in 44% of all cases.

      The present study aims at testing if the TherMax blood warmer is more accurate and reliable
      in reaching and maintaining chosen target temperature during CRRT as compared to the blood
      warmer used for the PrismaFlex system.
