    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, exploratory platform trial designed to assess the
      safety and antitumor activity of immunotherapy, in combination with standard of care
      chemotherapy, in participants with mPDAC who have not received prior therapy. Where
      supportive mechanistic data are available, immunotherapy may also be combined with other
      treatment modalities (eg, radiation). Each cohort of this platform trial will test a
      different immunotherapy combination and consist of up to 2 stages: an initial stage (Stage 1)
      to evaluate safety, biomarkers, and/or clinical activity of the combination and an expanded
      cohort (Stage 2), when warranted, based on the safety, clinical activity, and/or biomarker
      results from Stage 1. The Sponsor intends to modify and/or add new combinations to the
      protocol as data emerge from scientific findings, in this and other trials.

      This trial will be conducted in participants with histologically or cytologically documented
      diagnosis of mPDAC, with measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) v1.1, who have not received prior systemic therapy for their disease in the
      metastatic setting. Participants must have adequate organ and hematologic function and
      acceptable performance status. Participants must consent to tumor biopsies, including a
      pre-treatment (baseline) and on-treatment samples.
