      utilize a 16-channel EMG array to characterize cervical-cranial muscle activity networks in
      typical speakers at baseline and after a vocal loading task. Aim 2 will quantify how cervical
      muscle networks are perturbed in patients with two different types of dysphonia and examine
      if standard-of-care treatment restores cervical-cranial muscle networks to more typical
      states. In Experiment 2 (Aim 2), we will measure muscle networks in patients with muscle
      tension dysphonia before and after a course of voice therapy. Patients with muscle tension
      dysphonia represent an intact butpotentially maladaptive network. In Experiment 3 (Aim 2), we
      will measure patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis, representing a neurologically
      impaired network, before and after a vocal fold injection medialization procedure.
