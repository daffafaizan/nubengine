    
      An open-label, prospective cohort study of higher-risk HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in order
      to determine barriers and facilitators to uptake and sustained adherence to ART for HIV-1
      infected partners and daily oral PrEP for HIV-1 uninfected partners. The investigators
      developed a risk score tool to identify couples at highest risk for HIV-1 transmission. PrEP
      was offered as a 'bridge' to ART in the partnership - i.e., until ART initiation by the
      HIV-infected partner and for the first 6 months after ART is started; ART was recommended
      following national ART guidelines. A subset (up to 80 couples per site) was invited to
      participate in qualitative in-depth interview and focus group discussions.
