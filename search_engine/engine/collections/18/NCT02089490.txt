      of safety and performance of NEVELIA®, as described in the literature on equivalent products.

      This dermal substitute consists of an inner biodegradable dermal substitute made of bovine
      collagen (collagen of type I), covered with an outer silicone membrane. Its porosity and the
      speed of degradation allow the act of recolonization by the fibroblasts and initiation of the
      vascularization process within 3 weeks. The application procedure requires removement of the
      silicone layer and wound covering with an ultra-thin epidermal graft, possibly meshed. This
      surgical procedure is well-known and permits an ultra-thin epidermal graft.

      All the patients will be treated with NEVELIA®, prior to autologous skin grafting within 3
      weeks after its application. Then, three follow-up visits will be planned: post operatively,
      at 6 and 12 months.

      The objectives are:

        -  Primary objective: To assess the type and frequency of complications

        -  Secondary objectives:

             -  To assess the take rate of NEVELIA®

             -  To assess the take rate of skin graft

             -  To assess the satisfaction rate of physician and patient,

             -  To assess the quality of the healed skin,

             -  To assess the rate of re-operation at 12 months.
