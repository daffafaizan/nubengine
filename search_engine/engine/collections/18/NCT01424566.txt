      and tolerability of nabiximols administered as an adjunctive treatment for 5 weeks, versus
      placebo, assessed by a 2-part, randomized withdrawal design. The first part of the study
      (Part A) was single-blind (participants) and the second part of the study (Part B) was
      randomized, double-blind. Eligible participants had advanced cancer, with a clinical
      diagnosis of cancer related pain which was not wholly alleviated by their current optimized
      opioid treatment.

      Qualifying participants entered the study at screening and commenced a 5- to 14-day
      eligibility period. During this period, eligible participants had 3 consecutive days where
      pain severity remained within defined parameters, break-through opioid usage had not exceeded
      an average of 4 episodes per day, and maintenance opioid medication and dose had not changed.
      Eligible participants underwent nabiximols titration during a single-blind treatment period
      lasting 10 days, followed by 4 days of therapy at the titrated dose. Participants who
      demonstrated an improvement of 15% or more on the score of the pain numerical rating scale
      were advanced to Part B, where they were randomized 1:1 to nabiximols or placebo in a
      double-blind fashion. Participants then received study treatments at their self-titrated
      doses for 5 weeks. After the end of the 5-week treatment period, participants were offered
      the option of entering an open-label extension (OLE) study; participants who entered the OLE
      up to 7 days after study completion had their follow-up assessments performed on the same day
      as their first OLE study visit. Participants that did not enter the OLE study had a safety
      follow up visit 14 days after treatment completion, which could be via telephone.
