      I. To assess the pathological partial response (PPR) rate in patients with potentially
      resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) treated with neoadjuvant cemiplimab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the pathological complete response rate (PCR). II. To estimate the Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version [v]1.1) 9 week objective response rate
      (ORR).

      III. To estimate the RECIST (v1.1) 12 month progression free (PFS). IV. To assess the
      toxicity among patients with CSCC treated with neoadjuvant cemiplimab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate tumor mutational burden (TMB) and correlate with response to PD-1 blockade
      therapy.

      II. To evaluate PD-L1 expression on CSCC tumor cells and correlate with response to PD-1
      blockade.

      III. To evaluate CD8+ T cell infiltration into CSCC tumors and correlate with response to
      PD-1 blockade.

      IV. To assess other adaptive immune resistance mechanisms in CSCC tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cemiplimab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 3 cycles (or up to 4 cycles for patients whose disease is
      unresectable after 3 cycles) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Within 6 weeks of last dose of therapy, patients with potentially resectable tumors undergo
      surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months.
