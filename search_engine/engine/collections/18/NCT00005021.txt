      carboplatin (TOPO/TAX/CBDCA) with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors or lymphomas. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.
      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of TOPO/TAX/CBDCA and whether TAX/CBDCA will affect the
      pharmacokinetics of TOPO on day 1 as compared to TOPO administered alone on day 3. IV.
      Describe any clinical responses observed in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of the combination topotecan/paclitaxel/carboplatin.
      Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy (yes vs no). Part I:
      Patients receive topotecan IV on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV
      over 30-60 minutes, on day 1. Part II: Patients receive topotecan, paclitaxel, and
      carboplatin as in part I, plus filgrastim (G-CSF) on days 6-19. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of topotecan/paclitaxel/carboplatin until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 4
      years.
