      observer every 5 min after needle removal for 30 min in the regions of the radial, median,
      ulnar, and musculocutaneous nerves of the forearm. Skin temperature measurements will be
      performed from both the anesthetized side and the contralateral arm before the procedure and
      every 5 min for 30 min by a blinded observer. Before the block, the color changing nail
      polish will be applied to all hand nails of the patient. An independent observer will
      photograph the reaction of the nail polish (i.e. color change) in both hands immediately
      after application of nail polish and at two minute intervals for 30 min after performing the
      block. Two blinded observers were reviewed the digital photographs. They were asked to
      compare the colors of nail polish in both hands and to score the difference based on a
      three-point scale (0: absolutely no difference, 1: I am not sure, 2: indisputable difference)
