    
      This first-in-human trial with ABL001 is a dose escalation study whose primary purpose is to
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of
      single agent ABL001 in CML or Ph+ ALL patients, and in combination with either Nilotinib or
      Imatinib or Dasatinib in Ph positive CML patients. The safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABL001 and ABL001+Nilotinib, ABL001+Imatinib and
      ABL001+Dasatinib will be assessed together with an evaluation of pharmacodynamic (PD) changes
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bone marrow aspirates and all data may
      contribute to the assessment of the RDE.

      An understanding of the MTD/RDE, safety profile, PK/PD relationship, and preliminary evidence
      of anti-CML and ALL activity will be used to inform future development in adults with CML and
      Ph+ ALL. By virtue of its distinct pharmacological profile and by preclinical pharmacological
      studies demonstrating an additive effect, a combination of ABL001 and a tyrosine-kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) has the potential to achieve a deeper molecular response in a higher
      proportion of CML patients as compared to single agent TKI therapy. Such a combination has
      the added advantage of targeting the ABL kinase domain at two distinct locations,
      theoretically preventing single point mutation-associated treatment resistance. The
      prediction is that a nilotinib+ABL001, imatinib+ABL001 and/or dasatinib+ABL001 combination
      will increase the percentage of patients who achieve a complete molecular response (CMR) and
      decrease the time to CMR, thereby increasing the possibility of achieving sustained
      treatment-free remissions in these patients. In addition, some patients may be intolerant of
      therapy with TKIs or may develop mutations that promote resistance to TKI therapy. In these
      patients, ABL001 may provide a novel therapeutic option.
