      patients may be well outside the range of normalcy and potentially dangerous to the patient
      (Duma A, et al). This cardiovascular response is caused by activation of the autonomic
      nervous system and consists of an initial parasympathetic response rapidly followed by
      sympathetically mediated tachycardia and hypertension. The ultra-short acting synthetic
      opioid alfentanil has a rapid onset and duration of action that mirrors the duration of
      hemodynamic perturbation associated with ECT while having minimal or no effect on the
      duration or quality of the seizure. This drug may be effective in blunting the hemodynamic
      perturbations associated with ECT with a minimal amount of side effects.
