      compare pharmacopuncture therapy with physical therapy for chronic low back pain.
      Participants who voluntarily signed informed consent form and eligible for the study were
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (50:50) for pharmacopuncture therapy group and physical
      therapy group. Participants of each group will receive total 5 weeks of intervention. This is
      a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, so physicians will have medical decision making
      according to each participant's conditions and choose the specific type and volume of
      pharmacopuncture and physical therapy.
