        1. compare and evaluate the impact of this intensive care of rehabilitation of psychomotor
           vs. the standard care on:

             -  result of evaluation with Vineland Scale of adaptive behaviour at 6 months after
                randomization;

             -  result of evaluation with Brunet-Lézine Scale of developement at 12 months after
                randomization;

             -  the pain evaluation at 12 months after randomization;

             -  the durability of acquired cognitive-motor improvement at 6 months after the end of
                intervention (18 months after randomization);

             -  the quality of life of the patients' family or relatives at 12 months after
                randomization;

             -  the clinical global impressions and the quality of life for work for the long-term
                professional caregivers at 12 months after randomization.

        2. evaluate the tolerance of intensive care in psychomotor rehabilitation at 6 and 12
           months after randomization.

        3. study the concordance between the Vineland scale and the Brunet-Lézine scale.
