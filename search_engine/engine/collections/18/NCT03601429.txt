      controlled dietary study to evaluate efficacy of a dietary supplement, a combination of L.
      crispatus LMG S-29995, L. brevis, and L. acidophilus in women aged from 18 through 45 years
      suffering from rBV. The 2 phase of the study has been ascribed as there is no evidence that
      oral capsules with L. crispatus LMG S-29995, L. brevis, and L. acidophilus have a potential
      efficacy in rBV.

      Qualifying women received a combination of the three probiotic strains with a half daily
      recommended dose of vitamin C or just vitamin C without probiotics, a control
      supplementation, via oral route of administration for up to 120 days. During the intake of
      active or control formulations, participants kept a structured 120-DSD, where they recorded
      test capsules intake, screen for symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, and food intolerance
      events.

      Based on repeat physical examination with application of Amsel and Nugent criteria the main
      conclusions over the efficacy of probiotic strains were made.
