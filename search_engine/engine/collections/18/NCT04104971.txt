      involves the surgical removal of the entire organ, which is then replaced with a healthy
      donor liver. Having a healthy liver is essential to longevity because the liver is
      responsible for nutrient distribution and toxin removal in the body .

      Living-donor liver transplantation has been developed to address the disparity between the
      number candidates for transplant and the reduced number of available organs for liver
      transplantation.

      In general, liver transplant (LT) is indicated when the risk of mortality from the native
      liver disease outweighs the overall risk of transplantation. Indications for liver
      transplantation in children include malignant and non-malignant conditions.

      The complications occur both immediately post-transplantation and in the long-term. The main
      complications in the immediate postoperative period are related to the function of the graft
      (dysfunction and rejection), the surgical technique, infections (bacterial, fungal, and
      viral),and systemic problems (pulmonary, renal, or neurological) and In the long term, the
      complications are typically a consequence of the prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.
