      joint diseases has drawn great attention among clinicians and researchers. Aberrant
      methylation status has been demonstrated in human chronic inflammation yet more efforts have
      focused on global and sequence-specific hypomethylation and overexpression of specific genes.
      Few studies investigated the regulation of S-adenosylmethionine homeostasis and regulation
      during inflammation. At present the relevance and regulation of the complex epigenetic
      profiles and their modifications among different tissues and organs during inflammation
      remain largely unknown.
