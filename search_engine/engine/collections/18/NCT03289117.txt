      that includes: assessment for eligibility, randomization to one of two treatment
      alternatives, followed by the actual intervention and evaluation of outcomes.

      (the comparator group) or change of catheter with the additional use of the novel device to
      facilitate gel instillation and a slightly modified procedure (the experimental group).
