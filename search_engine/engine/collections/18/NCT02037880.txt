    
      Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III (Sanfilippo syndrome) is a group of four devastating
      genetic diseases that result in the abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in body
      tissues. In MPSIII the predominant symptoms occur due to accumulation within the central
      nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord, resulting in cognitive decline,
      motor dysfunction, and eventual death.

      In anticipation for future therapeutic studies for MPSIIIA and MPSIIIB, we are performing a
      natural history study to identify the following:

        1. Individual rates of decline in motor and cognitive function in a cohort of potential
           clinical trial patients

        2. The natural history of outcome measures in order to assess their appropriateness as
           outcomes in an eventual trial

        3. Baseline functional data in patients who will be potential candidates for an eventual
           trial

        4. Biomarkers of disease progression over a 12-month interval, including changes in brain
           MRI and in cerebrospinal fluid

      Patients in this study will need to come to Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio,
      three times. At each of these three time points, cognitive outcome measures will be assessed:
      at baseline (visit 1), 6 months (visit 2), and at 12 months (visit 3). At baseline (visit 1)
      and 12 months (visit 3), an MRI and a lumbar puncture will be performed.
