      We propose a study to examine the safety and efficacy of octanoic acid in essential tremor
      (ET).

      STUDY POPULATION:

      We will study 19 adult subjects with ethanol-responsive ET.

      DESIGN:

      Octanoic acid will be tested in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over
      design in 19 patients with essential tremor. The active study medication and placebo will be
      administered as oral single morning doses on consecutive days in a randomized sequence. All
      subjects will receive a dose that was defined as being safe according to available toxicity
      data (4mg/kg) and will be monitored closely during the total inpatient study phase of three
      days (day 0: baseline; days 1-2: active study days).

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcome measure for this study will be the effect on tremor power of the dominant
      hand, 80 minutes after administration of the study substance, compared to placebo. Tremor
      power will be measured using accelerometry with loading to test central tremor component.
      Secondary outcome measures include recordings of tremor power as measured by accelerometry at
      multiple other time points up to 300 min after administration, also recorded from the
      non-dominant hand and without loading. The change in tremor severity documented by
      spirography and actigraphy as well as data collected regarding drug safety (laboratory
      testing, documentation of vital signs, adverse events questionnaire and intoxication scale)
      as well as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties will act as further secondary
      outcome parameters.
