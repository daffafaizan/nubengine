    
      Aim 1. To evaluate the effect of MyHEART (home blood pressure monitor distribution and heath
      coaching) on clinical outcomes, the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (primary)
      and hypertension control (secondary) after 6 and 12 months, compared to usual clinical care.

      Aim 2. To evaluate the effect of MyHEART on hypertension self-management behavior (behavioral
      outcomes) at 6 and 12 months, compared to usual clinical care.

      Aim 3. To examine whether MyHEART's effects on self-management behavior are mediated through
      variables of perceived competence, autonomy, motivation, and activation (mediation outcomes).
