      precede a 5-week double-blind treatment period and a 2-week follow-up period. The duration of
      the screening period will depend on the necessity to introduce a wash-out for lipid-lowering
      drugs : 4-week wash-out from statins and other lipid regulating drugs and 6-week wash-out
      from fibrates. During the screening period, patients will be asked to start or continue
      adequate diet and exercise.
