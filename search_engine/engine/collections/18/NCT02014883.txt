      - to evaluate the capacity of triheptano誰n to improve the condition of patients with GLUT1-DS

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  to confirm the short-term safety of triheptano誰n therapy in patients with GLUT1-DS

        -  to evaluate the short-term effects of triheptano誰n treatment on motor function,
           autonomy, quality of life and clinical signs of patients with GLUT1-DS

        -  to evaluate the effect of triheptano誰n on brain energy metabolism using non-invasive
           31P-MRS spectroscopy after activation of the occipital cortex in order to measure the
           levels of high-energy phosphates (such as ATP and phosphocreatine)
