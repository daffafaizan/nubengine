    
      This study is designed as a placebo-controlled study of golimumab monotherapy for the purpose
      of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of golimumab, a new, fully human anti-TNF
      (Tumor necrosis factor) a monoclonal antibody produced by mean of HuMab mouse technology.
      Other reasons for using the study design are as follows: the effects of golimumab given alone
      must be confirmed as in the case of other drugs; and golimumab may be used even in patients
      not on the treatment with methotrexate (MTX). There will be 3 treatment groups in the study
      as follows: CNTO148 50 mg group, CNTO 148 100 mg group, and Placebo group.
