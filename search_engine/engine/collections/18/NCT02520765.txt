      diseases has been demonstrated. Obesity as it relates to infertility is also being studied
      All these studies used body mass index (BMI) to determine obesity. Although it is the most
      commonly used parameter to measure obesity, BMI does not provide an accurate measure of a
      person's body composition, including body fat.

      Almost all studies conducted on this subject used body mass index (BMI) as the measure of
      obesity; however, using only BMI might be the wrong strategy. Interestingly, some studies on
      the cardiovascular system found protective effects of BMI and as a result a new term,
      'obesity paradox,' emerged. Later studies used waist-to-hip (W/H) ratio and wrist
      circumference (WC) as a measure of obesity, and showed the exact effect of body fat
      distribution and obesity on the cardiovascular system
