    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the response rate to liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride versus liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate alone in patients with
           platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary
           peritoneal cavity cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  To determine the toxicity of these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease
      (platinum-refractory disease vs platinum-resistant disease. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate IV over 60 minutes on
           day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment
           repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin citrate IV over 60 minutes on
           day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who experience clinical benefit after completion of 6 courses of chemotherapy may
      continue therapy at the discretion of the investigator.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ30 and QLQ-OV28) at baseline,
      during, and after completion of study therapy. After completion of study treatment, patients
      are followed up every 3 months for up to 1 year.
