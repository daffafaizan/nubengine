      somatostatin receptors. Somatostatin analog PET tracers, such as 68Ga-DOTANOC, may be able to
      identify these pulmonary granulomas. Although currently used for other medical indications,
      68Ga-DOTANOC PET scanning has not previously been used to detect TB lesions.

      This is a pilot study which aims to assess the ability of 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/MRI to detect
      pulmonary lesions in individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis. The 68Ga-DOTANOC PET
      scan and 'standard' 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scan will be compared to enable analysis of
      differences in uptake between these tracers in terms of number, size and distribution of
      lesions.

      Demonstrating the clinical utility of 68Ga-DOTANOC in active pulmonary TB is necessary prior
      to using this PET tracer to further explore other potential uses in TB such as identifying
      individuals with latent TB who are at risk of progressing to active TB, measuring therapeutic
      response to TB treatment and identifying extrapulmonary lesions.
