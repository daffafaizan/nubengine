      fibers called A-delta fibers. A-delta fibers send signals to the brain about pin-prick type
      of pain and temperature. The investigators want to study whether the investigators can
      stimulate A-delta fibers and document this by recording electrical potentials from the nerves
      in subjects' limbs.

      Study Procedures:

      A small piece of plastic will be applied to your foot and your hand. A tiny sharp tip
      protrudes from this piece of plastic. You will be barely able to feel this sharp tip when
      touching the piece of plastic. This is the electrode for intra-epidermal stimulation.

      With stimulation, you will feel a pin-prick type of sensation. The stimulus will be adjusted
      so that you barely feel the pin-prick type of sensation. The investigators will record
      responses of stimulation from nerves in your skin.
