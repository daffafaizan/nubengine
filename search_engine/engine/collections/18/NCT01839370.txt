      strategy for closed-loop glucose control supervised by a safety system is coupled with a
      standard amylin replacement therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes the resulting combined
      treatment will unify the benefits of both individual therapies. In order to reduce post-meal
      blood glucose excursions in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, pramlintide (an analog of
      the human β-cell hormone, amylin) has been utilized, thus dealing with the problem or meal
      hyperglycemia more effectively than insulin infusion alone. Pramlintide has been successful
      in maintaining more normal blood glucose concentrations by significantly improving the
      postprandial glucose excursions in these patients when added to their mealtime insulin to
      mimic more closely the diurnal β-cell secretory pattern seen in normal physiology. However,
      pramlintide treatment can result in post-prandial hypoglycemia primarily due to overbolusing
      with insulin. Closed-loop systems have shown potential for significantly reducing
      hypoglycemia. A combined closed-loop insulin + pramlintide therapy could provide advantages
      over each of the individual therapies, and may also provide certain benefits with respect to
      weight control and improvement in sense of well being while decreasing glucose variability. A
      potentially important secondary benefit of combining the pramlintide treatment with a precise
      insulin delivery by the closed-loop system is that, based upon animal studies performed by
      the research team, a moderate inhibition of glucagon, as is usually achieved with pramlintide
      treatment, is anticipated to potentially improve the safety of insulin treatment as well by
      enhancing the glucagon response to hypoglycemia, which are usually impaired in type 1
      diabetes, if it should occur in the early postprandial period.
