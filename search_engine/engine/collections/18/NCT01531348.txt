      Patients may lose vision since they were young or later in life. Currently, there are more
      than 60 genes identified as the cause of this condition, one of which, RPE65, has been
      studied in several gene therapy trials for Leber congenital amaurosis with promising results.
      Another treatment approach for RP is stem cell therapy. Studies in animal models of RP have
      shown that subretinal injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells may delay
      degenerative changes of photoreceptor cells.
