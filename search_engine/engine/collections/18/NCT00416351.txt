      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine in patients with relapsed or
           refractory T-cell or natural killer-cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug, in terms of response rate, in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, non-randomized, dose-escalation study followed by an open-label,
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive clofarabine IV over 1 hour once daily on days 1-3. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease or partial response (PR) or
           complete response (CR) may receive 2 additional courses of treatment. Patients with PR
           or CR after completing 4 courses of therapy may receive 2 additional courses.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of clofarabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive clofarabine as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
