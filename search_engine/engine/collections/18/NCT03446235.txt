      enrolled at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. All enrolled subjects receive wearable monitoring devices
      with remote tracking capability and brochure regarding nutrition and physical exercise with
      basic instruction. Subjects are randomly assigned to connected health care group versus
      self-monitoring group. Connected health care group will have 2 interviews about physical
      exercise and 6 communications with individualized instruction and counseling of their
      exercise including the usage of the monitoring devices. Self-monitoring group will do
      physical exercise following the initial basic instruction and self-monitor them.

      All subjects visit Mayo Clinic to get outcome measures at 0, 12, and 24weeks. Outcome
      measures will be compared before, at 12 weeks, and after the 24 weeks of the fitness program.
