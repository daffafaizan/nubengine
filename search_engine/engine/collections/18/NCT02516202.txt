      Trials network was established in 2009. By the end of 2014, the network completed 4 clinical
      trials testing 7 interventions in approximately 1000 women ages 40-62 with vasomotor (VMS)
      and other menopause symptoms.

      The current trial will evaluate a relatively understudied area of menopause - vaginal health
      and sexual function. This is a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial
      among postmenopausal women ages 45-70.

      Our primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of ultra-low dose vaginal estradiol (Vagifem
      10 mcg), non-hormonal hydrophilic non-prescriptive vaginal gel (Replens) and placebo in
      reducing the Most Bothersome Symptom (MBS) severity. Choices for MBS include vulvovaginal
      itching, pain, dryness, irritation, or pain with penetration.

      Secondary aims include an evaluation of a composite score of vaginal symptoms, sexual
      function, treatment satisfaction, menopause quality of life, and objective measures of
      genitourinary atrophy. We will also create a biorepository of vaginal and blood specimens. In
      a subset of women, we will examine whether treatment response is related to: a) the
      post-menopausal vaginal microbiome; b) vaginal mucosal inflammation; and c) reproductive
      hormone profiles. The in-depth focus on the mechanisms associated with postmenopausal vaginal
      symptoms will use state of the art microbiologic techniques on longitudinally collected
      biologic specimens and will guide future translational studies.
