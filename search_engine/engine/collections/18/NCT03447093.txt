      disease (GD). Studies have shown that autoimmune thyroiditis is closely related to
      microbiological disorders. Intestinal microelements Both ecology and oral microecology belong
      to the category of microorganisms. It has been reported in the literature that intestinal
      microecology occurs disorder of autoimmune thyroiditis. However, there is no report on the
      correlation between oral microecology and autoimmune thyroiditis. When oral microbe flora
      When the immune system is disrupted, the immune balance is broken, the immune system is
      over-active, and the autoimmune disease (AID) is lost to the autoantigens and non-pathogenic
      commensal microbial flora antigens, including rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome,
      systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and allergic diseases. However, the
      association between oral microbial flora and AITD remains unclear. . Therefore, the research
      group will carry out the correlation between oral microbial flora and AITD.
