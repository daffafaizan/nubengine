      plays an important role in atherosclerosis development and it could be one of the mechanisms
      linking psychological stress and cardiovascular diseases.

      We plan to include 32 healthy subjects. (16 in every group). One group with subjects at age
      20 - 49 and the other group with subjects at age 50 - 70 years.

      The aim of the study will be to assess the acute and chronic effect of a standard short
      mental stress (2-minute Bondet Test) on platelet function and of the level of endothelin-1,
      catecholamines and cortisol. We plan to evaluate if age may play a role in the effect of
      psychological stress on platelet function.
