      I. To compare the recurrence-free survival of women receiving tamoxifen or thalidomide for
      epithelial ovarian cancer, cancer of the fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma who
      are in complete clinical remission following front-line treatment but have a high risk of
      recurrence due to rising serum CA-125.

      II. To compare the toxicities and complications of these treatments.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether changes in serum biomarker levels including VEGF and/or bFGF are
      independent of the randomization treatment.

      II. To determine whether serum and plasma biomarker levels including VEGF and/or bFGF are
      associated with the duration of recurrence-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the
      interval between completion of front-line chemotherapy and appearance of biochemical
      progression (6 months or less vs more than 6 months). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral tamoxifen twice daily on days 1-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional therapy beyond 1 year
      at the investigator's discretion.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
