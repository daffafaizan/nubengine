      transforaminal injections with cortisone or local anesthetic in a short term, 6-week,
      follow-up after using a series of three injections of cervical transforaminal glucocorticoid
      vs. local anesthetic. No study available thus far has evaluated and compared the long-term
      effect of these two treatments (glucocorticoid vs. local anesthetics). The investigators aim
      is to verify if there are responders and non-responders to this type of steroid injections.
      100 patients with MRI-verified nerve root compression caused by spondylosis or disc
      herniation and a history of radiculopathy with or without neck pain and muscle weakness will
      be included. The participants will be included if they showed at least 50% pain reduction in
      visual analogue scale (VAS) within 30 min of a diagnostic nerve root block with local
      anesthetic only. The participants will be blinded and randomized to each treatment group.
      Pain, muscle weakness, disability and quality of life will be evaluated. Follow-up will be
      made at 3 and 6 months.
