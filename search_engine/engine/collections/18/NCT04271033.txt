    
      Independent investigator initiated, academic, single arm, open-label, non-randomized,
      prospective, multicenter, multispecialty trial of CGuard™ routine use in all-comer population
      of consecutive patients with symptomatic or increased-stroke-risk asymptomatic carotid
      stenosis.

      Increased-stroke-risk is defined as the following patient and/or lesion characteristics:

      thrombus containing, documented progressive, irregular, ulcerated lesion; evidence of
      ipsilateral ischemic cerebral injury in MRI or CT imaging; contralateral stroke in relation
      to carotid stenosis; contralateral artery occlusion.

      The main objective of this observational study is to evaluate (1) the periprocedural
      feasibility and efficacy of CGuard™ stent system in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis
      (2) long-term efficacy and safety of routine CGuard™ stent system use.

      The study hypothesis is that the novel CGuard™ MicroNet® covered stent is safe and effective
      for a majority of consecutive patients considered to require carotid revascularization.
