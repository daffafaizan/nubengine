      therapy to an educational intervention of behavioral modification including pelvic floor
      exercise (PFE) in a cohort of 40 Parkinson's subjects over the age of 30 with overactive
      bladder (OAB). Active drug will be Mirabegron 25 mg daily with up-titration to 50 mg daily
      after 5 weeks. Subjects will be enrolled based on response to an overactive bladder
      questionnaire at visit 2.

      Enrolled subjects will have 4 study visits to the clinic as well as 2 phone visits.

      Enrolled subjects will be asked to record urinary symptoms and pelvic floor exercises in a
      diary at 3 separate time points for a 72 hour period.
