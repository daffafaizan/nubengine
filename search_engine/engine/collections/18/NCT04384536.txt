    
      In each session, 20 ml of local anesthetic (1:100 mixture of 10 mg/mL procaine) was used.
      Local injections, C5-T8 segmental injections, trigger point injections of the forearm muscles
      and stellate ganglion injections were applied in each session, using a 27-gauge, 4-6 cm
      needle. The local injection was applied first in the first extensor compartment at the point
      of maximal tenderness and was directed proximally toward the radial styloid (3 mL of the
      mixture). Then the forearm muscles were investigated by palpation to determine the trigger
      points. If any trigger point was detected, approximately 5 mL lidocaine was injected to that
      point. C5-T8 segmental injections were applied intradermally to each spinous process and to
      0.5-2 cm lateral of each process on the affected side (approximately 0.25-0.5 ml per
      injection). Finally, the stellate ganglion injection was applied using Fischer's modified
      technique. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was palpated by the physician between the middle
      and distal third, gently pulling the muscle laterally with the neurovascular bundle.
      Following palpation of the anterior tubercle of the transverse process of the sixth cervical
      vertebra, the cervical spine was extended and rotated 45째 to the opposite side. The needle
      entry point was 1 mm below the tubercle, then the needle was directed 45째 caudally, 45째
      medially and 45째 dorsally. If the aspiration was negative, 3mL procaine was injected
