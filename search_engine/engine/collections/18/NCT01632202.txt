      NewYork Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center and Weill Medical College of
      Cornell University. The investigators will enroll 328 pre- menopausal patients (>18years)
      with documented submucosal myomas undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy with monopolar
      resection in this study.

      The investigators anticipate that approximately 30% of the patients undergoing myomectomy
      will form intrauterine adhesions and that administration of the Seprafilm slurry will reduce
      the incidence to approximately 15%.

      Patients will be queried on post-operative days 1, 7, and 30 for pain/discomfort and the
      degree of intrauterine adhesions will be assessed after the patient's second menses (75-90
      days post procedure).
