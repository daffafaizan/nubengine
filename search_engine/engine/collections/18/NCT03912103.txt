      at the first consultation and end 30 days after.

      Patients that meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are invited to
      participate. After signing a written informed consent, the participants are block randomized
      to either the intervention or control group.

      Medication prescription for comorbid patients is challenging and may be attributed to marked
      inter-individual variations in general health, organ function, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties, biological age and physical performance. The intervention group
      receive a medication review.

      It is hypothesized that the intervention is feasible and more patients in the intervention
      group will complete ≥1 deprescribing and/or ≥1 medication optimization 30 days after the
      beginning of the intervention than the patients in the control group.

      Secondary it is hypothesized the patients in the intervention group:

      A. Complete more deprescribing compared to the control group (30 days after intervention) B.
      Complete more medication optimization compared to the control group (30 days after
      intervention) C. Have a higher knowledge about own medication (14 days after intervention) D.
      Have a higher level of satisfaction with medication information (14 days after intervention)
