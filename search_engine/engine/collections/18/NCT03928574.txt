      blocks of the MBCN and the ICBN in the axillary fossa. Our hypothesis was that the proportion
      of patients with complete anesthesia in the entire posteromedial and anteromedial surface of
      the arm would be greater if a USG technique were used, compared with a conventional
      technique. The secondary objectives were onset time of complete anesthesia, volume of local
      anesthetic used for the procedure, tourniquet tolerance during surgery, and ultrasound
      visibility of MBCN and ICBN.
