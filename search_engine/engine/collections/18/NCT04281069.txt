      with diabetes in the Oujda region.

      This 2-year project will tackle the prerequisites and optimise the conditions needed to start
      a larger (TEAM) project. Afterwards, in the larger long-term (TEAM) project we will study the
      cost-of illness of T2D in Oujda, the effect of a cultural-sensitive multidisciplinary
      intervention for T2D and the cost-effectiveness of such an intervention. In doing so we hope
      to provide not only arguments from a health perspective for such an approach, but also from a
      quality of life and economic point of view. This is needed to persuade political decision
      makers to invest in sustainable innovation in health care. This could open the job market for
      many young physiotherapists, nutritionists and occupational therapists in health centres and
      primary care.

      The specific objectives of this 2-year SI project are 1) to know the characteristics of T2D
      patients in Oujda and their perceived barriers and benefits towards participation in a
      lifestyle program and 2) to improve communication and cooperation between health
      professionals of different disciplines treating patients with T2D.

      The intermediate results of this 2-year project are well defined and feasible (Annex 4). The
      two years of the SI project will be devoted to gathering information from diabetic women as
      well as from health profes-sionals, to creating a platform and to strengthening research
      capacities. The changes needed to reach the SI project outputs are related to 1)
      knowledge/capacity and 2) attitude/behaviour.
