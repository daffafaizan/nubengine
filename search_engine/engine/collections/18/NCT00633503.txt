    
      Objectives:

        1. To develop a safe, non-contact, intra-operative & post-operative device, which can be
           used as an adjunct to the clinical evaluation of tissue transfer flaps after
           reconstructive surgery.

        2. To develop an adjunctive device that can reliably detect and distinguish arterial and
           venous occlusion before the clinical manifestations of such occlusions, and thus provide
           the scientific basis for future studies which may use the device to potentially improve
           the salvage rates after re-exploration for such complications.

        3. To evaluate if changes in the optical properties of tissue transfer flaps during the
           immediate post-operative period can be used to predict the development of late
           complications of tissue transfer flaps, such as the development of fat necrosis and/or
           flap atrophy.

      Specific aims:

        1. To record intra-operative and post-operative images of pedicle and free tissue transfer
           flaps used in reconstructive surgery with a device that shines low energy near infrared
           light that is spatially modulated into a sinusoidal configuration of amplitude called
           Modulated Imaging (MI).

        2. To study if the MI device described above is able to collect data regarding the optical
           properties of the tissue transfer flaps, which can then be used to detect acute
           post-operative occlusion of the artery or of the vein going to and from the tissue
           transfer flap.

        3. To study if there is a correlation between the immediate post-operative optical
           properties of tissue transfer flaps and the development of late complications such as
           fat necrosis and flap atrophy.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Prior authors have demonstrated that tissue spectroscopy can be used in both animal &
           human experiments to detect and differentiate between tissue transfer flaps with
           adequate vascular supply vs. flaps with either artery and/or vein occlusions prior to
           the detection of such complications using standard clinical observation during the
           post-operative period. These authors demonstrated that detection of the changes from
           baseline values in the post-operative period of the total hemoglobin [Hb-total],
           deoxygenated hemoglobin [Hb-deoxy], and oxygenated hemoglobin [Hb-O2] concentrations
           using tissue spectroscopy correlated with the clinical development of arterial or venous
           occlusion. 1,2 As the MI device developed at the Beckman Laser Institute has been
           demonstrated to be able to detect the [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy] and [Hb-O2] as well as the
           concentration of water,[H2O] in a non-contact manner; we believe the MI device will also
           be able to detect development of arterial and/ or venous occlusion in tissue transfer
           flaps without requiring direct tissue contact with a tissue spectroscopy device, as was
           the case with the instruments used by other authors.3, 4

        2. There are higher rates of fat necrosis and flap atrophy that occur after specific types
           of free tissue transfer flaps, [i.e., higher rates occur with Deep Inferior Epigastric
           Perforator (DIEP) flaps vs. Transverse Rectus Abdominis (TRAM) flaps.5, 6 Some authors
           have suggested that early flap congestion and the development of late fat necrosis may
           be due to venous insufficiency, without complete venous occlusion 7. We hypothesize that
           early post-operative changes in the flap's optical properties may be used to predict the
           development of late complications such as fat necrosis and flap atrophy, as these
           complications are thought to be due to a relative arterial and/or venous insufficiency
           to the tissue transfer flap; and thus should be reflected in the tissue's optical
           properties as detected by the MI device.

      Rationale: The use of tissue pedicle and free tissue transfer flaps allows for increased
      reconstructive possibilities for patients that have had disfigurement or loss of function
      after trauma or oncological surgical resection. Generally, the process of creating a pedicle
      tissue transfer flap involves the isolation of tissues onto a single artery and vein and then
      rotating this tissue from the donor site to the site requiring reconstruction. A free tissue
      transfer flap involves a process similar to the creation of a pedicle flap except that the
      artery and vein going to the flap's tissues are divided and re-implanted at the site of
      reconstruction. This process of using tissue transfer flaps however has known complications,
      including acute complications such as arterial or venous occlusion and late complications
      such as the development of fat necrosis and flap atrophy.

      Acute complications involving the vascular structures of the flap can be either partial or
      complete occlusion of the artery or vein going to and from the tissue flap. Both pedicle and
      free tissue transfer flaps can develop severe complications if either the artery or vein is
      compromised, including complete death of the tissue in the flap. If the vascular structures
      going to the flap(s) are compromised then the tissues used for reconstructive surgery may
      undergo damage. This tissue damage can become extensive and result in the loss of part or the
      entire tissue mass in the tissue transfer flap, which in turn can result in increased
      morbidity and mortality to the patient. In the reconstructive surgery literature, it has been
      shown that frequent monitoring during the first 48-72 hours after reconstructive surgery
      allows for early detection and intervention when a vascular compromised flap occurs. This
      earlier detection then can translate into earlier interventions including surgical
      re-exploration, which has been shown to improve the salvage rates of vascular compromise of
      the tissue transfer flaps.8, 9 It is generally known that venous thrombosis has a worse
      out-come, when compared to arterial thrombosis after surgical re-exploration and
      reestablishment of blood flow. This difference between arterial and venous thrombosis is
      thought to be due to the differences in the pathophysiology involved in venous congestion. In
      venous thrombosis tissue fluid content is increased due to initially continued arterial
      inflow, thus when venous out-flow is re-established the tissue edema continues to inhibit the
      diffusion of oxygen through the interstitial space from the capillaries to the tissue cells
      in the vascular beds were edema remains. The fact that venous thrombosis is more difficult to
      clinically detect early may also contribute to the poorer prognosis associated with venous
      thrombosis when compared to arterial thrombosis.10

      Given the difficulty of early detection of venous thrombosis, and of the decreased rates of
      successful salvage after surgical re-exploration for venous thrombosis, authors have employed
      successfully the use of tissue spectroscopy to detect venous thrombosis several hours before
      the clinical manifestations of thrombosis 2. These authors employed a spectroscopy device,
      which requires direct contact with the tissues being evaluated and only provided a small
      surface area in which the tissue flap's optical properties were measured. The device,
      however, is able to provide both diffuse optical tomography and rapid wide-field quantitative
      mapping of the tissue's optical properties in a single measurement platform through a device
      that does not require direct contact with the tissues being evaluated 3, 11. As theMI device
      is a new novel device developed at the Beckman laser Institute and has not been used to
      evaluate human tissue transfer flaps this would be a pilot study. This pilot study would seek
      to determine if this specific device is also able to detect vascular occlusion prior to
      clinical detection of such occlusion, as well as to differentiate between arterial and venous
      occlusions in a similar manner to other devices used by other authors, which employed tissue
      spectroscopy to monitor tissue transfer flaps.

      As mentioned above, delayed complications can develop after tissue transfer flaps are used in
      reconstructive surgery, which include fat necrosis and flap atrophy. These late complications
      are thought to be caused by a relative vascular insufficiency supplying the flaps. It is
      proposed that the increased venous congestion and increased rates of fat necrosis with the
      use of DIEP flaps when compared to TRAM flaps in breast reconstruction is due to a relative
      venous insufficiency that is not diminished enough to cause flap loss, but is on occasion
      great enough to result in the development of fat necrosis 7. The late development of flap
      atrophy may also be due to a relative arterial or venous insufficiency that occurs at the
      time of surgical reconstruction, and results in a relative global tissue flap ischemia
      leading to the development of flap atrophy. One of the goals of this experiment is to
      determine if any characteristic of the optical properties in a tissue transfer flap in the
      near post-operative setting can predict the development of either fat necrosis or flap
      atrophy.

      The MI device is a novel unique device when compared to other spectroscopic devices used to
      study tissue transfer flaps. MI uses a non-contact optical imaging technology developed at
      the Beckman Laser Institute that has the unique capability of performing both diffuse optical
      tomography and rapid, wide-field quantitative mapping of tissue optical properties within a
      single measurement platform. While other non-contact spectroscopic devices use a
      time-modulation methods, MI alternatively uses spatially modulated illumination for imaging
      of tissue constituents. The MI system consists of 1) a light projection system that
      illuminates the tissue with spatial sinusoid patterns, and 2) a CCD camera, which collects
      the diffusely reflected light in a non-contact geometry. The wavelength of illumination can
      be selected by bandpass filtering of a broadband source (i.e. tungsten lamp), or by use of a
      monochromatic source (i.e. laser diode). Lastly, tissue fluorescence measurements can be
      performed by placing a combination of source-blocking and bandpass emission filters in front
      of the camera. 3, 11

      The diffusely reflected amplitude of the modulated wave carries both optical property
      (absorption, fluorescence, scattering) and depth information. Specifically, the sampling
      depth of the spatially modulated wave is a function of the frequency of illumination and the
      tissue optical properties. This shares many analogies to the broadband frequency-domain
      photon migration (FDPM) approach. {12, 13} Consequently, measurement of multiple spatial
      frequencies (periodicities) allows MI to perform two functions. First, use of a wide range of
      frequency patterns allows depth-selective imaging and thus tomography of the internal 3D
      tissue structure. Secondly, it can rapidly and quantitatively map optical absorption,
      fluorescence yield, and scattering coefficients in near-real time, with high resolution and
      over a wide field-of-view.

      The ability to separate optical absorption from scattering distinguishes MI from conventional
      planar reflectance imaging methods. Absorption and scattering maps can be used to
      characterize the tissue's biochemical composition and structure. We have shown that these
      intrinsic tissue contrast elements vary with tissue types, and their wavelength dependence
      provides spectral "fingerprinting" that can be used to delineate the spatial relationships
      among tissues with different optical properties and can be used to determine the amount of
      H2O, [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy], [Hb-O2] & Tissue Oxygen Saturation [StO2]. MI is able to detect
      the concentration of [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy] & [Hb-O2] in absolute amounts in units of
      millimoles / unit volume of tissue measured. MI is also able to determine the percent
      fraction of mass, which is comprised of H2O in terms of percent mass.11, 14. This feature is
      critical to the performance of MI as a quantitative diagnostic method and, when combined with
      its tomographic capabilities, underscores the uniqueness of the method, and its potential use
      as a monitoring and diagnostic device to evaluate tissue transfer flaps after reconstructive
      surgery.
