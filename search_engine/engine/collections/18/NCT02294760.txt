    
      Twenty two patients with IBS-D or IBS-M according to the ROME III criteria, will be enrolled
      by invitation in the study.

      Having meet inclusion criteria, the patients are first set subsensory for 4 weeks and then
      randomised to receive either OFF-subsensory or subsensory-OFF stimulation in a 4+4-week
      period.

      During the PNE test the effect of the stimulation is evaluated by specific IBS symptom and
