      attempts, even after the medical treatment at critical emergency unit. To examine the
      effectiveness of continuous follow-up care by case manager after the suicide attempt, a
      randomized, controlled, multicenter trial by J-MISP (Japanese Multimodal Intervention
      Trials).This research project is one of the strategic research projects funded by The
      Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. In this study, J-MISP will implement the
      intervention for suicide attempters, a considerably high-risk group of further suicide
      attempts, who are transported by emergency services.
