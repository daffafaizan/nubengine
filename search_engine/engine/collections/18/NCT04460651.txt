      infection rates and, consequently, COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. To date,
      there is no available effective treatment to avoid or reduce infection (vaccines or viral
      inhibitors), to reduce or eliminate viral intracellular replication (antivirals) or to
      mitigate the inflammatory cascade or the subsequent cytokine storm (immunomodulatory drugs)
      associated with high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates although a press release of a
      multicenter trial showed that low-dose dexamethasone in high-risk patients was associated
      with a reduction in mortality.

      A simple strategy that can be globally implemented becomes necessary to minimize COVID-19
      pandemic consequences on healthcare until an efficacious vaccine is available. Icosapent
      ethyl (IPE) at high doses has proven to be effective to reduce cardiovascular events in
      patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. In the context of COVID-19, IPE could also
      be useful at pre-hospital and hospital stages due to its potential anti-inflammatory and
      antiviral effects.

      High-level exposure and infection risk among health-care providers, as well as the
      fundamental need for their active role under the current pandemic, make the search for tools
      to reduce or avoid infection, or its clinical manifestations, a priority.

      We have, therefore, designed a study with a simple, pragmatic, and universally applicable
      strategy with IPE at high doses intended to reduce infection and subsequent morbidity and
      mortality among subjects at high risk of infection due to SARS-CoV-2.
