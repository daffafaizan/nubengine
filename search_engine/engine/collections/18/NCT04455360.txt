      from Covid-19 related organ failure. Patients who survive a period of critical illness have a
      disproportionately high chance of suffering from significant and persistant poor
      psychological outcomes.

      Eye-Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) has reduced incidence of psychological
      morbidity in war veterans and victims of man-made and natural disasters. Small studies have
      also shown it to be effective in healthcare settings, within the Emergency department,
      following cancer diagnosis and implantation of cardioverter defibrillators. EMDR is validated
      by UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidance for use in treating adult onset
      PTSD.

      Because of ongoing social distancing guidance our study programme aims to investigate whether
      it is feasible to treat patients with an early online Eye Movement Desensitisation
      Reprocessing (EMDR) intervention, delivered soon after hospital discharge and whether this
      intervention will improve psychological outcome for survivors of critical illness.
