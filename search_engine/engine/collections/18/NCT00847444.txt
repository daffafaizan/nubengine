    
      Rationale:

        -  Taxane based chemotherapy will be established as treatment standard in the adjuvant
           setting of early breast cancer

        -  3xFEC100, followed by 3xDoc100 has been established as standard treatment option for
           node-positive breast cancer

        -  Anthracycline based regimens do not seem to be superior in Her2/neu-negative patients
           (Gennari et al., Slamon et al.)

        -  Dietary intervention can improve outcome in patients with early breast cancer (WINS,
           Chlebowski et al.)

      Primary Endpoints:

        -  The first primary objective of this study is to compare disease free survival after
           randomisation in patients treated with a combination of
           5-FU/Epirubicine/Cyclophosphamide followed by Docetaxel vs. Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide

        -  The second primary objective of this study is to compare disease free survival after
           randomisation in patients with vs. without lifestyle intervention

      Design:

      Prospectively randomized open label Phase III study with 2x2 factorial design
