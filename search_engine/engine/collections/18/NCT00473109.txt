      clotting after contact with the extracorporeal circuit. However, low molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH) or unfractioned heparin are contra-indicated in dialysis patients at risk for
      hemorrhagic complications. In this setting, several procedures theoretically allow dialysis
      without systemic heparinization, but randomized studies to compare them are lacking. The gold
      standard is the use of iterative rises of the extra corporeal circuit with isotonic saline ("
      rises "). Two emerging procedures are increasingly used : continuous pre-dilution of the
      arterial line (" pre-dilution ") and the use of a specific dialysis membrane (NEPHRAL 400 ST)
      coated with heparin immediately before use (" heparin adsorption ").

      We propose a monocentric prospective randomized open study to compare " rises ", "
      pre-dilution " and " heparin adsorption " in chronic hemodialysis patients with
      contra-indication to the use of LMWH. Main criteria will be extra-corporeal circuit clotting,
      with dialysis efficiency and tolerance as secondary criteria. Comparison will be made on
      grounds of " n-of-1 " trial, i.e. series of randomized cross-over tests in individuals. We
      have planned to include 75 patients in this study, with 1050 LMWH-free dialysis sessions.

      We hope to demonstrate chat by comparison wit rises, pre-dilution and heparin absorption
      techniques reduce the rate of extra-corporeal circuit by 30 and 50% respectively. We also
      hope to show that heparin adsorption (i) better preserves membrane integrity throughout the
      dialysis session, resulting in enhanced dialysis efficiency ; (ii) avoids extra fluid
      infusion and ultrafiltration, resulting in better dry weigh achievement and better clinical
      tolerance.
