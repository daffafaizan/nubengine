      severe dry eye disease. Subjects will be >18 years of age, diagnosed with moderate to severe
      dry eye (tear osmolarity > 320 mOsm/L and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score > 40), willing to
      adhere to twice daily dosing (BID) and follow up visit schedule, have no history of ocular
      pathology / degeneration / allergy, not on any T-cell modulatory therapy, not have instilled
      any artificial tears within 2 hours of study visit, and not participating in any concurrent
      clinical trials. All subjects will complete an informed consent form indicating their
      voluntary participation in the study.

      Study measurements will be made at baseline (first clinic visit), 2-, 6-, and 12-weeks
      following Lifitegrast therapy and include tear osmolarity (TearLab osmolarity system), VAS
      questionnaire, slit lamp examination for fluorescein corneal staining, tear break up time
      (TBUT), and Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) grading . At the end of the 3-mo study visit,
      the subjects will be informed of study completion and exited from the study.
