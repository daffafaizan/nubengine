      Investigators will collect plasma samples at 4 time points on all participants. These will be
      done at baseline (pre-dose), and 0.5-2 hours, 4-6 hours, and 22-24 hours after the first dose
      of BMZ is administered. Investigators will obtain serum for estriol measurement on all
      participants before or within 2 hours of antenatal corticosteroid administration and about 24
      hours after each dose is given (betamethasone is administered as 2 doses 24 hours apart).
      Investigators will obtain a saliva sample for measurement of estriol at the same times.
      Participants will be offered optional participation in a more detailed PK portion of the
      study. Participants who consent to this part of the study will have additional plasma samples
      obtained at a schedule of sampling of approximately 10-15 hours after the first dose and then
      6-8 hours, 24, and 48 hours after the 2nd dose. One sample will be collected at each of these
      times. At the time of delivery, umbilical cord blood will be collected before being discarded
      for DNA, serum and plasma. Four placenta sections will be collected. A maternal blood sample
      will also be obtained for serum and plasma. If the investigators are unable to obtain
      umbilical cord blood, a buccal swab will be collected from the baby for DNA extraction. A
      chart review will be done on the infant within 30 days of birth to review and record neonatal
      outcomes.
