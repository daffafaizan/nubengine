    
      The pilot study will lead to development of a future, large randomized controlled clinical
      trial, by fulfilling the following aims:

      Pilot Aim 1: Demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and ability to perform study procedures.

      Pilot Aim 2: Demonstrate the ability to measure accurately chronic disease risk factors such
      as diet, physical activity, weight gain, microbiome characteristics and inflammatory
      biomarkers.

      Pilot Aim 3: Provide preliminary results on the efficacy of gardens as a preventive
      intervention, and estimates for a detailed power analysis for the proposed subsequent larger
      trial.

      Aim 3a: Demonstrate that compared to non-gardeners, gardeners have 1) greater intake of
      fruits and vegetables; 2) better Healthy Eating Index (HEI); 3) lower Diet Inflammatory Index
      (DII); 4) reduced sedentary time and increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA);
      and reduced age-associated weight gain.

      Aim 3b: For gardeners and non-gardeners, sample garden soil, gut, skin, and oral microbiome
      at six time points from April through September to characterize and compare bacterial load,
      pathogenic taxa, taxonomic diversity, relative dominance, indicator taxa, and metabolomic
      results.

      Aim 3c: Demonstrate that gardening reduces inflammatory biomarkers linked to heart disease
      and cancer, including CRP, IL1b, IL4, IL6, IL10, and TNFa, and that the effect of gardening
      is mediated by diet, weight gain, physical activity and characteristics of the microbiome.
