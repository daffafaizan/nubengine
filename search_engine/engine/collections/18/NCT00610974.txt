      total, 20 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 types of
      body-weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) with the Lokomat, which differ only in the
      level of assistance that the Lokomat provides to the leg movements while walking. Therapy for
      both groups will take place 3 times/week for 12 weeks. During each session, participants will
      first complete a 10-minute warm-up period followed by 45 minutes of the assigned therapy.
      Rest breaks will be provided as needed, but participants should complete 45 minutes of
      walking per session.
