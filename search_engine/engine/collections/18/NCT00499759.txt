      Primary

        -  Determine the effects, in terms of fitness and blood parameters, fatigue levels, and
           quality of life, of an individualized prescriptive exercise intervention in patients
           with newly diagnosed acute or relapsed myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing
           chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility of developing an exercise program for these patients.

        -  Assess the changes in cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, selected blood
           parameters, and response of inflammatory proteins to exercise in these patients.

        -  Evaluate fatigue, depression, and quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients participate in an individualized prescriptive exercise intervention 3 to 4 times per
      week for 6 weeks (4 weeks in hospital, 2 weeks at home). Exercise begins concurrently with
      the first course (induction therapy) of chemotherapy. Each exercise session consist of 3-5
      minutes of light stretching (stretching component), 5-10 minutes of cycling on the recumbent
      bicycle (cardiorespiratory component), 5-15 minutes of resistance training including hand
      dumbbells, exercise tubing, rubber bands, and fit balls (resistance training component), and
      5-10 minutes of abdominal exercises (core muscles component).

      Quality of life, fatigue, and depression are assessed at baseline and weekly during study
      intervention.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and at weeks 3 and 6 for cytokine analysis.
