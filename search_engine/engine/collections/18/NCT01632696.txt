    
      Up to 12 patients (6 men and 6 women) will be enrolled in this open-label, single-arm, tumor
      imaging and dosimetry study of I-124 PGN650 in solid tumors. All eligible patients who give
      written, informed consent and meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, and
      whose laboratory results are within specified limits at the screening visit, will be
      enrolled. All study subjects will receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of I-124 PGN650.
      Study subjects will have whole body PET/CT imaging at three different timepoints with all
      patients having PET/CT at 0 to 60 minutes after injection of I-124 PGN650. Study subjects
      will then be assigned to either a 3 to 5-hour or 6 to 8-hour timepoint and either an 18 to 26
      hour or 42 to 52 hour post-injection timepoint. Tumor and whole body radioactivity
      distribution will be measured.
