    
      Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common joint disease in humans, is a significant cause of pain
      and disability. Non-pharmacological treatments for hip OA include education, exercise,
      appliances (walking sticks or insoles), and weight reduction if obese or overweight. Canes
      are often recommended to reduce adverse forces across joints although there is currently no
      research evidence regarding the efficacy of walking sticks for hip OA. Little information is
      available regarding the impact of walking aids on psychosocial function and quality of life
      in individuals with hip OA. This study will evaluate the effects of walking aids in hip OA by
      examining gait biomechanics, quality of life, pain, and opinions regarding using a cane.

      Comparisons: Compare gait biomechanics in people with symptomatic unilateral hip OA while
      walking with and without a cane at baseline and after 4 weeks of cane use. Compare gait
      biomechanics in people with symptomatic unilateral hip OA with and without a cane to those of
      healthy, age-matched controls. Compare pain and health-related quality of life in people with
      symptomatic unilateral hip OA following 4 weeks of cane use. Determine the association
      between changes in gait biomechanics, pain, and health-related quality of life in people with
      symptomatic unilateral hip OA following 4 weeks of cane use.
