      18 and 65 in the Polytrauma and TBI program who are greater than 1 year post injury prior to
      entering the study, will be recruited. After randomization participants in the intervention
      group will complete a 10 week bout of multidisciplinary wellness education, group discussion,
      and supervised exercise. The intervention will occur weekly and last up to 2 hours. The
      control group will complete a 10week comprehensive health education program simultaneously.
      All measures will be collected again, post intervention. A follow-up collection will occur at
      3 months post-intervention.
