      has been documented but it is not clear whether the benefits of iron supplements vary with
      age, gender or iron stores. To study this issue, individuals who are eligible to donate
      blood, based on hemoglobin level, will be randomized to receive daily iron supplements or no
      supplements. Randomization will be stratified on gender (male or female), age (<60 years old
      vs. at least 60 years old) and iron status (serum ferritin >26 vs serum ferritin no greater
      than 26). Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks with periodic blood draws to determine time
      to recovery of hemoglobin and iron stores. A 7 ml (about 1.5 teaspoons) blood sample will be
      drawn at each of seven study visits over the 24 weeks to track recovery of hemoglobin and
      iron.
