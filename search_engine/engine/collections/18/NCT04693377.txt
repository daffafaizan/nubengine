    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the efficacy of cryoablation in combination with stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) or SBRT only for the treatment of painful bone metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for narcotics utilization by daily morphine equivalent dose. II. To assess
      duration of pain response reported by International Pain Response Criteria.

      III. To assess for local tumor control. IV. To assess for changes in patient quality of life
      with Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) score.

      V. To assess for adverse event rates. VI. To assess incidence and severity of adverse
      events/toxicity. VII. To assess technical success for cryoablation.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the local microenvironmental changes following SBRT and cryoablation
      combined with SBRT to bone metastases.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy for 1 fraction.

      ARM B: Patients undergo cryoablation. Within 10 days after cryoablation, patients undergo
      stereotactic body radiation therapy for 1 fraction.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
      and 24 weeks.
