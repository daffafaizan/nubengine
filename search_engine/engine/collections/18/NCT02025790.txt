      and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Achalasia causes difficulty swallowing,
      regurgitation, and sometimes chest pain and weight loss. Endoscopic treatments of achalasia
      can be provided in the form of dilatation of the LES or cutting of muscle fibers (myotomy) of
      the esophagus and of the LES under endoscopic viewing. Dilatation in this trial is
      accomplished with rigiflex balloons and myotomy via Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM). The
      effectiveness of treatment of achalasia using each method will be compared in this trial.
