        -  Determine the joint occurrence of atypical hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma in patients
           diagnosed at initial biopsy to have complex atypical hyperplasia.

        -  Compare the histologic response rates in patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia
           treated with oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) vs intramuscular
           medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension (Depo-Provera) .

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, two-part study.

        -  Part A: Patients undergo immediate hysterectomy.

        -  Part B: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) once daily for 3
                months.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension (Depo- Provera)
                intramuscularly once monthly for 3 months (days 1, 31, and 62).

      Patients undergo hysterectomy at the end of the third month.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 360 patients for part A and 140 patients (70 per arm) for
      part B will be accrued for this study.
