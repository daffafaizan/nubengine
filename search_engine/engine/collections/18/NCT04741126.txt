      varies with motor level, proportionately improves the patient's ability to cough
      volitionally. Spinal cord injury also affects mucus clearance, the peak flow meter was used
      to assist the ability of cough and they also measure the peak cough flow (PFC).In the
      literature for the airway clearance, the following techniques were used, incentive
      spirometer, balloon, and blowing exercise, manually assisted cough technique active cycle of
      breathing exercise, postural drainage, autogenic drainage, positive expiratory pressure.
      There is increasing interest in strategies such as interval training that may provide a
      tolerable training load while maintaining an effective stimulus for adaptation. Manually
      assisted cough technique is used to enhance the cough strength, to help with mucus secretion
      it can be carried out in lying, side-lying, or sitting positions.it is important that clear
      secretion in order to maintain clear and healthy lungs, the risk of repeated chest infection
      and complication can be reduced which improve the quality of life. Manually assisted cough is
      a technique using strong arms to assist cough. This may be providing help in neuromuscular
      disease or spinal cord injury with weak respiratory and abdominal muscle.
