      cognitive rehabilitation effects on cerebral plasticity and quality of life remain unproven
      essentially because of methodological biases. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation is an
      innovative technique of noninvasive brain stimulation that showed efficacy in literature. The
      current study want to better understand cerebral plasticity mechanisms to optimize
      non-pharmacological rehabilitation approaches for patients with traumatic brain injury. The
      aim in the present study is to assess the effect of rehabilitation combined with Transcranial
      Direct Current Stimulation provided to traumatic brain injury patients with cognitive
      impairment on cerebral plasticity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Effects of
      rehabilitation and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation will be observed on functional
      magnetic resonance imaging activation maps acquired. Relationship between attentional
      outcomes measured in the neuropsychological assessment and activation extend will be
      explored.
