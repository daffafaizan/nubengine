      an estimated 500.000 deaths annually. The potential for the sudden emergence of pandemic
      influenza strains represents an incessant threat on even a larger scale. seasonal influenza
      vaccination is the backbone of influenza management. However, antibodies generated by
      vaccination, most often do not effectively neutralize emergent strains due to the high
      mutation rate of the influenza viral genome. In addition, although vaccination is effective
      in up to 85% of healthy adults, only 40-60% of the elderly are able to mount an protective
      antibody response due to an agerelated decline in immune function (so-called
      immunoscenescence). As a result, the protective effects of influenza vaccination are limited,
      and strategies to improve host immune defenses against influenza virus infection per se, and
      following influenza vaccination, are highly warranted.

      It is suggested that prior vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) could enhance
      resistance to other infectious diseases in addition to protection to tuberculosis (TBC) and,
      in mice, protection of prior BCGvaccination against influenza infection was demonstrated long
      ago. However, only recently substantial evidence for these nonspecific beneficial effects of
      BCG-vaccination in humans has been provided by several randomized clinical trials.
      Considering these potentiating effects of BCG-vaccination, it could be a viable strategy to
      improve efficacy of influenza vaccination, and/or enhance immune defenses against influenza
      virus infection per se. If so, this would have an enormous impact on clinical practice.
