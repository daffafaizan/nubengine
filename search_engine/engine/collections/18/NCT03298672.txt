    
      NDX-1017 is being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      This Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, first-in-human study will
      evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses of
      NDX-1017 in healthy young and elderly subjects, and elderly subjects with mild AD. The study
      contains the following two parts:

      Part A:

      A single-ascending dose (SAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting for 3 days in healthy
      young male and healthy elderly male and female volunteers evaluated in up to 7 dose cohorts
      to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) within the single dose range studied. Up to 56
      subjects (aged 18 to 45 years for young and 60 to 85 years for elderly) may be enrolled in
      Part A.

      Part B:

      A multiple ascending dose (MAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting for 10 days in male
      or female healthy elderly volunteers (aged 60 to 85 years) or subjects with amnestic mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (mild, mild-to-moderate, or moderate), or
      mixed dementia with Alzheimer's and vascular components (mild, mild-to-moderate, or moderate)
      (aged 40 to 85 years) in up to 6 dose cohorts that were proven tolerable in the SAD part of
      the study to identify the MTD within the multiple dose range studied. Up to 44 subjects (aged
      40 to 85 years) may be enrolled in Part B.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 28 days (or 90 days for amnestic MCI,
      Alzheimer's Disease, or mixed dementia with Alzheimer's and vascular components) prior to
      enrollment. Those eligible will be admitted to an inpatient facility for investigational
      product administration, safety monitoring, and collection of blood or urine for
      pharmacokinetic evaluations.
