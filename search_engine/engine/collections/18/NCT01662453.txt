    
      SUDEP stands for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy; a witnessed or unwitnessed,
      non-traumatic and non-drowning death occurring in benign circumstances, in a person with
      epilepsy with or without evidence of a seizure and excluding documented status epileptics
      (seizure duration of 130mins or longer, or seizures without recovery in between), in which a
      postmortem examination does not reveal a cause of death. SUDEP is not a cause of death so
      much as it is a descriptive term for a category of unexplained deaths in people with epilepsy
      or epilepsy-related conditions. Little is known about SUDEP and its mechanisms and risk
      factors.

      One of the main objectives of this study is to investigate the role of various risk factors
      in the development of sudden unexplained death in patients with epilepsy, with a particular
      focus on the role of antiepileptic medications. In addition, we want to elucidate the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to SUDEP.
