      with male patients affected significantly more often. Common risk factors are smoking,
      alcohol, viral infections, immunodeficiency or genetic factors. Locally advanced
      head-and-neck tumors can lead to severe symptoms such as dysphagia, cachexia and tumor pain
      with a significant decrease of the quality-of-life. The prognosis depends on multiple factors
      such as TNM-staging, tumor volume, histology, general condition, age and smoking. Further
      risk factors are positive resection margins, extracapsular extension and perineural invasion.
      While metastatic spread significantly decreases overall survival, the life-limiting problem
      in patients with head-and-neck cancer is locally invasive and destructive tumor growth
      leading to a decrease of the performance status and quality of life. After multimodal therapy
      of locally advanced head-and-neck tumors, around 30 - 50% of patients will develop local
      recurrence or locally progressive disease and up to 8% of patients with HNSCC will develop a
      second primary tumor in the head-and-neck .
