    
      Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma are treated with standard of care
      radiation and temozolomide, plus the addition of Bevacizumab and Tarceva. The dose of
      temozolomide, Bevacizumab and radiation are the same for all patients. Tarceva dose is based
      upon the use of enzyme inducing anti-epileptic agents. Tarceva is given daily; Bevacizumab is
      given every 2 weeks; radiation is for 6 weeks, and temozolomide is given daily during
      radiotherapy and then in the adjuvant setting, is given on a 5-day schedule every 28 days.
      Patients are followed for progression and survival. The measure of response is MR scanning
      every 2 months. Dose adjustments are based upon the specific toxicity of the agent in
      question which differs for each agent (Bevacizumab, temozolomide, or Tarceva). Patients are
      not randomized, but assigned to an arm based on use of anti-epileptic agents.
