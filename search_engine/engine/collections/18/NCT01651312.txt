    
      Four subjects are studied in one group. Each subject stays in the clinic for 6 days, and
      receives a single oral dose of 14C-labeled YM178. Blood, plasma, urine, feces and expired air
      are collected for 96h after dosing.

      If 14C-radioactivity quick counts show that radioactivity in urine or feces is above
      acceptable limits (ie. > 50 dpm/ml in urine; >75 dpm in 400 mg feces) on day 5, subjects are
      requested to stay in the clinic until the levels decrease. If, after 3 days, radioactivity is
      still > 50 dpm/ml in urine and/or >75 dpm in 400 mg feces, urine and/or feces is collected at
      home, until the amount of radioactivity decreases.
