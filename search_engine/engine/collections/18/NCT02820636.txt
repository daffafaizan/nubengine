      socio-cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for suicidal behavior (SCBT-SB) with Latino/a
      adolescents in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU). The SCBT-SB protocol was develop in
      Puerto Rico, but was expand to Latinx populations in U.S. based on a previous qualitative
      study. The SCBT-SB include developmental and cultural factors in order to optimize treatment
      outcomes in suicidal Latino/a adolescents. Study design: A pilot randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) of the SCBT-SB versus TAU was conducted in a real world scenario. Participants were 46
      Latino/a adolescents (13-17) admitted to a Psychiatric Unit for suicide ideation or suicide
      attempts, who were referred to outpatient care, and at least one legal guardian. RCT's
      primary question is: Is the SCBT-SB protocol feasible in terms of satisfaction,
      acceptability, recruitment, retention, and therapist adherence? RCT's secondary question is:
      What is the magnitude of difference in suicidality and psychopathology symptoms between the
      SCBT-SB and the TAU at three, six, and 12 months following baseline?
