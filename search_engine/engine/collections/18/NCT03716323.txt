      bone that has been selected and tested to be free of HIV and transmitted diseases. The most
      common allograft used is dematerialized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA), provide type I
      collagen, which comprises most of the organic component of bone. In addition, allograft
      contains BMPs, which stimulate osteoinduction. There are thirteen proteins have been
      identified (BMP1-BMP13) which are osteoinductive compounds and stimulate new bone formation.
      A previous study demonstrated that, a combination of osseous coagulum collected during
      preparation and freeze-dried bone allograft placed at immediate implant insertion and
      loading. Xenografts are one of the most successful and widely used grafting materials
      nowadays as a replacement for autogenous bone grafts. Studies showed that xenografts are very
      successful because of their osteoconductive properties, their denisty which provides
      stabilization to the graft and implant and they supply the necessary minerals for bone
      formation as xenograft don't resorb completely.
