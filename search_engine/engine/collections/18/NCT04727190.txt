      disposable guided sheath (including biopsy forceps and cell brushes) which have some
      limitations, such as big physical damage, small biopsy tissue, etc. Cryobiospy is a new
      technique for biopsy developed in recent years which has many advantages over conventional
      biopsy, such as larger tissue, higher diagnosis yield, less complication, etc. The
      investigators will explore the efficacy and safety of cryobiospy vs. biopsy forceps in GGO
      diagnosis. The study is designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial, 184 patients
      will be expected to enroll in the study and receive EBUS examination before biopsy to check
      whether the GGO lesions exist or not. This is a parallel-control study that patients with GGO
      lesions will be randomized to either TBCB group or TBFB group for biopsy. The primary aim is
      to compare the diagnostic yields of the two biopsy techniques. The secondary endpoint is to
      assess the tissue size, sampling time, number of sampling and the quality of specimen.
