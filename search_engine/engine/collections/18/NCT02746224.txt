    
      This is an interventional, controlled and randomized single-center clinical trial with
      patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer that will undergo laparoscopic left hemicolectomy
      or laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer.

      Methods:

      All patients included in the study (study 1) are randomized into two groups (group 1A and
      group 1B): in the group 1A the surgical technique initially dissects the inferior mesenteric
      vein (IMV) and in the group 1B the surgical technique initially dissects the inferior
      mesenteric artery.

      The patients who will undergo a colorectal anastomosis will be included in the study 2 and
      will be randomized to group 2A and group 2B: in group 2A the patients will have a
      latero-terminal colorectal anastomosis and in group 2B a termino-terminal colorectal
      anastomosis.

      Study hypothesis:

      Study 1: the surgical technique that initially dissects the IMV presents a greater number of
      total resected lymph nodes compared to the technique that initially dissects the IMA.

      Study 2: latero-terminal anorectal anastomosis has a better anorectal functional outcome than
      termino-terminal anorectal anastomosis.

      Primary outcome measures:

        -  Study 1:To compare the total number of resected lymph nodes and the distance to the
           surgical margins between the two arms (1A and 1B).

        -  Study 2: to compare the anorectal functional outcome at 12 months after surgery or
           ileostomy closure between the two arms (2A and 2B). The anorectal function will be
           assessed by the scores of the validated Colorectal Functional Outcome Questionnaire
           (COREFO) and the validated scale LARS (Syndrome anterior resection of the rectum).

      Secondary outcome measures:

        -  Study 1: to compare the duration of surgery, bleeding and need for surgical conversion
           between the two arms (1A and 1B). Another objectives are to compare the incidence of
           postoperative complications (measured by the Clavien-Dindo classification) and survival.

        -  Study 2: to compare the quality of life and anorectal functional outcomes at : 6, 12, 18
           and 24 months after intervention (or ileostomy closure) between the two arms (2A and
           2B). The anorectal function will be assessed by the validated COREFO questionnaire and
           the LARS scale. The quality of life will be assessed by the validated questionnaire of
           quality of life: SF-36. Another objective is to compare the incidence of postoperative
           complications assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification and the incidence of
           anastomotic leakage.

      Duration and follow up

      Study 1: the expected study duration is 6'5 years.

      Study 2: the expected duration of the study is 3'5 years.

      The planned duration of follow up in the study 1 is 5 years, in the study 2 is 2 years.
