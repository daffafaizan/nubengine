      control rate of 3D-CRT confined to the region of the lumpectomy cavity for patients with
      Stage I and IIa (less than or equal to 3 cm) carcinoma of the breast (non-lobular histology)
      treated with APBI using 3D-CRT before lumpectomy. This study also will test the feasibility
      of MRI-based treatment planning for preoperative accelerated partial breast irradiation and
      compare dosimetric data from treatment planning with patients treated on a previous
      institutional post-op APBI protocol. It will also look at overall survival rates. Correlative
      studies include measuring the changes in tumor gene expression and immune response to
      radiation therapy and correlate this with pathologic response.
