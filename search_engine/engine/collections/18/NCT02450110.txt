      guidelines-driven management or to control group on optimal management only. Spinal cord
      stimulation will be performed for 30 days, and outcome measures will be testes before
      stimulation, after 30 days stimulation and after 30 days of further follow-up. The control
      group will be studied at baseline and after 30 days only.
