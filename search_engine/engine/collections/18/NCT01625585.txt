      it is difficult to see and reach. Radiological imaging provides little details of small
      intestinal mucosa. Capsule endoscopy, introduced in 2001, enables gastroenterologists to
      visualize the entire small intestine from within for the first time, but it is only a
      diagnostic tool. Single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE) is a new enteroscopy methods that use an
      overtube with one balloon or a spiral to help pleat bowel onto the endoscope and allow
      examination of the distal small bowel. This methods allow for biopsy, hemostasis, and other
      therapeutic interventions to be performed in the small bowel. Early reports have been
      promising; with 50-70% diagnostic yield for small bowel pathology reported in the literature.
      However, despite these promising results the impact SBE findings on patient outcomes is not
      clear.
