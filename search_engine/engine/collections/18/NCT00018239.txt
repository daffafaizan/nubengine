      aerobic or resistive exercise. They will be instructed in a weight maintenance diet prior to
      beginning the exercise program, and maintain this diet throughout the study. Metabolic
      testing will be performed at baseline and after 6 months of exercise training. Testing will
      include measurement of body composition (anthropometry, dual-energy Xray absorptiometry,
      computed tomograph scan), maximal oxygen consumption, and muscle strength, glucose tolerance
      (oral glucose tolerance test), insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp), and
      muscle biopsies to examine skeletal muscle metabolic characteristics (fiber type
      distribution, capillary density, oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities, and levels of
      key proteins important in insulin signaling and glucose transport). Data will be analyzed
      using analysis of variance to determine differences between the two exercise groups, and
      multiple regression analysis to determine the primary adaptations that are associated with
      the improvements in whole body insulin action.
