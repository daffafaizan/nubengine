      and reduced general health status. It has been shown that these impairments may be reversible
      after cure of hypercortisolism. However, previous studies were restricted to selected CV
      aspects.

      The primary aim of the CV-CORT-EX study is to comprehensively assess left ventricular
      function and morphology of patients with endogenous CS. Secondly, we examine long-term
      changes of CV function, endothelial function, psychosocial status, bio-impedance, and quality
      of life.

      Within the longitudinal study, patients will be investigated at initial diagnosis and at
      least 6 months after cure of CS. Within the cross-sectional study, we aim to comprehensively
      phenotype patients with endogenous CS and unknown CV disease. Results will finally be
      compared with healthy controls.
