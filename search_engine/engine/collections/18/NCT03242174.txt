      receiving prenatal care in a non-traditional birth center and the impact of these behaviors
      on pregnancy and birth outcomes.Participants will be offered a questionnaire packet to
      complete at a prenatal appointment in the third trimester of pregnancy by their obstetrical
      prenatal care provider. The questionnaire packet will take approximately 10-15 minutes to
      complete.
