    
      Lyme disease is a multisystem illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and it is
      the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. This protocol is designed to offer
      evaluation, therapy and follow up to patients with Lyme disease. This is a natural history
      study, which has the objective of developing a rigorously defined population of patients with
      Lyme disease to serve as the basis of research in multiple aspects of the infection. These
      research sub-projects have emphasis in exploring the biological markers of Borrelia
      infections, assessment of clinical course and outcomes of patients with Lyme infection, and
      the immunological response to B. burgdorferi infection.
