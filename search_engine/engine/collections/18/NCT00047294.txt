        -  Determine the efficacy of adjuvant temozolomide, thalidomide, and celecoxib after
           radiotherapy, in terms of time to tumor progression and overall survival, in patients
           with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 and oral thalidomide once daily and
      oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.
