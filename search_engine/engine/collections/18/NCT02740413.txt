      treatment patterns and outcomes, as well as the related direct treatment costs in the
      populations of hemophilia patients treated with BeneFIX and ReFacto/ReFacto AF, and in
      subgroups (e.g. level of severity) at the MHC in Sweden.

      The study population will consist of all patients diagnosed with haemophilia (D66.9
      (haemophilia A) D67.9 (haemophilia B) in International Statistical Classification of Diseases

      have had at least one registered prescription of BeneFIX or ReFacto/ReFacto AF in the MHR
