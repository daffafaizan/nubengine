      pretest-posttest control design with 1 treatment arm and 1 control arm. Interpreted within
      the biopsychosocial model and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
      Health (ICF) framework, this research will measure the outcomes between patellofemoral pain
      syndrome (PFPS), the health condition, and contextual factors, particularly personal factors.
      It will address personal factors such as gender and age but will not address environmental
      factors. This research includes tests and measures of two of the three levels of human
      functioning, or domains, impairments to body functions and structures and activity
      limitations. Muscle strength testing is an impairment-level measure and pain-free deep squat
      range of morion (ROM) is an activity limitation-level measure.
