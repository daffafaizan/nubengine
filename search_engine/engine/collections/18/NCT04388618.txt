      study by introducing the concept for the patient and then taking consent. The patient will go
      through the regular flow of patients in the ED and after being asked to do the swabs the
      research assistant will start the process of the study by testing the smell by the NHANES
      cards then directly assess the taste by the NHANES strips and documents the results on the
      cards and ask the patient to take a photo with his mobile and send it with his name to the
      primary investigator via a mobile application and dedicated phone number. The research
      assistant is the same person who is going to take the nasopharyngeal swab for the COVID-19
      test. The cards are going to be collected in the negative pressure room of the patients and
      then discarded in the same room. The investigators in the study are not aware of which
      patient is answering what blinded investigator

      Taste exam measures in NHANES The NHANES chemosensory tests used regional and whole mouth
      taste intensities of bitter and salt tastants as measures of taste function, which were
      similar to those implemented in the NIH Toolbox norming study. These NHANES taste measures
      were selected based on their ability to capture genetic and environmentally mediated
      variation in taste and for their potential relevance to diet and health.

      Smell function in NHANES was assessed with an 8-item, odor identification test (Pocket Smell
      Testsâ„¢, Sensonics, Inc., Haddon Heights, NJ). Of many available psychophysical measures of
      olfactory function, odor identification tests are the most widely used in epidemiological and
      clinical settings, as they are quick, relatively inexpensive, and easy to administer. The
      odor identification test corresponds well with odor threshold tasks as well as other
      suprathreshold olfactory measures (e.g., discrimination, odor intensity), and hence is
      considered to be a rapid and accurate method for detecting olfactory dysfunction.
