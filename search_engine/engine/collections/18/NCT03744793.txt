      I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) in patients with (methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)
      MTAP-deficient metastatic urothelial cancer treated sequentially with pemetrexed and
      avelumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with
      MTAP-deficient metastatic urothelial cancer treated sequentially with pemetrexed and
      avelumab.

      II. To explore the effect of pemetrexed +/- avelumab on the immune system and tumor
      microenvironment including peripheral T-cells, tumor-infiltrating T-cells, macrophages, and
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemetrexed intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1. Starting cycle 2,
      patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 120 days, and then
      every 3 months for 2 years.
