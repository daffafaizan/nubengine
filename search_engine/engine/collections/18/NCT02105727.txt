      average salt consumption levels in the Lithgow population from 2011 to 2014. The primary null
      hypothesis to be tested is that there will be no difference between the mean 24-hour urinary
      sodium excretion levels between 2011 and 2014.

      The sample of 419 individuals with 24-hour urine samples in the baseline survey and 600
      individuals in the follow-up survey will provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.7
      g/day salt between the mean levels of excretion before and after the intervention. There will
      be more than 95% power to detect a difference of 1.0 g/day salt or greater.
