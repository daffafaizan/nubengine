      I. To assess the effectiveness of an online multidisciplinary psychological training program
      delivered via a smartphone-based application (the Untire app) in reducing patient-reported
      fatigue in cancer patients and survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-response association between use of the Untire app and reduction in
      patient-reported fatigue severity.

      II. To explore whether changes in positive and negative affect, depressive symptoms interact
      with the effects of the Untire app on fatigue severity.

      III. To explore the predictive value of genetic markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and
      personality characteristics for effectiveness of the Untire app in reducing patient-reported
      fatigue.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients use Untire application intervention after baseline up to 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients use Untire application intervention after 3 months up to 6 months.
