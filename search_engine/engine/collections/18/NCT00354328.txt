      Anti-Fibrotic Drug in Symptomatic patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) Associated
      with left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction and 96-H-0144, Double Blind Placebo-Controlled
      Study of Long-Term Effects of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (Enalapril) and
      Angiotensin II Receptor Blockade (Losartan) On Genetically-Induced Left Ventricular Diastolic
      Dysfunction were undertaken to assess the effect of therapeutic interventions on left
      ventricular (LV) diastolic function. The relationship between baseline measures of diastolic
      function as assessed by noninvasive modalities such as Doppler echocardiography and
      radionuclide angiography, and qualitative and objective measures of functional capacity in
      patients without LV outflow tract obstruction has not been reported. In this protocol we will
      look at measures of LV geometry, relaxation and novel indices of ventricular compliance as
      they may influence measures of exercise capacity. In all cases, we will use pre-existing
      baseline data obtained with informed consent as part of the above protocols.
