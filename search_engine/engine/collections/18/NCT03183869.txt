      vital signs, medical history and concomitant medications. Also before transplantation,
      patient's stool will be collected to study their microbial profile, blood collected for
      analysis to evaluate cytokines levels as well as blood DNA bacteria and finally, urinalysis
      to assess gut permeability (baseline). Other assessments (prior to the first dose of therapy)
      include an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), pregnancy test (if applicable), physical
      exam and ECG. Blood samples are also taken at month 1 in order to establish a baseline for
      routine chemistry/hematology. After all these assessments FMT will be performed by a trained
      nurse via a rectal enema.

      FMT for the early intervention group will be at V1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, V3 and V4. FMT randomized to
      late intervention group will be V4, 5, 6, 6.1.6.2, 6.3 and V7

      Both groups, at Visit 1, Visit 4 and Visit 7, patients will be instructed to drink lactulose
      solution and collect the urine throughout the previous night and first thing in the morning.
      A proper collecting bottle will be provided and will also undergo a contrast-enhanced brain
      MRI scan at Robarts Institute London Ontario.

      Those randomized to the Early Intervention group, will return to the clinic for visit 2, 1
      month after the first FMT(fecal microbial transplantation). Another stool sample to evaluate
      the microbial before the second FMT will be collected and peripheral blood samples for
      cytokines and blood bacterial DNA analysis. Both groups this same routine procedure repeated
      at visits 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.1.6.2, 6.3 and visit 7. Another safety assessment 2 weeks
      after FMT is to review any adverse events that may have occurred.

      Both groups will have an MRI at M1, M6 and M12.
