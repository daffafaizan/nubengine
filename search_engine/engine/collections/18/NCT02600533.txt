      research in to practice. Despite their significance, clinical trial participation rates
      remain low, especially among underrepresented minority groups. Several barriers exist to
      minority group participation in clinical trial, one of which lack of awareness about clinical
      trials. Video educational programs show promise as an effective strategy to increase
      knowledge and clinical trial participation. The specific aims are as follows:

        1. Measure the effects of an office-based, clinical trial education video on clinical trial
           knowledge and enrollment in clinical trials, in a clinical sample with no previous
           history of clinical trial participation.

        2. Determine the feasibility of implementing an office-based video educational program.
