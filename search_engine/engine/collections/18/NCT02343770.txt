      (5ml). The ProtoArray® Microarray allows to detect novel protein-protein interactions, to
      rapidly perform serum profiling using a sensitive method to detect potential autoantigen
      biomarkers. The ProtoArray® Human Protein Microarray is a high-density protein microarray
      containing thousands of purified human proteins for protein interaction screening.
