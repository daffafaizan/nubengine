      and administered scientifically validated questionnaires at study entry and during the
      observation period at specified intervals to determine the affect of the Portable Oxygen
      Concentrator on improvements in exercise capability, dyspnea and quality of life as primary
      endpoints, utilizing the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI), Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI), the
      Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) and six minute walk test (6MWT). The
      secondary endpoints will be rate of exacerbations, sleep quality (reported as number of hours
