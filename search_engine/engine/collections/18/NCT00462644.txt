      mg/kg) and succinylcholine (1mg/kg) for RSI. Patients on the other arm will receive standard
      therapy at this institution which consists of Versed (generic name midazolam) (5 mg) plus
      fentanyl (100 mcgs) as well as succinylcholine for RSI. Both drug regimens have a rapid
      onset, short duration and short half-life.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one arm of the study. The trauma nurse emergency room
      responders, intensive care unit staff, or helicopter crew will pull a study envelope which
      will contain a randomization to either the etomidate arm or standard therapy arm. The numbers
      will correspond to a log, delineating which medication is given. The nurse will document the
      medication as RSI Study Drug - etomidate or RSI Study Drug - standard and the randomization
      packet number (ie, RSI Study Drug, etomidate, #1, RSI Study Drug, standard, #2, etc.) and
      will document the patient's name and medical record number on the study log in either the
      helicopter or the ER Resuscitation Bay.

      Baseline cortisol level will be drawn prior to RSI. An additional cortisol level will be
      drawn 4-6 hours later. Following this level, a cortrosyn stimulation test will be performed
      by giving 0.25 mg cortrosyn IV and rechecking a cortisol level in 60 minutes. Adrenal
      insufficiency will be defined as a baseline cortisol level of <15 or an increase in cortisol
      of <9 after cortrosyn administration. Patients will be monitored for 24 hours for
      hemodynamics, IV fluid administration , and use of vasopressors. Patient will be resuscitated
      to adequate mean arterial blood pressure and urine output. Any patient found to be adrenal
      insufficient will be treated with hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours.
