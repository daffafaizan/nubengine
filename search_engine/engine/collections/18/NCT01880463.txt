      in prevention of dry eye disease. The primary aims are to test whether omega-3 fatty acid
      supplementation (1) reduces the incidence of dry eye disease, and (2) improves the natural
      history of dry eye disease by relieving symptoms and other impacts on quality of life.
      Secondary aims are to estimate the incidence of dry eye disease in the US, prospectively
      examine the natural history of dry disease, explore factors that could modify or influence
      the impact of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, evaluate the interrelationship of dry eye
      disease and depression, and test for possible independent or joint effects of vitamin D3
      supplementation in the incidence and natural history of dry eye disease.
