      Enrichment Program (CEP), on episodic memory, executive functions, psychological well-being
      and daily life activities in traumatic brain injured (TBI) older adults, as compared to an
      active control group that receives only usual care in the form of holistic rehabilitation.
      The experimental design is a semi-randomized, controlled, before-after study with blinded
      outcome measurement. French-speaking participants aged 55 years or older and having sustained
      a mild, moderate or severe TBI at least 6 months before enrollment, were recruited by
      clinical coordinators from one hospital and from two outpatient interdisciplinary
      rehabilitation centres. The CEP consists of three intervention modules, Introduction and
      self-awareness, Attention and Memory, and Executive functions, which were conducted with
      groups of 5 participants, in 90-minute sessions, twice weekly, during 12 weeks. The CEP was
      conducted by an experienced clinical neuropsychologist. Assessments of intervention effects
      were performed by trained evaluators, who were blinded to group assignment of participants,
      in two separate sessions lasting about 90 minutes each. There were three assessment
      time-points: baseline (pre-intervention - T0); 14-weeks (post-intervention - T1); 6-months
      post-intervention (follow-up - T2). Primary outcome measures (neuropsychological and
      self-report) were chosen to measure targeted effects of the CEP and generalization measures
      (self-report) were used to evaluate broader effects of the intervention. Control measures
      were also used to control for spontaneous recovery.
