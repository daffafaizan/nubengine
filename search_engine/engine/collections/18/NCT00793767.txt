      what the physiological role of these receptors are. It has previously been shown that Growth
      Hormone mediate insulin resistance. The GH receptor and EPO receptor belong to the same
      family of cytokine receptors, and thereby share many of the same signalling pathways. In this
      study we want to investigate if there is a similar effect on insulin resistance and/or
      substrate metabolism after acute administration of EPO in human muscle tissue. Different
      signalling pathways are investigated p√• western blotting, and insulin sensitivity are
      measured be a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and substrate metabolism is measured by the
      forearm model.
