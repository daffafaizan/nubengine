      postoperative pain. Multimodal analgesia, a combination of different techniques and analgesic
      agents, plays an increasingly important role to relieve pain after TKA. Femoral nerve block
      (FNB) is a first-line analgesic technique for multimodal analgesia after TKA. But local
      anesthetics alone often exert limited potency of analgesia and are insufficient to avoid
      supplemental opioid usage. Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist,
      is widely used in clinical settings due to its properties of sedation, anxiolysis, analgesia,
      and sleep promotion. Recent studies and meta-analysis indicate that dexmedetomidine combined
      with local anesthetics for FNB can prolong the analgesic duration, improve the analgesic
      efficacy, inhibit local inflammatory response, and reduce narcotic consumption. The
      investigators hypothesize that dexmedetomidine combined with ropivacaine for FNB can also
      improve the functional recovery in aged patients after TKA.
