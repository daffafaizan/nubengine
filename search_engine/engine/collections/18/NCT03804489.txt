      Acute gastroenteritis is one of the most common infectious diseases and still a major cause
      of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. Rotavirus was still the major cause of acute
      gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide, including in Taiwan. The World
      Health Organization has recommended rotavirus vaccine, which became available in 2006, for
      all countries. However, not all of children in Taiwan received rotavirus vaccination. Using
      decision aids (DA) is one way to provide information to infant family and to involve them in
      making decisions about their baby's vaccination. We developed a DA administered after
      consultation for baby's family deciding on whether the baby will receive the self-paid oral
      rotavirus vaccine Patients and Methods Decision aids are interventions designed to help
      infant family make choices among options by providing information relevant to oral rotavirus
      vaccine. Infant coming to receiving regular routine vaccination at 1 month old are randomly
      assigned to receive a DA or the standard oral conversation (control condition) after the
      initial consultation. Infant family complete interview-based questionnaires 1 month later
      when they came back to hospital receiving 2-month-old regular routine vaccination and decide
      to receive self-paid oral rotavirus vaccine or not at that time. Primary outcome measures:
      decisional conflict and decision-making difficulties at 2-month-old.

      Results and Conclusion The DA group are predicted to lower decisional conflict scores when
      compared with the control group. Our study hopes to support the efficacy of DA in helping the
      infant family to decide whether the baby will receive the self-paid oral rotavirus vaccine.
