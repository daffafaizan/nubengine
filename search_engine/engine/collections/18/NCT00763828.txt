      (STEMI) patients with the LRS (Life Recovery Systems)ThermoSuit System, a cooling device
      which uses the principle of cold water immersion to rapidly reduce patient temperature. The
      study will enroll a total of up to 20 patients, and will be a cooperative effort between LRS
      and LSU Health Sciences Center - Shreveport.

      The study is being conducted under an IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) that was granted
      to LRS by FDA (G070141). The primary goal of this trial is to demonstrate the feasibility of
      cooling AMI patients pre-reperfusion with the ThermoSuit cooling device. The safety of this
      treatment will be determined by review of a composite of serious adverse events.

      Consciously sedated patients will be cooled after entry into the emergency room and prior to
      percutaneous coronary intervention in the catheterization laboratory. It is hypothesized that
      the ThermoSuit System will enable cooling of the patient to 34ÂºC after a treatment of 30
      minutes or less. Previous research has suggested that cooling of ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction patients before coronary reperfusion could result in a significant reduction in
      myocardial infarct size.

      If successful, this study will lead to a pivotal clinical study to investigate the potential
      for the ThermoSuit cooling treatment to reduce myocardial infarct size. The ultimate goal of
      these studies is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the use of the ThermoSuit
      device for the treatment of AMI patients.
