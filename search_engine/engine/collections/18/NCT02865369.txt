      with the hepatic fibrosis stage and to have considerable accuracy for the diagnosis of
      cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Previous studied reported that liver
      stiffness is significantly reduced in SVR patients with pegylated interferon (IFN) and
      ribavirin treatment. Once a patient achieve sustained virological response (SVR), and
      resultingly lower liver stiffness score than baseline value, it is believed that he will have
      a better long-term outcome due to the improvement of liver fibrosis.

      Daclatasvir(DCV) and Asunaprevir(ASV) combined treatment showed a greater SVR rate in CHC
      compared to IFN based therapy. The investigators hypothesize that DCV and ASV combined
      treatment may achieve the improvement of liver stiffness measured by TE and a more favorable
      clinical outcomes in patients with advanced liver fibrosis. The investigators will also
      compare the change of fibrosis stage assessed by TE between this study subjects and those
      treated with other DAA agents during same observational period.
