      ASA 1-3, undergoing elective laparoscopic gynecological surgery. With the information to be
      obtained from the patients whose menstrual cycle regularly lasts 21-35 days, the cycle
      duration will be determined by counting from the first day of the last mens period. Days 6-12
      of the cycle will be grouped as follicular (F), and 20-24 as luteal (L). No surgery will be
      planned during the mens period (1-5 days). Patients will be excluded on days 13-19 of the
      cycle to better define the two stages.

      Remaining 3 ml of blood from routine venous blood samples taken from patients for
      preoperative evaluation will be stored to investigate Î¼-Opioid receptor levels. A continuous
      10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to determine the level of postoperative pain.

      Researchers who will make postoperative evaluations will be blind to menstrual cycles.

      The sensation of pain will be assessed every 10 minutes in the recovery room, intervening
      with a bolus of 10 mg iv tramadol for a pain score of 3 to 5 and a bolus of 20 mg for a pain
      score of more than 5. If the VAS does not drop below 3 after two additional tramadol boluses,
      rescue analgesia will be provided with 2 mg iv morphine.

      Patients will be followed in the ward and observations will be made at 6, 12 and 24 hours.

      Patients will be asked to evaluate their resting and coughing pains.
