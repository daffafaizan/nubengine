      admission each study participant will be provided with a standardized dinner. At 7am (t=0)
      the next day we will begin a primed, constant intravenous infusion d2 glucose (a stable
      isotope of glucose, the enrichment of which can be measured by gas chromatography mass
      spectrometry, allowing us to calculate endogenous glucose production rates) and continue this
      for 8 hours. At the same time (7am) a pancreatic clamp will be started as described above for
      8 hours. Blood samples will be analysed with a glucometer for instant blood glucose readings
      At 9 am (+120 minutes) intranasal placebo or insulin will be administered. The insulin
      (Humalog Lispro 100 IU/ml, Eli Lily, Canada) and placebo (diluent) will be transferred to a
      metered nasal device (Pharmasystems, Ontario UPC: 063636 802721, Item 10271) immediately
      prior to use. This device dispenses 0.1ml (10 IU) per puff. 4X0.1 ml puffs/vials (2 per
      nostril) will be administered at rate of 2 (one in each nostril) every 60 seconds. Blood will
      be drawn at t=0, 30, 60, 120 and every 10 minutes thereafter for 6 hours. In order to match
      peripheral lispro concentrations between study visits, a small dose of Humalog (lispro)
      insulin will be administered intravenously at 9am, during the placebo arm of the study. Based
      on the pharmacokinetics of Humalog lispro (personal communication from Eli Lilly), we propose
      to administer 0.005 IU/kg over 30 minutes. 20% dextrose will be administered to maintain
      euglycemia as necessary. Insulin, glucagon, and glucose isotopic enrichment will be measured.
      The enrichment data and glucose infusion will be used to calculate steady state glucose
      production.
