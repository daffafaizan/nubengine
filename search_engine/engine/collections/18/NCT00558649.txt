    
      Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe
      complications. Previous clinical studies demonstrated that delivery of vaccines intradermally
      (into the skin) can achieve good efficacy even with lower doses of the vaccine.

      Comparison: Low dose flu vaccine delivered intradermally with a microneedle device compared
      to the standard dose flu vaccine delivered intramuscularly (into the muscle) with a regular
      needle.
