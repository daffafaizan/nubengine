      I pharmacodynamic studies recommend doses of 50 mg weekly and 10 mg/daily, based on its
      toxicity and inhibitory effect of the mTOR pathway in tumours; although the inhibition of
      this pathway has been demonstrated, the knowledge of response prediction factors has not been
      developed, in part due to the very low responses found in the population in phase I studies.
      These factors can be better outlined in a phase II study, where patients who have received
      fewer previous treatments can respond better, and where the profile of responders and
      non-responders can be identified more easily.
