      the position is part of the physical examination. Recent studies have shown that photometry
      can be a reliable method to assess posture. The measurement of angles can identify situations
      as the forward position of the head and shoulder protraction.

      The aim of this study is to assess the position of the shoulder, using photometry by the
      measurement of angle between acromion process and seventh cervical vertebra, and the
      relationship with the presence of pain in volleyball players.

      For this study will be recruited thirty nine volleyball players. The variables measured are
      pain sensation registered with a visual analog scale and the position of acromion process
      measurement with photometry
