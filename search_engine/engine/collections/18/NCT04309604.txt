      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and recent data suggest that ALS may respond to
      peripheral intervention by expanding Tregs in mice and humans. The approach with IC14 builds
      on this hypothesis by targeting CD14 as a master regulator of the immune response of
      peripheral cell populations, which in turn determines the activation status and phenotype of
      peripheral T cells that enter the central nervous system (CNS) and drive further microglia
      activation .Binding and blocking membrane CD14 (mCD14) on peripheral immune cell populations
      with IC14 may thus be a relevant therapeutic target in ALS.

      IC14 has been safe, well tolerated and had no serious adverse events related to study drug.

      This is a protocol for 12 weeks of the investigational medication IC14 for 6 participants. An
      extension for 6 additional doses every 2 weeks will be done if the drug is safe and well
      tolerated. Up to 20 subjects may be screened in order to identify eligible subjects that meet
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      At the screening visit, the Principal Investigator will review the study procedures and
      consent form with the participant. After obtaining informed consent, the participant will
      receive IC14 8 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks (Â± 7 days) for 6 doses (12 weeks). An
      extension for 6 additional doses every 2 weeks will be allowed if the drug is safe and well
      tolerated. A second extension for 14 additional doses every 2 weeks will be allowed if the
      drug is safe and well tolerated.
