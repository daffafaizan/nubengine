      which makes it possibly the fourth leading cause of blindness in the United States. Cystoid
      macular edema (CME) is the most structural complication of uveitis, resulting in visual
      impairment and blindness. If left untreated or undertreated over a period of years, CME may
      result in permanent photoreceptor damage of the macula and loss of central vision. Further,
      CME may persist despite adequate control of the uveitis, and therefore, adjuvant therapy to
      specifically treat the CME may be required.

      We propose to study whether a sustained steroid delivery system (Ozurdex, Allergan) can treat
      uveitic macular edema. Ozurdex has been proven to be effective for non-infectious posterior
      uveitis; and FDA approved for posterior uveitis. The sustained delivery of the steroid and
      local delivery modality makes it an ideal candidate to manage macular edema in uveitis.
