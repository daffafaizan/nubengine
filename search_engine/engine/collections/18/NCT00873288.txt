        -  Compare the effect of a usual care mailing intervention vs a Cancer Information Service
           (CIS) support mailing intervention on the likelihood that women with an abnormal Pap
           test will keep their medical follow-up appointments and be satisfied with how they talk
           to their provider.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (Usual-care mailing intervention): Patients receive a generic letter reminding
           them of their follow-up colposcopy appointment.

        -  Arm II (Cancer Information Service [CIS] support mailing intervention): Patients receive
           a targeted letter reminding them of their follow-up colposcopy appointment, asking them
           or someone they designate to call the CIS, and suggesting some questions to ask the CIS
           about colposcopies and Pap tests.

      At their follow-up appointments, all patients undergo an exit interview to compare patient
      satisfaction between the 2 interventions. Patients in arm II also answer questions about
      their CIS experience, and if the intervention made their follow-up visit less difficult.
