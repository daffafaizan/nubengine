      patients; however, altered pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients has lead to
      subtherapeutic antibiotic exposure with standard antibiotic dosing and administration. This
      is further evidenced by low therapeutic target achievement with our intermittent vancomycin
      dosing nomogram. Administering vancomycin by continuous infusions may lead to achieving a
      therapeutic concentration and AUC24 more quickly than the administration by intermittent
      infusions as well as provide a more consistent concentration throughout the dosing period.
      Therefore, a new vancomycin continuous infusion nomogram was developed to increase the
      achievement of a goal vancomycin concentration within 24 hours.

      We hypothesized that vancomycin administered as continuous infusion would achieve the
      therapeutic target sooner and more consistently than when administered as an intermittent
      infusion in critically ill surgical patients. The aims of this study were to determine the
      dosing differences between continuous (CIV) and intermittent (IIV) dosing in critically ill
      surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients with preserved renal function and whether
      calculated Cockcroft-Gault Creatinine Clearance (CG CrCL) or measured creatinine clearance
      (CrCL) is a better predictor of vancomycin clearance.
