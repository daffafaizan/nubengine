      (EF) on weight loss. It has been hypothesized an increased EF improves appetite control,
      assisting with better regulation of energy intake, thus decreasing body mass index.
      Unfortunately, outcomes have not shown greater appetite control with increased EF. Instead,
      trends favor a lower EF reducing energy intake thereby producing greater weight loss than a
      higher eating frequency. Thus, a lower eating frequency may lower energy intake via
      behavioral mechanisms. At thit time no research has examined the behavioral mechanisms that
      may mediate the relationship between a lower eating frequency and superior adherence to an
      energy-restricted diet.
