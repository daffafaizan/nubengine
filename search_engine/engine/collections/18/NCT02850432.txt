      receive evaluation of the perfusion in the lower limb by using blood oxygenation-level
      dependent (BOLD) sequence with measurement of the extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as an
      indicator of fibrosis severity in calf muscles. All patients will receive cardiac MRI
      (cardiac function, ischemia and fibrosis) and MR angiography (severity of PAD). The baseline
      studies will be completed within 2 years and 3 additional follow-up studies will be performed
      by the end of 4th year.
