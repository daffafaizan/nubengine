      findings that the hormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP), causes constriction of uterine blood
      vessels which in turn produces congestion of the uterus resulting in dysmenorrhea. Prior to
      menses, blood vessels in the uterine wall become engorged with blood. Elevated concentrations
      of vasopressin acting through V1a receptors cause constriction of both uterine and vascular
      smooth muscle, contributing to the discomfort and pain of primary dysmenorrhea. Consequently,
      blockade of these receptors with a selective V1a receptor antagonist would be expected to
      provide therapeutic benefits to women with primary dysmenorrhea.

      SRX251 is a new chemical entity with potent V1a receptor antagonist properties, and an
      acceptable safety profile as demonstrated in preclinical studies. This study is intended to
      evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of a single oral dose of SRX251 in healthy
      human female volunteers in preparation for further studies of the safety and pharmacological
      activity in the amelioration of pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea.
