      adjunctive lacosamide via a single intravenous loading dose followed by oral maintenance
      treatment in subjects 16 - 60 years of age with partial-onset seizures. Three consecutive
      25-subject cohorts were given a progressively increasing dose of lacosamide (200, 300, 400
      mg) administered as a single 15-minute intravenous (iv) loading dose followed by the
      equivalent daily dose administered orally twice daily for 6.5 days with the first oral dose
      12 hours after the iv dose. A fourth cohort of 25 subjects repeated the 300 mg dose to
      provide safety data on a total of 50 subjects at the highest well-tolerated dose.
