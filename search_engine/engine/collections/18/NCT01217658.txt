      parental soothing skills and reduces infant crying at night (primary outcome) and parental
      sleep loss, distress, & depression assessed in the home by a masked nurse at 8 wks.

      Methods: Term singleton infants with EIC (> 3 hrs/24h) recruited through a program offered to
      parents at our hospital (4,700 births/yr) will be seen in our clinic 2-3 wks after birth.
      Consenting families (n=178) will be randomized to standard colic counseling (American Academy
      of Pediatrics) or to the intervention (adding nurse instruction plus a video and pamphlets).
      At 8 wks a study nurse will assess parental sleep and distress (Brief Symptom Inventory-18),
      place dosimeters in rooms where the infant sleeps and spends most time, and apply the
      actigraph at the ankle. She will collect the devices 5 days later, perform a physical exam at
      a usual feeding time (when EIC is likely), record infant & maternal behaviors during
      crying/feeding for the next 15 minutes using unobtrusive, validated methods (Tyson, 1992),
      and provide maternal support if desired. Standard statistical tests will be used (alpha=0.05;
      beta = 0.20; effect size =0.5 SD, power = .90).
