    
      The Primary Objective will be to determine whether the overall response (clinical and
      bacterial) to Aurograb® (1mg/kg i.v. b.d.) plus vancomycin is greater than the overall
      response to placebo plus vancomycin, in adult hospitalised patients with severe, deep-seated
      staphylococcal infections, particularly MRSA infections, being treated with vancomycin.

      Secondary Objectives will be:

        1. To further determine efficacy, comparing Aurograb versus placebo, regarding:

             -  attributable mortality

             -  overall mortality

             -  clinical response

             -  bacterial response ie eradication or persistence of the infection

             -  rates of clinical resistance to vancomycin.

        2. To compare the safety profile of treatment with Aurograb® (1mg/kg b.d.) plus vancomycin
           versus placebo plus vancomycin in adult hospitalised patients with deep-seated
           staphylococcal infections.

        3. To extend the data base on pharmacokinetics.
