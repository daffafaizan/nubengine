      mitral regurgitation can be as high as 90%.

      In contrast, with successful surgical correction of mitral regurgitation before the
      appearance of symptoms, patients may have life expectancies similar to that of the general
      population.

      According to European recommendations, mitral valve replacement must be proposed to
      symptomatic patients and to patients with significant left ventricular remodeling as a
      consequence of the severity of mitral regurgitation.

      A significant decline in left ventricular function is defined, in these recommendations,
      echocardiographically as an left ventricular ejection fraction < 60% or an left ventricular
      end-systolic diameter > 45 mm.

      Preoperative left ventricular systolic function and left ventricular end systolic diameter
      are important postoperative prognostic factors.

      The early detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction remains a challenge. Mitral
      regurgitation causes low left ventricular afterload, and the ejection fraction thus remains
      normal or supernormal until the disease reaches an advanced stage.

      Some authors have suggested the additive value of deformation indices as more sensitive than
      the ejection fraction to detect subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction Speckle
      tracking echocardiography has been well validated as a quantitative assessment tool for left
      ventricular function, and more recently this technique has been described for assessment of
      regional and global left atrial function
