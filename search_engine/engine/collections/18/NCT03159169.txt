      arm/shoulder/upper back will be considered for inclusion in this study. After baseline
      evaluation, subjects will undergo a SCS trial using the Abbott Invisible Trial system. At the
      end of the SCS trial, subjects experiencing at least 50% pain relief, according to average
      neck VAS (calculated by the average of last 3 days on the pain diary), will be considered for
      permanent implant and further participation in the study. Pain intensity, quality of life,
      disability, headache severity, sleep quality, patient satisfaction, anxiety, depression,
      stimulation sensation and medication usage assessments will be performed at baseline, after
      SCS trial and at the 3, 6 and 12 month follow up visits.
