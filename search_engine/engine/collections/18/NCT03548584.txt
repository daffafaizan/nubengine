      fixed-dose trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole
      compared with placebo. The trial consists of a 12-week double-blind treatment period with a
      30 day follow-up. The trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and
      90 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are
      residing either in an institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where
      the subject is not living alone. This trial will analyze data gathered from 330 subjects at
      multiple countries. An interim analysis will be conducted when a targeted sample of the first
      255 subjects has completed or discontinued the trial. Subjects may also be eligible to enter
      an active extension trial.
