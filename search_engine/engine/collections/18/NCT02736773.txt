    
      Primary objective :

      Estimate the percentage of loss of bone volume and the percentage thickness loss of the
      buccal and palatal cortical for patients who underwent bone volume preservation technology
      and conservation of the vestibular cortical by guided bone regeneration using a material slow
      absorption in the molar areas and premolar.

      Secondary objectives:

      Compare the percentage of loss of bone volume and the percentage loss of thickness of the
      buccal and palatal cortical patients who underwent a preservation technique, the upgrading
      data of mandibular posterior region without fillers described in the literature.

      Methods :

      After tooth extraction of a premolar or molar in mandibular flapless technique, guided bone
      regeneration is carried out. The cell is filled by a slow absorption material (Xenograft
      common use). The regeneration space is maintained by a resorbable membrane. To protect the
      membrane without tissue motion (technical flapless) placing a three-dimensional collagen
      matrix graft substitute gingival (MuccograftÂ®) will be used. A CBCT preoperative be performed
      to verify the integrity of cortical and measure the height and width of the residual cavity.
      caliper measurements at the foot will also be performed during surgery in order to integrate
      also the thickness of the bone tables and gingival thickness.

      After healing of the graft, the pre-implant scan performed at six months postoperatively will
      measure the height and width of the grafted cell, to compare measurements and evaluate the
      dynamics of alveolar resorption
