    
      Monocentric study (Hospital of 15-20 at Paris) of duration of 106 weeks.

      At total,12 evaluable patients will be enrolled and assigned in 2 cohorts as described above
      in brief summary.

      Expected follow-up for one patient is about 64 weeks including 8 weeks of screening and
      baseline period and 56 weeks of follow-up after implantation of hESC-derived RPE.

      After 56 weeks of follow-up, patients will be enrolled in a long term follow-up study.

      The primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of implantation of the
      Investigational Medecinal Product (ISTEM-01) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the placement and position of the patch

        -  To assess preliminary efficacy based on:

        -  Evaluation of visual function

        -  Eye fundus

        -  Evaluation of photoreceptor survival

      Assessment of visual function by Diagnosys-Full-field stimulus threshold (D-FST) is the only
      exploratory objective.
