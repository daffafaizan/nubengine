      Treatment (IPGT) in patients with chronic pain who are at risk for opioid misuse. IPGT is a
      comprehensive approach that blends evidenced-based psychosocial treatments for chronic pain
      and opioid misuse and addresses each issue individually, but also the interconnections
      between the overlapping problems. IPGT consists of 6 weekly group sessions of motivational
      interviewing and behavioral change, self-management, and pain education focused on
      appropriate adherence to treatment and resisting urges to misuse prescription medications.
      The intervention also entails an education session on knowledge pertaining to overdose and
      naloxone distribution. This study will involve the randomization of 40 patients to receive
      either: (1) treatment as usual (TAU; n=20); or (2) integrated psychosocial group intervention
      (IPGT; n=20). This study will: (1) establish feasibility; (2) demonstrate acceptability; and
      (3) demonstrate preliminary efficacy for an integrated psychosocial group treatment model for
      patients with chronic pain who are at risk of opioid misuse. The data generated from this
      study will also serve as a foundation for future implementation to support a subsequent
      fully-powered RCT.
