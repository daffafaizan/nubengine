    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled,
      study in adult males and females, ages 18 to 70 years, inclusive, with a diagnosis of
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. At the Screening Visit, patients who provide
      written informed consent will have screening procedures performed, including a complete
      medical history, medication history, physical examination, including height, weight, blood
      pressure, pulse rate and temperature, and clinical laboratory tests.

      Eligible patients will be those who have not received systemic retinoids, corticosteroids, or
      immunosuppressants (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine) within 6 weeks prior to initiation of
      study; or high potency topical corticosteroids (Class I-III), keratolytics, or coal tar
      (other than on the scalp, palms, groin, and/or soles); and UV or Dead Sea therapy within 4
      weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. Eligible patients will be sequentially assigned
      to 1 of 3 dosing cohorts:

      Cohort 1: CF101 1 mg (15 patients) or Placebo (5 patients); Cohort 2: CF101 2 mg (15
      patients) or Placebo (5 patients); Cohort 3: CF101 4 mg (15 patients) or Placebo (5
      patients).

      Medication will be taken orally q12h for 12 weeks. Disease activity will be assessed using
      the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and the Physician Global Assessment (PGA).
      Patients will return for assessments at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 14.
