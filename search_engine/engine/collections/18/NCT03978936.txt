      to address poor medication adherence. In addition, it employs a novel method to track and
      provide feedback to participants on adherence by using Propeller Sensors. 300 adolescents and
      young adults will be randomized to Medication Therapy Management (MTM) video telehealthcare
      plus electronic adherence self-management [MTM EAM] or electronic adherence self-management
      alone (EAM). Due to the hierarchal design of the trial, two primary outcomes to be tested in
      a sequential manner are specified, adherence and time to first asthma exacerbation.
