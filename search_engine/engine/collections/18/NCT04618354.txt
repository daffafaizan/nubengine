      complications are harmful to the human body. There are also fewer studies on the relationship
      between specific types of diabetes and clinical diseases such as osteoporosis and
      Hypogonadism. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of hypogonadism and osteoporosis
      among male patients with latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA), classic type 1 diabetes (T1DM),
      and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and investigate the protective factors for hypogonadism and
      osteoporosis in these patients. This cross-sectional study evaluated male patients with LADA,
      T1DM, and T2DM who visited the endocrinology department of Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital
      for diabetes management. Sex hormones, lipid profiles, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG),
      glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, beta-cell function, uric acid, and osteocalcin were determined
      in serum samples. Thereforï¼Œclarifying the differences in the clinical characteristics of
      adult men with LADA, T1DM and T2DM will help to further understand the effects of diabetes on
      bone metabolism and sex hormones.
