      chemotherapy combined with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with floxuridine and dexamethasone
      in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis. Hepatic arterial
      infusion oxaliplatin trials have been done with oxaliplatin alone and in combination with
      irinotecan, 5-FU/LV, and mitomycin-C and have showed that Hepatic arterial infusion
      oxaliplatin and FUDR could increase response rate and resection rate for colorectal liver
      metastasis. Therefore, we designed this study to compare objective response rates of
      FUDR/Oxaliplatin HAI plus CPT-11 and FOLFOXIRI chemotherapy in patients with initially
      non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer liver metastases.
