      enables the implantation of a new biological aortic valve at the beating heart. The procedure
      is performed under local anaesthesia and is a gold standard in the therapy of aortic
      stenosis, especially in patients with a too high health risk for cardiovascular surgery.

      In the proposed study, patients with and without embolic protection devices during TAVI will
      be repeatedly examined with a comprehensive psychiatric and cognitive test battery over a
      post-interventional period of 6 months after TAVI, with regard to the effects on mood,
      cognitive Performance and health-related quality of life.
