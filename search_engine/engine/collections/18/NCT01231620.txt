      anti-influenza therapies. This will be an international Phase III, double-blind,
      double-dummy, 3-arm study to evaluate the efficacy, antiviral activity and safety of IV
      zanamivir 600 mg twice daily compared to oral oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily, and 600 mg IV
      zanamivir twice daily compared to 300 mg IV zanamivir for 5 days in hospitalized subjects
      with laboratory confirmed or suspected influenza infection. For a given subject, the initial
      5-day treatment course may be extended for up to 5 additional days if clinical symptoms or
      patient characteristics as assessed by the investigator warrant further treatment.
      Alternatively, if the investigator considers that a subject is failing to improve clinically
      on their randomized treatment, the investigator can choose to initiate the switch/rescue
      option (600 mg IV zanamivir twice daily) on any day from Day 6 through Day 10 for up to an
      additional 5 days of treatment. On switching treatments, subjects complete a maximum of 14
      days of treatment and are followed-up to Post-Treatment +28 Days.
