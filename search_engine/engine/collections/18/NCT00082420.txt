      ß-C in labeled spinach (along with white rice), or Golden Rice (along with light colored
      vegetables), or ß-C oil capsules (along with white rice and light colored vegetables), every
      day for 7 days. Before the two meals, the volunteers will take a breakfast with a RAc-d10
      dose as a reference for 7 days. The enrichment of labeled ß-C and labeled retinol in human
      circulation will be determined using advanced liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry and
      gas chromatography / mass spectrometry. Through the applications of these novel technologies,
      we will be able to determine the relative biological activities of endogenous carotenoids;
      that is, the vitamin A value of spinach, Golden Rice, and ß-C in oil capsules for children
      with/without vitamin A malnutrition.
