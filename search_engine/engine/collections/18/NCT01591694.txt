      examine the clinical outcomes of children at the Family Center at Kennedy Krieger Institute
      who are enrolled in evidence-based and promising trauma-informed treatments as part of the
      National Child Traumatic Stress Network funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
      Services Administration. The purpose of the National Child Traumatic Stress
      Initiative(NCTSNI) Evaluation is to determine the extent to which the NCTSI, through the
      National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), has raised the standard of care and improved
      access to services for traumatized children. In addition, the evaluation assesses the extent
      to which the NCTSI has served as a national resource capable of improving children's access
      to high-quality, trauma-informed mental health services. This data, previously collected and
      managed by the Category I NCTSN Center at Duke will now be managed by ICF Macro in a data
      system entitled NICON.
