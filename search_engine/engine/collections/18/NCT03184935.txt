      groups, and receive basic treatment (Decitabine). Patients in experimental group will receive
      hUC-MSC, while control group receive placebo (normal saline), four weeks as a course of
      treatment. All of the patients accept examination before treatment, including

        -  diagnostic projects: bone marrow test, peripheral blood classification, chromosome, and
           MDS fusion gene test, etc.;

        -  routine examination: blood, urine, and stool routine test, X-ray film in chest,
           electrocardiogram, etc.;

        -  stem cell-based medicinal products usage, dosage, time, and course of treatment.

      Then, patients will accept routine examination everyday, and after treatment, investigator
      will follow-up for 6 months, to evaluate the security and efficacy of hUC-MSC.
