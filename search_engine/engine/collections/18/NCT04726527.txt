      imaging with florbetapir F 18 as a biomarker in the identification of amyloid-ß peptide (Aß)
      in the brain. Amyloid-ß peptide (Aß) accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's
      disease. Florbetapir F 18 sticks to the amyloid plaques in the brain and emits a low level of
      gamma rays which can be detected by a PET camera. The development of biomarker and imaging
      studies that track the development of PPA and reflect the change in people's bodies may help
      other people who have a similar medical problem in the future.
