      evaluation and data collection. Participants will be randomized to either placebo, aspirin or
      clopidogrel to be taken daily for the duration of the study. Patients will undergo invasive
      coronary studies (angiography, optical coherence tomography and intracoronary flow) and
      platelet function testing at 2 and 12 months post heart transplant. In addition, angiography
      will be performed at 24 months post heart transplant and thereafter according to
      institutional protocol. The primary analysis will determine the feasibility of conducting a
      large multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial by assessing recruitment rates, event
      rates, treatment crossovers and loss to follow-up. Secondary analyses will include assessing
      the effect of antiplatelet treatment on angiographic CAV, coronary intimal disease on optical
      coherence tomography, coronary macrovascular and microvascular function by intracoronary flow
      measures, and platelet function.
