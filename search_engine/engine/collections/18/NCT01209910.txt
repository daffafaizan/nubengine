      rehabilitation setting is extremely relevant to the patient population at Riverview Health
      Centre (RHC), as many patients at RHC receive a modified diet consisting of thickened
      liquids. To date, the research base for the use of free water protocols is limited. Despite
      the general lack of research evidence, modified versions of a free water protocol have been
      adopted at numerous facilities across North America. Pursuing clinical research to measure
      the effects of a free water protocol on rate of aspiration pneumonia, quality of life related
      to swallowing, fluid intake, and hydration levels, would provide research evidence to help
      guide patient care. If such research were to show that a free water protocol could be used
      without increased risk to patients with dysphagia, the patient population at Riverview, and
      at other rehabilitation centers, could benefit.
