    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of osimertinib (AZD9291) in combination with
      necitumumab in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity in these NSCLC patients in select cohorts of
      patients with EGFR-activating mutations including EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of AZD9291 in combination with necitumumab.

      II. To explore biomarkers of response and resistance to previous EGFR-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKIs) and with the combination by studying biopsied tumor tissue at baseline and
      at progression, as well as serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) specimens.

      III. To create patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC both
      prior to study initiation and at acquired resistance to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of necitumumab.

      Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and necitumumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, every 12
      weeks for 1 year, and annually thereafter.
