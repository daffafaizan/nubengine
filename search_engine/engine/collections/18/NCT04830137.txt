      patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies, who have required and received
      at least 2 prior systemic therapies and for whom no other therapies are known to provide
      clinical benefit. Phase 1b will investigate the efficacy of NX-2127 at the dose selected in
      Phase 1a in up to 5 cohorts of patients with R/R B-cell malignancy indications who have
      received at least 2 prior systemic therapies:

        -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) with no BTK C481
           mutation

        -  BTK C481 mutation-positive CLL/SLL

        -  Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) or Waldenstrom
           Macroglobulinemia (WM)

        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL)

        -  Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
