      their maximum heart rate (previously determined). After the exercise bout, participants will
      have either the placebo or the experimental drink. The investigators will measure muscle
      function and damage-related parameters right after the exercise as well as the three
      following days. This protocol will be repeated after a wash out period of 3 weeks, where the
      participants will have the other drink. The investigators will control exercise and diet
      three weeks before study entry, during the experimental week as the investigators as during
      the wash out period.
