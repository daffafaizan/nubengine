      Background/Purpose:

      Urodyamic study is an objective method to evaluate female patients with lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS). However, this method includes place a urinary catheter, thus prevents it as
      a routine method to evaluate and follow up patients with LUTS. Therefore, it is necessary to
      find a simple and objective method to help in evaluating female patients with LUTS. Several
      kinds of biomarker had been reported in diagnosing patients with overactive bladder; however,
      the sensitivity remained poor. The aim of this study is to find a useful biomarker,
      biomarkers, or combinations, with the aid of urodynamic study, to objectively and precisely
      in evaluating the female patients with LUTS.

      Patients and Methods:

      We will perform a prospective study to recruit 300 female patients with LUTS at the
      outpatient clinic of Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of National Taiwan University
      Hospital and Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.

      All patients will be asked to complete OABSS, UDI-6 & IIQ-7 questionnaires, voiding diary,
      20-min pad test and urodynamic studies. Urinary nerve growth factor, prostaglandin E2,
      interleukin-6 and epidermal growth factor were also measured. Besides, we will also recruit
      30 female patients without LUTS in our outpatient clinic, and they will be asked to complete
      the above questionnaire and examinations except pad test and urodynamic studies.

      Possible Results:

      With the comparison of the above parameters between non-LUTS and LUTS patients, we can answer
      the questions that (1) the mean values of urinary NGF, PGE2, IL-6, EGF in different
      urodynamic studies, (2) the sensitivity and specificity of urinary NGF, PGE2, IL-6, EGF or
      combinations in diagnosing different urodynamic diagnoses.
