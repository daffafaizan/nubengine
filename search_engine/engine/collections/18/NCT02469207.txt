    
      The purpose of this study is to use tissue from deceased organ donors to address questions
      that are of importance for the development of regenerative cellular therapies for better
      understanding of organ physiology and developmental biology. This study aims to maximise the
      clinically available data as well as patient benefit that can be generated from donated
      tissue. It also aims to reduce number of consent forms given to patients by consolidating and
      coordinating a number of related investigations.

      The study aims are:

        -  To examine function and the immune response to stem cells and their differentiated
           progeny as well as development of immunomodulatory approaches to prevent their
           rejection.

        -  Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their subsequent
           differentiation into functional cells as potential therapies.

        -  Generation of differentiated cells from native adult stem cells as cellular therapies.

        -  Investigation of organ physiology.
