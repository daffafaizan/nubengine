      Group I (normal subjects): 30 individuals (15 male, and 15 female students) with (BMI<25
      kg//m^2)) Group II (overweight subjects): 30 individuals (15 male, and 15 female students)
      with (BMI, 25-30 kg//m^2)).

      Group III (obese subjects): 30 individuals (15 male, and 15 female students) (BMI>30
      kg//m^2)).

      Motor control element of CS will be investigated by assessing bilateral static balance with
      open and close eye, right foot balance test, and dynamic balance test using Prokin System for
      balance. Data of this study will be statistically analyzed by performing descriptive (Mean
      and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (One way ANOVA, Unpaired T test) at level
      of significance p=<0.05.
