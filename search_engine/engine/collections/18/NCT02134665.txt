      serum level of vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibacterial agent.

      After reviewing more than 6000 clinical charts of patients who received vancomycin therapy
      and whose serum vancomycin level was monitored between January 2010 and December 2013, we
      identified 212 patients who also had diagnosed as severe acute pancreatitis (SAP group), and
      98 patients who also had diagnosed as pneumonia (pneumonia group) at that time. The
      fluorescence polarization immunoassay method was used to measure vancomycin serum trough
      concentrations in these patients 30 min before the next administration. Using these
      measurements, we calculated the pharmacokinetic parameters using the Bayesian estimator.
