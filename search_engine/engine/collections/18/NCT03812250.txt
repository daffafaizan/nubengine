      However, even in expert hands, ERCP fails in 3%-5% of cases, especially in patients with
      surgically altered anatomy or difficult biliary cannulation. In these cases, more invasive
      options are usually considered, which including percutaneous trans-hepatic biliary drainage
      and surgical intervention, but they all have been associated with a higher risk of
      complications and prolonged hospital stay. EUS-guide biliary drainage using a metal stent,
      particularly a lumen-apposing metal stent, is a promising technique for biliary decompression
      in patients with failed ERCP. There has been growing global experience with EUS-BD in recent
      years, and data from expert centers support the feasibility and efficacy of EUS-BD. However,
      few researches compared the efficacy and complication rates between EUS-BD and ERCP for
      malignant biliary obstruction. The investigators herein aim to conduct a randomized
      controlled clinical trial to compare the efficacy and complication rates between EUS-BD and
      ERCP for malignant biliary obstruction.
