      clinical-epidemiological information, will have a deep respiratory aspirate specimen to
      determine the etiology of the lower respiratory tract infection. Clinicians may obtain other
      diagnostic specimens, such as pleural fluid, lung tap, cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal
      culture, or serum for serological assays, as indicated clinically. The chest radiograph will
      be taken and read locally according to predetermined criteria and by staff radiologists
      trained in radiographic criteria for pneumonia. Bacterial isolates other than Streptococcus
      pneumoniae will be identified according to standardized procedures. S. pneumoniae isolates
      will be transported to central laboratories for confirmation of identity, serotyping and
      antibiotic resistance testing, using standard techniques. Serotype will be determined using
      type-specific sera (Quellung reaction). Antibiotic susceptibility to penicillin, cefuroxime,
      ceftriaxone, erythromycin, Amoxycillin, Ofloxacin, Vancomycin, and imipenem be conducted
      using E-test according to standardized procedures at the central facilities.
