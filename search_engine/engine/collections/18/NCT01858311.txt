      platelet function and cholesterol as well as the safety in patients with TIA (transient
      ischemic attack) or stroke in addition to the standard treatment for stroke prevention.
      Recurrent cardiovascular events including stroke, TIA, heart attack, venous thrombosis,
      pulmonary embolism, systemic embolism will also be recorded. In patients with recurrent
      stroke, severity of the stroke and stroke size measured from MR (magnetic resonance) or CT
      (computed tomography) imaging will also be collected. We expect that TCT will inhibit blood
      clotting and lower cholesterol more than current standard treatment without significantly
      increasing bleeding risks or other side effects. Future work is planned in a larger
      TIA/stroke population to examine whether TCT adds to standard medical care in terms of
      decreasing incidence of stroke and improving outcomes following stroke.
