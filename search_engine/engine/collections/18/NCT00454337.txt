      NNRTI and PI) and in whom the control of viral replication in the plasma has ultimately been
      achieved with enfuvirtide, the aim is to sustain this virological success for as long as
      possible to thus enable satisfactory immune reconstitution, avoid further accumulation of
      viral mutations conferring resistance to the drugs and protect the patient from the risk of
      opportunistic disease and death.

      Indeed, enfuvirtide is the lead compound in the new class of antiretroviral drugs which
      inhibit the fusion of HIV-1 virus with its target cell. Its in vivo efficacy was demonstrated
      during the pivotal studies TORO 1 and 2. Despite its efficacy, maintaining long-term
      treatment with enfuvirtide is nonetheless difficult for patients because of the constraints
      related to twice-daily subcutaneous parenteral injections. Furthermore, these subcutaneous
      injections are associated with inflammatory reactions at the injection site in 98 per cent of
      patients, without any reduction in frequency or severity over time. It is thus critical for
      patients who are well controlled by enfuvirtide to be able to simplify their treatment by
      replacing enfuvirtide with another active compound taken by mouth, which would enable
      maintenance of the virological response and acceptable safety in patients who have usually
      failed under the three main classes of antiretroviral drugs. A new antiviral compound, viral
      integrase inhibitor called raltegravir, could be proposed instead of enfuvirtide.
