      chest tube drainage and hospital stays. Due to the feeding difficulties, it often results in
      malnutrition and the need for central hyperalimentation. In addition, it results in a
      depressed immune system with the possibility of subsequent infection. Chylothorax can be a
      significant contributor to post-operative morbidity and mortality.

      The primary aims are to determine at risk populations - certain congenital heart defects or
      certain operative procedures, to define the associated morbidity secondary to chylothorax -
      prolonged chest tube drainage, prolonged hospital stay, need for central access and
      hyperalimentation, subsequent infection and to review our current treatment methods - change
      formulas, hyperalimentation, somatostatin. The secondary aims are to determine ways to
      prevent chylothorax, determine the most successful treatment method, and to discover better
      treatment methods. This study will be conducted through a retrospective chart review.
