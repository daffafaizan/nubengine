    
      This is an international, multi-center, open-label, phase II study in patients with
      metastatic urothelial cancer after failure of platinum-based regimen and/or anti-PD-1 / PD-L1
      based immunotherapy.

      The primary objective is Objective Response Rate (ORR) based on central review.

      The secondary objectives for Cohorts 1 and 2 are Duration of Response (DOR) and Progression
      Free Survival (PFS) both based on central review and Overall Survival (OS).

      The secondary objectives for Cohort 3 are Duration of Response (DOR),Clinical Benefit Rate
      (CBR), and Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on central review by Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria; Duration of Response (DOR),Clinical Benefit
      Rate (CBR), and Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on central review for Immune-based
      therapeutics (iRECIST) criteria, Overall Survival (OS), safety and tolerability of IMMU-132
      in combination with pembrolizumab.

      Cohort 4:

        -  DOR, CBR, and PFS based on central review by RECIST 1.1 criteria

        -  ORR, DOR, CBR, PFS based on investigator review by RECIST 1.1 criteria

        -  OS

        -  Safety and tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan in combination with cisplatin

      Cohort 5:

        -  DOR, CBR, and PFS based on central review by RECIST 1.1 criteria

        -  ORR, DOR, CBR, and PFS based on investigator review by RECIST 1.1 criteria

        -  OS

        -  Safety and tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan in combination with cisplatin and
           avelumab
