      by HIV. However, continuous treatment is expensive. Intermittent treatment will always cost
      less than continuous treatment, and therefore has the potential to facilitate access to
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in developing countries. HAART also causes many
      undesirable effects. Intermittent treatment decreases exposure to drugs and is therefore
      expected to decrease side effects.

      STACCATO is a randomised trial of intermittent versus continuous anti-retroviral treatment.
      At least 600 patients on HAART, with viremia below 50 copies/ml and CD4 count above 350
      cells/ml were randomised to one of two arms, in 1:2 proportions:

        -  Arm 1: Continuation (control) arm: Drugs are continued or changed according to current
           guidelines and good clinical practice.

        -  Arm 2: CD4-guided arm: Drugs discontinued and reintroduced according to CD4 counts, with
           HAART being administered only if CD4 count is < 350 cells/ml.

      Randomized treatment will continue during an average of approximately 2 years, and will be
      followed by a period of 12 to 24 weeks' continuous treatment, for patients in both arms.

      Endpoints: The amount of drugs used, side effects, viremia and CD4 counts, number of clinical
      events, at the end of the randomized treatment period, and again 12 to 24 weeks later. A
      subproject will study the effect of treatment interruption on resistance development,
      mutations in proviral DNA and proviral DNA levels.
