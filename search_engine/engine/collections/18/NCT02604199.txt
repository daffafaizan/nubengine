    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study of
      ARC-520 in combination with entecavir or tenofovir administered to patients with Hepatitis B
      'e' Antigen (HBeAg) negative and immune active chronic HBV infection. Eligible patients who
      have signed an Ethics Committee - approved informed consent, will be enrolled and will
      receive ARC-520 or placebo in combination with entecavir or tenofovir. The study will enroll
      up to a total of 60 eligible chronic HBV infected patients. Patients will undergo the
      following evaluations at regular intervals during the study: medical history, physical
      examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and
      temperature), weight, adverse events assessment (AEs), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs),
      liver fibrosis testing, concomitant medication assessment, blood sample collection for
      hematology, coagulation,chemistry, lactate, Pharmacokinetic (PK) measures (in a subset of
      patients), exploratory Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures, urinalysis, HBV serology, Follicle
      Stimulating Hormone (FSH) testing (post-menopausal females) and pregnancy testing for females
      of childbearing potential. Clinically significant changes including AEs will be followed
      until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or
      until the patient is lost to follow-up. For each patient, the duration of the study is
      approximately 33 weeks from screening to the Day 169 follow-up visit. For patients enrolling
      into a planned extension study, the total duration of this study is approximately 25 weeks
      from screening to Day 113 end of study visit.
