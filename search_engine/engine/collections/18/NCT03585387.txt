      by proposing a new methodology that capitalizes on the cardiac positioning system (CPS) to
      reach near-zero fluoroscopy time for interventional cardiologists.

      Intracoronary navigation of balloon catheter toward an anatomical landmark will be done with
      two navigation method:

        1. Fluoroscopy alone

        2. Fluoroscopy + CPS combination.

      The order of the navigation method (method 1 then method 2 or vice versa) will be determine
      arbitrarily determined for each subject.
