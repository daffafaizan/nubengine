      Primary

        -  Determine the quality of survival of patients in the UK and other European countries
           enrolled in previous International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) 2 or 3 phase III
           trials for treatment of pediatric primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET).

        -  Compare the quality of survival between children allocated to different treatments in
           these trials.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the framework that will allow similar information to be collected across all
           participating countries in the PNET 4 trial that opened in autumn 2002.
