    
      This is a two-site pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the feasibility of a
      Virtual Psychiatric Care for Perinatal Depression (Virtual-PND) intervention protocol,
      comparing virtual care to in-person care only. Participants will be pregnant or postpartum
      women with a major depressive disorder who are referred for care at one of the participating
      study sites. Each study site is a specialist reproductive psychiatric program where women
      from the greater Toronto area are referred, and generally treated with in-person care. Those
      randomized to the virtual care group will be able to receive psychiatric visits with
      video-based visits. Those randomized to the in-person care group will receive in-person care
      only, as per usual clinical practice at the study sites. The length of the active treatment
      phase will be 12 weeks from enrolment. The overall objective of this pilot RCT is to
      determine the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT to evaluate the efficacy of the
      treatment model, comparing outcomes among those with and without access to virtual care, and
      cost-effectiveness.
