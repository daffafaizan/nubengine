    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of bendamustine, obinutuzumab and venetoclax
      in patients with untreated mantle cell lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and dose intensity of the combination of bendamustine, obinutuzumab
      and venetoclax in untreated mantle cell lymphoma.

      II. To explore methods of determining molecular remission for patients with untreated mantle
      cell lymphoma (MCL).

      III. To evaluate long-term outcomes including progression-free and overall survival for
      patients with untreated MCL who receive the combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28 of course 1 and days 1-10 of subsequent
      courses, bendamustine intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 2, and obinutuzumab IV on days 1, 8,
      and 15 of course 1 and day 1 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 45-60 days.
