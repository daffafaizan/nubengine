      in the assessment of the risk and progress of the epidemic. Shortly, more and more rapid
      tests will be available, the aim of which is to be able to obtain a good overview of the
      immune status of corresponding samples in a timely manner.

      Employees in the health sector are faced with additional challenges, not only due to the
      tightened hygiene regulations. The concern about infecting other people and/or exposing
      oneself to a relevant health risk is of great importance. A moderate to high transmission
      risk can be assumed for ophthalmology. In view of older patients and sometimes unavoidable
      proximity, targeted and reliable diagnostics can offer the potential to reduce the risk
      potential for the current situation by determining antibodies.

      A rapid diagnosis is not yet available outside of clinical studies, especially since deficits
      in specificity (contact with other coronaviruses) are to be expected. Studies on the
      serological reaction are not yet available for longer observation periods, but it can be
      assumed that positive direct detection of IgG (Anti Sars-CV-2-ELISA; Euroimmun) is available
      at the latest 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Without larger and representative
      analyses, it is currently unclear whether seroconversion is associated with permanent
      immunity or a lack of it leads to a possible susceptibility to reinfection. A combined test
      procedure is therefore to be offered to employees within the framework of a random sample.

      The query of anamnestic parameters allows the assignment to different groups (CC: past COVID
      infection, PC: possible infection, N: asymptomatic). The primary goal of the planned study is
      to provide a first preliminary evaluation of the tests used in the current context.
