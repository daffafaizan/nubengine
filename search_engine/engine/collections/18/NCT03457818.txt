      Recent research shows that diabetes has negative effects on bones and that people with
      diabetes might be more likely to break a bone. We don't know the reasons for this, but we
      suspect that normal bone replacement is slowed down in diabetes and this could slow down the
      growth of new bone. It is possible that the normal bone material becomes weaker because
      sugar-related components ("Advanced Glycation Endproducts") are making the bone more brittle.
      The investigators have shown in past research that people who have type 2 diabetes are more
      likely to have both weaker bone with lower "bone material strength" and also higher levels of
      sugar-related components ("Advanced Glycation Endproducts"). This study will focus on
      attempting to lower the sugar-related components ("Advanced Glycation Endproducts") by
      treating a group of patients with type 2 diabetes with a medication ProliaÂ® or denosumab for
      one year. The investigators will compare postmenopausal women both before and after denosumab
      use and study them in terms of different bone features based on blood tests, bone imaging, a
      bone indentation test and a measurement of sugar-related components in the skin. This study
      will help to clarify if using this medication helps improve bone strength in women with
      diabetes.
