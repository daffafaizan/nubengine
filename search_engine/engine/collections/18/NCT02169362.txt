    
      The objective of this trial is to demonstrate the safety of applying autologous PRP gel
      (Magellan® Bio-Bandage™) to acute deep partial thickness thermal burns in the first days
      after burn injury.

      The Magellan® Bio-Bandage™ Burn Wound Care Kit is intended for the preparation and
      application of an autologous biological covering to deep partial thickness burn wounds to
      delay or minimize skin grafting requirements.
