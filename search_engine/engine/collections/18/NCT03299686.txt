      subjects entered the treatment period and were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of the two
      treatment groups:

        -  300 mg CJM112 s.c. injection received once per week for the first 4 weeks, followed by
           once every two weeks up to Week 12 (Day 85) + standard of care treatment.

        -  Matching placebo + standard of care treatment. After completion of the last dose on Day
           85 of treatment period, subjects returned for the final efficacy assessment on Day 92.
           Following the treatment period, all subjects entered a 13-week safety follow-up period,
           including the End of Study (EoS) visit on Day 176.
