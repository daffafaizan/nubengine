      with advanced refractory malignancies. Subjects of solid tumors or hematologic malignancies
      will be included as per selection criteria. Starting dose for P1446A-05 in this study is 75
      mg orally once daily for 14 days followed by 7 days rest. This constitutes one cycle for
      P1446A-05.Three patients will be enrolled in first cohort at this starting dose of P1446A-05.
      If this dose is well tolerated then dose escalation will be undertaken for subsequent cohorts
      as per accelerated titration design as described in protocol till maximum tolerated dose(MTD)
      for P1446A-05 is determined. The MTD will be the recommended phase 2 dose. 10 additional
      patients might be enrolled at this MTD to further evaluate safety and efficacy. It is
      expected that around 50 subjects would be enrolled in the study.Safety assessment will be
      conducted on the basis of vital signs, physical examination and laboratory investigations
      undertaken at regular intervals as per the schedule.
