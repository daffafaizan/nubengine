      unfractionated heparin (UFH)for the treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis(DVT) and
      may also be so in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Only limited data are
      available on the evaluation of body weight adjusted LWMH and standard UFH for the initial
      treatment of PTE in Chinese population.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether body weight-adjusted, subcutaneous Nadroparin
      is as effective and safe as UFH for treatment of patients with objectively documented PTE.

      An open-label, adjudicator-blinded, randomized controlled trial of patients with symptomatic
      non-massive PTE from 37 major hospitals in China is conducted . Intravenous UFH was
      administered received an initial bolus dose of 80 IU/kg, followed by a continuous infusion at
      an initial rate of 18 IU/kg /hour. The dose was subsequently adjusted by activated partial
      thromboplastin time (APTT) monitoring. LMWH (nadroparin) was administered subcutaneously at a
      dose of 86 anti-factor Xa IU/kg every 12 hours.

      Both treatments were overlapped with at least 3 months of warfarin therapy. Main outcome
      measures were combined end point of clinical effect, image improvement,Recurrent venous
      thromboembolism(VTE), major bleeding, and death within 14 days and 3 months of randomization.
