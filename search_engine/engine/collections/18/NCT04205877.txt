      occurs in the United States annually. However, there are no comprehensive data collection
      tools for this procedure. The current databases do not include multiple data points, or
      follow-up data, or a section for specific adverse events to be documented. Moreover, until
      now, there has been no approved devices for PDA closure in children < 2kg. This clinical
      study is the first of its kind to collect data from all transcatheter device closure of PDA
      in children < 2kg performed in the USA.This study will be limited to children between 700 to
      2000 grams who are the most vulnerable population undergoing this procedure. This will allow
      us to understand the real world experience (efficacy and safety) of using the Amplatzer
      Piccolo Occluder and other devices in an extremely vulnerable, yet highly underserved
      population. The study will allow for standardization of this procedure throughout the country
      for the small children (<2 kg) with a PDA. This is a multi-center, single arm, observational
      data collection study. This will be a large population study to help analyze outcomes in
      subjects <2 kg. The trial has two primary endpoints for safety and effectiveness without
      formal hypothesis. The safety and effectiveness results will be compared with data reported
      in the ADO II AS IDE and Continued Access Protocol studies.
