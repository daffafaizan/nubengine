    
      RB has developed a fixed-dose combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol). Since
      the pharmacological actions of ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) differ in their site
      and mode of action, the combination would be expected to be more effective than either active
      alone, given that pain is multi-factorial with different mediators.

      The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of
      ibuprofen/acetaminophen (paracetamol) combination with leading market analgesics.

      The efficacy and tolerability was assessed in terms of total analgesic effect, peak analgesic
      effect, onset and duration of action and the subject's overall assessment of the study
      medication.
