      and transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) will be used to quantify and optimize stimulation
      effects. We will test the hypothesis that tFUS can induce regional brain activity and use EEG
      to localize and image the brain electrical activity as induced by TFUS stimulation. Subjects
      will be recruited for MRI scan and then undergo motor and/or sensory tasks, and during these
      tasks, subjects will receive tFUS and concurrently be monitored by EEG. This tFUS-EEG study
      is aimed at exploring effects of tFUS and the use of EEG in providing electrophysiological
      responses to brain activation following tFUS stimulation.
