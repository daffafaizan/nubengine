        1. Primary hypothesis: In preterm infants (GA <29 weeks or GA <35 weeks and SGA)
           individualized and optimized nutrition will increase velocity of growth (weight gain
           velocity by 2 g x kg-1 x day-1 and length velocity by 0.2 cm per week) from birth to 36
           weeks of postmenstrual age (GA plus postnatal age) or discharge (whichever comes first)
           in comparison with optimized nutrition.

        2. Secondary hypotheses: Individualized and optimized nutrition will improve
           neurodevelopmental outcome and reduce the risk of disproportionate growth (excess fat)
           in the NICU and findings suggestive of metabolic syndrome in the first 3 years of life.

      Study design:

      Double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT): After consent, 150 neonates will be
      randomized to one of two groups.

      Study intervention: Patients will be randomized to either:

        1. Control: optimized nutrition: Milk fortification will be based on current
           recommendations and optimized by adjustment of nutrients once a week based on blood
           levels of urea nitrogen and albumin and velocity of growth (weight and length).

        2. Intervention: Individualized and optimized nutrition: Milk fortification will be
           optimized as in control neonates. In addition, nutrition will be individualized every
           day. Milk fortification will be adjusted based on daily measurements of macronutrients
           in human milk using near-infrared analysis.

      Randomization will be done by computer provided by a statistician using random block
      allocation and stratification by GA and size for age (AGA 23-28 weeks, SGA 23-28 weeks and
      SGA 29-34 weeks). Twins and multiples will be randomized to the same arm of the study.
