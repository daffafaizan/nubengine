        1. To define a panel of skin and blood biomarkers associated with disease activity and
           pruritus in Netherton syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, and other ichthyosis subtypes.

        2. To determine if blood samples can serve as surrogates for skin immune activation and
           will correlate with disease severity.

        3. To determine FLG, SPINK5, TGM1, or other mutation via buccal/saliva samples in
           ichthyosis subjects

        4. To determine differences in alterations of epidermal lipids and proteins in the outer
           stratum corneum of epidermis collected from tape strips in patients with ichthyosis
           compared to the general population. There will also be a difference detected in
           epidermal lipids from blood samples.
