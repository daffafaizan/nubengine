      Drug Study Dosage: Patients will receive an injection (0.5 mL, 0.4 mL, or 0.2 mL of the 6%
      Anecortave Acetate suspension or 0.5 mL of the 10% suspension) of study medication every 4
      months.

      Active Ingredients: Anecortave Acetate (AL-3789)

      Route of Administration: Sub-Tenon injection

      Objective(s): To evaluate the safety and efficacy of four dosages (50 mg, 30 mg, 24 mg, or 12
      mg) of Anecortave Acetate (AA) for the prevention of steroid-induced intraocular pressure
      (IOP) elevations caused by Retisert.

      Study Population: Approximately 24 patients

      Structure: Parallel Group Duration of Treatment: 3 years

      Description: Observer-masked study of the safety and efficacy of Anecortave Acetate 6% or 10
      % administered by a sub-Tenon injection. Up to 24 patients with recent implantation of a
      Retisert implant will be given a sub-Tenon injection of either 0.5 mL, 0.4 mL, or 0.2 mL of
      6% Anecortave Acetate Sterile suspension or 0.5 mL of the 10% suspension. Patients will
      receive periodic evaluations and re-treatment every 4 months for as long as 3 years. The end
      point will be an IOP which requires surgical intervention. An initial assessment of efficacy
      will be made at 18 months. If any patient treated with a lower dose develops an IOP of
      greater than 30mHg, then they are eligible to receive the 50 mg dose.
