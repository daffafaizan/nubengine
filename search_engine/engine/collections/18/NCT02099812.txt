    
      In this study potential participants who log in to the Amazon Mechanical Turk website as a
      worker and who have a HIT approval rate of at least 90% will be allowed to view and
      participate in the study. If a potential participant agrees to participate in the study by
      accepting the HIT, the participant will be asked to complete a brief survey (approximately
      150 questions; see sample survey in "other supporting documents") and various decision making
      tasks (e.g., delay discounting assessment, reinforcer valuation assessment etc.). This survey
      and accompanying tasks will solicit: (a) general demographic information such as gender, age,
      income, and education; (b) information about their health and health behavior practices, such
      as eating habits, alcohol and cigarette use; (c) questions about their food preferences and
      value of foods; (d) information about their valuation of immediate versus distant
      events/rewards.
