      Ophthalmic imaging has made considerable progress in the last years. Especially the
      introduction of optical coherence tomography and the scanning laser ophthalmoscope has helped
      to understand the structural changes underlying various retinal diseases. However, the
      appearance of structural changes during retinal disease often represents irreversible
      functional loss with only limited treatment options. In order to prevent loss of vision,
      retinal diseases should ideally be diagnosed before structural changes occur. This can be
      achieved by imaging metabolic changes of the retina as most retinal diseases such as age
      related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy are associated with distinct metabolic
      changes, mainly related to oxidative stress.

      Recently, a novel device for imaging fluorescent lifetimes of the retina in vivo, the
      fluorescent lifetime ophthalmoscope (FLIO), has been developed. This device is able to
      measure fluorescence lifetimes in the retina on a macroscopic level and may be able to shed
      new light on metabolic diseases of the retina.

      Objective

      To define fluorescence lifetime characteristics in healthy patients and patients with various
      retinal diseases.

      Methods

      The investigators will use a novel device, the fluorescence lifetime ophthalmoscope (FLIO) to
      investigate fluorescence lifetimes in the human retina.
