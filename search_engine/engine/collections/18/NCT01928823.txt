    
      The present study is a multicenter study with two participating institutions: The "Klinik für
      Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin" and the "ZPHU - Zentrum
      für Psychotherapie am Institut für Psychologie, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin". It is a
      randomized, placebo-controlled and double blind study with agoraphobic patients receiving a
      manualized cognitive behavioral therapy. The randomization and blindness refers to medication
      with an antibiotic called D-Cycloserine: One group receives D-Cycloserine after exposure
      sessions and the other group is treated with a placebo. The aim is to find out, whether or
      not D-Cycloserine augments psychotherapy outcome when administered after an exposure.
      Altogether, 78 patients will be treated. Before therapy, all patients receive a clinical
      examination to ensure that no contraindications for participating (like cardiac defects or
      serious central nervous system diseases) are present. In the following diagnostic sessions
      therapists conduct standardized assessments and after four diagnostic sessions therapy
      starts. All patients receive six therapy sessions, whereof three consist of exposures. When
      exposures are successful, D-Cycloserine or Placebo is administered afterwards. At the last
      therapy session another clinical examination to control several parameters is conducted. One
      month after therapy, two follow-up sessions with assessments take place.
