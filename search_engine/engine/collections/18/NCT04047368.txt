      (PCI). Reduction of the calcified plaque mass is necessary to achieve adequate stent
      expansion during further course. Rotablation has been the only reliable option to treat
      extremely calcified coronary lesions for a long time. Coronary lithoplasty has been recently
      introduced as a new promising treatment option in this special subset. It provides the unique
      opportunity to break severely calcified plaque structures even inside deeper layers of the
      vessel wall. Aim of this study is to compare rotablation and coronary lithotripsy for
      treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions. Plaque structure, plaque volume, as well as
      lumen diameters will be analyzed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) before and after
      debulking, as well as after stent implantation.
