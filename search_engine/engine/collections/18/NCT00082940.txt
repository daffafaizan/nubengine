      Primary

        -  Determine the complete and partial response rate in patients with fludarabine-refractory
           B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with denileukin diftitox.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients (regardless of CD25 receptor density) treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving a complete response after 8 courses proceed to follow-up. Patients
      achieving a partial response or stable disease after 8 courses may continue treatment at the
      discretion of the investigator.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually until relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
