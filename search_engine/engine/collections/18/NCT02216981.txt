    
      The main aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Intensive CBT
      for treatment resistant OCD when participants are randomized to this format.

      This study aims to establish an estimate of the relative efficacy of both Intensive and
      Weekly CBT when compared individually to wait list, for participants with a diagnosis of OCD,
      who have previously not responded to CBT.
