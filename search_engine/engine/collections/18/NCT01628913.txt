      (histologically confirmed well and moderately differentiated) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
      (pNET) were randomized to either BEZ235 or everolimus. The study was planned to include 140
      patients, with 70 patients in the BEZ235 treatment group and 70 patients in the everolimus
      treatment group. An interim analysis was conducted on 62 randomized patients. The study was
      terminated as the BEZ235 treatment did not demonstrate a progression free survival advantage
      to everolimus treatment.
