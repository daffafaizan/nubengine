      consisted of a 2 week screening period followed by an 80 week double-blind treatment period.
      Subjects who met all eligibility requirements were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by
      country, gender (male and female) and pre-screening HbA1c (≤9% or>9) either to MET or AVM.
      When the substudy was added, a new randomization was created for the participating centers.
      Those subjects in the bone sub-study were stratified by country, gender (male, premenopausal
      female, and postmenopausal female), pre-screening HbA1c (i.e., ≤9%; >9%), and either to MET
      or AVM.

      At randomization, Visit 3 (Week 0), subjects were initiated at Dose Level 1. Treatment with
      AVM was initiated at a dose of 4 mg/500 mg and titrated up to a maximum total daily dose of
      AVM 8 mg/2000 mg. Treatment with MET therapy was initiated at a dose of 500 mg and titrated
      up to a maximum daily dose of 2000mg.
