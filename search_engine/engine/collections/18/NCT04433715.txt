    
      Purpose Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 (UDI-6), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7 (IIQ-7)
      and The International Consultation on Incontinence (ICIQ-SF) Short Form are used to diagnose
      individuals with urinary incontinence (UI) and to assess the impact of the dysfunction on
      patient quality of life. While ICIQ-SF has fixed cutoff values - UDI-6 and IIQ-7 do not. We
      aimed to find the cutoff scores for UDI-6 and IIQ-7 in women with UI.

      Methods The study involved 205 women aged between 31 and 83 years - 155 with, and 50 without
      UI symptoms. All participants completed all three questionnaires: ICIQ-SF, UDI-6 and IIQ-7.
      Patients were categorized according to their ICIQ-SF scores, as symptomatic ICIQ-SF â‰¥6
      (n=134) and asymptomatic ICIQ < 6 (n=60). The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve
      was used to test how well UDI-6 allowed a discrimination between patients suffering from UI
      and those who do not. AUC (Area under Curve) statistic was calculated to measure the UDI-6
      and IIQ-7 Total Score efficiency.
