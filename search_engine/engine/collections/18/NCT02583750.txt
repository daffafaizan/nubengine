      for the participants to qualify for the study, each had to wear a pedometer for a week before
      the study began to determine eligibility. Each participant came to the lab for an oral
      glucose tolerance test on a morning, following three nights when they were sleep deprived,
      and on another morning when they had three nights' sufficient sleep. The sequence of the oral
      glucose tolerance tests were randomly assigned. The sleep duration for participants was
      monitored by the readings of the sleep monitors that each participant wore. The oral glucose
      tolerance tests were performed after an overnight fast. A 20-gauge polyethylene catheter was
      placed in the antecubital vein for blood sampling. Blood samples were drawn once (0 min)
      before and 4 times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) after a 75g glucose drink was consumed for the
      determination of plasma glucose, insulin, and concentrations of other factors. Each
      participant was told to continue their regular routine during the study period, including
      diet, caffeine usage, and exercise.
