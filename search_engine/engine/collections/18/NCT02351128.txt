    
      The efficacy will be considered as success if patient have a positive response to lanreotide.

      Primary criterion Positive response at 3 months will be defined according to the RECIST 1.1
      criteria (clinical and TDM evaluation will be done at 3 months): complete response (CR) or
      partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at 3 months.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assessment of the primary criterion at M6, M9, M12, M18 and M24

        -  Description of the overall survival and time to progression

        -  Assessment of the efficacy of the following radiological exams for staging the disease:
           SPECT-CT and TEP-CT

        -  Description of the correlation of SPECT-CT results (positivity or negativity) and
           response to treatment, and the correlation of TEP-CT results and response to treatment

        -  Description of the safety and tolerability of lanreotide in this study

      Population and Methods

      Experimental plan French national prospective multicentre phase II one-arm study. This
      one-arm study, for which the primary endpoint is overall response to lanreotide, will follow
      an A'Hern plan in one step.

      Population Inclusion criteria

        -  Histologically confirmed neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin (Merkel cell carcinoma)
           with inoperable local-regional disease or distant metastatic disease (stages IIIB or IV
           AJCC 2010), cerebral nervous system metastases will be allowed.

        -  First line of treatment or more

        -  Measurable disease: at least 20 mm by conventional techniques or 10 mm by spiral CT scan

        -  Age 18 years or older;

        -  WHO performance status ECOG 0-3

        -  premenopausal patients must use effective contraception

        -  No other prior malignancy within 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or
           squamous cell carcinoma or in situ cancer of the cervix

        -  No other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy or hormone therapy.

        -  At least 4 weeks since adjuvant chemotherapy, 14 days since radiotherapy and 2 weeks
           since surgery

        -  Biological functions: absolute neutrophil count at least 1000/mm3, platelet count at
           least 100000/mm3, haemoglobin at least 9g/dl (transfusion allowed), bilirubin no greater
           than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), SGOT and SGPT no greater than 2.5 times ULN,
           no untreated chronic liver disease, creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN, no
           untreated chronic renal disease, no untreated diabetes or infection

        -  Written informed consent

      Exclusion criteria

        -  previous hypersensibility to lanreotide treatment

        -  complicated and untreated cholelithiasis

        -  pregnancy or breast-feeding

        -  patient treated with cyclosporine

      Studied treatment Lanreotide 120 mg sub-cutaneously every 28 days during 12 weeks, followed
      by injections every 28 days if response is positive until progression. The expected rate of
      positive response is 50% of patients at 3 months and 25% of patients at 1 year.

      Evaluation Criteria and follow-up of the study The inclusions will be done during 2 years and
      the follow-up of patients is planned to be 2 years, to have an optimal assessment of
      progression free survival in case of response to treatment, with a total study duration of 4
      years.
