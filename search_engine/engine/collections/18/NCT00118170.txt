      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of BAY 43-9006 in patients with hepatic or renal
      dysfunction (part 1 of the study).

      II. To determine a tolerable starting dose of BAY 43-9006 in patients with varying degrees of
      hepatic or renal dysfunction (part 2 of the study).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 9
      treatment cohorts according to hepatic or renal function.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib once on day 1 and then once daily, twice daily, or every
      other day beginning on day 8 and continuing for 3 months. Patients are re-evaluated at 3
      months. Patients with responding disease may continue study treatment in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients (per treatment cohort) receive escalating doses of sorafenib until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
