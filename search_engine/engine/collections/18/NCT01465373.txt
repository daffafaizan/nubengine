      progesterone (Endometrin, Ferring Pharmaceuticals) compared to progesterone in oil injections
      in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) donor egg recipients. The secondary objective is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of freezing/vitrification of donor eggs. Effectiveness of vitrification
      will be evaluated by egg thaw/survival, fertilization, and implantation rates.
