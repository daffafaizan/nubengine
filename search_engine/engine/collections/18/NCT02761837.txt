      exacerbation risk factors. For patients with a history of frequent exacerbations or B-agonist
      overuse, the EHR notifies a nurse who uses an EHR-generated tailored clinical report and
      patient directed decision support tool to engage and empower patients to develop an action
      plan in collaboration with providers. EHR-templated notes and order sets facilitate care plan
      execution. Poor controller medication adherence or unaddressed smoking results in the patient
      being automatically enrolled in an IBCT medication refill or smoking cessation program.
      Breathe Well uses multiple EHR functions and a patient and provider team to address barriers
      to evidence-based asthma care for providers.The study will be conducted in 26 primary care
      clinics of Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) using a pragmatic clinical trial design. Up to
      15,000 high-risk asthma patients will be assigned to Breathe Well or guideline-based usual
      care based on their clinic.
