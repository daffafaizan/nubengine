      (IPG) mediator of insulin action, namely a D-chiro-inositol-containing IPG (DCI-IPG),
      contributes to the insulin resistance of some women with PCOS. Our interest in this area
      stems directly from our previous studies, which demonstrated that administration of the
      precursor, D-chiro-inositol (DCI), to both obese and lean women with PCOS improved glucose
      intolerance while reducing circulating insulin, and simultaneously improved ovulatory
      function and decreased serum androgens. These findings were recently confirmed in a
      large-scale study by an independent group. The findings of these three studies suggested that
      administration of DCI improved insulin sensitivity in PCOS, which then resulted in an
      improved hormonal and metabolic milieu.
