      on improving executive functions and lessoning disability among community-dwelling people
      with ABI, and to determine whether the effects of the intervention persist 1 year following
      the intervention.

      To address these purposes, a double-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will
      be implemented to assess the efficacy of the strategy training intervention program in
      comparison to the control group. An expected sample of 180 adults with ABI-related cognitive
      impairments and are undergoing outpatient rehabilitation services will be recruited.

      These participants will be blinded and randomly assigned to the intervention group and the
      attention control group at a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome measures, including Wisconsin
      Card Sorting Task (WCST), Stroop Test, Trail-Making Test, and Montreal cognitive assessment
      (MoCA), will be administered at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), 3-month follow-up
      (T3), 6-month follow-up (T4), and 12-month follow-up (T5). Data will be analyzed
      quantitatively andqualitatively.

      Findings of this study will provide important evidence on whether the strategy training
      intervention has immediate and long-term effect on executive functions. These findings will
      together support the application of the program in rehabilitation practice and inform future
      study development.
