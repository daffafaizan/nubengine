      pre-operative gabapentin administration on acute postoperative pain. We hypothesize that
      immediate post-operative pain will be improved with pre-operative administration of
      gabapentin.

      We plan to conduct a prospective randomized trial to assess the effect of a single immediate
      pre-operative dose of gabapentin 300mg on immediate post-operative pain in patients
      undergoing laparoscopy for gynecologic indications. This concept has been studied in patients
      undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. We aim to study the effect on patients undergoing
      laparoscopy.
