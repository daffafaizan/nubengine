      e-cigarette solutions containing varying amounts of nicotine. This is a randomized,
      double-blind study with a within-subject cross-over design, using e-liquids with 5 different
      flavors and 4 different levels of nicotine for a total of 20 different e-liquid formulations.
      Each subject will participate in 4 test sessions. The order of flavor and nicotine delivery
      will be randomized. At each test session, they will undergo directed self-administration, in
      a randomized order, then an ad libitum self-administration session where they can choose
      among all of the e-cigarettes used during the directed session. The primary aims assess the
      impacts of nicotine and flavor (and their interactions) on participants' subjective ratings
      of the e-liquids during the 'directed' self-administration component, and self-administered
      puffs during the ad libitum self-administration component. In addition, the study will
      explore the impact of sex/gender and sensitivity to nicotine aversiveness or bitterness (as
      operationalized by genetic variations in the alpha-5 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine
      receptor that influences the aversive effects of nicotine, or a taste receptor number 38 (
      TAS2R38) important for bitterness perception) on study outcomes.
