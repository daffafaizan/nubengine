      nephropathy (CBCIN) risk tool in patients undergoing PCI versus usual care. Only inpatients
      will be included in this study. These inpatients will be compared to historical controls
      obtained using the medical record of age- and gender-matched inpatients who underwent cardiac
      catheterization with at least two consecutive daily post-procedure creatinine values. The
      percentage PCI will be matched in the retrospective series.

      In the prospective group, the operator will be exposed to the CBCIN risk tool before and
      during care delivery with estimated CIN risk. The CBCIN risk tool estimates CIN risk based on
      the status of known risk factors (and suggests an associated standard hydration strategy
      based on left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure), which are automatically prepared from the
      patient's Electronic Medical Record and presented to the operator for review. This
      functionality has been evaluated in previous research and was found to be stable and
      reliable. Based on the data presented by and reviewed in the CBCIN risk tool, the operator
      may use the information and adjust therapy as clinically indicated (i.e. the risk tool is not
      the basis for clinical decisions). Following the PCI, serum creatinine will be measured as
      per treating physician, but those who undergo at least two consecutive daily serum creatinine
      measurements starting the day after the procedure will be included in the study. These
      patients will be called 6 months and 12 months post-procedure to determine mortality and
      re-hospitalization status.
