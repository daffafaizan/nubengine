      The cause of UCDs is a deficiency in one of eight enzymes responsible for removing ammonia, a
      waste product of protein metabolism, from the bloodstream. Normally, ammonia is converted
      into urea and then removed from the body in the form of urine. However, in people with UCDs,
      ammonia accumulates unchecked and is not removed from the body. Toxic levels of ammonia can
      build up and cause irreversible neurologic damage that can affect metabolism, cognition,
      sensation, and movement. This study will focus on the most common enzyme disorder among UCDs,
      ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), a disorder inherited from mothers. Using
      different types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study will evaluate how UCD-related
      neurologic injuries affect metabolism, cognition, sensation, and movement in adults with
      OTCD.

      Participants in this study will attend an initial study visit that will include a review of
      medical history, current symptoms, impairments, and diet history; urine and blood collection;
      a physical exam; a full neurological exam; and cognitive and motor testing. During this
      visit, participants will undergo imaging studies and additional cognitive and motor testing
      over a 2- to 3-day period. This will include standard MRI studies and four sessions
      consisting of functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging, and 1H magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy. For the fMRI study, participants perform various motor and behavioral tasks
      while in the imaging scanner. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is used to study and
      evaluate the chemical makeup of specific brain areas. Diffusion tensor imaging is used to
      assess myelination of major brain pathways and their alteration in disease states. This study
      will involve one-time participation. There will be no follow-up visits for this study.
