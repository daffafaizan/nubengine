      metabolic profiles that are unique. These profiles may contribute to the caliber of their
      athletic performance, and they may provide keys to understanding select genetic and metabolic
      conditions.

      Therefore, the specific aims of this project are as follows:

        -  Specific Aim 1: Characterize the fecal microbial communities in athletes participating
           in the summer 2016 games and in athletes not participating in the Olympic games

        -  Specific Aim 2: Characterize the fecal microbiome metabolome (untargeted) in athletes
           participating in the summer 2016 games and in athletes not participating in the Olympic
           games

        -  Specific Aim 3: Characterize selected serum analytes and single nucleotide polymorphisms
           (SNPs) of elite athletes participating in the Summer 2016 games and in athletes not
           participating in the Olympic games, via serum and saliva analyses, respectively

        -  Specific Aim 4: Retain specimens from Olympic athletes participating in the summer 2016
           games and in athletes not participating in the Olympic games for future research

        -  Specific Aim 7: Examine for the presence of Zika virus RNA in study participants who
           exhibit symptoms

      Stool, urine, and blood specimens will be collected to study the stool metabolome, as well as
      serum analytes and single nucleotide polymorphisms, and the nature and extent of exposure to
      pathogens and infectious agents. These will be compared between Olympic athletes and other
      non-Olympic elite athletes.
