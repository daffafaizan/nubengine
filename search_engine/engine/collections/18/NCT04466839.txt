      the pandemic and its consequences. In Parkinson's disease, where there are routine situations
      with difficulties adjusting to newness, patients in the current situation may be particularly
      affected and present anxiety due to great difficulties in adaptation.

      The repercussions in terms of symptoms (motor and non-motor) of the disease could be very
      significant. In this population already widely exposed to anxio-depressive symptoms
      (depression being a common symptom of Parkinson's disease, affecting up to 30 to 40% of
      patients outside of crisis periods), we can expect a risk increased psychiatric
      decompensation. The psychiatric consequences could not be limited to the current period but
      also concern long-term patients, in particular if there is decompensation of other symptoms
      of the disease (motors, complications linked to treatment, etc.).

      The consequences of COVID-19 in these already fragile patients should be evaluated. It will
      be important to appreciate the confinement consequences imposed on the patient on the course
      and impact of the disease.

      These consequences can be assessed by the end of confinement and 6 months after the latter is
      lifted.

      This is an observational, French multicenter study, of an uncontrolled cohort of parkinsonian
      patients followed by doctors from Parkinson Expert Centers in hospitals.
