      new and data in the literature are scarce. A recent randomised controlled trial by Ngan Kee
      et al compared continuous infusions of norepinephrine and phenylephrine to prevent
      hypotension during CD. They showed that norepinephrine was effective at maintaining blood
      pressure, with a greater cardiac output and heart rate compared to phenylephrine. However,
      the effective bolus dose of norepinephrine needed to prevent maternal hypotension was not
      determined, and since this is a relatively new arena, no dose-response studies are available
      in the literature either. Therefore, it would be logical to establish the effective bolus
      dose of norepinephrine TO PREVENT HYPOTENSION during elective CD.
