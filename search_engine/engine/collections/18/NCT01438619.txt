    
      Measurements: should be performed for 2 days

        1. 24 hour urine Na, K and Creatinine, 24 hour urine amount

             1. Calculation of urine completeness index : Creatinine/(21 x Bwt)

             2. Definition of incomplete urine collection: complete index less than 0.7 and loss of
                urine more than one time or 100 mL

        2. 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure

             1. mobile-O-graph (IEM GmbH)

             2. measurement interval: 30 minutes

        3. Measurement of peripheral blood pressure : microlife WatchBP office

             1. Sitting position

             2. After 5 minutes resting

             3. Peripheral systolic BP (pSBP), Peripheral diastolic BP (pDBP),

        4. Central aortic blood pressure

             1. SphygmoCor (AtCor Medical, Australia)

             2. Central systolic blood pressure

        5. Pulse wave velocity

             1. VP2000 (Colin, Japan)

             2. pulse wave velocity (PWV): carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity, heart-femoral Pulse
                Wave Velocity and brachial-ankle Pulse Wave Velocity

             3. distance measured by tape: distance from suprasternal notch to carotid artery,
                distance from suprasternal notch to femoral artery

             4. Silent environment

        6. Electrocardiography

        7. Blood chemistry and complete blood count

             1. Measure at the morning of first day after overnight fasting

             2. complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen/Creatinine, Fasting blood glucose, Total
                cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol

      Measurement protocol

        1. 1st day

             1. Visit hospital before 9:00 AM after overnight fasting

             2. Sampling of venous blood

             3. start 24 hour urine collection from 9:00 AM (with education for complete
                collection)

             4. start 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, in parallel with 24 hour urine
                collection

        2. 2nd day

             1. Measure central aortic blood pressure

             2. Measure Pulse Wave Velocity

             3. Electrocardiography
