      Especially when the contralateral side has progressive hearing loss assessment if cochlear
      implantation is feasible, should be carried out. Patients undergo extensive audiometric
      testing. Additionally, patients will undergo preoperative eABR. Intraoperatively eABR is
      carried out and cochlear implantation is performed. The eABR results will be correlated with
      postoperative hearing. EABR measurements are not part of the study. The results of eBAR will
      be categorized in three groups (good response, weak response and no response). The eABR
      results will then be correlated to speech understanding with cochlear implants measured with
      Freiburger monosyllables test.
