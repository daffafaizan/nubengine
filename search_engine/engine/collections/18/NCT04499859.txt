      showed that even when statin is not used as a treatment the rate of decrease of LDL
      cholesterol is correlated to the risk of heart disease. Yet whether concomitant use of
      ezetimibe and statin will have similar degree of clinical efficacy as single use of high dose
      statin in decreasing LDL cholesterol level needs further examination.
