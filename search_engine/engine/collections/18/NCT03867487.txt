    
      The overall aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and obtain a preliminary
      estimate of efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, in adolescents with
      obesity (BMI-percentile ≥95th) who have MRI-confirmed NAFLD (hepatic fat fraction ≥ 5.5%) and
      have normal fasting glucose.

      Participants will take empagliflozin, once daily, in the morning, with or without food, in
      addition to receiving lifestyle/behavioral counseling throughout the study.

      The following data will be collected throughout the course of the study: Physical exam with
      tanner staging, safety and fasting labs, fasting blood draw (biomarkers), urine sample, stool
      sample, OGTT, CGM sensor placement and removal, MRI scan (MRS-Liver), BMI/anthropometrics,
      urine pregnancy test for female participants, iDXA scan (body fat and bone density), arterial
      stiffness and blood pressure.
