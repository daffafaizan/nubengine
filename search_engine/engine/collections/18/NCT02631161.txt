    
      This is a prospective, randomized, monocenter parallel group study on restoration of tooth
      with non-carious cervical restorations. Each patient receives cervical restoration(s) either
      with glass hybrid EQUIA forte or with composite resin/adhesive combination Filtek Supreme
      XT/Clearfil SE Bond in anterior/posterior tooth region. Restorations will be provided by one
      experienced operator. One of two independent examiners will evaluate the restorations at
      baseline (1 week after placement), and after 18, and 36 months according to the FDI criteria.
      Reliability of examination will be assessed on a random sample of 30 restorations.
