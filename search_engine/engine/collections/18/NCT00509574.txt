      is included if he or she had been receiving atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for at least 3
      months and did not receive other lipid-lowering medications 4 weeks before starting
      atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Genomic DNA was collected from the blood sample of each patient
      using genomic DNA purification kit. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
      determined afterward.

      The correlation between response of statin therapy, defined as changes in lipid profiles
      including triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol, and SNPs examined.
