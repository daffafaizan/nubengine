    
      Background:

        -  Gene-expression profiling (GEP) has identified two dominant molecular subtypes,activated
           B cell like (ABC) and germinal center B cell like (GCB), that arise by distinct
           mechanisms, have distinct prognoses, and respond differently to targeted therapy

        -  Recently, genetic subtypes of DLBCL have been described within molecular subtypes that
           have distinct genotypic, epigenetic, and clinical characteristics providing biologic
           rationale for precision medicine strategies in DLBCL

        -  Frontline treatment of DLBCL is either rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
           vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP), or infusional rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
           doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, and prednisone (DA-EPOCH-R) but up to 40% of
           patients are not cured with frontline treatment

        -  Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key component of the B-cell receptor (BCR)-signaling
           cascade and selective BTK inhibitors have clinical activity preferentially in ABC-DLBCL

        -  Acalabrutinib is a selective, small molecule, second-generation BTK inhibitor approved
           for relapsed mantle cell lymphoma and demonstrated activity in DLBCL

        -  The molecular characterization of tumors that respond to DLBCL BTK inhibitors is
           incomplete; although responses occur more commonly in ABC-DLBCL, cases of GCBDLBCL show
           minor responses, and no information is available within genetic subtypes of DLBCL

        -  Patients with minor responses during 2-week window of treatment with acalabrutinib
           (100mg BID) as a single agent may benefit from acalabrutinib added to standard
           combination therapy as part of frontline therapy

      Objectives:

      -To determine the response rate, including minor response (MR), to acalabrutinib administered
      for 14 days in molecular and genetic subtypes of untreated DLBLC (ABC, GCB, unclassified,
      genetic subtypes)

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed DLBCL or high-grade B-cell lymphoma

        -  Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and CNS involvement excluded

        -  Stages II-IV

        -  HIV negative or positive

        -  Available FFPE or fresh frozen biopsy

        -  Adequate organ function

        -  Age >=18 years

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single center, non-randomized phase 2 study, with enrollment of 100
           untreated DLBCL patients. It is estimated that there may be 50% who are ABC (~50
           patients), and 50% who are GCB or unclassified (~50 patients). The accrual ceiling will
           be set at 132 to allow for inevaluable patients and to account for screen fails.

        -  The study will start with an initial 2-week window of treatment with acalabrutinib
           (100mg BID) as a single agent, with collection and assessment of molecular correlates as
           well as response rates (by imaging) by molecular subtype

        -  Treatment with chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP or DA-EPOCH-R) either alone or in combination
           with acalabrutinib will depend on response during window; those with less than 25%
           reduction during window will receive chemoimmunotherapy alone, while those with at least
           a 25% reduction in tumor lesions (sum of the products of the longest diameter) will
           receive combination therapy of chemoimmunotherapy with acalabrutinib (100mg BID on days
           1-10 of each cycle); those with clinical progression during window will move immediately
           to chemoimmunotherapy

        -  Secondary objectives include integrative genomic analysis of all untreated DLBCL that
           respond or are resistant to acalabrutinib for 14 days, event-free survival (EFS),
           progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of combination therapy of
           acalabrutinib and chemoimmunotherapy will be assessed
