    
      Females aged 18 years or older who are postpartum from a singleton gestation status post
      vaginal and with diastasis recti will be recruited. The aim of this study is to determine if
      frequency specific microcurrent therapy improves pain management of DRA by 30% or greater

      Improving DRA after microcurrent therapy in post-partum females may allow a faster, more
      effective return to activity thereby improving the return-to-duty transition and establishing
      personal readiness by meeting military fitness standards.
