    
      Patients scheduled for emergency angioplasty in the acute phase of a first ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction will be treated either by thromboaspiration followed by angioplasty or
      by angioplasty alone. The infarct size and severity will be assessed by ce-MRI and rest
      Tc99m-mibi gated SPECT performed during initial hospital stay (5th-8th day). A control MRI
      will be performed at 6-month follow-up to analyse the evolution of left ventricular volumes.
