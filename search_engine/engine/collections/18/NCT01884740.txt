        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol
           25%; 10 mL over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique
           has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of
           chemotherapy for malignant glioma. We have used this without complication in our
           patients from our Phase I protocols as well.

        2. To treat patients <22 years of age with recurring or relapsing glioma with a single
           intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of Cetuximab and Bevacizumab. Our Phase I trials have
           demonstrated the safety of SIACI delivery of these drugs in adults. This trial will
           focus on the safety and efficacy in patients <22 years of age.
