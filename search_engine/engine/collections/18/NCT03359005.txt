      dismal and unchanged over the last decades. The anti-tumor activity of VIT was demonstrated
      by several studies in the past. However, the detailed schedule of VIT was not decided. Thus,
      the investigators explored the activity of 5-d shorter schedule of VIT and 5-d x2w longer
      schedule of VIT in patients with relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma after the failure of
      first-line chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, ifosphamide and
      etoposide.
