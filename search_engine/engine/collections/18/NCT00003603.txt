        -  Compare the response rate, response duration, and survival of patients with relapsed
           multiple myeloma after treatment with lomustine, idarubicin, and dexamethasone vs
           melphalan and prednisolone.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior autologous
      transplant (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1, oral idarubicin once daily on days 1-3,
           and oral dexamethasone twice a day on days 1-4. Treatment is repeated every 28 days for
           6-9 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral melphalan once daily on days 1-4 and oral prednisolone
           twice a day on days 1-4. Treatment is repeated every 28 days for 6-9 courses in the
           absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Some patients may receive oral cyclophosphamide every 7 days and oral prednisolone on
      alternate days for 6 weeks concurrently with chemotherapy in either treatment arm.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 660 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
