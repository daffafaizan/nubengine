      colleagues using a metal bar to lift the depressed chest wall. This surgical procedure is
      usually done under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. After inserting metal bar
      into the chest wall, decreased lung compliance was shown. Previous studies demonstrated that
      administering desflurane during anesthesia resulted in marked increases in respiratory
      mechanical parameters, especially in the children with airway susceptibility. Our primary
      hypothesis was that desflurane would cause an increase in respiratory resistance and a
      decrease in lung compliance compared to sevoflurane during repair of pectus excavatum.
