      Erwinia L-Asparaginase helps stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the nutrients that
      cancer cells needed to survive.

      Study Visits:

      Erwinia L-Asparaginase will be given either outpatient or inpatient, depending upon your
      condition.

      If you are allergic to E. Coli Asparaginase or Pegylated Asparaginase, you will be given 6
      doses every other day.

      You will receive Erwinia L-Asparaginase as an injection through a needle in your vein, under
      the skin, or in your muscle, as directed by your study doctor.

      You will be monitored closely by your nurse and your doctor before, during, and after
      receiving the drug for any side effects. If you develop a severe allergy to Erwinia
      L-Asparaginase, you may not receive any more asparaginase therapy.

      The length of study will be based upon on the ALL treatment you are currently receiving. Your
      doctor will discuss the details of your treatment schedule with you.

      This is an investigational study. Erwinia L-Asparaginase is not FDA approved. The FDA allows
      patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have an allergic reaction to the U.S.-approved
      L-asparaginases to receive Erwinia L-Asparaginase. Up to 35 patients will take part in this
      study at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center.
