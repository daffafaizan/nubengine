    
      Background:

        -  Despite very significant progress in therapy for plasma cell myeloma (PCM) in the last
           decade, the disease remains mostly incurable.

        -  High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT)
           continues to be a critical component of early treatment for PCM, but it is clear that
           the disease is not eradicated by the present high-dose therapy strategy, while
           intensifying the preparative regimen has, to this day, resulted in either no improvement
           in disease control or increased toxicity.

        -  Carfilzomib (CFZ) is a newer proteasome inhibitor with increased activity and a safer
           toxicity profile than bortezomib in PCM. The favorable toxicity profile makes it a
           likely candidate for increasing anti-PCM drug exposure in the early post-AHCT period.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives

      -Evaluate feasibility and toxicity of an increasing number of doses of CFZ administered in
      the early period post-AHCT for PCM

      Secondary Objective

        -  Evaluate the immune reconstitution post-AHCT following CFZ therapy

        -  Evaluate the effects of the addition of CFZ in the early post-AHCT period on the
           response rate at day 100 post-AHCT

      Eligibility:

        -  Newly diagnosed subjects with PCM following induction therapy

        -  Subjects with documentation of persistent/refractory disease who have received no more
           than 2 salvage regimens following relapse and who have not undergone AHCT

        -  Adequate organ functions with no major co-morbidity

        -  Age greater than 18 years and less than or equal to 75 years

      Design:

        -  Phase I/II study on the backbone of high-dose melphalan on day -2 pre-AHCT

        -  Addition of an increasing number of doses of CFZ in the early post-AHCT period
           introduced in a step-wise fashion in 3 successive cohorts of 3 to 15 subjects:

      Cohort 1: add CFZ 20 mg/m^2 on days +1, +2

      Cohort 2 : add CFZ 20 mg/m^2 on days: +1, +2, +8, +9

      Cohort 3: add CFZ 20 mg/m^2 on days: +1, +2, +8, +9 and add an early post-AHCT consolidation
      following

      engraftment: CFZ 20 mg/m^2 given on days 42-43 then CFZ 56 mg/m^2 given on days 49-50, 56-57,
      then on days 70-71, 77-78 and 84-85

      -Dose-limiting toxicity, incidence of engraftment failure and treatment-related mortality are
      the objects of early stopping rules for safety purposes
