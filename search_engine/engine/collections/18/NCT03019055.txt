    
      This is a single center, single arm, open label phase I/1b study to demonstrate the
      feasibility of manufacturing CAR-T cells expressing tandem receptors against both CD20 and
      CD19 (CAR-20/19-T) in a completely closed system using the CliniMACS Prodigy device and then
      determine the safety of this dual targeted CAR in a first-in-human study of patients with
      relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies. Secondary outcomes will include response rates,
      and observed toxicities of the treatment, specifically the development of cytokine release
      syndrome (CRS), an inflammatory storm that has been seen with previous CAR-T therapies.
