      carboplatin. Lonafarnib is a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) that is active against a
      broad spectrum of tumor cell lines in vitro and tumor xenografts in nude mice. Lonafarnib has
      single-agent antitumor activity as well as enhanced activity in combination with taxanes in a
      number of tumor cell lines and in vivo models.
