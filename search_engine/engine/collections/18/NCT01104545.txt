    
      Up to three planned panels of either 8 healthy participants (Panels A and B) or 8
      participants with mild to moderate hypertension (Panel C) will be enrolled. In Panels A and
      B, 8 participants will alternately receive single rising doses of MK-3614 or placebo. All
      doses will be administered in the fasted state, except Panel A, Period 3 in which a standard
      high-fat breakfast provided approximately 30 minutes prior to dosing. Panel A will begin
      first. At least 3 days will elapse before participants in the alternate panel (Panel B) will
      receive the next higher dose. In Panel C, 8 mild to moderate hypertensive male participants
      will receive single rising doses of MK-8892 or placebo. For all panels, there will be at
      least 7 days washout between treatment periods for any given participant. Participants may
      only be enrolled in one panel of the study. All participants in periods of all panels (with
      exception of 0.25 mg fasted/fed periods) will be randomly assigned to either study drug or
      placebo, i.e., a participant could be assigned to receive study drug in one period and
      placebo in another. As per the protocol allocation plan, the same participants will receive
      0.25 mg MK-3612 in a fasted and fed state.
