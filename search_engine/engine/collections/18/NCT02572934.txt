      long-term testicular cancer (TC)-survivors treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery
      only and non-cancer treated healthy controls. Secondary aim is to assess prevalence of
      adverse late treatment effects in very long-term TC-survivors treated with chemotherapy (CT),
      radiotherapy (RT) or surgery only (SU) and investigate the relationship between GFR
      parameters and these late effects.

      Study population: Patients treated with CT, RT or only surgery for TC more than 20 years ago
      and an age-matched male control population.

      Study design: An observational cross-sectional cohort study will be performed. Patients will
      be invited for a single study visit, which consists of collection of urine during 24 hours,
      withdrawal of blood samples, filling in questionnaires, physical examination, vascular
      function and structure tests, lung function tests, digital cooling tests, neuropsychological
      assessment and a walk test.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary study parameter is renal function as expressed by
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Secondary endpoints are the prevalence of the following
      defined adverse late effects: cardiovascular disease (CVD), peripheral neuropathy, reduced
      lung function, Raynaud's phenomenon, hypogonadism, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Other
      secondary parameters are health related quality of life (HRQoL), physical fitness, markers
      for (subclinical) vascular damage, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and aging markers.
