      the bacteria in the gut. This research is being done because Investigators believe that there
      is a connection between the way food is digested by a person's gut bacteria and the
      development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and cardiovascular disease. The
      ultimate goal of this research is to eventually determine if changes to the gut bacteria can
      prevent cardiovascular disease or disease progression.
