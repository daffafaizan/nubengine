      efficiency of aggressive insulin serum glucose control is not established. Furthermore the
      modalities of insulin administration are discussed since US and European guidelines recommend
      subcutaneous administration, whereas some groups use intravenous administration of insulin.
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and the safety of a continuous
      intravenous insulin protocol versus classical subcutaneous administration of insulin. The
      study will include carotid territory stroke at the acute stage (< 6 hours of onset) confirmed
      by MRI, and randomized in intravenous versus subcutaneous insulin. The percentage of patients
      in the target range (mean capillary glycaemia within 24 hours < 7 mmol/l) is the primary
      outcome. The secondary outcomes include comparison of Modified Rankin Scale at 3 months, rate
      of hypoglycaemic events and comparison of Infarct Growth as measured on MRI.
