      d-amphetamine or the dopamine precursor levodopa over the course of five days markedly
      improves word learning success in healthy subjects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind clinical trial, we probe whether the effect can be replicated using a
      within-subject design, with administration of levodopa and placebo on alternate days for a
      total period of 10 days.

      The expected scientific results will strengthen the basis for transferring neuromodulatory
      interventions from the laboratory to stroke patients with language dysfunctions. Because of
      the heterogeneity of stroke patients, only a within-subject design can be used to probe the
      effects of pharmacological adjuncts to language therapy.
