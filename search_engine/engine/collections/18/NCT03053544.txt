      efficacy of adding metformin in non-diabetic rectal patients who undergo standard of care
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The translational aim of the study will inform on
      predictive factors (such as p53) and mechanism of action (hypoxia, proliferation). Metformin
      has been used for decades in patients with type 2 diabetes and has an extremely safe toxicity
      profile. With current interest in the use of metformin as a cancer therapeutic in
      non-diabetics, this study is expected to provide proof-of principle data for a larger study.
