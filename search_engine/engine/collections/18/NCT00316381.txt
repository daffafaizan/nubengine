      bone-marrow-derived progenitor cells in treatment of patients with acute myocardial
      infarction and low left ventricular ejection fraction. The subpopulation of CD34+/CXCR4+
      cells most likely contains the tissue-specific stem cells likely to be involved in myocardial
      salvage/regeneration after ischemic injury. This approach is novel and original, because so
      far no study identified the type of cells that actually contribute to stem cell-induced
      improvement in myocardial function in patients with AMI which were treated with unselected
      population of cells. The REGENT trial (prospective, randomized, multicentre trial comparing
      unselected BM mononuclear cells and sorted CD34/CXCR4+ cells in patients with myocardial
      infarction and low left ventricular ejection fraction) successfully treated with primary
      percutaneous coronary angioplasty within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain. The cells
      are delivered by intracoronary infusion. Efficiency is assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging, echocardiography and left ventricular angiography.
