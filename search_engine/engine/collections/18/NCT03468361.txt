      originated from Mediterranean region however, it is cultivated almost throughout the world
      now-a-days. The plant has reported folkloric uses in different parts of the world; in Iran
      the seeds of the plant is used for different pharmacological effects including antimicrobial,
      kidney stones, digestive disorders etc., in Turkey the leaves of this plant is used to treat
      hypertension, diabetes and as a diuretic in Morocco the leaves are used for arterial
      hypertension, diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiac diseases in Spain the leaves of this
      plant are used to treat hypertension, diabetes, prostititis and anemia whereas in Serbia the
      leaves of the plant are used to treat urinary tract diseases and infections. Though the
      aforementioned literature supports the diuretic and anti-hypertensive potential of parsley
      however no in-vivo studies have been reported to establish its diuretic activity in human
      subjects. Some studies have reported diuretic activity for seed aqueous extract in rats.
      Still, to evaluate the effect in human subjects, an in-vivo phase-I clinical study is needed
      to support the pre-clinical in-vivo and in-vitro diuretic effects of this plant. Our study
      aims to investigate the diuretic and anti-hypertensive activity of parsley in hypertensive
      individuals currently using conventional medication.
