      childhood is difficult and there is definite risk of damaging the vas deferens and testicular
      vessels. Laparoscopic repair of RIH has the benefit of avoiding the previous operative site.
      The aim of this study is to present the investigator's experience with laparoscopic repair of
      RIH either after open or laparoscopic hernia repair with stress on technical refinements to
      prevent recurrence. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective study of laparoscopic
      repair of recurrent inguinal hernia. Records of patients that have been subjected to
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair for RIH were reviewed and evaluated. All patients were
      subjected to laparoscopic repair of 42 recurrent hernial defects. The primary outcome
      measurements of this study include; operative time. The secondary outcomes include; hydrocele
      formation, iatrogenic ascent of the testis and testicular atrophy.
