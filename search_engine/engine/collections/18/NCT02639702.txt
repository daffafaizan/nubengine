      for example, it is recommended that agents with a short plasma half-life be administered
      multiple times per day. To date, however, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have
      shown that once-daily dosing of antipsychotics including perphenazine, risperidone,
      olanzapine, quetiapine, and asenapine is comparable to twice-daily dosing in terms of
      efficacy and tolerability, suggesting that once-daily dosing of antipsychotics is a viable
      option regardless of plasma half-life.

      This issue applies to clozapine as well, in that it has a relatively short plasma half-life
      of 12-16 hours; of note, the product monographs recommends that clozapine be administered
      more than once daily if the dose exceeds 200 mg/day in Canada. Despite this, in clinical
      practice clozapine is frequently administered once daily because of convenience and side
      effects such as a daytime sedation or somnolence, In support of this, a cross-sectional
      survey done at the investigators' own centre has revealed that clozapine was prescribed once
      daily in 75.1% of 676 patients, even though >200 mg/day was administered in 88.6%. However,
      there have been no studies comparing once-daily vs. twice-daily dosing regimens of clozapine
      in terms of efficacy and tolerability. To address this gap in the literature, the
      investigators shall conduct a pilot, double-blind, RCT to examine efficacy and tolerability
      following a switch to once-daily dosing regimen of clozapine in patients with schizophrenia
      receiving clozapine twice a day.
