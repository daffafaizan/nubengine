      expanding elderly population as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.
      Atherosclerosis in the vessels of the lower extremities can cause a variety of symptoms
      ranging from intermittent claudication to ischemic rest pain and critical ischemia with major
      tissue loss. Typically, femoropopliteal lesions have been difficult to successfully treat
      with endovascular therapy because the disease is often diffuse and located in an area of the
      body subject to significant mobility stresses such as extension, contraction, compression,
      elongation, flexion and torsion.

      The SuperNOVA clinical study is a prospective, single arm, controlled, multicenter, global
      study. Approximately 50 centers located in the United States, Europe, Canada and/or Australia
      are expected to participate in recruiting patients needing treatment of lesions in their
      femoropopliteal arteries. A maximum of 300 subjects will be enrolled to ensure that a minimum
      of 296 stented segments are treated with the Innova Stent System.
