      of at least 4 tests a day in pre and post prandial with additional controls in circumstances
      of meal or of unusual physical activities.

      Du to age, this control need supervision of an adult, in each place of children life (school,
      nursery, out-of-school center ...), according to their autonomy.

      During several years, all the actors of educational care tried to improve the welcome of the
      children affected by handicap or by chronic disease.

      Since 10 years, the team of pediatric diabetology of Mulhouse Hospital has developed a
      partnership with the department of Education by setting up every year in September of a
      training courses for voluntary teachers and all staff nursery.

      These sessions are consisted of a formal time bringing knowledge on the disease, followed by
      exchanges and finally a practical time around manipulation of the readers of glycemia and
      pumps.

      Alerts can be scheduled to warm an increase or an important reduction of blood glucose.

      The study will evaluate the child quality of life, and also parents and staffs in preschool,
      school or in out-of-school center felt too.
