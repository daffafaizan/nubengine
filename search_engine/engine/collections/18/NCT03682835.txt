      nutrient volume tolerance, gastric emptying and gastrointestinal hormones in healthy
      volunteers after an acute intake of a combination of peppermint oil and caraway oil, compared
      to placebo. In addition, the effect of a combination of peppermint oil and caraway oil on
      appetite-related sensations and upper gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed. These
      outcomes will be studied on 2 study days. On study day 1, gastric emptying rate will be
      assessed using a 13C breath test 30 minutes after intake of study medication. This test is
      followed by an intragastric pressure (IGP) measurement during which 350 mL of a nutrient
      drink will be intragastrically infused 30 minutes after intake of study medication. On the
      second study day, IGP will be measured in fasted state for 4 hours after intake of study
      medication. Hereafter, a second dose of study medication will be administered. Thirty minutes
      later, a nutrient drink will be infused until the participant is fully satiated.
      Appetite-related sensations and gastrointestinal symptoms will be rated during IGP
      measurements on a 100mm VAS. Blood samples will be collected to assess peptide hormone
      levels.
