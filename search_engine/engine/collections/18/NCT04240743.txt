      and all procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration
      of Helsinki (1964). Patients with a basicervical femur fracture were identified on admission
      to the Emergency Department of our tertiary hospital from January 2016 to January 2018.
      Patients with scheduled surgery who met the inclusion criteria and provided written informed
      consent were included in the study.

      Patients were randomly allocated to a study group by permuted blocks of randomly mixed sizes
      and stratification according to the type of surgery (CMN or SHS). Randomization was applied
      using pre-prepared randomization cards, which were placed in opaque sealed envelopes and
      given to the surgeons to open just prior to surgery, and the designated procedure was then
      performed.
