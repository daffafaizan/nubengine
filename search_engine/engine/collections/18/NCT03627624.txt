    
      The sit-to-stand test (STST) is a feasible alternative for measuring peripheral muscle
      strength of the lower limbs used as standard test at the beginning and at the end of
      pulmonary rehabilitation programme.

      Our aim was to retrospectively evaluate, in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
      patients, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 30-second STST (30-STST)
      after pulmonary rehabilitation (PR).

      Stable COPD inpatients undergoing 30-STST and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) before and after PR
      were included. Responsiveness to PR was determined by pre-to-post PR (Î”) evaluation of
      30-STST. The MCID was evaluated using an anchor-based method.
