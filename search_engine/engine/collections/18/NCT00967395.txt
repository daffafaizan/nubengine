      Spiritual healing includes several categories, including 'therapeutic touch' and
      'intercessory prayer', and the healing may be attributed to God, spirits, universal forces or
      energies, biological healing energies residing in the healer, or self-healing powers or
      energies thought to reside latent in the healed organism. The highly controversial
      hypothesized effects of distant or spiritual healing contradict our traditional sense of
      reality and are in conflict with what is generally viewed as being in correspondence with
      modern science.
