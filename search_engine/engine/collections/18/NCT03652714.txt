    
      Adult patients with postdural puncture headache will be enrolled in the study. The patients
      will be randomised to receive a ganglion sphenopalatine block (GSP-block) with either local
      anesthetic (lidocaine + ropivacaine) or placebo (isotone NaCl).

      Primary outcome is hyperactivity in the sphenopalatine ganglion assessed by pain intensity
      (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) of the postdural headache in standing position 30
      minutes after block.

      If the patients in the timeframe of 1 hour to 1 week after block does not achieve remission
      (VAS <30mm while standing) they will be offered a "rescue GSP-block" defined as a new
      GSP-block with "open-label" local anesthetic and if continued lack of remission at least 1
      hour thereafter then an epidural blood patch will be offered.
