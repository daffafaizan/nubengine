      annulus plication with the Mitralign System in eligible patients with chronic functional MR
      using an endovascular approach. Data obtained from this study, combined with extensive
      pre-clinical data, will provide important technical and early clinical outcome information
      that will drive the next phase of clinical investigation and potentially enhance the future
      design of the Mitralign Percutaneous Annuloplasty System. It is anticipated that the
      Mitralign System will one day provide physicians with a safe and effective alternative
      therapy for treating patients who are candidates for mitral valve repair and offer a primary
      therapy option for patients superior to current treatment modalities.

      This is a single-arm, multi-center, prospective study designed to test the safety and
      feasibility of the MPAS to treat patients with chronic, functional MR by performing plication
      of the posterior mitral annulus.

      Up to a total of 36 patients with chronic functional mitral regurgitation will be enrolled:
      1.) Up to 16 patients (12 patients + 1 roll-in patient per site) will be enrolled in Phase I.
      Up to thirty-four (34) patients will be enrolled in Phase II (MITRALIGN ADVANTAGE). All
      patients will be followed for 24 months. Up to 5 sites in Europe and South America will
      participate.

      Study procedures include implantation of the MPAS, Trans-Esophogeal Echo, Trans-Thoracic
      Echo, Blood test, 6-min walk, Quality of Life, Chest X-ray and ECG.

      Descriptive Statistics will be conducted for this study.
