      stage non-small cell lung cancer to help prevent early progression and to improve progression
      free survival. The primary endpoint will be to determine if the addition of nab-paclitaxel to
      nivolumab improves progression free survival compared to nivolumab alone. Retrospective
      studies will be conducted to analyze blood based immune biomarkers, and tumor biomarkers to
      better understand the effect that nivolumab combined with chemotherapy has on the immune
      system in NSCLC. Patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer who have progression
      of cancer after receiving platinum doublet chemotherapy will be randomized to receive
      nivolumab with or without nab-paclitaxel. Patients on both arms will receive a maximum of one
      year of therapy with the option to retreat at progression.
