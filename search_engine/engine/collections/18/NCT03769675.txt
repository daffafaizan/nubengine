      improve nerve function. SCS is FDA approved for the treatment of intractable neuropathic
      (nerve) pain related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. With SCS a wire is placed in the
      epidural space and the spinal cord is stimulated to interrupt the pain signal coming from the
      legs. The spinal cord stimulator is a device similar to a pacemaker (which helps treat
      abnormal rhythms of the heart). Recent studies have suggested that SCS with high frequencies
      can improve nerve function for subjects with painful peripheral neuropathy therefore, the
      investigators are looking to measure changes in nerve function after SCS for treatment of
      painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

      The purpose of this research is to gather information on the effect of high frequency spinal
      cord stimulation (HF10) on nerve function with a spinal cord stimulator.
