      corticosteroids combined with cyclophosphamide or rituximab (RTX). In recent randomized
      trials (MENTOR, GEMRITUX), the long-term remission rate of RTX is about 60%, which is similar
      to the remission rate of cyclophosphamide combined with corticosteroids in early studies. But
      there is only one published randomized trial (STARMEN) comparing the efficacy of the two
      protocols head-to-head. In STRAMEN trial, the long-term remission rate of
      cyclophosphamide+corticosteroids group was 83%, which was significantly higher than the that
      (58%) of the tacrolimus-RTX group. But in STRAMEN trial, only one single dose of RTX was
      given which might influence the efficacy of the tacrolimus-RTX arm. Therefore, head-to-head
      comparison of RTX (more than one dose) and cyclophosphamide+corticosteroid is needed. The
      optimal dose of RTX in the treatment of iMN is unclear. In MENTOR trial, RTX was given 1g on
      D1 and D15, and the rate of complete remission at 6 month was 0, so RTX was repeated at 6
      month. Based on the experience of our center, most patients need at least one repeated dose
      of RTX at 6 month.

      Based on the previous rationale, the investigators designed this study to compare the
      efficacy of cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids with RTX in the treatment of iMN.
