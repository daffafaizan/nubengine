      (ACTIV) throughout France participated at this prospective study. From October to June of
      each subsequent year, children of both sexes suffering from suppurative acute otitis media
      (AOM) with fever and/or otalgia (in order to increase the probability of pneumococcal AOM),
      aged 6 to 24 months, were enrolled.
