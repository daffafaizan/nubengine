      (Protocol recommended by manufacturer (Group Control) vs. Protocol based on the initial
      apical file). The root canals will be completed after 14 days. Patients will record
      postoperative pain during the follow-up period (7 days) using a Visual analogue scale (VAS)
      and the change in periapical radiolucency will be assessed by periapical index (PAI) scores.
