      their regular clinic visits, at the baseline before desired therapy is given, and at the time
      when treatment is changed due to either disease progression or unbearable toxicities leading
      to treatment stop/change. If treatment stop/held is due to toxicities, a 3rd set of samples
      will be collected when toxicities reduce to less than grade 1. The samples will be subjected
      to DNA extraction followed by 16S rRNA and/or shotgun sequencing metagenomic analysis. The
      data will be correlated to clinical response from treatments, toxicities, clinical data (use
      of antibiotics, PPIs, lab parameters, etc.) and tissue genetic/immunological characteristics
      (mutations, PDL1 expression, etc.) for review of response. This is not data to be used for
      treatment of these subjects.
