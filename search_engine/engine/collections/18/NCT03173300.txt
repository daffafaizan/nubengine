      symptoms of PMM2-CDG. Medical history, physical examination, laboratory testing and imaging
      studies will be performed during a single consultation. Follow-up will occur every 6 months
      at a minimum, depending on the standard of care at the investigator's institution as well as
      the clinical status of the individual patient. All medical procedures are routine. No new
      therapy is offered as part of this study, and no change in the patients' routine therapy is
      dictated by this protocol. No randomization will be performed.

      All serious and non-serious adverse events will be recorded in the study CRF database.
