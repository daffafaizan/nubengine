      crown-like structures in fat tissue, the enzyme aromatase, PGE-M in the urine and estrogen in
      blood and urine. Volunteer subjects will be expected to stay in the hospital for about 2
      weeks taking Celebrex for approximately 10 days while eating a diet similar to what they
      consumed before coming into the hospital for the study.
