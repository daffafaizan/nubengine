      tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies.
      "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved BMS-986158 as a treatment
      for any disease.

      BMS-986158 is currently still being studied in adults. This is the first time that BMS-986158
      will be evaluated in younger children, though children 12-17 years of age may also be
      included in parts of adult studies of BMS-986158.

      Research in the laboratory has shown that BMS-986158 may have activity against cancer cells.
      BMS-986158 belongs to a group of drugs called Bromodomain (BRD) and Extra-Terminal Domain
      (BET) inhibitors. These drugs block proteins that are important in reading DNA, which is a
      process important for cancer cells.
