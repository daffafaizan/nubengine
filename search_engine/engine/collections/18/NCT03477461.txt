      calculated according to standard formulas.Oxygen delivery index (IDO2) was calculated as
      arterial oxygen content multiplied by CI. Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) was
      calculated as the MAP minus right atrial pressure divided by CI and multiplied by 80.
      Pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) was calculated as the mean pulmonary artery
      pressure (PAP) minus pulmonary artery occlusion pressure divided by CI. Left and right
      ventricular stroke work index (L and RVSWI) were calculated .The following laboratory
      parameters were collected: bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT),prothrombin time, and thrombocytes.
