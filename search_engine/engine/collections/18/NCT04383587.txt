      antibody positive. Participants will then complete serologic testing for SARS CoV 2 IgG
      antibodies. The study will characterize the prevalence of antibody positivity in this
      population and assess whether there is a correlation between a pre-test confidence level
      using a Likert scale and actual antibody positivity.
