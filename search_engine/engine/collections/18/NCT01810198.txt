    
      A prospective, randomized controlled multicenter trial to determine the clinical and cost
      effectiveness of a "selective catheterization" strategy versus a "direct catheterization"
      strategy for stable patients with suspected but without known CAD and clinical indication for
      non-emergent invasive coronary angiography. Subjects in the "selective catheterization" arm
      will be followed for a primary endpoint of non-inferiority for rates of major adverse cardiac
      events (MACE) as compare to subjects in the "direct catheterization" strategy.
