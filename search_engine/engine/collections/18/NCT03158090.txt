    
      The study was designed to answer some of the most important questions about the treatment
      modalities of acromegaly, the relevance of these treatment modalities to patients' clinical
      outcomes and the economic impact of treatment programs on patients. These answers may be of
      great help to the treatment of these populations and may also help to make treatment and
      related health decisions in the future.

      This study only collects the patient's medical information during the study and does not
      interfere with the patient's treatment. Each patient will be assigned a unique patient
      identification number for the study. The sites will maintain a confidential decode list that
      enables the study staff at the site to link the assigned patient identification number with
      the patient's medical records for extraction of study-required data. These registries will be
      maintained following International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice
      (GCP) and the respective local privacy laws and requirements.
