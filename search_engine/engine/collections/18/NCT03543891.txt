      fifth most common malignancy diagnosed in women (1). The incidence of TC in the United States
      has increased by an average of 3% per year over the past 4 decades. According to the China
      National Cancer Registry data in 2015 (3), there were estimated 90,000 new TC cases in China,
      and its incidence has risen sharply. Much progress has been made in exploring the etiology
      and pathogenesis of thyroid cancer, while the exact etiology remains unknown, TC is thought
      to arise from interactions between genetic susceptibility factors, epigenetic effects, and
      various environmental factors. Besides the improvement of diagnosis, TC increasing incidence
      emphasize that other important factors such as the environment play an important role in
      disease pathogenesis. While microbiota as an environment factor to some cancers accept
      widespread attention, if microbiota also as a risk factor for TC, it is worthy to be
      considered.
