      I. Sensitivity and specificity of molecular profile of thyroid derived extracellular vesicles
      (EVs) as predictor of thyroid cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Quantity of thyroid derived EVs captured in various stages of thyroid cancer.

      II. Whether quantity of EVs decreases in proportion to response to therapy in thyroid cancer
      patients.

      III. Optimal ribonucleic acid (RNA)/deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) panel in thyroid tumor
      derived EVs to diagnose thyroid cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples on the day of surgery following anesthesia but
      prior to incision and approximately 4-6 weeks after surgery. Patients who undergo remnant
      ablation after total thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine have an additional blood sample
      collected. Patients also undergo collection of tissue samples following surgical resection of
      the thyroid. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.
