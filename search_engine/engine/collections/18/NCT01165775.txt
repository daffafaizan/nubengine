      clinical care will be eligible for the study. Once the clinical team and patients have agreed
      to pursue betamethasone therapy, the patients' treating physician or nurse will inquire if
      the patient is interested in participating in our study protocol. Those patients who are
      interested in participation will be consented by either a member of the treatment team or the
      study team. Prior to receiving the first betamethasone dose, a soft sensor for continuous
      glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be inserted superficially under the skin. For those
      patients who will be receiving a scheduled course of betamethasone, the sensor may be
      inserted up to 24 hours prior to the betamethasone administration. The patient will be
      instructed on how to wear and care for the device. She will wear the CGMS for the duration of
      her hospitalization or for up to 7 days total, whichever time period is shorter. For those
      patients who are diabetic, they will receive normal finger stick blood glucose (FSBG)
      monitoring and insulin therapy as determined by their treating physicians. Those patients who
      are not diabetic will need to have 2 FSBG checks each day to correlate with the device.
      Abnormal values will be reported to the patients' treating physician and addressed by the
      treating physician. Prior to being discharged from the hospital, the patient will have the
      device removed. The patient will otherwise be treated routinely. We will record baseline
      demographic information and medical history from each of the women. We will also record
      information from the neonates' newborn medical records.
