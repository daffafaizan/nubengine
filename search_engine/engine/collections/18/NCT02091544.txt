      study aims to investigate the changes in lifestyle behaviour of children with overweight or
      obesity and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the (governmental)
      measures taken for this, and the effect of obesity and different weight-related risk factors
      on the host response of these children.

      The goal of this sub study is to collect data to enable analyses for future research
      questions regarding the influence of the COVID-19 on the lifestyle of a child with overweight
      and their family. Endpoints are for example physical activity, eating behavior, BMI-z score,
      remote lifestyle coaching, quality of life and parental practices regarding nutrition and
      physical activity behavior. We will also measure symptoms associated with COVID-19 and the
      host response that target COVID-19.
