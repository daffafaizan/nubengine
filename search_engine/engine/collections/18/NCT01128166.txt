      heart failure, determine how sensor measurements vary during patient daily activities and
      during the development and recovery from events of worsening heart failure, develop
      algorithms capable of detecting the onset of worsening heart failure prior to the overt
      presentation of patient symptoms using reference measurements: thoracic impedance, heart
      sounds, physiologic responses to activities and respiration.
