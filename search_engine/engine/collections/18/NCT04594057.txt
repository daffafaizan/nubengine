      (i.e., head and trunk control during simulated community activities, short term community
      mobility, and patient reported participation) and relating these deficits to laboratory
      (i.e., video head impulse testing and corrective postural responses) and clinical (i.e.,
      MiniBEST and dynamic visual acuity, and visual spatial cognition) measures of gaze and
      postural stability in individuals with varied forms of vestibulopathy (unilateral vestibular
      neuritis, bilateral vestibular loss, migraine related vestibulopathy, concussion, BPPV,
      Multiple Sclerosis). Additionally, we will examine the longitudinal change of laboratory, and
      community-based measures of gaze and postural in two cohorts of people with a specific form
      of unilateral vestibular loss (Vestibular Schwannoma resection); one group of these
      individuals will receive 6 weeks of vestibular rehabilitation during the acute onset of
      symptoms and the other one will begin intervention 6 weeks post onset. This portion of the
      proposed project will test my global hypothesis that changes in community-based performance
      of head and trunk control impair recovery following the onset of VH.

      Aim 1: In individuals with vestibulopathy, characterize and compare laboratory and clinical
      measures of body structure, function, and performance to community-based, activity levels,
      performance, and patient reported participation. Hypothesis 1: The severity of laboratory and
      clinically measured gaze and postural stability function deficits will not strongly correlate
      with head and trunk control during community-based performance or patient reported
      participation. Hypothesis 2: The nature and severity of laboratory and clinically measured
      gaze and postural stability function deficits will differ between varied diagnostic groups.

      Aim 2: In individuals with unilateral vestibular hypofunction following unilateral vestibular
      schwannoma resection, examine the longitudinal trajectories of laboratory and clinical
      measures of body structure, function and performance, and community-based performance,
      activity levels, and patient reported participation during periods of spontaneous and
      rehabilitation driven recovery. Hypothesis: Recovery of laboratory and clinical measures will
      follow different trajectories than measures of community-based performance and patient
      reported participation during both periods of spontaneous and rehabilitation driven recovery.
