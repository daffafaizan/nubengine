      and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is complex and not univocal. Both a
      stimulatory and neutral effect of IGF-I on HPA axis has been demonstrated in in vitro models
      and in healthy subjects, respectively. The effect of GH on the 11beta-hydroxysteroid
      dehydrogenases (11beta-HSD) isozymes is always to be considered in patients affected by GHD
      both at diagnosis and during GH treatment. Indeed, in peripheral tissues, corticosteroid
      hormone action is partially determined by the activity of 11beta-HSD, two isozymes of which
      interconvert hormonally active cortisol and inactive cortisone. 11beta-HSD2 inactivates
      cortisol to cortisone in the kidney, whilst 11beta-HSD1 performs the reverse reaction
      activating cortisol from cortisone in the liver and adipose tissue.

      For these reasons, many data are available about the evaluation of adrenal function in
      patients affeceted byGHD, but most of them come from patients with organic GHD or adult
      patients, while few and discordant data are available on pediatric GHD patients. We aimed to
      evaluate, through insulin tolerance test, the adrenal function in about 30 children with
      overt diagnosis of idiopathic GHD both at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of GH treatment.
