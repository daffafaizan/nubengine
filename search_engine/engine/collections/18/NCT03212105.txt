      focuses on acceptance rather than control of thoughts, emotions and physical sensations,
      regardless of their quality. The crux of ACT is teaching patients to separate themselves from
      their thoughts (e.g., cognitive defusion) and thus decrease the importance placed on them.
      ACT has been successful in treating psychological disorders and emotional disturbances alone
      or when associated with physical illnesses, those that cause pain in particular. While ACT is
      effective, it may not be feasible for busy orthopedic practices. However, simple exercises
      that teach patients to deemphasize the importance they place on thoughts might be feasible in
      orthopedic settings where patients present with pain and strong emotions. An ACT exercise,
      delivered before the orthopedic appointment, has the potential to set the tone for a more
      positive experience for both patient and provider, by lowering a patient's pain intensity,
      state anxiety (e.g., anxiety symptoms in the present moment) as measured comprehensively by
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire, distress, depression, anger, and anxiety,
      all four measured by 1 item emotional thermometers (visual scales used to rate different
      emotions). This exercise might help patients see ACT exercises as a helpful part of their
      recovery. Some might be motivated to learn more and to continue using them at home. This
      could improve their recovery from and adjustment to the medical condition.
