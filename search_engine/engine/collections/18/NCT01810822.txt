      French/Belgium cohorts) were studied for the association with diabetic nephropathy (DN) with
      a total of 1396 patients. The patients were classified according to the urinary
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) in absence of
      nephropathy, defined as ACR <30 mg/g or UAER < 20 µg/min or < 20 mg/L and plasma creatinine
      <1.7 mg/dL; incipient nephropathy, defined as persistent microalbuminuria (ACR 30 - 300 mg/g
      of creatinine or UAER 20 - 200 µg/min or 20 - 200 mg/L) and plasma creatinine <1.7 mg/dL;
      established diabetic nephropathy, defined as past or present macroalbuminuria (ACR >300 mg/g
      of creatinine or UAER >200 µg/min or > 200 mg/L) and plasma creatinine <1.7 mg/dL; advanced
      diabetic nephropathy, defined as past or present macroalbuminuria, plasma creatinine >1.7
      mg/dL and any renal replacement therapy. Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed by Real
      Time PCR using fluorescent-labelled probes.
