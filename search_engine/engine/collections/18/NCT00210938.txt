      multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study of intravenous doripenem versus a
      comparator antibiotic to assess the effectiveness and safety of doripenem in the treatment of
      complicated intra-abdominal infections in hospitalized adults. The primary endpoint is the
      clinical response rate measured at late follow-up visit. The patients will receive either
      doripenem or comparator; treatment duration is 5 to 14 days.
