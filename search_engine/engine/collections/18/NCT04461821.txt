      more time points in a biological matrix after a dose. The purpose of TDM is to individualize
      the drug dose to achieve maximum efficacy and at the same time minimize toxicity. The concept
      of TDM could potentially be even more valuable if in addition to drug concentrations, other
      drug-regulated and drug-related metabolites could be included in the models to define optimal
      dosage. There exists a clinical need to stratify patients with better precision to improve
      current clinical and therapeutic management. Breath analysis offers an opportunity to
      non-invasively retrieve relevant information on the ongoing internal biochemical processes,
      as well as to monitor the respiratory system itself. For breath analysis, a Secondary
      Electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) breath analysis platform will be used
      to capture disease-related, drug-regulated and drug-related metabolites (breath metabolomics)
      in exhaled breath. This information, retrieved in parallel to standard of care clinical
      co-variates, could have the potential to provide a more personalized therapeutic management
      of patients.
