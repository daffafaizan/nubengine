      of the management of children with hypo-tension. Epinephrine is typically used as a
      continuous infusion (0.02-0.5 Î¼g/kg/min) for severe sustained hypo-tension and as a bolus
      (0.01 mg/kg, maximum dose = 1 mg) for bradycardia, asystole, or pulse-less arrest. There are,
      however, clinical conditions that may benefit from smaller doses of bolus epinephrine. For
      example, brief periods of hypo-tension during medical procedures, intermittent hemodynamic
      instability, and augmentation of low blood pressure in a pre-arrest condition. While a
      resuscitation (or code) dose of epinephrine would be inappropriate (as it would cause an
      unacceptable large increase in blood pressure and heart rate [HR]), a smaller dose may be
      particularly useful.

      Low-dose bolus vasopressors have been used for decades by anaesthesiologists to prevent
      post-re-perfusion injury after solid organ transplant, control cerebral oxygenation during
      anaesthesia and manage acute hypo-tension during spinal surgery. Recently, use of bolus dose
      phenyl-ephrine has been described in the emergency department setting to augment blood
      pressure during periods of hypo-tension surrounding intubation. Finally, free open access
      medical publications have provided some insight into using bolus dose pressors for acute
      hypotensive episodes in adults. However, there is few published data describing the use of
      low-dose vasopressor boluses in children.
