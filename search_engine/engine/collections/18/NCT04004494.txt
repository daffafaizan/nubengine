      morbidity and mortality amount all the malignant tumors. Due to the wide spread of lung
      cancer screening, more and more early stage lung cancer patients have been diagnosed.
      Video-assisted segmentectomy is a standard surgical procedure in treating early stage
      peripheral non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, anatomical variations of pulmonary
      vessel may cause serious problems, for example unexpected bleed during surgery.
      Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT), which is reconstructed based on the standard
      chest CT image, presents 3D images of pulmonary vessels and the tracheobronchial tree and
      therefore helps operative planning. There are several retrospective studies addressed the
      importance of 3-dimensional CT in the field of pulmonary segmentectomy. And the aim of this
      multicenter randomized controlled trial is to compare the usefulness of 3-dimensional CT and
      standard chest CT in preoperative planning of video-assisted segmentectomy.
