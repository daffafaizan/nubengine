    
      The decision on the number of embryos to transfer after an IVF cycle is based on the number
      of available embryos, the quality of the embryos, the patient's age, and the goal of limiting
      multiple gestations. Stanford Fertility Center and most IVF centers examine the embryos on
      the third day after oocyte (egg) retrieval to select for the best quality embryos to
      transfer, and depending on quality, the remaining embryos are frozen to be used in the
      future. Patients with a limited number of embryos, those that plan to replace all available
      embryos after an IVF cycle, do not need to wait until the third day after oocyte retrieval to
      select embryos, and may replace the embryos on the second day after the oocyte retrieval. We
      are examining whether pregnancy rates differ among these patients based on the day of embryo
      transfer (Day 2 vs. Day3). Patients must be undergoing IVF treatment at Stanford University
      and patients will not receive compensation for their participation (no medical costs covered
      or patient payment for participation).
