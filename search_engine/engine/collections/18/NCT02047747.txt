      inhibitor dacomitinib in the treatment of brain metastases, as measured by radiographic
      objective response rate.

      The rationale of this study is three-fold. First, the use of dacomitinib, an irreversible
      pan-ErB kinase inhibitor, is to improve the duration of response seen by reversible, EGFR
      only inhibitors. Inhibition of the multiple ErB kinases may interfere with receptor
      cross-talk as a method of developing resistance; indeed, patients who have failed erlotinib
      treatment for systemic disease have seen responses to dacomitinib. The second rationale is to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the penetration of dacomitinib into the CSF to determine if
      adequate drug levels reach the CNS, and determine if the current dosing regimen is
      appropriate. The third rationale is to determine if specific molecular phenotypes
      preferentially respond to dacomitinib. As part of this study, serum and cerebrospinal fluid
      will be collected and analyzed both for drug levels and for molecular markers to key elements
      of the ErB signaling cascade. The objective of the marker analysis to identify a distinct
      molecular phenotype that may preferentially respond to targeted drug therapy in the future.
