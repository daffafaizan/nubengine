      tissues. We hope to better understand the mechanism(s) through which alpha globin deletions
      protect against malaria, sickle cell disease or other diseases involving inflammation or
      endothelial dysfunction.

      The Physiology Unit of the Laboratory of Malaria and Vector Research studies the role of
      alpha globin in erythroid and non-erythroid tissues. The collection of human specimens from
      healthy volunteers and patients with malaria, sickle cell disease, or other diseases
      involving inflammation or endothelial dysfunction is necessary for the development of
      laboratory and physiological assays to further basic and clinical research studies. This
      protocol defines the purposes for which specimens will be collected and establishes general
      conditions under which sample collection will be performed. Development of assays and our
      research into the roles of alpha globin in normal human physiology, as well as in the
      pathogenesis of malaria and sickle cell disease, requires laboratory analysis of
      saliva/buccal swab, urine, blood, adipose tissue, bronchial brushing, and/or bronchoalveolar
      lavage specimens from human volunteers.
