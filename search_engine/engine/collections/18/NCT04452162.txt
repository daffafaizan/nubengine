      parameters (Ktrans, ti and ADC) in discriminating benign from malignant salivary glands
      tumors (SGTs). A total of 30 treatment na√Øve patients suspicious of SGT as observed on
      clinical evaluation and prior routine CT/MRI will undergo 3T MRI. The MRI protocol will
      include acquisition of anatomical images with and without contrast agent injection, diffusion
      imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI.
