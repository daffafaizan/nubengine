      followed on a weekly basis until week 12 after infection. If volunteers develop a patent
      infection, defined by detectable egg production in stool by microscopy at any timepoint
      within week 9 to 12, they will be scheduled to donate faeces on request.

      Two years after infection or if volunteers do not excrete eggs detectable by microscopy on
      week 9 to 12, volunteers will be treated with a 3-day regimen of albendazole to abrogate the
      infection. Retreatment with albendazole will be given to volunteers who remain positive for
      hookworm after treatment.

      Six months after the treatment, volunteers will undergo their last visit.
