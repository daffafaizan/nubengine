      including low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), vitamin K antagonist (VKA), or synthetic
      pentasaccharide (SP) Xa inhibitors) in the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE in
      pediatric subjects with regard to the composite efficacy endpoint (ie, symptomatic recurrent
      VTE, death as result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden) during the
      first 3-month treatment period.
