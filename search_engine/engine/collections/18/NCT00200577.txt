    
      In this open, multicentric (Grenoble, Montpellier, Nantes, Angers, Caen, Le Mans, Poitiers,
      Rennes, Tours) randomized study, selected patients with only one invaded lymphnode confirmed
      by anatomopathological exam will be randomized to one of the following arms: 1-Control group:
      patients of this group will not receive any treatment and will have the same clinical
      follow-up as the treated group. 2- TIL-IL2 group: treated patients will receive two
      injections of TIL combined with IL2. Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes will be obtained from a
      small piece of tumour tissue removed from the invaded lymphnode after surgery. TIL will be
      grown in larger number in laboratory during 6 weeks. Patients randomized in treatment arm
      will receive two injection of TIL (the first about 6 and the second about 10 weeks
      post-surgery). Administration of TIL will be combined with a low dose of IL2 (6 million U.I.
      per day) injected subcutaneously from J1 to J5 and J8 to J12 following the day of TIL
      infusion. The same dose and duration of IL2 treatment will be used for the second injection
      of TIL performed one month later. After 2 months adjuvant therapy, patients received no other
      treatment. Only a regular follow-up was performed.
