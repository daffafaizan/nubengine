      patients. Recently, regional anesthesia using a fascia iliaca block (FIB) to help treat pain
      in patients who present with hip fractures has been gaining popularity and has been
      incorporated as part of a multi-modal pain control protocol in many centers. It is commonly
      offered in addition to oral and intravenous medications to help patients deal with pain in
      the perioperative period. The block is done by an anesthesiologist under anesthesia using
      ultrasound guidance. We propose a prospective, randomized study evaluating the efficacy of
      the FIB as an adjunct in the pre-operative or postoperative period for pain control as
      measured by visual analog scale (VAS) scores and morphine equivalent dosing (MED), as well as
      its efficacy in promoting patient participation in physical therapy postoperatively in
      patients who present with hip fractures. We hypothesize that those patients who receive FIBs
      will report lower VAS scores as well as decreased narcotic requirement at all time points;
      and have improved participation in therapy when measured by ambulation distance.
