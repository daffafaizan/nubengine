        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients with previously untreated Burkitt's
           lymphoma or Burkitt's leukemia treated with rituximab and high-intensity chemotherapy
           with filgrastim (G-CSF) support.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease (leukemia
      vs lymphoma).

        -  Course 1: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 5-15 minutes daily on days 1-5 and
           oral prednisone on days 1-7. Allopurinol PO will be given on days 1-14.

        -  Courses 2, 4, and 6: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour daily on days 1-5;
           vincristine IV over 10 minutes and methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1; leucovorin
           calcium IV over 15 minutes every 6 hours on day 2; cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 4
           and 5 and etoposide IV over 1 hour daily on days 4 and 5; oral dexamethasone daily on
           days 1-5; and methotrexate and cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1. During course 2,
           patients receive rituximab IV over 1-4 hours on days 8, 10, and 12. During courses 4 and
           6, patients receive rituximab IV over 1 hour on day 8. Patients also receive filgrastim
           (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts
           recover.

        -  Courses 3, 5, and 7: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 5-15 minutes daily on
           days 1-5; vincristine IV over 10 minutes and methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1;
           leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hours on day 2; doxorubicin IV daily on days 4 and 5; oral
           dexamethasone daily on days 1-5; methotrexate and cytarabine IT on day 1; and rituximab
           IV over 1 hour on day 8. Patients also receive G-CSF as in courses 2, 4, and 6. After
           course 3, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 3 years.
