    
      This study was to randomize an equal number of participants to either an olmesartan medoxomil
      based treatment or to placebo. The titration scheme was as follows:

        -  First 3 weeks (wks), all participants - olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg or placebo

        -  Next 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil
           40 mg or placebo

        -  Next 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil
           40 mg/HCT 12.5 mg or placebo

        -  Final 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil
           40 mg/HCT 25 mg or placebo

        -  Subjects with a mean BP of <120/80 mmHg at any visit were considered responders and were
           not titrated up to the next dose level. However, they remained in the study at their
           currently assigned dose of study medication.

        -  Subjects with a mean office SBP ≥120 mmHg or a mean office DBP ≥80 mmHg at any
           subsequent visit(s) were considered 'uncontrolled' and were titrated to the next dose
           level according to the titration scheme above.

        -  Subjects who reach the highest dose (ie, olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCT 25 mg) remained
           on that dose until study exit at Visit 8, unless safety concerns caused discontinuation
           of treatment.
