    
      This is a single and multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of SUVN-G3031 administered orally once a day to healthy male subjects. The
      study will be conducted under double-blind conditions.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SUVN-G3031 following oral
      administration of single or multiple ascending doses and estimate the maximum tolerated dose
      of SUVN-G3031, if possible.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the single and repeat dose plasma pharmacokinetics
      following oral administration of single and multiple ascending doses of SUVN-G3031 in healthy
      male subjects.
