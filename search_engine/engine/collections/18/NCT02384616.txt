      ensure normoxemia despite intrapulmonary shunts and to provide security in case of adverse
      events. However, high-inspired oxygen fraction may decrease ventilation-perfusion ratios and
      its benefits are still unproven in children.

      The investigators aim at assessing the benefits and potential adverse effects of
      high-inspired oxygen fraction in two groups of children receiving either 30% FiO2 or 80% FiO2
      during maintenance of anesthesia. Nitrogen multiple breath washout technique and forced
      oscillation technique will be used to measure end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and airway
      resistance (Rrs) and respiratory elastance (Xrs) respectively. These measurements will be
      obtained before the general anesthesia, one hour and one day after the procedure.
