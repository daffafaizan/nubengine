      current status of physical distress (fatigue, sleep dysfunction, other symptoms),
      psychological distress (fear of cancer recurrence, depression, body-image), care needs, and
      psychological & physical functions in DTC patients diagnosed within three years. We will also
      examine these factors of their relationship with physical and psychological function by
      short-form -12.

      Phase II is a 6-month three-group randomized controlled trial with 12 month follow-up of its
      effects. Eligible subjects will be those newly diagnosed DTC patients with total
      thyroidectomy. A stratified randomization by age (age 45 as cut-off point) and gender would
      be conducted. Although the different intervention designs in the two intervention groups
      (NLSCP & ICT supported HAP). The three groups, control and two intervention groups (Exp-1 &
      Exp-2) will all receive the hospital routine and case manager's care. The three groups will
      receive baseline assessment before first intervention during hospitalization. We will first
      build up the contents and operable programs for two interventions groups: nurse-led
      survivorship care program (NLSCP/ Exp-1) and ICT supported HAP (ICT supported HAP/ Exp-2).
      Both intervention groups will also receive routine case manager care too. For both
      intervention groups, there will have 5 intervention sections during the first 6 month,
      including one day before hospital discharge post-operation, 5-6th week and 2-, 3-, 5- month
      post operation, known as intervention 1-5, respectively.
