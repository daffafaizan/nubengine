      quality of life (QoL) for palliative patients who can be unwell due to their advanced disease
      and who suffer from pain and other symptoms related to metastases.

      A single fraction of 8Gy is considered a standard treatment. In an assessment of health
      related quality of life (HRQoL) after palliative RT for painful bone metastases, the overall
      radiotherapy response at 1 week was 45% and by week 2 was 62%. Patients had a significant
      decrease in pain, insomnia and constipation by 1 month post treatment and an improvement in
      emotional functioning. When RT is used to control a bleeding tumour, up to 90% of patients
      will experience haemostasis.

      There is however concern that 8 Gy in 1 fraction will not provide a durable response, with up
      to 20% of patients requiring retreatment to the same site, compared with 8% who receive
      multiple fraction treatment. Single fraction palliative radiation therapy (SFRT) is therefore
      an under utilised treatment regimen.

      To implement the higher doses with a single fraction, more advanced radiation techniques are
      required, and there is still equipoise regarding the benefits. With advances in linear
      accelerator design and software, it is now possible to treat patients with advanced radiation
      techniques and low resources. Standard clinical pathways including computer optimised
      planning, remote (virtual) QA of plan delivery and the use of diagnostic imaging for planning
      are all feasible (under currently in clinical use at Northern Sydney Cancer Centre).

      The results from this study will be used to design / proceed to a Randomised Phase III study,
      if appropriate.
