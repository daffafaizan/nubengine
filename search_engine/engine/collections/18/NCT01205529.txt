      significant (albeit generally small) risks of serious adverse effects, including drug-induced
      long QT syndrome (diLQTS), other forms of proarrhythmia, increased mortality through
      uncertain mechanisms, and extracardiac toxicity. Identification of clinical and genetic
      subtypes of AF will permit stratification of therapeutic approaches and thereby facilitate
      the practice of personalized medicine. Furthermore, limited success of drug therapy and
      increase in drug toxicity in AF is probably because the arrhythmia represents a final common
      pathway of multiple initiating mechanisms, including some that are genetically-defined.

      Identifying specific intermediate phenotypes ("endophenotypes") associated with defined
      clinical courses in AF represents a potential method to systematically subtype patients by
      underlying mechanism and represents a much-needed clinical advance. Clinical endophenotypes
      that have been studied include atrial fibrillatory rate, prolonged signal-averaged P-wave
      duration, and biomarker profiles. The endophenotype we will study here is right precordial ST
      segment elevation, seen not only in Brugada syndrome (BrS) (where it is unmasked by sodium
      channel blocking drugs) but also commonly in early-onset ('lone') AF and in patients with
      AF-associated rare variants in genes encoding the cardiac sodium channel α- or β-subunits.
      Taken together these data suggest the hypothesis to be tested in this study, that variants in
      multiple genes can culminate in a similar AF-prone substrate by reducing sodium current that
      can be identified by screening for baseline or manifest right precordial ST segment elevation
      endophenotype after sodium channel block with intravenous procainamide.
