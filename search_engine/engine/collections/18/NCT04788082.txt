      is feasible to marry the two to produce a patient-matched and accurate 3D model of congenital
      heart defects. The production of a 3D model of the heart may be particularly useful in
      anticipation of surgery such that the operator can plan and visualize the surgery prior to
      the surgical date with a physical heart he or she can manipulate in their hands.

      Preliminary studies demonstrate potential for clinical impact of 3D models on patient care
      and patient outcomes. 3D models have long been shown to enhance education and communication
      of anatomy. In 2008 Kim et al reviewed 3D printed models as an emerging technology in
      management of congenital heart disease, and also suggests that physical models may also help
      enhance patients and physicians' understanding of congenital heart disease. Our group has
      also published on the clinical and educational value of these 3D heart models. To date, no
      systematic trial identifying the value of 3D models on procedural planning has been
      published.
