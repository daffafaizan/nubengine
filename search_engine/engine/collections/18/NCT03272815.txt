    
      A prospective, non-randomized clinical feasibility cohort study. The purpose of this
      feasibility study is to collect preliminary performance and safety information for the
      Percussion Device (PD). Patients satisfying the inclusion criteria will be approached for
      study enrolment before their surgery in clinic. Following surgery and after the patient's
      chest tube has been removed, evaluation of the chest using the PD and ultrasound will be
      performed by two independent assessors (a nurse practitioner or resident on the Thoracic
      Surgery Team) prior to the post-removal CXR. Details of study procedure are details in
      section 2.8. The PD's performance metric will be compared against CXR results, which is
      considered the gold standard in diagnosing a pneumothorax.
