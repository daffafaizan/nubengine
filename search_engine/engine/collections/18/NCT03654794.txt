      diet, drug interactions and also genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP 3A5) and
      efflux protein ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, P-gp).

      The mechanism of action of tacrolimus is based on inhibition of calcineurin in T cells.
      Therefore, tacrolimus intra-lymphocyte concentration may be a finer marker of the risk of
      transplant rejection or toxicity. The degree of inhibition of calcineurin in the T lymphocyte
      could also be a pharmacodynamic marker more relevant than the blood concentration. The
      hypothesis that the ABCB1 efflux pump is the main factor limiting the diffusion of tacrolimus
      into mononuclear cells is advanced.

      The diffusion of tacrolimus into mononuclear cells and the impact of the ABCB1 efflux pump on
      this diffusion have not been studied to date. The effect kinetics of the drug on calcineurin
      in mononuclear cells is also unknown.

      The aim of the study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus diffusion in
      mononuclear cells as well as the kinetics of effect of the drug on its target protein:
      calcineurin in the presence or absence of an efflux pump inhibitor ABCB1 at room temperature
      and at 4 Â° C (in order to inhibit all transport proteins) from blood obtained from 18
      patients undergoing bleeding as part of maintenance treatment for hemochromatosis.
