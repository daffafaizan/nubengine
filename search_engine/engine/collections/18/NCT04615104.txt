      and acetabular fractures, treated both operatively and nonoperatively, in order to understand
      the trajectory of functional and self-reported outcomes as well as to answer critical
      questions about treatment. Performance assessment data and patient-reported outcome measures
      utilizing the NIH PROMIS tool will be collected and analyzed for patients following pelvic or
      acetabular fracture, regardless of treatment.
