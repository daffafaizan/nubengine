      acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused or suspected to be caused
      by susceptible isolates of designated Gram-positive microorganisms. The purpose of this study
      is to determine the (a) safety and tolerability and (b) pharmacokinetic profile of multiple
      doses of Oritavancin given over a 7-8 week period.

      Cohort 1 will consist of 14 subjects, randomized to receive a total of four doses of either
      oritavancin or placebo, given once every two weeks in a double-blind fashion.

      After completion of cohort 1, a Data Safety Monitoring Board will review the blinded safety
      data and pharmacokinetics (PK) for cohort 1 and determine whether to continue with cohort 2,
      modify cohort 2 or end the study. The cohorts for this study are sequential.

      Cohort 2 will consist of 14 subjects, randomized to receive a total of eight doses of either
      oritavancin or placebo (4 subjects) given once every week in a double-blind fashion.
