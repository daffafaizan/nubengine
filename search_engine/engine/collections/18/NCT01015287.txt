      will receive placebo immediately after NSTEMI diagnosis and prior to the diagnostic coronary
      angiography. A 60 mg prasugrel loading dose will be given immediately after coronary
      angiography when proceeding to PCI. Subsequently, participants will receive daily maintenance
      doses of prasugrel until day 30. Participants who are greater than or equal to 75 years of
      age or who have a body weight less than 60 kilograms (kg) will receive 5 mg oral dose daily.
      All others will receive a 10 mg oral daily maintenance dose for 30 days.

      The other arm is a pre-treatment arm where participants will receive a split loading dose
      regimen with 30 mg of prasugrel administered immediately after NSTEMI diagnosis and prior to
      diagnostic coronary angiography. The remainder of the loading dose (30 mg) will be
      administered when the participants are proceeding to PCI. Subsequently, participants will
      receive daily maintenance doses of prasugrel until day 30. Participants who are greater than
      or equal to 75 years of age or who have a body weight less than 60 kg will receive 5 mg oral
      dose daily. All others will receive a 10 mg oral daily maintenance dose for 30 days.
