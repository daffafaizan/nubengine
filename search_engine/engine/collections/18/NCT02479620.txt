    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized pilot study to document the effects of
      adventitial delivery of dexamethasone after atherectomy-based revascularizations of lesions
      below the knee in symptomatic patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Up to 120 patients
      (60 treatment and 60 control), including up to 20 Rutherford 6 patients (10 treatment and 10
      control) at up to 30 sites in the United States and Europe. This study will assess the safety
      and effectiveness of Bullfrog Micro-Infusion Device adventitial deposition of dexamethasone
      in reducing inflammation and restenosis in patients with clinical evidence of chronic
      critical limb ischemia with an angiographically significant lesion in the infrapopliteal
      crural vessels.
