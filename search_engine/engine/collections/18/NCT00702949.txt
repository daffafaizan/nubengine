        -  To evaluate the efficacy of 150 mg of pregabalin versus placebo on hot flash scores in
           women with a history of breast cancer or women who do not wish to take estrogen therapy
           for fear of increased risk of breast cancer.

        -  To evaluate the side effect profile of different doses of pregabalin in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the effect of 150 mg of pregabalin versus placebo on the secondary outcome
           of interference of activities from hot flashes in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy and side effect profile of 75 mg of pregabalin versus placebo
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (18-49 years vs ≥ 50 years); selective
      estrogen-receptor modulator (i.e., tamoxifen or raloxifene) or aromatase inhibitor use (yes
      vs no); duration of hot flashes (< 9 months vs ≥ 9 months); and frequency of hot flashes per
      24-hour period (4-9 vs ≥ 10). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive 75 mg of oral pregabalin twice daily for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 150 mg of oral pregabalin twice daily for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 weeks. Treatment in all arms
           continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete Hot Flash Diaries at baseline and once daily during treatment and the
      Symptom Experience Diary at baseline and once weekly during treatment. Patients also complete
      the Profile of Mood States and the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale questionnaires
      at baseline and after completion of study treatment.
