    
      This is a Phase 1b, 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of
      salsalate in patients with mild to moderate AD. Approximately 40 subjects will be randomized
      1:1 to placebo or active. All study drugs will be administered orally bid [two placebo
      tablets bid or two 750 mg salsalate tablets bid (for a total daily dose of 3,000 mg)] for 12
      months.

      This study will test the effects of Salsalate on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, brain
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cognitive (thinking and memory) tests in subjects with
      mild to moderate AD. This study uses placebo which looks like the experimental drug but does
      not have any active drug in it.
