      restore. Insufficient recovery can result in a reduced performance and suboptimal development
      in the training process and a higher risk for injuries. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of Deep Oscillation (DO) self-treatment on recovery after fatiguing
      soccer training. Deep Oscillation is a unique method which is characterized by an alternating
      electrostatic which results in a deep resonance vibration of patients tissue.

      Methods: In a randomized crossover study design including 10 soccer players of the 5th german
      devision the following parameters will be evaluated directly before and 48h after an
      fatiguing soccer specific exercise: Maximum isokinetic strength of the leg and hip extensors
      and flexors (Con-TrexÂ® Leg Press, Physiomed, Germany), rating of perceived exertion (RPE)
      during isokinetic testing (Borg scale 6-20) and creatine kinase (CK) serum levels. Delayed
      Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS; visual analogue scale 1-10) will be recorded 24 and 48h
      post-exercise. At random half of the group will perform a DO self-treatment twice daily (4
      applications) for 15 minutes each, whereas the other half gets no intervention. 4 weeks later
      in a cross-over design the same procedure will be conducted again.
