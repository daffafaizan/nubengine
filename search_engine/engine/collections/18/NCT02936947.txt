      Demonstrate the clinical benefit of the HFPV coupled to thoracic radiotherapy in 2 distinct
      and frequent clinical situations :

        1. Tomotherapy for lung and left breast tumors. The investigators assume that the volume of
           irradiated healthy tissue will be much less when using HFPV as compared to free
           breathing during tomotherapy sessions .

        2. In comparison with Active Breathing Control (ABC system). The investigators assume that
           the HFPV will lead to breathing motions cessation the same way as the ABC system, but
           will abrogate pause times when administrating the radiotherapy. This will shorten the
           radiotherapy sessions for lung patients treated with stereotaxis and for breast cancer
           patients.
