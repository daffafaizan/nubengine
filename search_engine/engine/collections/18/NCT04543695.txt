      preoperative chemoradiation (CRT), total mesorectal excision (TME) and postoperative adjuvant
      chemotherapy (ACT). However, treatments fail to show an improved therapeutic effect on
      high-risk patients now. Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is a new try for rectal cancer
      treatment,and this trial aims to identify and select the more promising TNT sequence.

      This trail is a multicenter, randomized, phase II trial . Eligible patients age from 18 to 75
      years with histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma. MRI is mandatory, and patients of
      stage II or III rectal cancer are eligible if any of the following criteria are fulﬁlled:
      Categories T3,Categories N2, MRF involvement, EMVI positive, and lateral lymph node
      involvement. Patients are randomly assigned to 3 groups, group 1: concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy → TME → adjuvant chemotherapy (control group);or group 2: concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy → consolidation chemotherapy → TME (experimental group);Or group 3:
      induction chemotherapy → concurrent chemoradiotherapy →TME ( experimental group).The primary
      end point is the rate of tumor down-staging, which is deﬁned as stage yp0-II after surgery.
      Secondary end points include acute toxicity, compliance with TNT, surgical complications,
      3-year overall survival (3yOS),3-year disease free survival (3yDFS),3-year distant metastatic
      free survival(3yDMFS),3-year locoregional recurrence-free survival(3yLRRFS) and quality of
      life.
