    
      School-aged children (8-11 years old) will be included in their usual schools to participate
      in an afternoon snack, organised according to regular arrangements, during two days separated
      by one week. On each day, the participants will receive a choice of three portion sizes of a
      food (small, medium, large), and will be asked to chose one of these portions and to eat it
      for snack. On one day, the high energy-density food will be offered; and on the other day,
      the low energy-density food. This will be counterbalanced across participants. Moreover, two
      groups of children will be constituted: the first group, the control group, will have to
      perform a sensory imagination task about neutral facts. The second group, the "food sensory
      imagination" group, will have to perform a sensory imagination task foods.
