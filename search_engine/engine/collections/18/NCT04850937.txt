      cancer.WE pay attention to :

        1. Safety of low-dose single intravenous injection of esketamine (1)The influence of
           intraoperative vital signs of patients after medication, such as blood pressure and
           heart rate fluctuation; (2)the duration of recovery after anesthesia; (3)postoperative
           adverse reactions, such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness and diplopia, respiratory
           depression, laryngeal spasm, delirium agitation, etc

        2. Effect of single intravenous injection of low-dose ketamine on postoperative depression
           in patients undergoing radical mastectomy (1) 1 day before surgery, 2 days, 5 days, 30
           days, 90 days after surgery Hamilton Depression Scale scores; (2) The serum leptin level
           1 day before surgery, 2 days after surgery and 5 days after surgery; (3) Correlation
           between depression scale score and leptin level

        3. Effects of low dose esketamine on acute and chronic pain in patients undergoing radical
           mastectomy

             -  visual analogue scale scores at 6, 12 and 24 hours after surgery;

                  -  visual analogue scale scores at 3, 5, 30 and 90 days after surgery;

                       -  the number of analgesic remedies
