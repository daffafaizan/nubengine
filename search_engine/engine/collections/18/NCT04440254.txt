    
      The main objective of this non-blinded, monocentric non-randomized study is to assess the
      occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders (sinus dysfunction, branch block
      [BB], atrioventricular block [BAV], sustained [TVS] or non-supported [TVNS] ventricular
      tachycardias, atrial fibrillation [AF] during a three-year follow-up in 40 patients with
      Fabry disease (half with left ventricular hypertrophy) using an implantable Holter ECG device
      (Medtronic Reveal-LINQâ„¢). The secondary objectives are to analyze the correlations (at 1, 2
      and 3 years) of these anomalies with the modifications of :

        -  cardiac MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] data at inclusion [M0] and at 36 months [M36]
           (left ventricular hypertrophy [HVG], amplitude of the T1 signal, extent of fibrosis);
           MRIs will be performed before implantation and after removal of the Holter to avoid the
           reading artifacts linked to the device.

        -  echocardiographic measurements of the left ventricle (overall longitudinal strain
           systolic [SGL] and ejection fraction [FE])

        -  biological parameters (BNP or NT-proBNP, ultra-sensitive troponin and Lyso-Gb3)

        -  the overall severity of the disease assessed by MSSI (Mainz Severity Score Index), DFG
           and proteinuria
