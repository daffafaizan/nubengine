      Diagnosis is typically made in adults over the age of 50 and more than half of the people
      with CLL/SLL are over the age of 70. Elderly patients in particular have other comorbidities
      that limit the tolerability of standard CLL/SLL chemoimmunotherapy regimens and they often
      have inferior response to these particular regimens. In addition, those patients with a 17p
      deletion also have inferior outcomes due to rapid progression of disease as well as
      refractoriness to standard treatment regimens.

      It is still unclear what leads to the development of CLL/SLL. However, recent studies
      indicated that B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is an important contributor to the disease and
      could be a target for therapy. Bruton s Tyrosine Kinase (Btk) is an enzyme required for BCR
      signaling.

      Ibrutinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (Btk). In vitro
      lymphoma models have demonstrated that ibrutinib inhibits Btk. Inhibition of Btk blocks
      downstream BCR signaling pathways and thus prevents B cell proliferation. A phase 1 study of
      ibrutinib shows activity in multiple lymphomas including CLL/SLL.

      This study will investigate the efficacy of ibrutinib for patients with CLL/SLL in patients
      that are older than 65 who are in need of therapy.This protocol is intended both for patients
      who have been untreated and those who have undergone other therapies.
