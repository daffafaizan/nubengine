      or preventing the development of OA. The viscosupplementation by intraarticular injection of
      hyaluronate-derived products has gained popularity as a treatment modality of gonarthrosis.
      Today there are various papers on the treatment of gonarthrosis by intraarticular injection.
      Several methods have shown good results. There isn't, however, a consensus on the best
      method. The investigators know that in the treatment of osteoarthritis, with the
      viscosupplementation Hylan is superior in the long term, than the infiltration with
      cortisone. The good short term results achieved by infiltration of cortisone make us think
      about the combination of these drugs. The investigators will be assessing 104 patients with
      osteoarthritis of the knee, divided into two groups. Patients in group 1 will be subjected to
      infiltration procedure 6ml of Hylan. Patients in Group 2 will undergo the procedure of
      infiltration with 6ml of Hylan and 1ml (20mg) of hexacetonide Triamcinolone. The researcher
      will apply the informed consent term, the pain visual analog scale (VAS), WOMAC and Lequesne
      questionnaires. The questionnaires will be answered before infiltration (week zero), one week
      after the puncture (week 1), four weeks after (week 4) and 12 weeks after (week 12) and 24
      weeks after (week 24).
