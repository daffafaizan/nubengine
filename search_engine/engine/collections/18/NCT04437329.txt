    
      This is a prospective, parallel, randomized, open labeled, phase III, non-inferiority
      clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and toxicity of nedaplatin versus cisplatin in
      induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locoregionally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients in endemic area - nedaplatin, docetaxel and fluorouracil as
      induction chemotherapy regimen combined with nedaplatin as concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      (DNF-N) versus cisplatin, docetaxel and fluorouracil as induction chemotherapy regimen
      combined with cisplatin as concurrent chemoradiotherapy (DPF-P). All patients will receive
      radical intense modulate radiation therapy (IMRT). The primary endpoint is progress free
      survival (PFS).
