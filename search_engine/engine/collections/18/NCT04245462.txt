      intake per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner). One meal was considered with adequate protein
      content if it contained >30 g or >0.4 g/kg. Then, the number of meals with an adequate
      protein content was counted and classified as Zero meals, One meal, or Two or Three meals.

      Physical disability was assessed with two validated questionnaires. One for instrumental
      activities of daily living (Lawton) and another for activities of daily living (Barthel).
      Disability was classified for each questionnaire item according to the authors' scales. Most
      items considered a physical disability if the participant reported any difficulty performing
      that task.

      To analyze the association between the number of meals with adequate protein content
      (predictive variable) and physical disability (outcome variable), we used binomial logistic
      regression for each item. For the number of meals, we set the group of Zero meals as the
      reference. The analyses were adjusted for age, BMI categories, number of diagnosed diseases,
      sex, and inadequate protein intake per day (<1.2 g/kg/d).
