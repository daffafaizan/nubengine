      androgen-independent cells to bicalutamide (Casodex®) and the combination has synergistic
      inhibitory activity. Here, we hypothesize that treatment of castration-resistant patients
      with Panobinostat will enhance the response to the second line hormone therapy with
      bicalutamide (Casodex®). In the proposed phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose of
      tri-weekly, intermittent oral Panobinostat at three different dose levels (60, 90, 120
      mg/week) in combination with Casodex (50mg PO) will be determined; The following phase II
      study will evaluated the efficacies of 9-month treatments of the selected
      Panobinostat-Casodex combination and also a lower dose of Panobinostat. We expect that
      Casodex-Panobinostat combination treatment of castration-resistant patients will prevent
      biochemical and/or metastatic disease progression of these patients compared to historical
      controls in the same time period.
