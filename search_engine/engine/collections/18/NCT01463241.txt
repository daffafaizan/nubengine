      principles that are common to evidence-based treatments for youth depression, anxiety, and
      disruptive behavior problems. The protocol will be designed for implementation in everyday
      community practice settings by practitioners. Because many empirically supported treatments
      for youth disorders address only one area of impairment, they may not be an ideal fit to
      community clinics, where (a) most practitioners treat an array of disorders rather than
      specializing in just one, (b) most referred youths present with multiple disorders, and (c)
      priority problems and treatment needs may shift for many youths during an episode of care.
      Moreover, because many evidence-based treatments have been developed in research settings,
      they may not be designed in ways that are ideal for front-line therapists in community
      settings. The investigators hope to reduce the difficulty of transporting treatments into
      community practice by incorporating the perspectives of community practitioners in the
      development and design of the protocol. By incorporating the feedback of expert treatment
      developers, the investigators hope to ensure that BASIC is not only appealing to users but
      also consistent with what has been learned through treatment research over the years.
      Finally, the trial will provide preliminary evidence on whether this brief "first course" in
      evidence-based treatment is beneficial for youths with depression, anxiety, and disruptive
      behavior problems-three clusters that account for a large percentage of youth referrals.
