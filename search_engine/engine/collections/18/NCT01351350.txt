    
      This is a Phase I, open-label study consisting of a dose escalation phase in advanced solid
      malignancies to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral administration of MLN0128
      in 1 or more dosing schedules, combined with paclitaxel on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle,
      followed by an expansion phase for further safety and preliminary efficacy.

      Once the MTD is determined for each of the dosing schedules evaluated, a dose and schedule
      will be selected for the expansion phase, which may enroll participants into 2 arms in
      parallel:

        -  Arm A will consist of HER2- unknown cancer participants receiving MLN0128+paclitaxel

        -  Arm B will consist of HER2+ cancer participants receiving MLN0128+paclitaxel plus weekly
           trastuzumab
