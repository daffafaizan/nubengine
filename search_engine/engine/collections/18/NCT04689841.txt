      muscles and different circuits of the central nervous system are stimulated. The motor
      reactions that are triggered regularly and cyclically due to pressure stimuli, from certain
      starting positions, are completely reproducible and as often as desired, even in the newborn
      child.

      All the movements that appear in the development of the human being in grasping, turning,
      crawling, standing up and walking, are therefore visibly stimulated. They are, according to
      Prof. Vojta, present even in children of a developmental stage, in which they do not
      spontaneously yet possess these capacities.

      Through the therapeutic application of reflex locomotion, those muscular functions used
      unconsciously and necessary for spontaneous daily motor skills are activated in the patient,
      especially in the spine, but also in the arms and legs, hands and feet and in the face.
