      be strongly associated with an elevated risk for relapse, readmission to psychiatric
      inpatient care, longer length of stay and suicide, resulting in elevated costs across the
      health care system. The proposed project seeks to bridge the gap between the significant
      progress of recent years in psycho-pharmacology that produced more efficient 'newer
      generation' medications, and the continuing unanswered problem of non-compliance, by applying
      knowledge from clinical decision-making theories and recent evidence-based research on the
      management of severe mental illness.

      In Phase I of the project, an epidemiological survey will be conducted to evaluate the
      magnitude and correlates of the problem in patients attending walk-in crisis clinic , using
      Treatment Compliance Assessment and Decision-Making Assessment Tools, both developed by the
      researchers. An 8-module psycho-educational intervention protocol emphasizing illness
      management and optimization of health care decision-making will then be designed and
      implemented.

      In Phase II, eligible outpatient clients will be randomly assigned to either Intervention or
      Standard Care conditions, and followed for a period of 15 months. Repeated assessments will
      include pre-post measures of knowledge, treatment compliance, and decision-making, and on
      outcome measures of relapse such as hospitalizations and symptoms, functioning,
      self-efficacy, quality of life, and satisfaction with services.
