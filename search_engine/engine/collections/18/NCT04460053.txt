      the fact that a relatively mild hyperthermic temperature is used which should be well
      tolerated by the nerves and other normal tissues in the limbs. It seems probable that the
      neurotoxicity observed after ILP results from both a thermal enhancement of drug toxicity
      combined with a local effect of a high tourniquet pressure that is used to isolate the blood
      flow. Prevention of regional and systemic toxicity is essential for improving the outcome
      after the procedure. It is known that both higher doses of melphalan, higher temperatures and
      longer perfusion time correlates to a higher toxicity. The Wieberdink method is a grading
      system for the reaction of the normal tissues after ILP and the grading is used as a routine
      in ILP today. Neurofilament light protein (NfL) is released into the cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) during axonal damage and has been shown to be elevated in different forms of dementia.
      An NfL assay sensitive enough to measure NfL in blood was recently developed. Its
      concentration reflects axonal injury in both central and peripheral nervous system
      disorders.The primary aim of this study is to investigate the possibility to measure
      neurofilament as a biomarker for peripheral nerve toxicity after isolated limb perfusion.
