      infection, characterized by circulating malignant cells expressing the IL-2 receptor (CD25).
      Prognosis for patients with ATL remains poor despite advances in chemotherapy, with survival
      in leukemic patients ranging from six months to less than one year. Novel agents that are
      potent and specific for the tumor cells are urgently needed to improve overall survival and
      decrease toxicity in this dismal disease. One therapeutic approach would be to use
      immunotoxins (ITs). ITs utilize a potent toxin linked to a targeting moiety designed to
      maximize drug delivery to the tumor cells, thus avoiding the nonspecific toxicity of
      conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Imtox-25 is constructed using the RFT5 murine
      monoclonal antibody (Mab) coupled to deglycosylated ricin-A chain (dgA) via the
      heterobifunctional, thiol-containing crosslinker, 4[(succinimidyloxy)
      carbonyl]-ƒÑ-methyl-ƒÑ-(2 pyridyldithio) toluene (SMPT). Phase I and II clinical studies with
      Imtox-25 (RFT5.dGA) have been shown safety and efficacy in adult patients with Hodgkin¡¦s
      disease and a recommended Phase II dose has been established.. In vitro experiments using ATL
      cell lines and in vivo studies in a murine xenograft model have demonstrated significant
      activity of Imtox-25 in this disease. Based on these results, the investigators propose to
      conduct a phase II trial utilizing Imtox-25 in adults with relapsed or refractory ATL.
