    
      To determine the value of using Multispectral 3T MRI (MS3TMRI) for prostate cancer screening
      in men with a high risk of developing early onset aggressive prostate cancer given known
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier status, with no prior prostate cancer diagnosis, independent
      of baseline PSA levels.

        -  Determine the prevalence of prostate cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers
           independent of baseline PSA levels.

        -  To evaluate the accuracy of tumor targeting based on MRI and ultrasound (US) tumor
           co-localization. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of an
           automated computer aided diagnosis method (CAD) applied to MS3TMRI in the prediction of
           zonal biopsy results for the presence or absence of a significant cancer.
