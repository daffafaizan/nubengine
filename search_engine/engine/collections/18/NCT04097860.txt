      critically ill infants frequently produce insufficient amounts BM which is likely due to
      inadequate daily breast pumping frequency. BM sodium levels are an easy to measure biomarker
      of pumping frequency and providing this information to mothers via text messaging may
      increase their pumping frequency and BM production. Therefore, the overall objective of this
      pilot study is to determine the feasibility and potential benefits of a mHealth intervention
      to increase BM pumping frequency and BM production in mothers delivering critically ill
      infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at UF Health. Specific aims
      include (1) evaluate the feasibility of a mHealth intervention to increase BM pumping
      frequency and BM production and (2) assess whether results indicate a signal of effectiveness
      supporting a subsequent adequately powered randomized clinical trial (RCT). Following
      delivery, 50 mothers of critically ill infants admitted to the NICU will be randomized to one
      of two groups. The Enhanced Intervention Group will receive text messages including both
      general lactation information and a personalized message consisting of the mother's BM sodium
      level, pumping frequency and feedback regarding pumping frequency. The Standard Intervention
      Group will receive only general lactation information. Results will be used to revise the
      intervention and study processes and to estimate outcome measurement variability and effect
      sizes needed for sample size calculations for an adequately powered RCT.
