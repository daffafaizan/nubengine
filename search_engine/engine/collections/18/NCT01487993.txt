      with significant medical and psychosocial consequences persisting into adulthood.

      Obesity may lead to metabolic complications, such as insulin resistance, which can progress
      via impaired fasted glucose and impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      and to the development of micro- and macro-vascular complications.

      Metformin, an oral anti-diabetic licensed for T2DM for adults and children from 10 years
      onwards, is already used off label in obese children and adolescents with insulin resistance,
      even though the specific effects of metformin in these obese children and adolescents have
      not been elucidated, particularly upon long-term use.

      The rationale for this study is based on the hypothesis that metformin may reduce body mass
      index (BMI), insulin resistance and percentage of body-fat in obese children and adolescents
      with insulin resistance. Further more it is anticipated that metformin may delay the
      progression to T2DM and thereby micro- and macro-vascular complications in obese children and
      adolescents with insulin resistance.
