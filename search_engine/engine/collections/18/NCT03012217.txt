    
      The FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 (RP2) is an automated sample-to-answer PCR-based diagnostic
      for the identification of common upper respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens in
      nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected in viral transport media (VTM). The purpose of
      this study is to prospectively collect and test residual NPS specimens and generate
      performance data to support regulatory classification of the FilmArray RP2 as an in vitro
      diagnostic (IVD) in the US, European Union (EU), Canada, and other regions.

      Clinical performance evaluations will be initiated at sites in the US and/or EU during the
      2016/2017 respiratory illness season, approximately September through December.Prior to
      performing the prospective clinical evaluation, each participating site will have the
      necessary Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews (or equivalent for non-U.S. sites).

      Specimens for inclusion in this study will be residual, de-identified NPS collected in VTM
      leftover from clinician-ordered respiratory pathogen testing.

      Comparator testing will be performed using de-identified specimen aliquots at a central
      reference laboratory.

      This study is funded by BioFire Diagnostics, LLC. The FilmArray device conforms to the
      requirements of the European Union In Vitro Diagnostic Directive (IVDD). This study was
      designed such that every precaution has been taken to protect the health and safety of
      patients, users, and other persons.
