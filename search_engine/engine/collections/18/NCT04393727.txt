    
      This is a multicenter prospective randomized open-label clinical trials. Patients with
      pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 will be included and randomized to receive or not convalescent
      plasma.

      Convalescent plasma will be collected by cured patients with previous diagnosis of COVID-19.
      More specifically, inclusion and exclusion criteria for donors will be the following.

      Inclusion criteria for donors:

        -  age > 18 and <60 years

        -  confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: PCR on nasopharynx swab or positive IgG

        -  presence of 2 negative nasopharynx swabs for patients with previous positive swab and
           presence of 1 negative nasopharynx swab for patients with positive IgG

      Exclusion criteria for donors:

        -  age < 18 ys or >60 ys

        -  other conditions that controindicate blood donation

      Collected plasma will undergo all procedures for blood preparation. Plasma will be tested
      with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralizing antibody titers.

      Patients eligible for the study will be selected among hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2
      pneumonia. More specifically, the following criteria will used for inclusion in the study.

      Inclusion criteria for recipients:

        -  age >18 ys

        -  confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 pneumonia

        -  PaO2/FiO2 200-350

      Exclusion criteria for recipients:

        -  PaO2/FiO2 <200

        -  need of non invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive or not convalescent plasma. All patients will be
      followed-up for 30 days after randomization.

      Primary endpoint will be the need of mechanical ventilation, defined as PaO2/FiO2 <150.
