      blood immune responses.It has been an increasing interest in the analysis of the abnormal
      glycosylation of human lgG in healthy and disease states, such as autoimmune diseases and
      cancer.However, there is few relevant studies about the changes in glycopeptides of serum
      immunoglobulin G in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This study was performed for
      the frst timeto assess the quantitative changes of serum IgG glycosylation in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction and the relationships between its change and prognosis.
