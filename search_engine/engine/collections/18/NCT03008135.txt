      How to effectively measure the physical independence of the elderly at home and how, from
      this measure, the investigators can determine the fragility threshold of the elderly.

      The elderly mobility scale measures the critical points of the patient's physical autonomy.
      This scale was developed in Great Britain. The purpose of this study is to establish the
      reliability of this French version scale and to study the correlation with the elderly scale
      fragility.

      People are recruited by a Medical consultant. After consent, their frailty is measured and a
      prescription is done to see a Physical therapist. The physical therapist will evaluate the
      physical points measured/ mentioned in the Elderly Mobility Scale, twice in a week, with two
      different assessors.
