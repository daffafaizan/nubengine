      pedometer walking with training (PWT), and positive education and pedometer walking with
      training (PEPWT). Randomization was conducted using opaque envelops and a randomly generated
      number sequence by an independent research assistant who had no prior knowledge of the
      recruited elders. Researchers allocated participants to their treatment condition based on
      the randomization code in the sealed envelope (opened in order of sequence). Researchers were
      not blind to the patients' treatment allocation.
