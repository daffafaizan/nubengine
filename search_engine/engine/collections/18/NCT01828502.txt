      The primary objective of this study is to determine if providing urine cotinine feedback to
      caregivers in conjunction with standard education will be more effective than education alone
      in reducing patient SHS exposure.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      To determine whether urine cotinine feedback in conjunction with education provided to the
      caregiver is more effective in changing parental smoking behavior compared to education
      alone.

      As an exploratory measure we will collect history and physical exam data to follow patient's
      clinical complications during the study to determine if patients with a decrease in SHS
      exposure also have a decrease in clinical complications.
