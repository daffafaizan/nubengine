      will be randomized to one of three treatment groups and treated with up to 30 subcutaneous
      injections of the assigned study drug into submental fat, once a week for 8 weeks. Upon
      completion of treatment visits, subject will return to the clinic for a follow-up visit and
      end of study visit, one and four weeks after the last treatment. The number and pattern of
      injections will be based on the area (cm x cm) of submental fat at baseline. At each visit
      the subjects will also undergo an examination of the treatment area, collection of vital
      signs and questioning about possible adverse events (AEs).

      The study consists of 11 visits: a Screening Visit, eight Treatment Visits, a Follow up Visit
      and an End of Study Visit.
