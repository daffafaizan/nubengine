      are two separate anatomy tissue and have different oncological impact on the treatment of
      breast cancer. Areola Sparing Mastectomy (ASM) is a innovative procedure that involves of
      removal of nipple and preservation of areola the pigmented skin of which would improve the
      cosmetic outcome of mastectomy and lead to a illusion of congenital crater nipple in some
      patients.
