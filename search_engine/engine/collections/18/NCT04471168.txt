      prevalence between 15% and 20%.

      This disease is mainly managed by general practitioners for whom benzodiazepines and Z-drugs
      (zopiclone, zolpidem) represent the first-line treatment. The french health authorities
      recommend limiting the consumption of these molecules to 2 to 4 weeks taking into account
      their possible undesirable effects (eg memory impairment, in the elderly, road accident) as
      well as the risk of tolerance and addiction. However, it appears that a majority of the
      patients concerned become chronic consumers.

      The investigators propose to assess cryo-auriculotherapy in the treatment of chronic
      insomnia.

      The population studied will consist of patients with chronic insomnia, whose diagnosis has
      been made according to the definition in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
      disorders (DSM-5), and followed up in an outpatient clinic at Foch Hospital or in one of the
      participating centers.

      Half of the patients will be treated with cryo-auriculotherapy (use of a device with nitrous
      oxide) and compared with control patients who will have the same treatment visits involving a
      sham device (device without nitrous oxide).
