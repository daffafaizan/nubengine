    
      Given the rarity of patients with WHIM syndrome, this study is being conducted to better
      understand the clinical course of untreated patients with WHIM syndrome.

      The goals of this Natural History Study are to define both the frequency and diversity of
      WHIM syndrome by specific genetic mutation, as well as to understand the clinical course and
      phenotype of untreated WHIM patients.
