      and a high incidence of nausea and vomiting. Therefore, national and international guidelines
      have recommended the use of a setron as a prevention to nausea and vomiting and also the
      systematic administration of paracetamol to help in the control of postoperative pain.
      However, a potential interaction between setrons and paracetamol has been reported in
      different animal studies and in human volunteers although its existence has never been found
      in the clinic. Indeed, several hypotheses are proposed to explain the mechanism of action of
      paracetamol in the treatment of pain. However, a recent one involves the endocannabinoid
      system and spinal serotonin receptors. Serotonin receptors are also involved in the mechanism
      of action of antiemetics such as setrons. Indeed, these drugs are serotonin antagonists.
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the concomitant administration of paracetamol
      and ondansetron leads to an interaction that will decrease the analgesic effect of
      paracetamol.

      Patients aged 2-7 years old and scheduled for a tonsillectomy will be recruited. They will
      all receive intraoperatively intravenous paracetamol together with either ondansetron or
      droperidol. Pain scores using the CHEOPS scale will be recorded for 24 hours. Furthermore,
      patients will receive i.v. morphine during the operation and in the recovery room if
      necessary and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for postoperative pain; on the ward,
      oral codeine will be administered when needed. Pain scores will be recorded regularly for up
      to 24 hours together with opioid consumption and the incidence of nausea and vomiting in the
      same period. Any adverse event will also be recorded.
