      paclitaxel, and amifostine in patients with high risk stage II/III and responsive stage IV
      advanced breast cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of paclitaxel administered
      with amifostine in this regimen in these patients. III. Assess the toxicity of this treatment
      regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously twice daily on days 1-4 for
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization and continuing through days 5-10 during PBSC
      collection. At least 2 weeks following mobilization, patients receive doxorubicin IV as a
      continuous infusion on days -9 through -5 followed by cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day
      -5 and amifostine IV over 15 minutes, and paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on day -4. On day -2,
      25% PBSC are reinfused and 75% are reinfused on day 0, followed by daily G-CSF subcutaneously
      or IV beginning on day 1. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then periodically
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-8 months.
