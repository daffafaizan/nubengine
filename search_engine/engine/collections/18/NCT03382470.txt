      inappropriate antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) improve the use of
      antimicrobials. The purpose of this study is to identify the need for and barriers to
      implementation of ASPs in three hospitals in Sri Lanka, Kenya, and Tanzania. The impact of
      creating a basic ASP will be assessed at each hospital.
