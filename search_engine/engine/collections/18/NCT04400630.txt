    
      Randomized interventionist study (ratio 1:1) with two parallel branches, blinded by
      evaluators (the evaluator does not know the branch of treatment to which the patient belongs
      )to evaluate if an individualized moderate-to-vigorous physical exercise intensity program as
      adjuvant therapy to standard drug therapy will improve the functional and neuropsychological
      status of patients with Bipolar Disorder. The effectiveness of the intervention will be
      assessed by an extensive battery of clinical tests, physical parameters (e.g. brain structure
      changes measured by optical coherence tomography) and biological parameters (inflammation,
      oxidative stress and neurotrophic factors).

      The total sample of the study will be 80 patients and a sample of 40 controls (individuals
      without psychiatric pathology). The sample of patients will be divided into 40 patients in
      each group at random. In the intervention group, a supervised physical exercise treatment by
      high-intensity interval training (HIT) will be performed during 16 weeks with 2 sessions per
      week (32 sessions in total).Three visits will be made in both groups: baseline visit at the
      beginning of the study, at 4 months (at the end of the intervention) and at 10 months (6
      months after the end of the intervention)
