    
      1. Develop a randomized controlled clinical trial design to optimize the testing of the
           effects of a sham vs real cervical manipulation.

        2. Use novel modifications of both a sham a real manipulation to create "procedures"
           designed to optimize group equivalence in the RCT design. Then, evaluate the accuracy of
           'patient post-treatment perception of treatment type' versus actual administered
           treatment (primary outcome #1).

        3. Quantitatively evaluate group differences in local soft-tissue tenderness by algometry
           (primary outcome #2), as well as changes in self-reported neck pain, ranges of motion,
           myoelectric responses in selected neck muscles and forces imparted during the
           procedures.

        4. Evaluate the occurrence of neck joint cavitation during the manoeuvres comprising these
           procedures.
