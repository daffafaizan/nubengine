      possible identifying markers in neuroglial inflammation with elevated cytokines IL-1, Il-6,
      and MCP-1 and elevated ratios of CSF/serum levels of TNF-alpha in patients with regressive
      autism.

      Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is an analogue of thalidomide. Based on the improved clinical
      efficacy predicted for Revlimid® in its effects on TNF-alpha and other immunomodulatory
      cytokines, this oral compound may prove efficacious with less toxicity compared with
      thalidomide.

      The study will evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide by measurement of changes in EEG,
      clinical global impression, Childhood Autism Rating Scale, and serum and CSF (if available)
      TNF-alpha at the end of the study compared with the same measurements at baseline.
