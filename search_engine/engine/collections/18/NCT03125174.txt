      idiopathic bronchiectasis and healthy individuals without a history of lung disease. In order
      to understand how mucus is abnormal in disease conditions, the investigators need to
      understand the mucus biochemical and biophysical properties in healthy individuals. In this
      study the investigators will prospectively recruit patients with bronchiectasis and healthy
      individuals from the community to provide airway sputum samples. In these samples the
      investigators will measure an array of mucus properties. This will help our understanding of
      the mucus-obstructive lung diseases and facilitate the development of appropriate and
      effective disease prevention strategies.

      A key question is whether mucus is hyper-concentrated and has abnormal biophysical properties
      in individuals with mucus-obstructive lung disease. To answer this question, the
      investigators need to understand the properties of the mucus in individuals with idiopathic
      bronchiectasis and no history of lung disease. This study will allow us to collect airway
      mucus (sputum) from individuals with bronchiectasis and healthy individuals with no history
      of lung disease.
