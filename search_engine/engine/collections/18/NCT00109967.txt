      I. Determine the overall response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell
      lymphoma treated with CCI-779 and rituximab.

      II. Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients by assessing toxicity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the time to disease progression and overall survival of patients treated with
      this regimen.

      II. Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior response to rituximab (sensitive [partial
      response (PR) or complete response (CR) that lasted â‰¥ 6 months after the last treatment with
      rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy] vs refractory [stable or progressive
      disease OR a PR or CR that lasted < 6 months after the last treatment with rituximab alone or
      in combination with chemotherapy]).

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive
      rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on day 1 only of courses 3, 5, 7, 9,
      and 11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of course 3, patients undergo
      reevaluation. Patients achieving a CR or an unconfirmed CR (CRu) receive 2 additional courses
      of treatment for a total of 5 courses. Patients achieving a PR or stable disease continue
      study treatment as outlined above for up to 12 courses. Patients achieving a PR or stable
      disease who subsequently achieve a CR or CRu between courses 3 and 10 receive 2 additional
      courses of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 2 years.
