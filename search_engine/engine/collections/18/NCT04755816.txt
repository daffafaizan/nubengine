      clinical trial. This study will investigate the effectiveness of two contextual just-in-time
      adaptive interventions (JITAIs) delivered via a mobile app for heart failure patients. The
      clinical worsening intervention targets self-management of behaviors to prevent worsening of
      a patient's heart failure symptoms. The dietary sodium intervention promotes lower sodium
      intake. Eligible participants will be randomized to the dietary sodium intervention, the
      clinical worsening intervention, both interventions, or no intervention in a 1:1:1:1 manner,
      stratified by site, gender, and HF type (HFpEF versus HFrEF).
