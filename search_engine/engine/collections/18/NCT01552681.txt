    
      Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder in which a person's own immune cells attack the
      body's tear and salivary glands. This disease is the second most common autoimmune disorder,
      affects close to four million people in the U.S., and has no known cause. About one-third of
      patients with Sjögren's syndrome have enlarged parotid glands (the largest salivary glands,
      the glands that make saliva); inflammation of organs such as the lungs and joints may also
      occur. There is no known effective treatment other than measures that can relieve symptoms.
      One of the most bothersome symptoms is dryness of the eyes and mouth. Eye drops and saliva
      stimulants (which help make more saliva) are common treatments. When other organs are
      affected, symptoms are treated with corticosteroids (prednisone), non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen), hydroxychloroquine
      (Plaquenil®) or other medications that suppress the immune system. These drugs may curb or
      kill cells of the immune system, but they are not always helpful, do not cure Sjögren's
      syndrome, and can have many side effects.
