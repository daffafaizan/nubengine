      250 mCRC patients who have finished 18 to 24 weeks first-line chemotherapy and disease
      evaluation is SD, PR or CR. Then, the patients will be randomised into two group. The
      experimental group, capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy versus capecitabine conventional
      chemotherapy as control group. These treatment regimens will be continued until progression,
      death, or an unacceptable adverse event.

      The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints are overall
      survival (OS), quality of life (QOL) and toxic effects.
