      acute, severe disease. Diabetic patients have a poorer peripheral vascular function measured
      by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) as compared to normals, but the effect of hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy (HBOT) on endothelial function in these patients is unknown. Measurement of
      PAT in patients with diabetic foot ulcers undergoing HBOT, may help to improve treatment and
      changes in the reactive hyperemic index (RHI) might correlate with wound healing in these
      patients.

      Peripheral arterial tonometer (PAT) has been shown to be an easy, fast and standardized
      method for measuring the peripheral arterial endothelial function. The method is also
      operator-independent and has a high reproducibility.

      The PAT apparatus (ENDOPAT) measures the post-ischemic response to a five-minute blood flow
      occlusion of the upper arm, and the relationship between the pre-and post-ischemic pulse
      amplitude is expressed as a reactive hyperemic index (RHI). The normal RHI in young healthy
      persons is more than 2, while in critically ill patients and patients with diabetes,
      hypertension or heart disease it is significantly decreased.

      The study aims to test whether or not patients treated with HBOT for diabetic foot ulcers
      will demonstrate an improvement of the endothelial function in the peripheral vessels, i.e.
      an increase in RHI measured by the PAT. Similarly, essential mediators of angiogenesis and
      nitric oxide bioavailability will be measured in peripheral blood taken during the PAT
      measurements which will be performed at the time of inclusion, before HBOT and subsequently
      for each 10th HBOT session.
