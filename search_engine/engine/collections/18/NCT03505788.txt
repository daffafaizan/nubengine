      patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups by chance. Patients randomized
      to the first group will receive standard treatment with high doses of intravenous loop
      diuretics and a placebo. Patients randomized to the other treatment group will receive a
      combination of the same doses of loop diuretics and an additional diuretic, acetazolamide
      (Diamox®). All diuretics will be administered intravenously. It is expected that the patients
      of the treatment group with the combination therapy will have a faster reduction of their
      fluid overload. In consequence the treatment duration and total dose of diuretics
      administered will be shorter. Acetazolamide (Diamox®) is a diuretic that acts at a different
      location in the kidney compared to the loop diuretics. This mutual reinforcement will
      probably reduce the total dose and duration of the diuretics.

      The study will start during the hospitalization and will last around 3 months.
