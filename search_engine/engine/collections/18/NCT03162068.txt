      Primary outcomes : Analysis thanks to pQCT will be carried out in order to compare radius and
      tibia bone mineral volume (total, trabecular and cortical)

      Secondary outcomes :

      Strength parameters, muscle area adipose tissue surface will be assessed. Analysis of body
      composition thanks to DXA (Dual Energy X ray Absorptiometry), and surface bone mineral
      density.
