      written consent will be obtained from all patients.

      A sample size of 60 patients was calculated to obtain at least 25% reduction of glutamate
      concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid in the ropivacaine group with 0,05 significance and
      power of 0,8.

      Consenting patients, scheduled for orthopaedic surgery under spinal anesthesia will be
      randomly (1:1) assigned using closed envelopes to receive intrathecally ropivacaine or
      bupivacaine as a single shot before the start of surgery, followed by bolus doses of the same
      local anesthetic as required during the surgery, and continuous infusion of the same local
      anesthetic for 24 h for postoperative pain relief. All block will be performed in the sitting
      position, and the drug will be administered in supine position through the catheter in the
      intrathecal space. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples will be drawn at predetermined time
      intervals centrifuged as required and frosen in -70deg C until analysis.
