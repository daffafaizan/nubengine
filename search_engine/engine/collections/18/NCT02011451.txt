      Epigallo-catechin-galleate [EGCG]) as a treatment for MS.

      The primary outcome will be the changes in N-Acety-Aspartate (NAA) levels over six months.
      Secondary outcomes will be changes in brain atrophy over over six months. As an exploratory
      outcome we will correlate changes in NAA levels with free Plasma levels of EGCG 8 hours after
      the morning dose.

      Exploratory outcomes include disability progression by Expanded Disability Status Scale
      (EDSS), multiple sclerosis functional composite components and a cognitive test battery.
