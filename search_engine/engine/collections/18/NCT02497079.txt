      been widely used to perform mediastinal lymph node sampling, little information is available
      on polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB-PCR) using EBUS-TBNA samples
      in patients with isolated intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. In addition, two methods of TB-PCR
      (nested PCR and realtime PCR) are available for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      and which method is superior for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has not been
      established in patients with isolated intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.

      Thus, this study was design to compare the diagnostic efficacy of nested and realtime TB-PCR
      using EBUS-TBNA samples in patients with isolated intrathoracic lymphadenopathy in South
      Korea, where the incidence of tuberculosis is intermediate (97/100,000 per year).
