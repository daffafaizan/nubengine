      Bradshaw Index, and the response is then related to the number of regulatory T-cells, Th17
      cells, and biomarker levels at baseline. The exact cut-off for response vs. non-respons will
      be determined and validated once all data is collected by an assessor blinded for the flow
      cytometry results and biomarker levels.

      Plan for missing data: for patients with missing Harvey Bradshaw Index, we will first try to
      re-create the score using the patient records (information on well-being, abdominal pain,
      diarrhea, fistulae/abscesses, and extra-intestinal Crohn manifestations). If this is not
      possible, an experienced clinician will rate the patient's Infliximab response based on all
      available patient record data, but blinded for flow cytometry results and biomarker levels.
