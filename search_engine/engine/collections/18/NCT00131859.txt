      and the electronic fetal heart rate tracing of the labor. Infants will have a head ultrasound
      at 24-72 hours, 10-14 days, and at 4-6 weeks to look for cerebral white matter injury, as
      standard of care. All infants with a birth weight < 1500 grams will be offered DTI, and
      infants > 1500 grams with white matter injury diagnosed by ultrasound will be imaged as well
      as the subsequent delivery born within 7 days of that gestational age without brain injury.
      All infants will have the DTI brain scan at 12-18 months of age corrected for the degree of
      prematurity, and will also have a formal neurological assessment at that time.
