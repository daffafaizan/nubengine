    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the therapeutic activity of chemotherapy comprising cisplatin, epirubicin
           hydrochloride, capecitabine, and gemcitabine hydrochloride with versus without metformin
           hydrochloride in terms of 6-month progression-free survival in patients with metastatic
           pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the toxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin, epirubicin hydrochloride, and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride on days 1 and 15. Patients will also receive capecitabine and metformin
           hydrochloride on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin, epirubicin hydrochloride, gemcitabine hydrochloride,
           and capecitabine as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
