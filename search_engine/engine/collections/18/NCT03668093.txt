      traditional system of treatment plan. Comprehensive patient care should include all recent
      information related to the biological, social, behavioral, cultural, systemic, and
      dental/oral risk factors which help development and progression of dental caries. (ICCMS™)
      also report all essential decisions that aid to preserve tooth structure; as diagnosis,
      prevention and restoration only if indicated [9]. Moreover ( ICCMS™) deals with caries as a
      disease and not as a lesion, prevent development of initial caries lesions, and restore
      moderate or extensive caries lesions with the aim of preserving of tooth structure as much as
      possible.

      worse over 1-2 year.
