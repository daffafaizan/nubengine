      cared for in the JHACH NICU with an average length of stay of 30 days. Such a prolonged
      length of stay has a negative impact on maternal/infant bonding. In addition, infants
      suffering from NAS have poor regulatory mechanisms and are invariably hard to care for and
      difficult to console, and they provide an emotional challenge to their caretakers. This
      challenge becomes even more significant when the caretaker is the mother who is suffering
      from addiction and is already emotionally compromised by feelings of depression, anxiety,
      guilt or insecurity. Attachment is an ongoing process and the quality of the relationship
      between mother and her infant directly influences the structure of the child's affective ties
      and overall organization of responses to environment. This mother-infant bond sets the stage
      for understanding and identifying the infant's needs and reciprocal parental response to
      those needs. Maternal emotional unavailability has potentially serious effects on the long
      term mother-child relationship, and on the child's development.

      This project provides a novel approach and an alternative care plan for infants with NAS. It
      is funded by the State of Florida and allows to: 1) educate and empower a specified
      population of mothers who are undergoing institutionalized rehabilitation and whose infant
      needs treatment for NAS; 2) safely transition the infants home for final wean of their
      pharmacologic treatment; 3) provide regular developmental follow up for these infants through
      our NICU follow up clinic, hence identifying and quickly responding to neuro-developmental
      delays.
