    
      The purpose(s) of the study is (are) to evaluate several features available in EnPulse Series
      pacemaker and report the long term benefit of Atrial Capture Management (ACM) and Ventricular
      Capture Management (VCM) as demonstrated by accuracy in comparison with manual measurements
      and variability of ACM and VCM thresholds.

      In addition, an evaluation of the timesaving and qualitative benefits of the device feature
      known as Quick Look II (the computer interface screen of the device programmer) will be
      measured through the use of a questionnaire completed by the health care professionals
      involved in patient follow-up care.

      This is a one-to-one randomized, multicenter, prospective study in which patients receiving
      new EnPulse pacemaker implants will be randomized to each of three study arms, 1) routine
      manual follow-up and follow-up using the automatic features; 2) ACM diagnostics detail on or
      VCM diagnostics detail on; 3) PMOP on / off or PMOP off / on (6 month cycle).
