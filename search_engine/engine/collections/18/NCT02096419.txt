      presents cornerstone treatment in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Clopidogrel is the most widely used P2Y12 inhibitor
      despite it's limitations that include highly variable P2Y12-receptor inhibition which causes
      wide interindividual platelet reactivity variability. Since high on-treatment platelet
      reactivity (HTPR) on clopidogrel is strongly associated with adverse events, antiplatelet
      therapy tailoring has been vastly investigated to determine whether individualized approach
      could improve outcomes. In the time of progressive personalized approach to therapy,
      effective strategies are needed to minimize the risk of ischemic adverse events without
      increasing the risk for bleeding.

      Aim of this study is to investigate whether continuous clopidogrel dose adjustment according
      to platelet function testing (PFT) using MultiplateÂ® function analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,
      Mannheim, Germany) could decrease the rate of adverse events in ACS patients treated with PCI
      and with HTPR during early and late period of DAPT treatment.

      Cut off values for HTPR and enhanced platelet response were set according to the consensus
      statement at >46 U and <19 U, respectively. PFT and therapy tailoring was performed at day 1,
      2, 3, 7, 30 and month 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12.
