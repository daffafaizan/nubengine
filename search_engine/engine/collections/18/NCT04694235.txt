      epigenetic and stunting related outcomes in infants. The open-label intervention study would
      be conducted alongside the observational study in the same study setting by recruitment of
      additional number (n=153) of pregnant women. Thus, a total of 653 pregnant women would be
      enrolled in the study; 153 women would be randomized to intervention arm and 500 to the
      control arm who would form an observational cohort of women and newborns as described above.
      The intervention group women will be provided one egg three times per week from recruitment
      (2nd trimester) until term. The control group women will receive standard intervention in the
      form of Ante Natal Care from village midwives or Public Health Centre (IFA tablet, calcium
      tablet, nutrition counselling).
