      patients with reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion and increased visceral adiposity. We
      hypothesize that low-dose growth hormone will reduce visceral fat preferentially over
      subcutaneous fat, and increase lean body mass. Secondary endpoints will include measures of
      IGF-1, glucose homeostasis, lipids, blood pressure,bone density, cardiovascular risk and
      safety parameters. Dosing of growth hormone will be based on patients' IGF-1 levels and will
      not exceed 6mcg/kg/day.
