    
      Prospective study of 15 consecutive patients with suspected or newly diagnosed cardiac
      sarcoidosis (CS) who are referred for a clinically indicated 18FDG (and 13NH3) PET/CT scan
      for cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) will be approached to undergo a 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan.
      Comparison will then be made between the 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and the 18FDG and 13NH3 PET/CT
      to determine if 68Ga-DOTATATE detects CS.
