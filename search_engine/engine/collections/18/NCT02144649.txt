      I. To conduct a randomized, three-arm pilot clinical trial to determine compliance and safety
      of daily consumption of tangerine tomato juice or red tomato juice.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify total carotenoids, total lycopene (LYC), cis-LYC, trans-LYC, phytoene,
      phytofluene, and lycopene metabolites in plasma and prostate tissue in the three groups of
      men.

      II. To evaluate serum biomarkers related to prostate carcinogenesis, including those
      previously impacted by tomato phytochemicals (testosterone, sex hormone-binding protein
      [SHBP], insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-I, IGF-binding protein [BP]3, vascular endothelial
      growth factor [VEGF], and a panel of anti-inflammatory cytokines) by validated assays.

      III. To evaluate molecular signatures using the 200 gene quantitative Nano-string nCounter
      code set (selected genes known to be impacted by dietary components, genes impacted by common
      prostate genetic and epigenetic damage, and those regulated by testosterone) and
      micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA) nCounter code set.

      IV. To plot the distribution of carotenoid metabolites across the matrix versus the
      epithelium and cancer versus non-cancer areas of the prostate using matrix-assisted laser
      desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging of a limited number of samples.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients consume no tomato juice.

      GROUP II: Patients consume two cans of tangerine tomato juice daily until their scheduled
      surgery (approximately 4 weeks).

      GROUP III: Patients consume two cans of red tomato juice daily until their scheduled surgery
      (approximately 4 weeks).
