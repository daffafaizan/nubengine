    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the graft versus host disease (GVHD)-free relapse/progression-free survival
      (GRFS) at one-year post hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and to evaluate the clinical
      activity of post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To summarize toxicities/complications/infections including type, frequency, severity,
      attribution, time course and duration through 100 days post-transplant.

      II. To estimate the cumulative incidence (CI) of acute and chronic GVHD. III. To characterize
      the time course of neutrophil and platelet recovery/engraftment.

      IV. To estimate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), CI of
      relapse/progression and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

      V. To describe quality of life at 100 days, 6 months, 1 and 2 years. VI. To characterize
      immune cell reconstitution and T cell repertoire post high dose cyclophosphamide in
      mismatched donor HCT.

      VII. To characterize quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 conditioning regimens at the discretion
      of the attending physician and principal investigator.

      REGIMEN A (REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING): Patients receive fludarabine phosphate
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days -7 to -3 and melphalan hydrochloride IV over 20
      minutes on day -2.

      REGIMEN B (MYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING [MAC]): Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over
      1-3 hours and busulfan IV over 3 hour on days -5 to -2.

      REGIMEN C (MAC): Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 60 minutes on days -7 to -5
      and total body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -4 to -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 3-4,
      mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) beginning on day 5 and stopping on
      day 35 if no severe GVHD is present, and tacrolimus IV continuously on days 5-180 with a
      taper beginning on day 90 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice weekly for 100 days,
      twice monthly for 6 months, monthly until no evidence of GVHD, and then yearly for up to 2
      years.
