      parameters of 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa every other week in adult Fabry patients who have
      successfully completed studies PB-102-F20 or PB-102-F30. Patients will be enrolled to receive
      1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa as intravenous infusions every 2 weeks (Â±3 days). The duration
      of treatment will be no less than 24 months and up to 48 months or until pegunigalsidase alfa
      is commercially available to the patient at the discretion of the Sponsor. An interim
      analysis may be performed for administrative purposes during the conduct of the study. For
      the analysis, available efficacy and safety parameters will be summarized using descriptive
      statistics.
