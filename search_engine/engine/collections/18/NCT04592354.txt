      oxaloacetate for treatment of fatigue in women with a history of COVID-19 infection,
      resolution of the infection, and remaining fatigue that interfere with everyday activities,
      based on use of a standardized questionnaire to screen for impairment. Women will be
      recruited from a variety of settings including clinics affiliated with our existing doctor
      base, outreach through social media and notification of community organizations that serve
      this patient population. The study will take place at the residences of the participants,
      being performed virtually after receipt of informed consent paperwork, COVID-19 positive test
      data, and COVID -19 negative resolution data by us, and by receipt of the test product by the
      participant. Efforts will be made to conduct as much of this trial virtually as possible due
      to the Covid-19 pandemic. Women who could potentially be pregnant will undergo pregnancy
      testing and determination of menopausal status, if appropriate. Participants will complete
      baseline questionnaires that assess fatigue and depressive symptoms.

      Subsequently, the participants will receive a 6-week supply of the active or placebo and will
      be asked to take one capsule twice a day with water and food. They will be contacted weekly
      for two weeks by the study coordinator to assess for any side effects or difficulty taking
      the medication. They will be asked to again to complete the standardized questionnaire to
      screen for impairment after 2 weeks, and again at the end of the study at 6 weeks. Finally,
      any adverse reactions and symptoms will be evaluated once again four weeks later to ensure
      that any symptoms that may have been present during treatment have resolved.
