      (consisting of an Ask diary and a CHAP health review). During the first two terms of school
      the adolescents will receive their own Ask diary and will be trained in the use of the diary
      by their teacher. At the end of term two the carers and adolescents will be asked to complete
      part one of the CHAP tool, which comprises a health history, and make an appointed with their
      GP to complete a health assessment. After this assessment both the adolescent and the parent
      will use the Ask diary for all ongoing healthcare matters. The control group will receive
      their customary educational and medical care.
