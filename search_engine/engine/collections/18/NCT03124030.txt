      introduction of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications. Nowadays it is not certain if
      suspension could give more costs than benefits for the surgical procedure itself. With the
      recent development of the Direct Oral Anticoagulant it is still unclear whether these
      medications might bring more bleeding events in the intra-operative and post-operative phase
      after oral surgery procedure, equal to, or more than Oral Anticoagulant Therapy. The purpose
      of this study is to assess the degree of intra- and post-operative bleeding complication
      between direct oral anticoagulant therapy patients and Oral Anticoagulant Therapy patients.
