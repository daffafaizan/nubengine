      interventions performed in the preoperative period often focus on classical clinical outcomes
      such as postoperative organ dysfunction, morbidity or complications. Postoperative recovery
      of the patient is rarely considered the most important outcome variable in interventional
      studies. In this study, the effects of both preoperative patient condition and postoperative
      recovery on morbidity and mortality are investigated.

      In order to evaluate the ability of QoR - 15 to predict postoperative complications patients
      who underwent major abdominal surgery, patients answer the Quality of Recovery 15
      questionnaire both in the preoperative and postoperative periods.

      In addition, the risk of postoperative complications is calculated in the preoperative period
      with the American college of surgeons (ACS) surgical risk calculator.

      Finally, postoperative complications of all patients are recorded according to Clavien Dindo
      classification.

      The primary goal is to understand the predictive value of the QOR15 score on postoperative
      complications. Secondarily, it is to compare of predictive values of QoR15 with ACS risk
      calculator on morbidity and mortality. Another secondary aim is to investigate the effect of
      preoperative conditions of patients on postoperative recovery.
