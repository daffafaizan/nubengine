      were previously enrolled in a Phase 2 study of migalastat (FAB-CL-201 [NCT00214500],
      FAB-CL-202 [NCT00283959], FAB-CL-203 [NCT00283933], or FAB-CL-204 [NCT00304512]).
      Participants could enter this extension study immediately upon completion of participation in
      their previous study of migalastat, or at a later time point. Thus, some participants did not
      necessarily have continuous treatment with migalastat from the end of the original study to
      the time of enrollment into this extension study. Participants who enrolled before Protocol
      Amendment 2 received migalastat 150 milligrams (mg) orally once every other day (QOD). After
      the amendment, these participants entered a dose escalation period (DEP) at their next
      scheduled visit. During the DEP, participants received migalastat 250 mg (once daily [QD] for
      3 days and 4 days off per week) for the first 2 months. If there were no safety concerns, the
      dose was then increased to 500 mg QD for 3 days and 4 days off per week). Participants
      received 500 mg (QD for 3 days and 4 days off per week) for up to 10 months, depending on the
      approval date of the protocol amendments at each site. An interim review of safety and PD
      data was performed after all enrolled participants had completed at least 4 months of
      treatment in the DEP. After the review, the dose and regimen of migalastat was returned to
      150 mg QOD for all participants, except those who were on another dose as previously agreed
      by the investigator and medical monitor.

      The sponsor (Amicus Therapeutics) discontinued Study FAB-CL-205 for logistical reasons and
      not due to either safety concerns or lack of efficacy. Participants who were ongoing in Study
      FAB-CL-205 at the time of discontinuation were offered participation in another open-label,
      long-term treatment study of migalastat (AT1001-041 [NCT01458119]). Participants who did not
      enroll in Study AT1001-041 were contacted by telephone or another suitable method
      approximately 1 month after the End of Study (EOS) visit to inquire about adverse events and
      concomitant medications.
