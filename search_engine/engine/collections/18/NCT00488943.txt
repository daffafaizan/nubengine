      underwent endovascular AAA repair at UCSF and SFVA, and others who will undergo this
      operation in the future. Most of these patients have now passed the 2-year follow-up required
      by the original protocol, all continue to be followed for clinical purposes, using the same
      studies, the same data forms and the same schedule as before, because studies of various
      devices of this type have shown that the potential for late problems requires continuing
      scrutiny of stent-graft structure and function, as a basis for timely re-intervention.
