      used in adults more often. However, because adults are larger than children, the relatively
      smaller stem cell dose in UCB is major limitation for transplantation in adults and
      engraftment can be delayed. This study is trying to find out if the drug sitagliptin can be
      used to increase and speed up engraftment in adults receiving UCB transplantation.
