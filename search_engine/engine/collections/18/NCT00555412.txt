      and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of Staccato Loxapine given within a 24 hour time
      period. The study will be conducted in schizophrenic patients who are on chronic, stable
      antipsychotic medication. Patients meeting entry criteria will be randomized to one of three
      dose sequences of Staccato Loxapine or to Staccato Placebo. Following administration of
      medications, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic assessments will be conducted at serial
      time points.
