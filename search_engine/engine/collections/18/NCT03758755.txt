      to promote muscular development. Traditional training regimens are based on the concept that
      muscle growth is induced with high resistance exercises of at least 65-70% of 1-repetition
      maximum. Achieving a high resistance level can be challenging in the early post-surgical
      patient who may be limited by pain, muscle atrophy, diminished proprioception, and
      psychological factors. Increasing evidence has suggested that Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) in
      resistance training, while transmitting a decreased load (25-50% of 1-repetition maximum)
      across the surgical site, may provide an additional benefit of inducing muscular development
      similar to that of high intensity exercises .

      Augmenting exercises with BFR involves an external pressure cuff applied to the proximal
      portion of the extremity, which is inflated to a pressure that restricts venous outflow while
      allowing arterial inflow to continue. This creates a physiologic environment for the patient
      to gain the hypertrophic effect of high resistance training, though at a lower and safer
      intensity. Studies suggest that BFR stimulates muscular development through an increase in
      metabolic stress, muscle fiber recruitment, cell swelling, and protein synthesis.
