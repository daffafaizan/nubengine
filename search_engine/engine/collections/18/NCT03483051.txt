    
      This is a randomized double-blind crossover clinical trial, in which 22 subjects who
      underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) three
      or more months prior to enrollment will receive the following 2 interventions, in randomized
      order: (1) Potassium nitrate (KNO3), at a dose of 12-18 mmol/d by mouth for 4 weeks, or; (2)
      Potassium chloride (KCl), at a dose of 12-18 mmol/d by mouth for 4 weeks. A 1-week washout
      period will be introduced between the 2 interventions. The purpose of the trial is to test
      the safety of KNO3 and its efficacy on a number of clinical and physiologic endpoints in
      subjects who underwent TAVR for severe AS.
