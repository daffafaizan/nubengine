    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the rate of leptomeningeal failure after neoadjuvant radiation therapy (NaRT)
      versus (vs) postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)/stereotactic radiation therapy
      (SRT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Local control of brain metastases. II. Rate of salvage treatment including surgery, SRS,
      SRT, or whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).

      III. Dose and volume of radiation to adjacent normal brain parenchyma. IV. Rate of
      symptomatic radiation necrosis/steroid dependency. V. Rate of distant brain failure. VI. To
      compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 groups. VII. To determine the number of patients
      who die due to neurologic causes. VIII. To assess quality of life as assessed using
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy?Brain (FACT?BR).

      IX. To evaluate and compare the molecular makeup of tumor tissue in pre vs post radiation
      settings and determine differences in molecular and germline markers.

      X. To evaluate biomarkers and germline markers predicting response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo 1, 5, or 10 fraction of SRS/SRT radiation. Surgery is performed
      within 72 hours of radiation therapy.

      ARM B: Within 2-5 weeks after standard of care surgery, patients undergo 1, 5, or 10 fraction
      of SRS/SRT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
