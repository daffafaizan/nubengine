      sessions, and the text messages and mailed sun screen (SPF30)interventions will be offered
      during the summer when UV rays are at their highest. Inclusion criteria are Operating
      Engineers who:1)are greater than 18 years of age; 2) are interested in enrolling in the sun
      protection study; 3) own a cell-phone that accepts text messages; and 4) are willing to share
      their phone number with the study team. Based on power analysis, 256 subjects are needed to
      have 80% power to detect medium sized effects on primary outcomes. Accounting for a 20%
      attrition rate, 320 subjects will be recruited. The analyses will include: a) paired t-tests
      to determine changes over time (from pre-intervention to post-intervention) in outcome
      variables (sunscreen use and burning) separately in the 4 intervention groups, b) Repeated
      Measures Analysis of Variance (RM-ANOVA) to compare the changes in outcomes across the 4
      groups, and c) t-tests on change scores as follow-ups to the RM-ANOVA to determine exactly
      which groups differ from each other. Sub-analyses will explore if particular subgroups of
      Operating Engineers (e.g., demographic, heath behavior, and job type subgroups) differ in
      sunscreen use and sun burning pre-and post-intervention.
