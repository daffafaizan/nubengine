      Ketamine in analgesic infusion has been described to decrease acute pain, in patients with
      opioid tolerance. Ketamine use has been associated with side effects, which are doses
      dependant. Those side effects are mainly cardiovascular: Hypertension, tachycardia, and
      neuropsychiatric: delirium, hallucinations,nightmares that potentially compromise recovery of
      patients.

      Objective:

      To determine retrospectively in data bases the frequency of tachycardia, hypertension,
      delirium, hallucinations and nightmares, in adult patients that received ketamine infusions
      before and after administration of this drug in the first 48 hours to treat acute and
      postoperative pain
