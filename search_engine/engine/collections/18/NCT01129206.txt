      I. To evaluate overall response rate CR & PR(Complete Response + Partial Response)as assessed
      by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v 1.1) of the combination of
      pralatrexate and docetaxel in patients with advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal
      carcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluation of progression free survival and overall survival. II. Correlation of
      FDG(fludeoxyglucose)PET(positron emission tomography)response defined as a 35% reduction in
      SUV(standard uptake value)during the early course of chemotherapy to progression free and
      overall survival in addition to radiographic response as measured by RECIST v 1.1 criteria on
      CT imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pralatrexate IV over 3-5 minutes and docetaxel IV on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
