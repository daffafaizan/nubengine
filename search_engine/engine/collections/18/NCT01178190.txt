      biopsied. applied the system of shibuya et al. to analyze and classify vascular patterns by
      NBI into four categories (spiral and screw pattern, dotted pattern, tortuous pattern,
      avascular pattern) compared with the known diagnostic yield of conventional white light
      bronchoscopy, An equivalent or superior result will also significantly impact on patient care
      This technology could aid not only early-stage lung cancer diagnosis but also more accurate
      local staging of lung cancer.
