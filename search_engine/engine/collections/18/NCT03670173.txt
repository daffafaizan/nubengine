      clinically used in China to promote biliary drainage and protect liver function. Studies have
      shown that osalmid is an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (RR). Recently, it was proven
      by our group that osalmid induced a dose-dependent lethality in multiple myeloma (MM) cell
      lines H929, OPM2, U266, OCI-MY5, and RPMI 8266, as well as in MM xenograft mouse models. This
      study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of osalmid in the treatment of MM.
