      of 12 participants will be enrolled - patients will be treated in cohorts of 3 to determine
      the safety and preliminary efficacy of autologous, ex-vivo expanded bone-marrow derived MSC
      injected into the knee joint in patients with moderate to advanced knee osteoarthritis.

      A minimum of three evaluable patients will be entered at each dose level until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Toxicity will be evaluated and graded according to the
      Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for Adverse Events, as Grade 3-4. If a patient is
      discontinued due to a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (i.e. dose-limiting toxicity, DLT), an
      additional patient will be enrolled at the same dose level to ensure that a minimum of 3
      patients are evaluated. If 0/3 patients experience dose-limiting (DLT) at a given dose level,
      then the dose will be escalated for next cohort of 3 patients. If 1/3 patients experience DLT
      at a given dose level, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at that dose level. If
      no other patient experiences a DLT, dose escalation will continue. If DLT occurs in 2/3 or
      2/6 patients, dose escalation will stop and the prior dose level will be declared the MTD for
      the MSC cell infusions in this study.
