      the absence of significant cardiovascular disease after a thorough cardiac evaluation. It
      accounts for 2-5% of all emergency department visits. Studies examining the prevalence of
      esophago-gastric lesions in patients with NCCP referred to gastroenterologists have found
      esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, hiatal hernias, gastritis, and gastric ulcers in 62% of
      patients. Advances in endoscopic technologies, particularly, the introduction of the wireless
      video-capsule (PillCam Eso) allows for the possibility of direct visualization of the upper
      gastrointestinal tract in the emergency department. During capsule endoscopy, a patient will
      swallow a pill-sized video-capsule, the wireless images of the gastrointestinal tract are
      transmitted to a computer. Findings of the PillCam Eso will be then compared to findings
      during conventional upper endoscopy.
