      children with PARDS and describe its management in Asia. The first specific aim is to
      determine the prevalence of PARDS among PICU admissions. This will be achieved by
      establishing a systematic manner of screening patients and including them in this study. The
      second specific aim is to describe the use of pulmonary and non-pulmonary therapies in PARDS.
      This study will utilize an established dataset to extract pertinent and analyzable clinical
      data.The third specific aim is to determine the outcome of patients with PARDS. These
      outcomes will include functional data, PICU mortality, ventilator duration and length of stay
      data. This is a two-part study - the first part established the baseline prevalence and
      ventilator management strategies, the second part (to be registered separately) will include
      the intervention of a ventilation protocol.
