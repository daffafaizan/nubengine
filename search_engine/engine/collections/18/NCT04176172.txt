      greater than it is in the general population and the health risks of smoking outweighing
      those associated with the virus itself. Unfortunately, remarkably few studies have evaluated
      smoking cessation interventions for PLWHA and the available literature indicates that both
      behavioral and pharmacological smoking cessation interventions yield modest effect sizes and
      quit rates that are considerably lower than in the general population. A sizable literature,
      including studies by our research team, indicates that using the nicotine metabolite ratio
      (NMR) to personalize the selection of medications for tobacco use and the MAPS intervention
      to augment adherence to these medications can optimize treatments for tobacco use among
      PLWHA. The NCI recognized the potential for clinicians to use the NMR to individualize
      cessation treatment in order to improve effectiveness
      (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget/plan/public-health) and the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) has endorsed MAPS as an evidence-based approach to increasing
      medication adherence among PLWHA. As such, this trial will test these intervention
      optimization strategies to determine if individually or together they can represent an
      effective approach to treating tobacco use in this under-served population of smokers. As a
      major advance for this area of work, the investigators will use rigorous methodology to
      evaluate these optimization strategies (i.e., a randomized design, biological verification,
      an ITT approach, and 6-month outcome assessments) and, overall, our approach is consistent
      with the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework, which has been used to identify
      intervention components that maximize cessation outcomes. This trial will also assess
      theoretically derived and empirically based mechanisms through which these optimization
      strategies affect cessation and explore sub-groups who are more or less responsive to these
      strategies. In the end, this trial, which is consistent with the Office of AIDS Research
      trans-NIH Strategic Plan for HIV and HIV-Related Research
      (https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/research-priorities), will determine if
      getting the right medication to the right person and making sure they adequately use the
      medication optimizes tobacco cessation treatments among PLWHA as a critical way to improve
      health outcomes for this population.
