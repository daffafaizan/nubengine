      intermediate-stage AMD from Youyi Street, Baoshan District, Shanghai, China. Comprehensive
      standardized ophthalmic examinations included visual acuity, anterior segment analysis by
      slit lamp, dilated fundus evaluation by direct ophthalmoscopy, 90D handheld lens, fundus
      photography, fluorescein angiography (FFA), and fast optic disk scans using OCT. The macular
      CNV characteristic profiles in early and intermediate-stage AMD were determined by OCT. Data
      were obtained at first visit and 6 to 24 months follow-up, and FFA and OCT outcomes of early
      and intermediate-stage AMD patients were analyzed.
