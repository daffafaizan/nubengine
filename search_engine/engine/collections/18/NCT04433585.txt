    
      LY3471851 is a potential first-in-class therapeutic that may address an underlying immune
      system imbalance in people with many autoimmune conditions. It targets the interleukin (IL-2)
      receptor complex in the body in order to stimulate proliferation of inhibitory immune cells
      known as regulatory T cells. By activating these cells, LY3471851 may act to bring the immune
      system back into balance.
