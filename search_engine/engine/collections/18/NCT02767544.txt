      surgery: a ropivacaine group (RG) (n=41) and a control group (CG) (n=40). General anesthesia
      and use of local anesthetics were standardized. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain and
      side effects (nausea/vomiting) and the amount of postoperative analgesic used were recorded
      for 24 hours.
