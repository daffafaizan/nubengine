        -  To evaluate the biochemical progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, clinical
           PFS, and disease-free survival of patients with previously untreated intermediate-risk
           prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)
           agonist therapy and permanent iodine I 125 implantation with vs without adjuvant LHRH
           agonist therapy.

        -  To determine the non-adaptive interval to salvage therapy in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  To determine the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist
           therapy for up to 3 months and undergo permanent iodine I 125 implantation. Patients
           then receive adjuvant LHRH agonist therapy for up to 9 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant LHRH agonist therapy and undergo permanent iodine I
           125 implantation as in arm I.
