      'Let's Move! Child Care' which aims to improve nutrition and physical activity practices in
      child care centers to promote healthy weight for children ages 0-5y.

      The San Francisco Child Care Wellness Collaborative, including the San Francisco Department
      of Public Health (SFDPH) and SF Children's Council, developed a citywide Healthy Apple
      Program (HAP) to support local implementation of the Let's Move! initiative.

      The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDH) has an existing Child Care Health
      Program (CCHP) which provides nurse consultation and health education materials for child
      care centers and annual health screenings for children.

      The aim of this analysis is to see whether child care centers offered the HAP in addition to
      usual CCHP services can improve child care center nutrition and physical activity practices
      and child weight change better than usual CCHP services alone.
