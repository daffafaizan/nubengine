      effectiveness of new antiretroviral drugs in clinical trials, a washout period, or cessation
      of current antiretroviral regimens, is commonly required for study entry to allow for a
      drug-free steady state of viral load prior to initiation of the new drug. However, the
      kinetics of the viral rebound following drug withdrawal has not been sufficiently studied,
      and the proper duration of washout is an estimate.

      Patients who have volunteered to temporarily cease antiretroviral therapy will be followed
      during a 28-day washout period. Blood samples are drawn at each of nine clinic visits.
      Patients may resume antiretrovirals after the 28-day washout.
