    
      A two-arm, randomized study will be conducted in patients about to undergo consent discussion
      for participation in two large, multicenter BMT CTN clinical trials. Once they agree to
      participate in this Easy-to-Read Informed Consent (ETRIC) study, they will go through the
      consent process for the parent trial using either a standard or the ETRIC consent form. The
      content of both forms will be similar but the ETRIC form will incorporate a two-column format
      with specific attention towards enhanced readability and processability. Following the
      consent discussion for the BMT CTN parent trial, patients will complete assessments of health
      literacy, comprehension of the parent trial and satisfaction and anxiety related to the
      consent process. These assessments will be completed within 7 business days of the consent
      discussion of the parent trial.

      Notes: Enrollment on the BMT CTN 0901 trial (NCT01339910) was closed to further accrual on
      April 18, 2014. Enrollment on the BMT CTN 1203 trial (NCT02208037) completed accrual on May
