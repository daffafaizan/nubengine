      for the treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma in the clinic. The combination of sorafenib
      and valproic acid is predicated on the basis that sorafenib activity is enhanced by HDAC
      inhibition. The addition of sildenafil is based on its ability to block ABCB1 and ABCG2 drug
      efflux pumps. As the ABCG2 transporter is the primary transporter involved in the efflux of
      sorafenib at the BBB, blocking its action is predicted to increase the concentration of
      sorafenib in the brain.
