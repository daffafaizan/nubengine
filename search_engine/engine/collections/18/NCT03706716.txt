      The objective is to develop a decision aid to increase successful patient involvement and
      increased health care professionals integration of preferences in the clinical consultations
      with women with urogenital prolapse.

      Method:

      in the context of consultations an online app solution using a multicriterial analytic
      approach is developed and tested in order to support shared decision making (SDM). The
      decision aid is developed involving four national gynecological departments through
      participatory design. The decision aid is tested in a randomized, controlled multicenter
      trial in three hospital departments in the Region of Southern Denmark. A feasibility trial
      for the protocol of a randomized controlled trial will decide for further approach in
      relations to testing the online app. in a larger scale In the randomized trial patients will
      either receive consultations as usual (controls) or consultations using the interface (IF) in
      an app. The IF is generated upon data from a patient survey regarding their preferences for
      treatment beforehand.

      Effect measures are the perceived shared decision making within the consultation (SDM-Q-9 )
      and the patientperceived satisfaction with the decision (SWD)
