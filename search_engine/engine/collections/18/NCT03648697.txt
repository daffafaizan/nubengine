    
      This Phase I/II study is designed as single dose pilot trial evaluating the safety and of
      EBV-TCR-TT cell therapy in subjects with NPC who have received prior therapy for their
      disease but the disease has progressed or relapsed. Anti-tumor activity and other exploratory
      objectives will be assessed. Subjects enter from a Screening Protocol and are positive for
      HLA- A02:01/24:02/11:01, and EBV serum positive. Subjects will receive cytoreductive
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -6 and -4 followed by infusion of
      dose of about 2Ã—108 EBV-TCR-T(YT-E001).

      Subjects will stay in hospital for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion
      (Day 0) through Day 7, and then weekly until week 4 and then at 8 weeks every 8 weeks until
      progression of their disease or the end or termination of trial.
