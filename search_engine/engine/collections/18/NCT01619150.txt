      subjects with painful knee osteoarthritis can be affected by the peripheral and central
      actions of etoricoxib as compared to placebo during a 4 week treatment therapy period.

      The present study will utilize a set of quantitative mechanism based pain biomarkers to
      assess peripheral and central pain manifestations in OA and the influence of etoricoxib on
      those individual manifestations in an attempt to understand and explain clinical pain
      alleviation.

      Study Treatment: Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 sequences of treatment: Sequence
      1 (60 mg/day etoricoxib followed by placebo) or Sequence 2 (placebo followed by 60 mg/day
      etoricoxib). The two treatment periods of 4 weeks each are separated by a washout period of
      at least 6 days.

      Primary Objective: To assess which pain mechanisms are modulated by 60 mg daily
      administration of etoricoxib compared to placebo in subjects with osteoarthritic (OA) knee
      pain during two treatment periods of 4-weeks each.

      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate if changes in any of the mechanism based experimental pain
      assessment parameters can explain changes in clinical outcome parameters.

      To profile drug responders- versus non-responders based on pain mechanisms involved.

      To investigate if change in inflammatory, bone and cartilage related bio-chemical biomarkers
      can explain changes in either experimental or clinical pain parameters.
