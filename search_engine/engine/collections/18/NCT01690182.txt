      accommodation, aimed at increasing the capacity of the stomach. An increased gastric volume
      progressively distends the stomach, and this distension has been shown to have an inverse
      relationship on appetite. The link is assumed to be based on activation of mechanoreceptors
      lying in the walls of the stomach. On activation, vagal discharges are triggered, leading to
      activation of hypothalamic neurons and regulation of feelings of satiety. Gasrtric emptying
      is also regulated by duodenal feedback mechanisms triggered by the arrival and amount of
      nutrients.

      Based on current knowledge, a high volume test meal would be expected to produce more gastric
      distension and satiety over a low volume test meal, and a low energy density food would be
      expected to empty from the stomach faster than a high energy density food. Going on this
      premise, study test meal 2 would be expected to empty faster than study test meal 1. These
      phenomena will be investigated using non invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) methods.
      MRI can measure gastric volumes serially and non-invasively with high spatial resolution.
      Ultimately, the findings from this study will provide novel insights on mechanisms of gastric
      distension and satiety.
