      termination/discontinuation from Study NCT04450069 or any protocol in which patients were
      administered CLBR001. Patients will begin the long-term follow-up period regardless of
      whether they responded to treatment or progressed on treatment. Patients will be followed for
      up to 15 years post CLBR001 infusion and will continue to be monitored for safety,
      immunogenicity, and efficacy.
