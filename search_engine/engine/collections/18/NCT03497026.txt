      lesions are beyond the reach of conventional bronchoscopes. Additionally, alternative
      techniques, such as CT-guided or surgical biopsy, can carry increased risks to the patient.
      Diagnostic yield of flexible bronchoscopy is limited by its inability to guide biopsy
      instruments directly to the lesion. Varying technologies have been proposed to guide
      endobronchial biopsies, such as electromagnetic navigation, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)
      and computed tomography fluoroscopy. However, the correlation of real-time guidance and the
      ability to precisely direct a biopsy instrument is critical to biopsy success.

      In this study , the novel Robotic Endoscopy Platform and its accessories will be used to
      provide bronchoscopic visualization of and access to patient airways for diagnostic
      procedures. Commercially available biopsy instruments will be used to acquire tissue for
      diagnostic purposes.
