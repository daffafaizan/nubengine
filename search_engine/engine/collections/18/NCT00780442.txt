      intense research, efficacious pharmacotherapeutic treatments have not been identified.
      Cocaine-associated environmental cues can elicit drug craving and exposure to cocaine-related
      cues is likely to be involved in relapse. Emerging data supports the role of glutamate in
      extinction of associative learning in animal models of rear-conditioning and clinical studies
      of exposure treatment for anxiety disorders. A recent study demonstrated DCS acceleration of
      cocaine-induced conditioned place preference in rats. Exploration of DCS in facilitating
      extinction of response to drug-related cues in humans is needed. The proposed study will
      extend these innovative and promising findings from the basic science arena and anxiety
      disorders field in a proof of concept investigation of DCS facilitation of extinction of
      response to cocaine-related cues in a human laboratory paradigm.
