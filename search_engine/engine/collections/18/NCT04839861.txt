      regulation skill-building among children ages 6-14. The technology behind Mightier's mobile
      app has been validated in two independent sham-controlled randomized controlled trials, where
      the investigators have seen decreases in clinical symptoms of aggression and disruptive
      behaviors, as well as lowered family stress without adverse events.

      Mightier will soon introduce offline Mightier Family Games to its product line. Mightier
      Family Games will include offline, interactive components that have not previously been
      incorporated into Mightier play. Studies have shown that improvements in child behavior and
      child-parent relationships are among the many benefits of family play.

      For the proposed study, families with no prior Mightier exposure will engage in different
      types of Mightier play for six weeks, to demonstrate the effects of online and offline
      Mightier play in comparison to the effects of Mightier online play alone. Mightier will
      recruit families through social media, then Mightier will randomly assign participants to one
      of two groups: a Mightier online play only group, and a Mightier online and offline play
      group. The investigators will aim to enroll 20 participants in each group.
