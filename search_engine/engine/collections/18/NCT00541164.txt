      production centers of cells. Within recent years, there has been expanding interest in the
      potential benefits of CoQ10 supplementation on a variety of neuromuscular diseases, some of
      which involve mitochondrial dysfunction, such as CMT. Daily supplementation may have
      cytoprotective and neuroprotective properties, which may improve symptoms of weakness,
      fatigue, and pain, as well as increase quality of life (QOL) among persons with CMT.

      With regards to within group comparisons we hypothesize that daily supplementation of CoQ10
      taken as a 300 milligram wafer twice a day for 3 months will produce a statistically
      significant reduction in weakness, fatigue, and pain, along with a significant improvement in
      QOL as indicated from scores in both standardized physiological and scale measures.

      The addition of serum level analysis will help to contextualize clinical results. We
      hypothesize the ratios of the oxidized and reduced forms of CoQ10 will be modified upon
      supplementation.
