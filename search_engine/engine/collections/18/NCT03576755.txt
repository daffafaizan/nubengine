      pilot clinical trial of spironolactone in women with biopsy-proven NASH receiving 6 or 12
      months of spironolactone or placebo. 30 women are targeted for enrollment. Each participant
      will be administered a single dose of spironolactone or placebo once daily for a total of 6
      or 12 months. In person evaluations will take place at Month 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. There will
      be a telephone follow up visit within 3 months of end of treatment (up to Month 9 or 15).

      This is a pilot clinical trial that is largely feasibility focused. Study outcomes will
      include

        -  Change in liver stiffness on Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE)

        -  Change in hepatic steatosis by Magnetic Resonance Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF)

        -  Change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

        -  Change in NASH histology as assessed by the continuous NAFLD activity score (NAS), which
           measures different components of NASH on liver biopsy.

        -  Biochemical endpoints: serum lipids & HOMA-IR

        -  Feasibility outcomes including Rates (and reasons) for the following: a) % women that
           decline/women contacted for study inclusion (i.e. need for a second liver biopsy,
           concern regarding randomization to placebo) b) % women enrolled/women screened (i.e.
           exclusion criteria too narrow), c) study dropout (i.e. medication side effects, too
           frequent study visits, and/or phlebotomy)
