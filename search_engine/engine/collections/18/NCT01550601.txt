      appearance of gastroesophageal reflux(RGO) between two techniques of longitudinal gastrectomy
      under laparoscopy (gastrectomy coupling sleeve with antrum conservation or without antrum
      conservation) at patients with morbid obesity.

      There are lot of secondary outcomes assessed in this study. In fact, one of secondary
      objectives is to compare between both techniques of longitudinal gastrectomy under
      laparoscopy described in the literature the efficiency on the loss of weight and global
      post-operative morbidity.

      This study assess the impact of these surgery techniques on the comorbidity of the obesity
      and their treatments (type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome,
      arthralgia, dyslipemia).
