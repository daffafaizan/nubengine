      I. To evaluate the response rate of patients with histologically or cytologically proven
      small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with depsipeptide in the "sensitive" relapse setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the overall survival and failure-free survival of patients with histologically
      proven recurrent SCLC treated with depsipeptide.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity of depsipeptide in patients with relapsed SCLC. III. To evaluate
      surrogate biological markers from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal epithelial
      cells: p53 acetylation, histone acetylation, p21CIP1 expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have continuing tumor response or stable disease after 6
      courses receive 2 additional courses beyond best response.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years.
