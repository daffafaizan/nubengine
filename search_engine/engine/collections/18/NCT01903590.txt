    
      Patients with isolated stress incontinence attending to Dr Zekai Tahir Burak Woman Health
      Teaching and Research Hospital Urogynecology Department will be prospectively randomized,by a
      computer generated randomisation code,to the TVT or TOT. The patients will be aware of the
      type of the surgical procedure before the operation.

      Preoperative evaluation includes clinical history,urinanalysis,pelvic examination QoL
      assessment and urodynamic study. QoL included Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form
      (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form( IIQ-7).Urodynamic study
      includes cystometry,urethral profilometry and Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP).In all
      patients,pelvic floor defect will be evaluated according to the POP quantification (POPQ)
      staging.To diagnose the occult stress incontinence in patients with pelvic prolapse, a cough
      test after reducing the prolapse will be performed.Patients will be followed up at 6 and 12
      months postoperatively.Objective cure is defined as a negative cough stress test .Negative
      cough stress test ,but occasional urine leakage during stress will be considered
      ''improved''.

      Postoperative subjective outcomes will be categorized as follows:cured (UDI-6 and IIQ-7
      postoperative<10), improved (UDI-6 and IIQ-7 if postoperative>preoperative) and worsened
      (UDI-6 and IIQ-7 if postoperative<preoperative).
