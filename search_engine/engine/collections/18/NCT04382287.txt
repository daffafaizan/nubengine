    
      Objective: To evaluate and compare the clinical efficacy of Remin Pro® and MI Paste Plus® for
      the remineralisation of white spot lesions (WSL) on the enamel of primary teeth.

      Methods: The selected design for this study was a randomised double-blind clinical trial
      based on CONSORT guidelines. Patients with at least one upper anterior primary tooth with a
      WSL on the enamel surface, with units of fluorescence (UF) ranged from 11-20 (evaluated with
      DIAGNOdent) were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the
      twice-daily at-home topical application of Remin Pro® or MI Paste Plus® (both as experimental
      pastes) or Colgate Total® (as control paste). The degree of remineralisation was quantified
      by the change in the number of UF from the baseline evaluation and at days 10 and 21. The
      difference between groups was statistically evaluated using ANCOVA and ANOVA techniques.
