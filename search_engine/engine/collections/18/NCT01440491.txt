      trial was performed in 44 patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (lasting longer
      than 3 months), pain intensity greater than 3 by visual analogue scale and age > 18 years.
      Patients with renal and gastrointestinal disease, simultaneously submitted to another type of
      physical therapy, cognitive impairment, and pregnant women were excluded.

      All patients received an exercise booklet which consisted of stretching and strengthening of
      muscles. G1 patients were orientated by the physiotherapist during the performance of
      exercises once a week, using the booklet, and the patients in G2 (n=22) received the booklet
      to self perform the exercises without orientation of the physiotherapist. Everyone should
      perform the exercises once a day at home.

      Pain intensity by VAS, and quality of life by SF-36 were measured before the start of
      treatment (T0), after 6 (T6) and 12 (T12) weeks. Side effects were recorded. Acetaminophen
      (up to 4 g / day) could be used as necessary.

      The sample size was provided by SAS 8.0, SPSS 15.0 program. To detect difference in pain
      intensity of 3 between the groups by VAS, with 95% of power (estimated SD= 2.0), when the
      alpha level is set at 0.05, the sample should be of 16. The program used for statistical
      analysis was SAS 8.0, SPSS 15.0. The tests used were Student's T to compare age of patients,
      chi-square to compare gender and analgesic complementation, and Mann Whitney test for pain
      intensity and quality of life.
