    
      Patients discharged after TAVI, with a history of heart failure (HF) plus depressed left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%) or diabetes mellitus (DM) or glomerular filtration
      rate (GFR) between 25 and 75 ml/min/1.73 m2, will be randomized (1:1) before hospital
      discharge to receive treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or no dapagliflozin (no placebo).

      Only variables available during routine clinical practice will be collected and there will be
      no additional tests.

      The incidence of clinical events and adherence to the dapagliflozin arm will be documented at
      2 time-points (3 ± 1 months and 12 months) by phone calls and review of medical records.
