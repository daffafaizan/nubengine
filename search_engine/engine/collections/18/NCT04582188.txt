      hemostatic system in sepsis patients. Blood samples will be collected from sepsis patients at
      admission. Parameters reflect endothelial injury, such as thrombomodulin (TM), tissue type
      plasminogen activator inhibitor complex (tPAIC), parameters reflect procoagulation condition,
      such as thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), and parameters reflect hyperfibrinolysis, such
      as plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) will be tested. Based on the results of these
      parameters, sepsis patients will be divided into coagulation parameter normal or abnormal
      groups. Twenty-eight days of mortality will be determined by patient follow-up. Regression
      analysis will be used to evaluate the relationship between these parameters and the mortality
      of sepsis patients.
