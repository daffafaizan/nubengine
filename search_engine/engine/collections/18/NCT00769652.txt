      vs prostate). Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (Medical nutrition therapy): intervention with a registered dietitian or nutrition
           professional. MNT is a cyclical process which includes nutrition assessment,
           intervention, follow-up, and reassessment. Patients will receive a total of three (3)
           visits with the dietitian over a six-week period with follow-up during weeks 2-3 and
           weeks 6-9 based on their treatment schedule.

        -  Arm II (standard care): Standard nutritional care includes the National Cancer
           Institute's booklet "Eating Hints for cancer patients: before, during & after
           treatment".

      In both arms, patients' weight, fat free mass, and Patient Generated Subjective Global
      Assessment Score (PG-SGA) score will be assessed before, during, and after the intervention.
      The PG-SGA includes a patient report of symptoms and a healthcare professional assessment of
      medical, metabolic, and physical parameters.
