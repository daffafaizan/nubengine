      the simple spirometry after the application of the study techniques: muscle stretching
      technique of the diaphragm (G1), rotation impulse technique of the cervical level of C3- C4
      (G2) and combined technique of both (G3); 2. Determine the influence of these on measurable
      respiratory parameters by simple spirometry; 3. Compare the spirometric values obtained after
      applying the study techniques (G1, G2, G3) and the control group (G4: simulation of a
      previous technique); and 4. Analyze the different variables measured (age, gender, weight,
      height, sports practice and body mass index) in the effects of the applied treatment.
