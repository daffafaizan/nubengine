      treatment is recommended, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and others.
      Pre-operative inductive therapy can reduce tumor burden, increase organ preservation rate,
      and reduce distant metastasis rate. Pre-operative inductive therapy with paclitaxcel and
      cisplatin (TP) has been used as one of recommended protocols in patients with locally
      advanced head and neck squamous cell caricnoma, including OSCC. Anti-PD1/PD-L1
      immunotherapies have achieved exciting clinical outcomes in several malignancies, such as
      lung cancer, breast cancer, and so on. Recently, pre-operative inductive therapy with
      combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy agents has been used with good pathological
      response, which might transfer to good clinical prognosis in patients with malignancies.
      However, pre-operative inductive therapy with combination of anti-PD1 and TP in OSCC patients
      has not been reported. The innovation of this study is the combination of immune checkpoint
      inhibitor of Toripalimab, and chemotherapy agents of TP, as an inductive therapy to treat the
      patients with locally advanced OSCC, followed with radical surgery and post-operative
      radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy, the major pathological response and safety will be evaluated
      as the primary surrogate endpoints, the 2-year survival rate and local recurrence rate will
      be the second endpoints.
