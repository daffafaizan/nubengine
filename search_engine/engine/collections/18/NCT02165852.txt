      solution or dilute epinephrine, some do not. Whether physiologic saline solution or dilute
      epinephrine should be used is also not established. Submucosal injection of either dilute
      epinephrine or saline solution may be useful for avoiding inappropriate resection because
      failure to lift the tumor from the proper muscle layer of the duodenum may indicate deeper
      invasion18 and is the strongest predictor of malignancy.

      In adenomas of the major duodenal papilla, however, some investigators do not recommend
      submucosal injection. Not only the surrounding mucosa at the region of the duodenal papilla
      but also the tumor is lifted by submucosal injection, so capturing the lesion with a snare
      becomes difficult.
