    
      Prospective, observational study evaluating three dimensional echocardiography for measuring
      hemodynamic variables versus the current gold standard (pulmonary artery catheter).

      Critically ill patients with a severly compromised circulation due to a shock state with an
      advanced hemodynamic monitoring in place and the need for echocardiographic evaluation will
      be included.

      While performing an echocardiography study stroke volume measurements using the bolus method
      for thermodilution will concomittantly be measured.

      In case of insufficient image quality we are planning to use SonoVue echo contrast. Once the
      image quality has improved we will repeat the stroke volume measurements with the bolus
      thermodilution method while performing the echocardiography.

      The acquired echocardiography loops will then be analysed and measured offline once deferred
      consent has been obtained. We will then compare the echocardiographic measurements with the
      measurement obtained by the pulmonary artery catheter (bolus method) - since this is the
      current reference method.
