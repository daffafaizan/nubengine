    
      In order to evaluate efficacy and safety of Seroguard, solution for IP administration, a
      study design meeting the set objectives was selected: prospective, multi-center,
      double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study.

      Given the fact that comparison with placebo is considered the best way to prove efficacy and
      safety of a drug and that currently there are no drugs with a similar mechanism of action at
      the pharmaceutical product market, a placebo-controlled, parallel group study design was
      selected.

      A randomized, parallel group study design was chosen in order to ensure minimization of a
      selection bias.

      Subjects were randomized into four groups (two groups of the test drug and two placebo groups
      corresponding to the two doses) to enable a comparison of Seroguard administration at two
      doses.

      A double-blind study design was selected in order to ensure minimization of an outcome
      evaluation bias.
