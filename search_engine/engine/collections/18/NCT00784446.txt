      colorectal cancer. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate has been shown to
      efficiently target PDGF-signalling. Blocking PDGFR-signalling leads to disruption of
      pericytes from the endothelium and reverses the maturation status thereby enhancing the
      sensitivity to anti-VEGF therapy.This background forms a rationale for a combined therapeutic
      PDGF and VEGF inhibition. Since bevacizumab shows best activity when used in combination with
      chemotherapy, capecitabine and oxaliplatin are included in this protocol. Patients with stage
      IV colorectal cancer and no prior chemotherapy can enter the study. Patients receive oral
      imatinib once a day on days 1-21. Oral Capecitabine is given on days 1-14 bid, Oxaliplatin
      and Bevacizumab are given on day 1. Courses are repeated every 22 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
