      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using HPPH in patients with
           advanced obstructing endobronchial non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine palliation of symptoms in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the amount of HPPH taken up by the obstructing endobronchial tumors in
           these patients.

        -  To determine the extent of STAT3 cross-links, which are molecular markers of immediate
           PDT reaction, in the obstructing tumors of these patients before and after PDT
           treatment.

        -  To determine inflammation and apoptosis in the obstructing bronchial tumors of these
           patients before and after PDT treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1. On day 3, patients undergo
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) comprising laser light delivered by flexible, fiberoptic fibers
      passed through the biopsy channel of an endoscope. Patients undergo endoscopic debridement on
      day 5. If viable tumor is found outside of the initial treatment area, patients may receive
      another dose of laser light without additional HPPH.

      Patients may undergo tumor biopsies periodically during study for optional
      biomarker/correlative studies. Tumor tissue samples are analyzed for STAT3 cross-links by
      western blotting; apoptosis and inflammation biomarkers by immunohistochemistry, TUNEL, and
      other immunological laboratory methods; and tumor concentrations of HPPH by fluorescence
      emission spectroscopy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks and then periodically
      thereafter.
