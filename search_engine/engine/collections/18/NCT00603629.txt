      many asthmatics enjoy good control of their disease by using regularly scheduled
      corticosteroid treatment, a significant minority do not achieve optimal control with steroids
      and suffer asthma exacerbations which can be severe and even fatal. Asthma pathophysiology is
      complex and involves multiple cell types and multiple signaling mechanisms. One approach to
      this complexity has been to study responses of isolated airway cells to experimental
      conditions which model asthmatic inflammation; another has been genetic manipulations of
      candidate mediators of asthma in inbred mice. These studies have yielded important insights
      about possible mechanisms of asthma in humans, but the relevance of these mechanisms to human
      disease has not always been proven, and it is possible that unsuspected mechanisms have not
      yet been revealed by these approaches.

      In the current study, we propose to collect samples of airway secretions and blood from
      asthmatic subjects when their asthma is uncontrolled and they are being treated in the
      hospital or emergency room. Our goal will be to identify abnormal gene expression profiles
      and protein concentration abnormalities in these biological fluids. We will then study them
      again 6-10 weeks later when their asthma is controlled. This study design will allow us to
      compare airway and blood biomarkers of asthma exacerbation during acute asthma and recovery.
