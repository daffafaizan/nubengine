      vaginal delivery. Therefore it is required to apply cervical ripening methods for unfavorable
      cervices. Application of transcervical Foley catheter is an effective mechanical method and
      has the advantages of lower cost and lowest rate of fetal heart rate changes due to
      tachysystole compared with PGE1 and PGE2. Despite the advantages of mechanical methods, PGE1
      and PGE2 are reported to be more effective than mechanical methods to achieve vaginal
      delivery within 24 hours. Although there are a lot of studies comparing PGE1, PGE2 and
      transcervical Foley balloon catheter separately and PGE1 combined with transcervical Foley
      balloon catheter, less is known about combined usage of PGE2 and transcervical Foley balloon
      catheter. Early amniotomy is another effective method to ripen cervix. we aim to evaluate
      which method is superior to another.
