      has increasingly rapidly, due to the development of technologies of diagnosis, during the
      past 20 years. PTMC defined by the World Health Organization (WTO) as the largest dimension
      less than 1 cm. Previous autopsy study demonstrated that the lesions are normal in many
      people and accompany them latently until they die because of another reasons. The long-term
      outcome of PTMC is good and, as expected, more than 90% PTMC aren't progress for many years.

      Ultrasound-guided Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) treatment was introduced to clinical practice
      few years ago. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guideline, the
      treatment of radiofrequency and laser ablation are mentioned to be used in recurrent thyroid
      cancer. But clinical practice shows that the RFA treatment for low risk PTMC braces well
      effect，low financial budget，high safety and even rare postoperative complication.

      Although the cohort study was performed before, the real answer concerning about whether RFA
      is a rational choice for treating PTMC lacks more powerful evidences. The investigator
      considers to perform a randomized, controlled and multicenter study as a high-quality
      evidence and demonstrated the effect of PRF in low risk PTMC treatment.
