      PCR (HCV RNA) and liver biopsy with elevated liver enzymes and/orhyperbilirubinemia with
      Normal Abdominal Doppler ultrasound and MRCP.Other aetiology for liver disease as indication
      for transplantation and other causes of post-transplant abnormal liver profile as Post
      transplant biliary stricture or vascular liver diseases (if unresolved) were excluded from
      the study. Patients with active CMV infection(proved by positive CMV PCR or positive
      inclusion bodies by histopathology) were also excluded. All patients were subjected toFull
      history taking and thorough clinical examination, Laboratory investigations including CBC,
      Liver profile tests, Albumin, Bilirubin (Total and Direct), ALP(Alkaline phosphatase),
      AST(Aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (Alanine aminotransferase), INR (International
      Normalization Ratio),HCV RNA quantitative,CMV PCR, AST/ platelet ratio, Alpha feto-protein
      and fibro alpha score
