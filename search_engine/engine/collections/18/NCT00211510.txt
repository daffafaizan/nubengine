      diabetics. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGMS) is currently used by clinicians to record
      continuous, retrospective glucose measurements which aid in identification of glycemic
      excursion patterns. This data is then used to make therapy change recommendations for the
      future. The Paradigm 722 System transmits real-time glucose measurements to the insulin pump
      every 5 minutes, allowing users to view their current glucose values, as well as to review
      glycemic excursions and trends over a 24-hour period. This System will alert users to high
      and low glucose levels, and will allow subjects and their clinicians to treat to a
      therapeutic target HbA1c under monitored conditions.

      Subjects wearing the Paradigm 722 System will be compared to subjects wearing the Paradigm
      715 Insulin Pump over a 6 month period to evaluate changes in glycemic control (HbA1c).
