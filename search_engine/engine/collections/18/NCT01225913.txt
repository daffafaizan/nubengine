      exacerbation of asthma and following treatment. If available, results of lung function
      studies including measurements of lung elastic recoil will be compared to pathologic analyses
      of formalin fixed, air inflated lungs obtained at autopsy in asthmatics who die from asthma
      related or non-asthma related death. This kind of lung structure-function study will provide
      potential mechanism(s) to explain the loss of lung elastic recoil in acute and chronic
      asthmatics who are non-smokers. We will also obtain voxel quantification of high resolution
      thin section CT of lung obtained without IV contrast. Also, we will use fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy to obtain optical coherence tomography in stable asthmatics with mild to
      moderate to severe expiratory airflow limitation to assess integrity of the lung parenchyma.
