      preventable by reducing exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, recent primary
      prevention efforts have been inadequate in evoking behavior change, as manifested by
      increasing rates of ultraviolet radiation exposure, particularly among young adults. These
      findings indicate the need to research novel approaches to skin cancer prevention.

      Motivational enhancement techniques facilitate patient-centered, directive discussions
      wherein practitioners provide clear structure and encourage patients to play an active role
      in the consultation. The use of motivational enhancement techniques for health behavior
      change in medical settings has thus far yielded encouraging results for other health behavior
      change topics, but research has not yet investigated the application of these techniques to
      skin cancer prevention discussions.
