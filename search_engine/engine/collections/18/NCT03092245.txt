    
      This is a single center, randomized (1:1, active : standard of care), controlled, open-label,
      investigator-initiated pilot phase IIa trial in patients with septic shock investigating the
      efficacy and safety of administrating OctaplasLG® as compared to crystalloids, such as
      Ringer-Acetate (standard of care) in a total of 40 patients.

      40 patients will be enrolled:

        -  Patients in the active treatment group (n = 20 patients) will receive OctaplasLG® as
           volume support according to trial algorithm.

        -  Patients in the standard of care group (n = 20 patients) will receive crystalloids, such
           as Ringer-Acetate, as volume support according to trial algorithm.

      All patients will be treated according to the standard ICU care.
