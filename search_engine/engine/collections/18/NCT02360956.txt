      artery. By means of paracrine action, it can generate various kinds of cytokines,
      inflammatory factor and free fatty acids, that can affect the state of coronary endothelial
      function, inflammation and oxidative stress, which finally aggravate the progression of
      coronary atherosclerosis. In recent years, clinical studies have shown that EAT is a newly
      discovered independent risk factor of coronary atherosclerosis.Studies confirm that
      olmesartan medoxomil can improve endothelial function, resisting thrombosis, improve tissue
      reconstruction, resisting oxidative stress so as to achieve atherosclerosis resistant. Latest
      researches show that olmesartan medoxomil can better inhibit rat epididymal adipose cell
      hypertrophy and inflammatory reaction. Coronary CT angiography(CCTA) has emerged as a
      noninvasive imaging method for analysis coronary atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study
      is to determine whether olmesartan medoxomil is effective in the treatment of coronary
      atherosclerosis progression and EAT volume reduction in patients with coronary
      atherosclerosis detected by CCTA.
