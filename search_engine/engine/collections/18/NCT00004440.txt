      This is an open label study. Patients are randomized into 5 arms, each consisting of 10
      healthy volunteers and 5 patients with cystic fibrosis, based on the amount of ibuprofen
      received during the treatment period.

      The study period lasts for at least 15 days and consists of 3 periods: baseline (days 1-3),
      treatment (days 3-12), and recovery (days 13-15 or longer). During the treatment period
      patients receive ibuprofen orally every 12 hours (except for a control arm that receives no
      ibuprofen).
