      I. To determine the CR/CRi rate after treatment with vorinostat plus GO. (Good risk group)
      II. To determine the 30-day survival after treatment with vorinostat plus GO. (Poor risk
      group)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the frequency and severity of regimen-associated toxicities, along with 30-day
      survival after start of treatment with vorinostat plus GO. (Good risk group) II. To determine
      the CR/CRi rate after treatment with vorinostat plus GO, and estimate the frequency and
      severity of regimen-associated toxicities. (Poor risk group) III. To investigate the
      relapse-free survival of patients who achieve CR/CRi and receive maintenance therapy on this
      study.

      IV. To define cellular factors associated with clinical response to GO/vorinostat and
      determine the mechanisms underlying the synergistic effect between GO and vorinostat on
      primary AML cells (in vitro correlative and mechanistic studies).

      OUTLINE:

      REMISSION INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-9 and
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on day 8. Treatment repeats every 15-22 days for up to
      3 courses.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning within 60 days after the completion of remission induction
      therapy, patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-9 and gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV
      over 2 hours on day 8.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 4 courses.

      All treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3
      years.
