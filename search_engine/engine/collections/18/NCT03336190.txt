      military-connected caregivers (MCCs) of wounded warriors. The program leverages existing
      resources and incorporates evidence-based training and peer-based support networks to enhance
      continuity of care. The program consists of an educational Toolkit (workbook) and an avatar
      training interaction where an MCC can practice skills learned from the toolkit training with
      the avatar (how to navigate difficult conversations). This is an educational training
      evaluation to determine whether or not avatar interaction can effectively improve health
      outcomes in MCCs.

      The investigators will implement a pre-post design looking at a group of caregivers across
      multiple time points examining differences in outcomes from baseline (before engaging in the
      training/intervention) to after completing the training, including follow-ups at 3- and
      6-months to evaluate longer-term outcomes.Those enrolled in the intervention will receive the
      complete training program (toolkit and avatar).

      Project participants (i.e., MCCs who engage in the training and follow-up activities) will
      receive the (a) training toolkit workshop and will engage with the avatar to practice the
      knowledge and skills described in the workshop or will receive only the (b) training toolkit
      workshop (control).

      Comparing the time differences will enable us to determine if the training program,
      specifically the avatar interaction, is associated with improved health and quality of life
      in caregivers of wounded warriors, enhanced caregiver social support and networks, improved
      patient (wounded warrior) experience of care, and reduced per capita costs of care for both
      the wounded warrior and caregiver.

      Follow-up focus groups and interviews will be conducted to assess caregiver participant
      perspectives on what worked, what did not work, what they would like to see in the future,
      how the avatar interaction impacted them, and how the program could be improved in the
      future, as well as to clarify findings
