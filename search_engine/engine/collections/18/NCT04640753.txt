      be collected from patient's electronic health records (EHR) of the hospital In addition; a
      prospective chart review will be performed for patients who will undergo endoscopic
      procedures and POEM from 02/2019 - 06/2021. All the subjects enrolled in prospective chart
      review will be first consented for their study participation. Subjects will undergo a
      clinically indicated endoscopic procedure and POEM and subsequent follow-up clinical visits
      as part of their standard medical care. All procedures, barring research activities such as
      consenting and data collection from Electronic Health Records, will be either clinically
      indicated and/or standard of care.

        -  Each patient in the study will be assigned a Case ID number to de-identify their
           personal health information during data collection

        -  The Case ID number connecting the patient to the personal health information will be in
           an encrypted electronic file on a computer that can only be accessed by study members at
           MDMC.

        -  A procedure report and outpatient clinical records for each subject's POEM procedure
           will be used to record each patient's data for the registry

        -  That data will only be shared by members of the study (PIs, research coordinator) who
           require it for conducting of data collection/interpretation
