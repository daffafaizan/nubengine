    
      This is a prevention study that evaluates a community-based, family oriented intervention
      called Reach-Out. The University of Chicago will partner with community organizations
      including the Women, Infants and Children [WIC] Clinic at the Chicago Department of Public
      Health Roseland Clinic, South Side YMCA, the Chicago Park District and the Southside
      Faith-Based Wellness Network of churches to deliver the intervention. Families will be
      recruited from the high risk population of patients in the University of Chicago Diabetes
      database and the Chicago Childhood Diabetes Registry; and La Rabida Children's Hospital; and
      from the broader south side African-American community ("outreach" population). Families will
      be randomized to behavioral intervention (Reach-Out Program, hands on nutrition and exercise)
      or control group(Reach-In Program, standard of care consultation).

      All who participate in this study will be seen at the University of Chicago GCRC (General
      Clinical Research Center). They will be asked to come in at the beginning of the study, after
      14 weeks, afer 1 year and after 2 years.
