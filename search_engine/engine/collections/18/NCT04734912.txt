      through the patient's mouth is therefore considered a high-risk examination for the medical
      and nursing staff. Alternatively, gastroscopy can also be performed through the patient's
      nose. An advantage here is that the aerosol formation is naturally significantly reduced and
      the patient usually does not need sedation, since in transnasal endoscopy no stranglehold
      occurs. Transnasal endoscopy therefore appears to us, especially during the COVID-19
      pandemic, as a safe alternative to conventional gastroscopy.

      Patients who received the indication for endoscopic diagnostics using gastroscopy in
      transnasal technique will be included into the study. The examination is carried out in
      standard technique and is not influenced by the study. Following the examination, patient
      data is collected pseudonymously and a questionnaire is sumbitted to the patient.

      Only patients who have the indication for gastroscopy in transnasal technique are included. A
      specific risk to patients cannot be foreseen.This study does not interfere with diagnostics
      or therapy.
