      orally administered taxane, in patients with HER2 negative, HR Positive, LA/MBC not
      previously treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. This
      Study complements CONTESSA, a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study in
      patients with HER2 negative, HR positive LA/MBC previously treated with a taxane in the
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. 152 patients were enrolled, including 149 who received
      treatment. Patients are administered tesetaxel at 27 mg/m2 orally once every 21 days on the
      first day of each 21-day cycle plus capecitabine at 825 mg/m2 orally twice daily (for a total
      daily dose of 1,650 mg/m2) for 14 days of each 21-day cycle. Patients in the dense
      pharmacokinetics (PK) cohort receive a single dose of capecitabine monotherapy prior to
      starting the combination regimen. Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy agent that is
      considered a standard-of-care treatment in LA/MBC. The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR as
      assessed by the IRC. The secondary efficacy endpoints are duration of response (DoR) as
      assessed by the IRC, progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the IRC, disease control
      rate (DCR) as assessed by the IRC and overall survival (OS). CONTESSA 2 also investigates the
      PK of tesetaxel.
