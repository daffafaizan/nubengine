      melanin pigmentation were made according to Dummett-Gupta Oral Pigmentation Index scoring
      criteria given by Dummett C.O. in 1964 The investigators classified pigmented gingiva in
      patients as:

        1. Mild:Pink to slightly brown

        2. Moderate:Deep brown or black

        3. Severe:Mixed in color Score in each tooth was taken including one full inter dental
           papilla. Observations were made in natural light. The assessment of the scoring of the
           pigmentation index were done by all the three examiners, and the agreed upon score was
           assigned to prevent individual variations.

      The investigators compared the intensity of pigmentation in each patient in recall sessions
      after 1month and 3mounth postoperative.
