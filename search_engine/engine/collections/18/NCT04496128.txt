    
      This study is a prospective observational cohort study to document the prevalence and types
      of neurological manifestations among hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected novel
      coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus
      that causes COVID-19, shares significant structural and biological similarities with
      SARS-CoV, which is known to be neuroinvasive particularly with brainstem involvement. There
      are emerging reports of neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 infections, including
      seizures, coma, encephalitis, Guillan-Barre syndrome, and cerebrovascular events including
      ischemic stroke, ICH, and cerebral venous sinus thromboses. However, the exact prevalence of
      these conditions and their impact on patient disease severity and outcomes is unknown. As the
      incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection continue to rapidly rise globally, it is
      imperative to capture prospective data to accurately document prevalence, severity and
      clinical characterization of neurological components of COVID 19, the influence of treatment
      regimens of neurological complications, and role of these confounders on patient and
      organizational outcomes.
