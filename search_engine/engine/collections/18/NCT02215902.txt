      subject will serve as his/her own control. The control period will be the week immediately
      preceding the use of the investigational device during which eligible subjects will undergo
      and be monitored during three standard intermittent dialysis sessions. Vital signs, blood
      chemistries, hematology, liver function and adverse events will be measured. On weeks two and
      three, patients will receive treatment with the Hemopurifier® three times per week coincident
      with their ongoing standard intermittent hemodialysis treatments. During these two weeks,
      subjects will be assessed for the same clinical parameters but with the addition of viral
      load determination by quantitative PCR before and after each treatment with the
      Hemopurifier®. Viral load will also be measured at follow-up prior to the start of a given
      subject's hemodialysis treatment.
