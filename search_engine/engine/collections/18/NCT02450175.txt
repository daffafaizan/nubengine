    
      Hypotheses for proposed study

      Platelet reactivity as measured by percentage aggregation in response to agonists such as ADP
      is increased in patients with metastatic cancer compared to age sex and ethnicity matched
      controls.

      Platelet activation as measured by release of cytokines and vasoactive substances such as
      VEGF, TGF-beta, and PDGF is increased in patients with metastatic cancer compared to age sex
      and ethnicity matched controls.

      Study Design:

      Single center matched case control design; matching variables are age, sex and ethnicity

      Inclusion Criteria

      Cases:

      25 adult patients (>18 years old) with any form of metastatic or advanced stage (TNM stage
      III or equivalent) solid adenocarcinoma including breast, colon, and lung cancer will be
      eligible for inclusion in this study with no restrictions related to previous chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy, biological therapy or surgical management at the time of enrollment or in the
      past., although we will prefer to recruit them prior to initiating chemotherapy.

      Controls:

      25 patients will be selected based on age (+/- 5 years), sex and ethnicity matches from the
      outpatient medicine Clinic at Sinai hospital, as well as the Sinai community care clinic.

      Exclusion Criteria:

      Thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count of <100,000 at the time of recruitment of in
      the last available laboratory data

      History of known bleeding disorder or known platelet dysfunction

      Patients on antiplatelet treatment or anticoagulant therapies at the time of enrollment or 10
      days prior to testing

      CKD stage IV or greater
