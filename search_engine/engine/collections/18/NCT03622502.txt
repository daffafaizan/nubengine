      hemodynamic changes during tracheal extubation. Compared with remifentanil alone,
      administration of dexmedetomidine in combination with remifentanil is effective in relieving
      cough and hemodynamic changes without inhibition of respiration. The purpose of this study
      was to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine on the remifentanil concentration for the
      cough suppression during anesthetic emergence using the modified up-and-down method.
