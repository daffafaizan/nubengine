      dacarbazine and bortezomib administered weekly.

      Secondary objectives are to determine the maximum tolerated dose combination and to observe
      anti-tumor activity in terms of response rate(s), duration of response, time to progression,
      and time on treatment (a measure of both antitumor activity and treatment tolerance).
