      I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free rate in patients treated with perifosine and
      having advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate survival and time to progression. II. To evaluate objective tumor response
      status and duration. III. To evaluate adverse event rates. IV. To evaluate patterns of
      treatment failure. V. To evaluate pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine every 6 hours for a total of 4 doses on
      day 1 and once daily on days 2-28 of course 1 only. For all subsequent courses, patients
      receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12
      months.
