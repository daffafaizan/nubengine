    
      A pilot phase II imaging study to determine hypoxia in melanoma.

      About 16 - 24 hours before surgery, participants will be asked to come to the study center to
      take the investigational agent oral pimonidazole (pimo) by mouth. Pimo is a substance that is
      able to enter tissue when there are low levels of oxygen present (hypoxia). When the tissue
      is removed and visualized under a microscope, the amount of pimo present is related to the
      amount of oxygen in that part of the tissue. The dose of pimo given to the participant will
      depend on their weight (13 mg pimo/kg body weight).

      After surgery, a sample of the participant's tumor tissue will be viewed by doctors under a
      microscope to determine the amount of pimo present.
