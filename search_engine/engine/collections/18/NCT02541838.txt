      therapeutic intervention for improving balance and mobility functions and preventing falls in
      older adults with type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).

      Specific Aim 1 will determine if combined high intensity isolated leg muscle power exercise
      with balance perturbation training (ActiveStep) and aerobic exercise achieves greater
      improvements in balance stabilization (protective stepping behavior and kinematics) and
      mobility function (gait parameters and timed functional measures) than a lifestyle based
      intervention that primarily focuses on aerobic exercise through underlying mechanisms of
      improved neuromuscular activation (rate and magnitude) and sensorimotor control, improved
      muscle quality, and increased blood flow to enhance neuromuscular and sensorimotor
      performance in people with DPN.

      Specific Aim #2: To determine if a neuromotor balance training program combined with muscle
      power exercise training and aerobic exercise, leading to improved neuromuscular and
      sensorimotor mechanisms, is more effective in improving clinical tests of balance and
      mobility functions in those with DPN compared with a traditional exercise intervention.
