      in NSCLC. A novel approach to treatment of NSCLC is the combination of Hsp90 inhibitors, such
      as ganetespib, and taxanes. Such combinations have shown potential for synergy in preclinical
      and clinical evaluations with other Hsp90 inhibitors. Preclinical studies with ganetespib and
      taxanes have indicated that the combination of these drugs was more effective than either
      drug alone at inducing cell death, and an ongoing phase 1 study indicates that the
      combination is well tolerated and warrants systematic evaluation in a larger study.
