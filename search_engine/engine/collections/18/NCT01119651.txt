    
      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to
      evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam 0.1% to induce a photoallergic reaction in healthy
      adult volunteers. Approximately 62 healthy, male and female, volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65
      years will be enrolled.

      All subjects will be exposed to patches containing tazarotene foam, vehicle foam, and no foam
      (blank; negative control). Inflammatory skin responses (eg, erythema and local skin
      reactions) or superficial effects at patch sites will be visually assessed to corresponding
      grading scales. The study duration will be 6 weeks or 9 weeks and will consist of the
      following phases: Screening, 3 week Induction, 2 week Rest, and 1 week Challenge, and if
      indicated, a second 2 week Rest and 1 week Repeat Challenge.
