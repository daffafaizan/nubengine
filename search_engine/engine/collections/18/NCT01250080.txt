      functionality of TLR2 and TLR4 in circulating monocytes of trauma patients admitted to the
      ICU. Specifically the next variables were measured:

        -  Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in peripheral blood monocytes was determined by flow
           cytometry

        -  To study the functionality of TLR2 and TLR4, monocytes were stimulated with TLR specific
           agonists and cytokines were measured in cell culture supernatants. We determined the
           concentration of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and IL-10 in cell culture supernatants using a bead
           array ELISA.

        -  To determine the phagocytic capability of monocytes, live Escherichia coli expressing
           green fluorescent protein was added to 100 μL of whole blood collected in
           K2-anticoagulation medium tubes. Bacteria were added at a ratio of 100 bacteria per
           monocyte. The analyses were carried out in an Epics XL flow cytometer.
