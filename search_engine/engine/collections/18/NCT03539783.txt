      with collection of serum at these same time points. Brushing RNA will be processed by
      mRNA-Seq for gene expression analysis and compared to previously published serum biomarkers
      (interleukin-8, advanced glycosylation end-product specific receptor, and angiopoietin-2) to
      assess correlation and ability to discriminate PARDS endotypes. Changes in gene expression
      over time will be assessed to define a PARDS recovery gene expression signature, and
      correlation between bronchial and nasal gene expression will be determined.
