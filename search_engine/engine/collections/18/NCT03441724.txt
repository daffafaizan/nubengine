      Center cathlab for primary percutaneous coronary intervention are enrolled in the study. A 2
      to 15 minutes mechanocardiographic recording is acquired before the intervention. A control
      recording is collected after the coronary intervention, within 24 hours. These recordings are
      compared and the results analyzed to determine the ability of this novel modality to
      discriminate between the two circumstances.
