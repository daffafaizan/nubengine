      (Powers et al., 2010), whereas other studies suggest that there is no difference in exposure
      therapy outcomes whether or not safety behaviors are used (Deacon et al., 2010). Mixed
      findings could be explained by the parameters of safety behaviors use, such as whether they
      are used throughout the full course of therapy or faded toward the end of therapy. This will
      be the first study to directly compare the impact of faded and unfaded safety behaviors on
      exposure therapy outcomes. Specifically, researchers will randomize participants with a fear
      of spiders to receive exposure therapy (a) without safety behavior use, (b) with faded safety
      behavior use, and (c) with un-faded safety behavior use. Researchers will compare each
      condition's impact on fear reduction and on the tolerability/acceptability of treatment.
