      Gemcitabine is always the only approved single agent. The recent results of the phase III
      trial MPACT (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial) demonstrated an improvement
      in overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for
      the combination of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine alone. Thus, the
      combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine became one of a standard treatment in
      metastatic PDA. S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine, and shown to be non-inferior to gemcitabine
      on OS for unresectable pancreatic cancer, and also demonstrated non-inferior, and even
      superior to gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy. This single-arm study is to explore the
      efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 as first-line treatment in Chinese patients
      with local advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
