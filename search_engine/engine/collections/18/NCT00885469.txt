      diagnostic tool limits its utilization in many patients (17). There is a need for an
      alternative, simple, and less invasive diagnostic tool for evaluating GERD patients and
      screening for BE. Esophageal capsule endoscopy (ECE) is a novel technique that offers
      non-invasive evaluation of esophageal pathology in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
      patients. The potential benefits of screening patients by Capsule Endoscopy (CE) are several.
      Detection of esophageal pathology during CE could select a subgroup of patients for upper
      endoscopy avoiding the risks and costs of an upper endoscopy in the majority. Other benefits
      include convenience, ability to perform the test on an outpatient basis in less than 30
      minutes, patient acceptability, minimal loss of work time, safety, tolerability, the ability
      of non-physicians to screen patients, and potentially, improved compliance with screening
      recommendations. Recently, a new, high resolution capsule (ESO 2) with a larger field of view
      and better illumination than the previous CE has been introduced. A simplified ingestion
      protocol for CE that improves visualization of the Z-line has also been reported as well
      (17).
