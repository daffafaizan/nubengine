      morbidity and mortality. It accounts for nearly 10% of all cancers. The etiology of cervical
      cancer has been identified and confirmed associated with high risk-human papillomavirus
      (HR-HPV). When HR-HPV infections persist overtime, patients have an increased risk of
      developing cervical cancer The proprietary, a standardized extract of cultured Lentinula
      edodes mycelia (ECLM), AHCC®, was developed in Japan in 1992. Several studies have reported a
      variety of therapeutic effects, including antioxidant and anticancer activity and improvement
      of immune response.

      As recently reported study on AHCC®, pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrated
      its durable clearance of HR-HPV infections. The preliminary data from the two pilot studies
      suggested that AHCC® supplementation supports the host immune system for successful clearance
      of HR-HPV infections. A confirmatory phase II randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
      study is about completion. The preliminary results of this phase II study confirmed data
      observed in pilot studies that AHCC® supplementation for at least 6 months is associated with
      a 60% successful elimination of HPV infections and confirmed IFN-β correlates with clearance
      of persistent HPV infections. The optimal duration of AHCC® supplementation required after
      the first negative result still needs more evaluation in future clinical studies.

      Nevertheless, all above mentioned studies have included western participants solely. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the clearance capacity of AHCC® on Chinese female participants
      with diagnosis of HR-HPV infection.
