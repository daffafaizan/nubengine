      and oatmeal) and a dessert (apple crisp) using a randomized, three-period, within subjects,
      crossover design. The three test conditions will be (1) Full sugar ("FS"), (2) reduced sugar
      (and calorie) with no added spice ("RS") and (3) reduced sugar (and calorie) plus spice
      ("RSS"). The two reduced sugar meals will be matched for calories. Subjects will taste each
      condition of the item on a separate day; tastings will be one week apart.
