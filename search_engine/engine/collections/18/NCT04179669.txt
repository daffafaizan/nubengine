      maintained a low-fat diet and stable current lipid-lowering therapy for at least 4 weeks,
      randomized into different dose groups at 1:1, followed by 2:1 randomized double-blind
      treatment with subcutaneous IBI306150 mg (n=49) or placebo (n=25) every two weeks; or
      subcutaneous injection of IBI306 450mg (n=49) or placebo (n=25) every four weeks, treatment
      lasts for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, each group entered a 12-week open-label treatment, in
      which IBI306 subjects continued to receive IBI306, and placebo subjects shift to received
      IBI306. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in LDL-C levels relative to baseline
      at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in baseline lipid levels, drug safety, and
      immunogenicity at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. The exploratory endpoint was the population
      pharmacokinetic profile of IBI306 in Chinese heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
      population. If necessary, the dose of IBI306 will be adjusted accordingly based on the
      results of the ongoing multi-dose climbing study. After the open period, the subjects will be
      given a safety visit for 8 weeks.
