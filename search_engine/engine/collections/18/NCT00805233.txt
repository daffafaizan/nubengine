      age of 50 years. It can cause permanent loss of eyesight due to deterioration of the macula.

      Ranibizumab monotherapy is currently the standard of care in neovascular AMD patients.
      Inflammation is believed to play an important role in AMD. Currently, MD's are investigating
      modulating the inflammation component of AMD with intra-ocular steroids although there is a
      high rate of steroid associated adverse events, such as glaucoma, cataracts and
      endophthalmitis.

      Bromfenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDS) and is currently approved for
      the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery. In combination with intravitreal
      ranibizumab, bromfenac may also provide anti-inflammatory effects and may be a safer
      alternative to steroids.
