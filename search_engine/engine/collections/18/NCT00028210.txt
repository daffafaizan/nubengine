      adjacent deafferented hand representation. It is conceivable that this enlargement of the lip
      representation may translate into a behavioral gain. The purpose of this protocol is to test
      the hypothesis that upper limb amputation in humans results in higher tactile spatial acuity
      at the lip. This would represent the first demonstration of chronic deafferentation-induced
      behavioral gains within the somatosensory system.
