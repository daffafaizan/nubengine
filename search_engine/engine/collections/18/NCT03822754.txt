      purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of sIPV manufactured by
      Sinovac Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd in a '1+2' sequential schedule with bOPV in 2-month-old
      infants. 240 infants aged between 60-90 days will be randomly assigned into experimental
      group or control group in the ratio 1:1. The experimental group received sIPV-bOPV-bOPV
      vaccination schedule at one month doses interval (i.e., month 0, 1, 2), and the control group
      received wIPV-bOPV-bOPV vaccination schedule at one month doses interval (i.e., month 0, 1,
      2). The control wIPV was manufactured by SANOFI PASTEUR S.A.
