    
      1. Progression free survival rate at 12 weeks, defined as the proportion of patients alive
           and progression free at Week 12. Patients will be progression free if they have no tumor
           assessments of progressive disease (defined according to RECIST guidelines, version 1.1)
           at any point from the start of treatment to Week 12.

        2. Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall
           response is either CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1. The best overall response
           is the best response recorded during the first 12 week treatment cycle.

        3. Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR,
           PR and SD during the first 12 week treatment cycle according to RECIST version 1.1.

        4. Duration of overall tumor response (DR), defined as the interval between the date of the
           first observation of tumor response (CR or PR) and the date of disease progression or
           death.

        5. Progression free survival defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor
           progression by RECIST version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

        6. Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.

        7. Time to progression (TTP) defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor
           progression by RECIST version 1.1.
