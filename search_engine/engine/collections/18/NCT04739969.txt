      treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for 40
      min over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been
      effective in real world situations. The limitations of this approach include the duration of
      the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session, 5 days per week, for 4-8
      weeks). Recently, we have pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce treatment
      times with an accelerated treatment paradigm with great preliminary success. This study aims
      to further study our accelerated protocol and examine changes in neuroimaging biomarkers.
