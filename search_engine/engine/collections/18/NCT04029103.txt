      affects quality of life in a negative way, that has high treatment and care costs and
      mortality rates, long hospitalization duration and thus with all these aspects a
      psychological, physical, social and economic priority. Despite all these, diabetic foot
      complications and amputations could be decreased with the help of a good foot care, education
      and a multidisciplinary team work. Mobile technologies have been continuously increasing
      worldwide for the management of diabetes, and the use of these technologies is recommended by
      international institutions as well.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a Turkish mobile application that would
      increase patients' knowledge levels about foot health and care, improve their behaviours and
      self-efficacy, and evaluate its effectiveness so that it could be possible to prevent foot
      ulcer and the related amputations in individuals with diabetes. The Mobile Diabetic Foot
      Personal Care System (m-DAKBAS) developed for this purpose enables to increase individuals'
      self-confidence, improve communication with the health personnel, involve patients in their
      own care in an interactive way, and take responsibility.

      The usability of the application was indicated by the patients' feedback, and in line with
      the purpose of the mobile application, improvements in the patients' knowledge, behaviours
      and self-efficacy about foot care in diabetes.
