      undergo an ultrasound examination. During the examination, the operator will assess the
      location of the placenta/sac insertion. After the performance of the ultrasound, the women
      will undergo hysteroscopy with a different operator who will be blinded to the results of the
      previous exam result. During the hysteroscopy the second operator will assess again the
      location of the sac insertion .The investigatorswill then compare the results of the two
      tests using the histeroscopy as the gold standard and evaluate the performance of abdominal
      ultrasound exam in the evaluation of placenta/ sac inserion.
