      within a year. Stress and an individual's biological response to it are significant
      predictors of relapse. Thus, interventions that decrease stress and normalize an individual's
      biological response to stress are desperately needed. Exercise decreases stress and improves
      the body's regulation of stress. The proposed project will utilize exercise as a novel
      relapse prevention intervention with individuals who have recently completed inpatient SUD
      treatment. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a motivational intervention for
      exercise in a randomized clinical trial of 150 SUD patients beginning Aftercare treatment at
      the VA St. Louis Health Care System. Participants will be randomized to one of two
      interventions: (1) standard care (SC), or (2) standard care plus a motivational intervention
      targeting exercise that lasts for six months. Participants are followed every three months
      for one year. Results from this study will advance exercise as a new strategy for enhancing
      stress regulation and prevention of relapse in SUD populations.
