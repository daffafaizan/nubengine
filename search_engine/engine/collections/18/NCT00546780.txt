    
      Phase 3 combination study comparing tanespimycin (KOS-953) plus bortezomib to bortezomib
      alone in patients with multiple myeloma in first relapse after failure of previous
      anti-cancer therapy and/or bone marrow transplantation. Primary objective is to compare the
      progression-free survival (PFS) associated with the use of tanespimycin (KOS-953) in
      combination with bortezomib versus that associated with administration of bortezomib alone.
