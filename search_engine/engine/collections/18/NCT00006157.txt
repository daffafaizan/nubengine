      functional abdominal pain) will be enrolled at UNC-Chapel Hill and Toronto, Canada. A
      severity index will determine recruitment into the group of moderate FBD (200 patients) and
      severe FBD (100 patients). Each group will be randomized into the three treatment arms
      (cognitive-behavioral treatment, desipramine, and education/attention placebo), treated over
      a 12-week period, and followed for one year. Outcome measures will include symptoms
      (standardized abdominal pain, stool form and frequency) using diary cards, daily functional
      status (Sickness Impact Profile), depression (HAM-D) and psychological distress (SCL-90),
      physiological measures (enhanced rectal motility and visceral sensation), and health care
      use. Multivariate statistical methods with a hierarchical design will be applied to the data
      to assure maintenance of statistical power over multiple tests of overlapping groups.

      The results of this study should significantly improve our understanding of this complicated
      syndrome that lowers the quality of life and economic productivity of large numbers of women.
      The clinical impact of the study, in providing physicians with scientific evidence of the
      efficacy of treatments of FBD that are commonly used in practice, is significant. We
      anticipate that this study will provide clinicians with predictors of success among types of
      FBD patients and types of therapy that will improve symptoms and quality of life, and reduce
      the health care costs associated with this common syndrome while improving patient-physician
      satisfaction.
