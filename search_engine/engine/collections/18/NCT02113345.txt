      the Chinese Metamemory Scales. Study 2 is a cross-sectional study to explore the relationship
      between metamemory and memory of elders encountered in Hong Kong primary health care
      setting.Study 3 is an Effectiveness Study of Metamemory Cognitive Intervention on elders with
      mild cognitive impairment and low memory self-efficacy.

      This research has the following aims and hypotheses:

      Research Aims:

        1. To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese Metamemory Scales

        2. To explore the relationship between metamemory and memory of elders

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of a metamemory cognitive intervention on Mild Cognitive
           Impairment (MCI) elders who have low memory self-efficacy

      Research Hypotheses:

      Study 1: The Chinese Metamemory Scales will show acceptable psychometric properties.

      Study 2: There is a positive correlation between metamemory (subjective memory) and memory
      (objective memory) and this relationship is mediated by stereotyped beliefs about memory
      ageing.

      Study 3: Comparing to Control Group, the Intervention Group will yield the following expected
      results:

        1. There is an improvement in objective memory measures post-training.

        2. There is an improvement in subjective memory measures post-training.

        3. There is an improvement in mood measures post-training.
