    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multiple cross-over study. Eligible
      subjects will be treated with open label BEMA fentanyl over a period of up to two weeks.
      Doses will be titrated upward, starting at 200 Î¼g, until a dose is identified that produces
      satisfactory pain relief for at least 2 episodes. Those subjects who identify a dose of BEMA
      fentanyl that produces satisfactory relief of breakthrough pain episodes will enter the
      double-blind, placebo controlled period of the trial. They will receive 3 placebo doses and 6
      BEMA fentanyl doses in a random sequence per randomization schedule.
