      patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer and to establish an immune monitoring laboratory for
      future clinical trial. We will ask up to 10 patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer in stable
      condition and in reasonable health to participate in this study. The study will establish an
      immune monitoring for correlative studies done in patients with HER-2(+) breast cancer. The
      immunologic tests that will be done are ELISpot, lymphocyte proliferation, intracellular
      cytokine staining, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, and ELISA.
