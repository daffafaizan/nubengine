    
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-dose study to compare the PK of 21-desacetyl-DFZ
      and, if data permits, deflazacort in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (based on
      the Child Pugh classification, Grade B) to that of 8 healthy matched control subjects (age,
      body mass index [BMI], and gender).

      On Day 1, a single oral dose of deflazacort will be administered followed by serial blood
      sampling for 24 hours to assess the PK of 21-desacetyl-DFZ and, if data permits, deflazacort.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory
      evaluations.

      Subjects will return to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) 3 days (± 1 day) following study
      drug administration to determine if any adverse events (AEs) have occurred since the last
      study visit. Subjects who terminate the study early will be contacted if the Principal
      Investigator (PI) deems necessary.

      A total of sixteen (16) adult male and female subjects will be enrolled. Hepatic Impaired
      Cohort: Eight (8) subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency (a score of 7 to 9, on the
      Child-Pugh scale).

      Healthy Match Control Cohort: Eight (8) healthy subjects. Subjects will be matched for age [±
      15 years], BMI [± 15 %], and gender [1:1] to the subjects in the moderate hepatic impaired
      cohort.
