        -  Primarily, the functional results of a cohort of 20 pacients presenting fractures of 3
           and 4 parts of proximal humerus (according to (Neer's Classification) that will be
           treated orthopedically (this is, non-surgically). This patients will be recruited in the
           emergency room of our center, and after being diagnosed of their fracture, will be
           treated with a sling for three weeks and subsequent rehabilitation treatment. Our
           intention is to assess the function of the injured shoulder using functional scales
           (ASES and Constant score) at the time of one, three, six and twelve months from the date
           of the trauma.

        -  Secondly the investigators want to compare the results obtained in this cohort with the
           results of a historical cohort of patients operated in our center with the same type of
           fracture. Both types of treatment (non-surgical and shoulder prosthesis) are valid for
           this type of fracture, and endorsed by the scientific literature.

      The investigators consider this to be an observational study since it assigns a single cohort
      of patients a single treatment (ie non-surgical treatment). The conservative treatment for
      this fractures is part of routine medical care, and the object of this study is studies the
      effect of this intervention.
