    
      Within the context of a research and teaching clinic at the Department of Psychology and
      Behavioral Sciences, Aarhus University, Denmark, 70 adolescents aged 13-17 with a primary
      anxiety disorder as assessed by the ADIS C/P will be randomly allocated to either a 3 month
      wait-list control condition or a treatment condition.

      The treatment consists of an internet-based self-help program for adolescents with anxiety
      disorders called 'Chilled Out', based on material from the well-established manualised
      group-treatment Cool Kids Program: Adolescent version. It consists of 8 CBT-inspired modules
      of approximately 30 minutes each distributed over a 14-week period. The program is
      interactive using a combination of different media (text, audio, illustrations, cartoons, and
      videos) to deliver psychoeducation and CBT-inspired techniques, activities and exercises for
      adolescents to manage their anxiety. In addition, the adolescent will receive a limited
      amount of therapist support calls.

      Participants (youth and parents) are assessed with semi-structured diagnostic interviews and
      self-report measures before treatment, after 14 weeks (post treatment) and 3 months after
      treatment (follow-up).

      Participants are assessed at pre, post and 3-month follow up.
