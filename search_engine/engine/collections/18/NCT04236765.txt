      age, which are children of immigrants and born or not in Spain, who travel to VFRs to
      countries with an elevated incidence of TB (> 40 cases/100,000 inhabitants). A sample size of
      492 children was estimated. Children will be recruited during a programmed visit to a
      traveler health clinic or a primary care center, a questionnaire will be completed with
      sociodemographic, epidemiologic and clinical data and a tuberculin skin test (TST) will be
      performed and read at 48-72 hours. At 8-12 weeks after returning from the travel abroad the
      child will have a new visit in which a questionnaire will be completed with epidemiological
      and clinical data, an a TST and QFT-Plus test will be performed. The rate of incidence of
      LTBI will be estimated per individual/month and person/year per country visited and by age
      group.
