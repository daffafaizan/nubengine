      brain, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study healthy volunteers while
      they performed a working memory task following intra-gastric administration of either 250 ml
      or 500 ml Rivella green速 (RG), a milk whey based green tea extract containing soft drink, or
      Rivella blue速 (RB), a milk whey based soft drink without green tea extract as sham condition
      in a double-blind, controlled design. Based on the literature on pharmacological and
      behavioural effects of green tea, we hypothesized - a priori - that green tea extract would
      subtly modulate the engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a brain region
      critically involved in many cognitive functions such as working memory processing.

      A double-blind, controlled, within-subject study with counterbalanced order of substance
      administration using an established protocol (6-8) was conducted over 4 sessions (250 ml or
      500 ml Rivella green速 (including green tea extract; RG), 250 or 500 ml Rivella blue速 (RB).
      Each participant was scanned four times with a one-week interval between scans. The order of
      substance administration across sessions was counterbalanced across subjects, such that equal
      numbers followed each substance sequence.
