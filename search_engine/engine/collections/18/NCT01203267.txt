      treatment of locally advanced breast cancer has become a standard therapy. Results from
      neoadjuvant trials have shown that pathological complete response (pCR) is an independent
      predictor of outcome. Paclitaxel was introduced into clinical practice in the early 1990s and
      has demonstrated good activity in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Platinum complexes,
      like cisplatin and carboplatin, are active in a wide range of solid tumors. Paclitaxel
      combined with carboplatin has shown great activity in ovarian and nonsmall- cell lung cancer
      treatment. In addition, the overall response rate of paclitaxel plus carboplatin was between
      53% and 62% in the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. This study will evaluate
      the pCR rate of weekly paclitaxel plus carboplatin as preoperative treatment for breast
      cancer patients.
