      clinical trial designed to evaluate the longer-term safety and effectiveness of the BHR
      system. The data collected will permit clinical evaluation for the device performance in
      improving hip pain, function and range of motion through ten years. The study will permit
      radiographic evaluation of proper component fixation and alignment maintenance through 10
      years post-operative. The incidence of revision is an especially important measure in this
      study. Data collected will allow analysis of the implant survivorship.
