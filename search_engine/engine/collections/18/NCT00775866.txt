      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided prostate biopsy in a 1.5T horizontal bore scanner
      using a dedicated interventional table. We primarily hypothesize that the integration of
      diagnostic and interventional MRI enables needle biopsy targeting to foci of tumor recurrence
      after radiotherapy, and will enable a determination of the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in
      mapping sub-sites of tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH:
      Patients with recurrence of their prostate cancer after radiotherapy currently face difficult
      choices. Standard second line treatments target the entire prostate gland and are associated
      many side effects. This study will directly improve the detection, spatial delineation, and
      characterization of prostate cancer persistence after radiotherapy. If anatomic patterns of
      disease persistence are found across patients, radiation delivery techniques will be suitably
      modified, which may translate to improved cure rates. Importantly, this study will establish
      a procedural platform for MRI-guidance of minimally invasive local salvage therapies. By
      precisely focusing salvage therapy to sites of tumor persistence within the prostate gland,
      side effects may be reduced in the future.
