      pain especially in postmenopausal patients. A recent randomized controlled trial revealed
      that uterine striating by bladder filling prior to office hysteroscopy is associated with
      reduced pain perception and easier introduction of hysteroscope through the cervix.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of misoprostol versus uterine
      straightening by bladder filling for pain relief in menopausal patients undergoing office
      hysteroscopy.
