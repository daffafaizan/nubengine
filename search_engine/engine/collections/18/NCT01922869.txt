      generally healthy.On arriving at the study day we will collect a blood sample. Breakfast will
      then be supplied in the form of a food or drink that will contain freezedried powder from
      orange juice, chocolate and blackberry. After breakfast further blood samples will be taken
      at several time points throughout the day. Urine and faeces samples will also be collected.
      These biological samples will be tested for flavonoid absorption, metabolism and excretion as
      well as influence of genetic make-up of individuals and the gut microflora harboured in
      faecal samples.
