    
      This clinical study is a prospective, single-arm study designed to confirm that the acute
      performance and safety of the Lotus Valve Flex System for TAVR are consistent with the
      results of the Lotus Valve System in the REPRISE II study, when delivered and deployed in
      symptomatic subjects who have severe calcific aortic valve stenosis and who are at high risk
      for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).
