    
      The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of an experimental dentifrice
      formulation in promoting enamel remineralization and inhibiting post-treatment enamel
      demineralization in an in situ erosion model, in comparison with a fluoride-free placebo and
      with a marketed competitor dentifrice product. The study will have 4 visits, 1 screening
      visit to assess participants eligibility and 3 treatment visits to assess product efficacy,
      where the treatment product will be dispensed and used under the supervision of a suitably
      trained study site personnel. Prior to each treatment visit, there will be a washout period
      of a minimum of 3 days. During this period participants will use their own dentifrice for at
      least one day, and a fluoride free dentifrice (provided) for two days prior to the next
      scheduled visit (including in the morning of the scheduled visit) to minimize any carry-over
      effects of the fluoride toothpaste.
