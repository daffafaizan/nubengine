    
      BACKGROUND:

      The study constituted part of a growing body of research designed to understand not only the
      secular trends in mortality, morbidity, survival, and disability levels for selected major
      chronic diseases among older persons in the United States, but also the implications of the
      findings for health care utilization.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The design was that of a retrospective study of successive cohorts of a well-defined and
      well-documented elderly population for the purpose of identifying and explaining trends in
      congestive heart failure (CHF) incidence, survival, comorbidities and health services
      utilization during the 25-year period 1970-1994. The study sample consisted of two successive
      period cohorts of elderly people, identified for each of two five-year periods, 1970-1974 and
      1990-94. The study tested the following hypotheses: 1) incidence of CHF had decreased among
      the younger old (65-74 years of age); 2) incidence of CHF had increased among the older old
      (75 years of age or above); 3) one-year survival time had increased following onset of
      incident CHF; and 4) prevalence of hypertension had decreased and prevalence of myocardial
      infarction and other manifestations of coronary artery disease increased among incident cases
      of CHF.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
