    
      This is a randomized, non-blinded, multicenter treatment trial to demonstrate and compare the
      efficacy of esomeprazole and fluticasone in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.

      Following the initial diagnostic EGD with four quadrant biopsy, serum eosinophil count and
      serum IgE levels will be measured. Patients will undergo 24 hour pH study to determine the
      incidence of reflux in this population. Clinical assessment will be performed with validated
      questionnaires quantifying dysphagia, GERD, and allergy/atopy. Patients will be randomized to
      8 weeks of either esomeprazole versus swallowed aerosolized fluticasone. After 8 weeks of
      therapy, upper endoscopy will again be performed. Eosinophils per high power field will be
      quantified, and biopsies will be stained for major basic protein. Dysphagia, GERD, and
      allergy/atopy questionnaires will be repeated, as will serum eosinophil counts and IgE
      measurements.
