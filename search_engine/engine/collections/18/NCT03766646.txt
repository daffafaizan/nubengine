      the Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton. The study will take place from September 2018 to
      January 2019 and involve preoxygenating all participants for three minutes using the
      Optiflowâ„¢ device. During this time, participants will be instructed to either read aloud a
      standardised text or to breathe through their nose with a closed mouth. At the end of 3
      minutes, the primary outcome, ETO2, will be measured and recorded.
