    
      This is a dual-agent, prospective, open-label, multi-centric, phase I trial of combination of
      Lapatinib and Sorafenib in patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic solid
      tumors. This trial will be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),
      safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of these two agents given
      together on a continuous schedule, in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Our ambition is to recommend a safe dose regimen of the combination for subsequent larger
      phase II studies, coinciding with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), will be defined as the highest dosage cohort at which no
      more than one of six patients will be experienced a DLT in the first treatment cycle.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled and treated according to the schema, using a 3+3 design
      (Fibonacci method modified);
