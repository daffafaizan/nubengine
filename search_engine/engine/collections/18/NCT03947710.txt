      enrollment. The intervention will last 3 consecutive weeks. Eligible subjects will be
      randomised to one group (high or low protein meals during dialysis) for one week (3 dialysis
      sessions). Second week will be a wash out period (patients will not consume meals during
      dialysis) and during the third week randomised subjects will cross over to the other study
      group. Every meal will provide 1/3 of daily recommended energy and protein intake (35 kcal/kg
      body weight/day, 0.7 gr protein/kg body weight/day for low protein meals and 1.5 gr
      protein/kg body weight/day for high protein meals). All the meals will be prepared in the
      hospital's kitchen and will be personalized to each patient's preferences. The meal will be
      given one hour after the start of the session and should be consumed completely during
      dialysis.

      Patients will be evaluated for the following parameters during their midweek dialysis
      session:

        1. Intradialytic blood pressure

        2. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure

        3. Arterial stiffness indices (Central Aortic blood pressure, Pulse Wave Velocity,
           Augmentation Index)

        4. Hemodialysis adequacy

        5. Nutritional status

      Intradialytic blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and arterial stiffness
      indices will be evaluated with the use of the brachial cuff-based oscillometric device
      Mobil-O-Graph NG (IEM, Stolberg, Germany). Urea reduction ratio (URR) and Kt/V (standard and
      equilibrated) will be used as measures for dialysis adequacy. Possible changes in patients
      nutritional status will be assessed using the Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS).
