      main complications is paralysis of vocal cords. Indeed, the anatomy of the thyroid and its
      close location with the recurrent laryngeal nerve (responsible for the vocal cord movement)
      involves a possible lesion or inflammation of the nerve during the surgical procedure. This
      complication is common, affecting around 10% of thyroid or parathyroid patients following
      surgery. This complication can be reversible, with a speech therapy or a specific endoscopic
      treatment by an otolaryngologist.

      Currently, a postoperative screening is performed by nasofibroscopy in the recovery room to
      directly visualize vocal cord mobility. This examination may be painful or badly tolerated by
      some patients.

      Recent studies have highlighted the performance of ultrasound in this diagnosis. The protocol
      for these studies included an ultrasound distant of the intervention, while it is known that
      vocal cord paralysis may have earlier consequences.

      In this study, the investigators would like to evaluate diagnostic performances of vocal
      cords ultrasound for an early diagnosis (as soon as awakening of the patient) of vocal cords
      paralysis in the post-operative period in order to prevent at best complications.

      The main limitation of vocal cord ultrasound is mainly related to surgery. Surgery creates
      anatomical rearrangements, so the secondary objective of this study will be to test whether
      the preoperative visualization is predictive of a good postoperative visualization.
