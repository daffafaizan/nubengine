      according to the random table. All patients will receive tumour screening, symptomatic
      supportive treatment, and immunotherapy. The immunotherapy includes high-dose corticosteroid,
      intravenous gamma immunoglobulin (IVIG; 0.4 g/kg/d for each course for 5 d), PE and
      immunosuppressants. The immunosuppressants will be given after enrolled 4 weeks. High-dose
      corticosteroid and PE will be given before IVIG in the early PE group. PE will be given after
      high-dose corticosteroid and IVIG 2 weeks in the non-early PE group. The mRS will be used for
      outcome evaluations. The outcomes will be evaluated after 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months
      respectively following immunotherapy. The evaluation standards were as follows: a mRS of 0-2
      points is a favourable outcome, and 3-6 points is an unfavourable outcome. Statistically
      analyses will be employed to examine the differences in outcomes between the severe and
      non-severe groups.
