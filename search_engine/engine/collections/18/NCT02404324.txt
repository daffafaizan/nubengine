      astigmatism, myopia, myopic astigmatism and minor ametropias. All children are prescribed
      full optical correction of refractive errors with special attention to astigmatism up to 0.5
      Dpt to achieve maximal clear image on the retina of both eyes.If necessary, direct occlusion
      or penalization were administered to the children. The investigators suggest that this
      approach will give good results in the treatment of esotropia.
