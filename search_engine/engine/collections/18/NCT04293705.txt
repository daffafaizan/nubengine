      and behavioral and social problems. Ad hoc rehabilitation may significantly ameliorate such
      difficulties. With this aim, the Teen On-line Problem-Solving program (TOPS) could represent
      a suitable opportunity of intervention, as it aims at helping children to improve executive
      and behavioral functioning. The program consists of a web-based platform composed of 20
      sessions, 10 core and 10 supplementary, providing information and activities on executive
      functioning, behavioral strategies, social skills and injury-related issues. The program is
      delivered remotely, with patients performing it at home, together with their families.
      Biweekly Skype sessions with a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist are scheduled along the
      entire duration of the intervention to monitor the real-life problem-solving process that
      patients are required to perform.

      Assessment of executive functions and behavioral problems is conducted before and after the
      training (immediate post training assessment at month 6 and follow-up assessment at month
      12), in order to investigate the presence of significant changes after the intervention. Both
      questionnaires and performance-based measures are used.
