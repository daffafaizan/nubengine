    
      In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we seek to evaluate
      the effect of the administration of 200 mg of IV potassium canrenoate vs placebo in
      brain-dead donors aged 18 years or more - at 3-6 hours after the diagnosis of brain death is
      made and before the departure to operating room.

      The primary objective is to assess the impact of potassium canrenoate administration vs.
      placebo on the hemodynamics of brain-dead subjects who are candidates for kidney or multiple
      organ harvesting (including renal).

      The vital status and renal function of kidney recipients will be followed at 3 months, 1
      year, 3 years and 10 years from transplant (main secondary objectives)
