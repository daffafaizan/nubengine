      control actions such as running, jumping, grasping, and lifting. Without tendons it would be
      difficult to control the movement of your body. A protective layer known as synovium covers
      tendons. This sheath produces fluid, which keeps the tendon lubricated and moving properly.
      Inflammation or swelling of the sheath is known as tendon sheath inflammation or
      tenosynovitis. This condition is often treated with an injection into or around the sheath.
      This injection often consists of a corticosteroid with or without lidocaine.
      Corticosteroid(CS) are drugs that decrease inflammation and are given for a number of
      orthopaedic conditions to decrease symptoms of the underlying disease. Lidocaine is also a
      drug that blocks the pain response, although it only blocks it momentarily. The study aims to
      determine if corticosteroid injection alone is as effective as corticosteroid combined with
      lidocaine for the relief of tenosynovitis of the upper extremity.

      The study plans to enroll 1000 pts with tendinopathies of upper extremities and nerve
      entrapments and will be followed up in clinic 2 weeks and 6 weeks after the injection. During
      the clinic visits the Visual Analog Scale for pain (VAS-pain), range of motion (ROM),
      strength, and patient reported outcome data will be collected and any complications will be
      noted. Patients will also utilize a pain journal to track VAS-pain over the first 7
      post-injection days.
