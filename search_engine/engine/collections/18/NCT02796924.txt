      PNES to investigate the feasibility of using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) to decreasing the frequency of psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) episodes. rTMS
      is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation that uses rapid magnetic pulses applied over
      the scalp to active neurons in a specified target location of the brain.

      Electronic as well as paper-and-pencil questionnaires will be used to asses patient's
      psychiatric symptoms and functional impairment both before and after treatment to monitor
      symptom-changes.Treatment will consist of daily sessions of high frequency (20 Hz) rTMS
      applied over the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) of the cerebral cortex. Patients will
      receive two sessions per day for 15 consecutive weekdays. Each session will take
      approximately 20 minutes to complete.

      Results of the questionnaires will be analyzed to determine the effect of the treatment on
      PNES episodes and functional impairment. As a pilot study, this research will be used to
      evaluate the effect size and the feasibility of a more definitive project in the future. Both
      patient response and tolerability to rTMS will be analyzed.
