      I. To establish the effect of D vitamin (vitamin D3) supplementation on inspiratory muscle
      strength in vitamin D3-deficient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
      (Roswell Park Cancer Institute [RPCI]/University at Buffalo [UB] study) II. To establish the
      12 month conversion rate. (University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute [UPCI] study)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on peripheral muscle strength and
      exercise capacity in vitamin D3-deficient COPD patients. (RPCI/UB study) II. To establish the
      3 and 6-month conversion rates. (UPCI study) III. To examine whether vitamin D3
      supplementation is equally effective in COPD patients who are current versus former smokers.
      (UPCI study)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in COPD patients on biomarkers of
      lung cancer risk, inflammation, and pulmonary function. (UPCI study)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      CONTROL ARM: Patients receive a placebo and multivitamin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 52
      weeks.

      SUPPLEMENTATION ARM: Patients receive a multivitamin and cholecalciferol supplement PO QD for
      52 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
