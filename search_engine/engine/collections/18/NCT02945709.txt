      Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

      ACT was found to be effective in decreasing attention bias variability and PTSD symptoms in
      combat veterans (Badura-Brack, et al., 2015). It is now important to continue the examination
      of ACT's efficacy in additional populations of patients with PTSD. Such extension of
      treatment to other traumatic experiences raises the question of whether the threatening
      content of the training material could be personalized for each patient.

      For this purpose, we will recruit participants that are diagnosed with PTSD and will be
      randomly assigned to one of three conditions: personalized ACT, non-personalized ACT, or
      control training We expect that personalized ACT will produce greater reduction in PTSD
      symptoms relative to a non-personalized ACT, and that both these conditions will be more
      effective in symptoms reduction than a control condition not designed to affect attention or
      expose patients to threat stimuli. We also expect the ACT conditions to reduce attention bias
      variability relative to the control condition.
