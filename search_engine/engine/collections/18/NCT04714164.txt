      for seniors to a telemedicine format. Currently the Geriatric Psychiatry service associated
      with the Nova Scotia Health Authority offer two CBT-E groups every year. They are usually
      facilitated by psychiatry residents, under the supervision of a staff psychiatrist. Due to
      the risk of COVID-19, we will not be holding in-person groups this year. Instead we will
      offer the group in a smaller, telemedicine format. For this project, we will change the group
      structure and activities to allow it's delivery in a virtual format. This study will assess
      feasibility, tolerability of the telehealth format by using the System Usability Scale and
      Group Satisfaction Survey. It will also assess response to online therapy buy using pre- and
      post-group questionnaires including the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and
      Perceived Quality of Life Questionnaire. Paired t-tests will be used to analyse the data and
      determine whether there has been an improvement in participant's symptoms and quality of
      life.
