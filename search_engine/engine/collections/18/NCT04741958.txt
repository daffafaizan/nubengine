      origin (chest wall, pleura, pulmonary, and mediastinum), they are increasing in numbers
      including, peripheral lung cancer, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and atelectasis. [1] Thoracic
      masses with wall contact represent a frequent pathology that requires complex imaging
      studies, and often interventional procedures, in order to reach the complete diagnosis. In
      most cases, after a thoracic lesion is found on a thoracic X-Ray, the next step is to perform
      a CT and/or a bronchoscopy exam, but pleural and pulmonary lesions often call for additional
      investigations.

      Therefore, transthoracic ultrasonography (US) permits visualization of these lesions, their
      structural characterization, while offering suggestive elements for their malignant nature
      and for the differential diagnosis.

      Sonography has the capacity to clarify the nature of opaque lesions such as effusions,
      atelectasis, masses, and consolidations. Transthoracic ultrasound has received increased
      interest from chest Physicians in recent years as it has the advantages of bedside
      availability, absence of radiation, and guided aspiration of fluid-filled areas and solid
      tumors.

      Furthermore US allows percutaneous guided biopsies with lower risks compared with the
      radiological guiding methods (fluoroscopy and CT). Trransthoracic US can replace other
      imaging modalities of the chest and guide a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
      Under real time US guidance, the success rate of transthoracic needle aspiration or biopsy
      (TNB) significantly increases, whereas the risk of complications is greatly reduced.
