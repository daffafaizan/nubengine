      supplementation are, separately, effective in improving old adult's health and palliate
      functional metabolic diseases in the elderly. However, the true effect of HMB supplementation
      combined with a tailored exercise program in frail old adults is still unknown.

      Thus, the aim of the HEAL study is to assess the effects of the combination of a daily
      multicomponent exercise and resistance training intervention in addition to HMB
      supplementation on old adults' health.

      The findings of the HEAL study will help professionals from public health systems to identify
      cost-effectiveness and innovative actions to improve older people's health and quality of
      life, and endorse exercise practice in older adults living in nursing homes.
