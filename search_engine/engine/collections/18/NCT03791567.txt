      is for the treatment of brittle T1D. Brittle T1D is a distinct subset of T1D, representing
      the most severe and difficult to manage manifestation of the disease. Standard therapies
      (i.e. exogenous insulin injections and insulin pumps) are not sufficient to regulate blood
      glucose levels for this subset of patients. Thus, the severity of disease and the lack of
      metabolic control that occur despite intensive insulin therapy in brittle T1D patients
      defines a patient population whose risk-benefit profile makes them suitable for islet
      transplantation. Eligible patients may receive one or several allogeneic pancreatic islet
      transplants. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), composed of 3 members who have
      training in medicine and/or organ transplantation, will review eligibility and safety data
      within 2 weeks after each islet transplantation and every two months thereafter. An
      independent monitor, who is knowledgeable about Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and
      regulations, monitors the study for compliance with 21 CFR and according to ICH GCP
      Guidelines. The UIC Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews safety data annually and on
      occurrence of serious adverse events. The principal investigator also reports serious adverse
      events to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Success, partial success, and failure
      criteria will be the same as indicated in the Phase III clinical trial. Patients will be
      closely monitored post-transplant by the UIC clinical team and/or their primary care
      physician for safety and efficacy.
