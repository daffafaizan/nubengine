      interventions is limited. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of rotator
      interval injection with steroid with that of steroid hydrodilatatoin for treating adhesive
      capsulitis.

      Design: a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, clinical trial

      Patient and methods:

      Patients with adhesive capsulitis for at least 3 months were enrolled and randomly allocated
      into group 1 ( ultrasound guided rotator interval injection ) and group 2 (ultrasound guided
      steroid hydrodilatation). The patients were evaluated before treatment and were reevaluated
      0, 6, and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Outcomes measures included a pain
      scale (visual analog scale), range of motion, Constant shoulder score, and Shoulder Pain And
      Disability Index.
