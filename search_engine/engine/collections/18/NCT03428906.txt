    
      In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo controlled design, healthy male volunteers
      receive intranasal oxytocin or placebo prior to functional magnetic resonance
      imaging.Subjects will then go through a decision making task, a emotion judgement task and an
      eight-minute resting-state scan in MRI scanner to investigate whether and how intranasal
      oxytocin alter the topology of functional brain network in resting-state and multiple tasks
      in healthy males. State anxiety and mood are measured before and after experiment as
      covariates to be controlled.
