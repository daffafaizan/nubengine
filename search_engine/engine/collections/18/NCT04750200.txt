      randomized in our study. Patients that present in the ED or neurosurgery clinic will be
      assessed for standard of care treatment options based on their presenting symptoms; this may
      include surgical drainage or medical management. Patients will then by screened for study
      eligibility based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. After screening and
      consenting patients will be randomized in to the control arm or interventional arm.

      Patients randomized to the control arm will undergo institutional standard of care treatment
      (surgical drainage and/or medical management) of the CSDH.

      Patients randomized to the interventional arm will undergo institutional standard of care
      treatment (surgical drainage and/or medical management) of the CSDH as per the standard of
      care in the institution. These patients will then undergo EMMA within 48 hours after
      finishing the surgical drainage. The embolic agent and use of general anaesthesia vs
      conscious sedation will be left to operators' preference and the institutional protocol.

      All patients will be followed as per the institutional standard of the care. Any
      peri-procedural complications and change in clinical status will be recorded. The risk of
      recurrence at 90-days in patients who undergo standard of care treatment (surgical and/or
      medical management) of CSDH with or without EMMA will be observed.
