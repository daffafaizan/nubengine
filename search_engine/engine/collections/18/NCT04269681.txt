    
      Do-not-intubate (DNI) is usually established in cases where endotracheal intubation (ETI) is
      considered disproportionate to prognosis and/or incompatible with the expression of wishes
      and values of the patient. Regardless of the profile of this care plan offered to patients
      with DNI, the control of dyspnea is one of its central objectives. The approach to dyspnea
      includes pharmacological measures such as opioids and non-pharmacological measures, such as
      oxygen therapy and Non-Invasive Ventilation, and more recently, the high flow nasal catheter
      (HFNC). HFNC provides high flow of heated and humidified mixed gas through a nasal cannula.
      In addition to the ability to generate high flows and supplemental oxygen, HFNC may generate
      a low level of positive airway pressure, may decrease dead space ventilation and may
      contribute to better patient comfort, such as the possibility of oral feeding while
      undergoing treatment, performing oral hygiene and allowing conversation and interaction with
      family members. This pilot study aims to evaluate the efficacy of HFNC in reducing dyspnea
      and improving comfort in patients with Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) and DNI order.
