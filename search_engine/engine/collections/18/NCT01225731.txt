      participant will receive assigned treatment at Weeks 0 and 4 in Part I. At Week 16, the
      dosage of treatment the patient is assigned to may be adjusted based on the Psoriasis Area
      and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response (responder vs non-responder). Participants will receive
      study medication once every 12 weeks during Part 2 (Weeks 16 to 52); no participants will
      receive placebo in Part 2. Part 3 is an observational period and each subject will continue
      to be monitored on a monthly basis through Week 72. Subjects will not receive any study
      medication during Part 3.
