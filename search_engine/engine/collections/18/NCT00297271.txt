      management and outcome of mild cognitive impairment and dementia and the profile of patients
      at participating sites. The data will be used to build models looking at the effect of
      management of these conditions on principal clinical events, health status and economic
      outcomes. This will provide the foundation for subsequent objective and prospective
      evaluation of evidence-based strategies for the optimal treatment of mild cognitive
      impairment and dementia in Australia. This study is not prescriptive, but will instead
      examine the influence of a whole range of routinely used management strategies on clinical
      and economic outcomes among mild cognitive impaired and dementia patients in Australia. This
      'practice based' approach is increasingly widely used and is a useful tool for elucidating
      the relative effectiveness of different management strategies and for exploring relationships
      between patient characteristics, treatment and outcomes. Observational study - no study drug
      administered.
