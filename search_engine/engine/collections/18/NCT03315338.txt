    
      This is a 5-part, single-center study of single and multiple ascending doses of CORT118335 in
      healthy subjects.

      Parts I and 4 of the study are double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessments of
      single-ascending doses (SAD) of CORT118335. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of
      up 8 cohorts (Part 1, Cohorts A to D [Cohorts E to G have been cancelled]; Part 4, Cohorts A
      to D), each containing 8 subjects. Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomly assigned
      to receive a single dose of CORT118335 and 2 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a
      single dose of matching placebo.

      Part 2 Cohort A, food-effect, will be an open-label 2-way crossover study in one cohort of 12
      subjects, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of CORT118335 once after an
      overnight fast and once after a high-fat breakfast or the alternate sequence, over 2 study
      periods separated by a washout of at least 7 days/5 half-lives.

      Part 2 Cohort B, PD cohort, will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way
      cross-over study and will serve as proof of pharmacological effect (GR modulation) for
      CORT118335. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, and two dose
      levels of CORT118335 in one of three treatment sequences across 3 study periods separated by
      washouts of at least 7 days/5 half-lives. On each occasion, the ability of CORT118335 to
      ameliorate the pharmacological effects of a single dose of prednisone will be measured.

      Parts 3 and 5 are double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessments of multiple oral
      ascending doses of CORT118335. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of up to 4
      cohorts (Part 1 Cohort A [Cohorts B to D have been cancelled; Part 5 Cohorts A to C), each
      containing 12 subjects. Within each cohort, 9 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive
      CORT118335 and 3 subjects to receive matching placebo daily for 14 days.

      Different formulations of CORT118335 will be used in Parts 1, 2 and 3, and in Parts 4 and 5.
