      neuroma, a malicious possibly nontraumatic, neoplastic tissue coding and decoding itself upon
      autonomic release of neurotransmitter(s). Exhaustion of neurotransmitter synthesis turns out
      the explosions of pain-symptoms off.

      Poor attention to the characterization of a peripheral neuroma of trigeminal nerve branch
      deranged attention to central(CNS) characterization of Cluster Symptoms.

      This study based on our experimental results of minimal surgical procedure to explore,
      diagnose and resect a Zygomatico-Temporal neuroma in the temple of patients suffering from
      EpisodicChronic, Cluster Headache-ECCH. The goal is to light on this speculation in a novel
      analysis of events to put an end to devastating catastrophic headaches. Detailed anatomical
      components loci of the autonomic symptoms in the cluster headache reveal the presence of an
      electrical neural circuit.

      The extracranial circuit components of ECCH reflects the anatomical nerve components
      participating reflection of the single circumscribed symptom:

        1. Zygomatico-Temporal-neuroma

        2. Zygomatic nerve V-II

        3. Intraorbital communicants rami

        4. Lacrimal nerve V-I

        5. Ophthalmic nerve Intraorbital routing, supraorbital nerves, the upper eyelid, the
           conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including the tip of the nose, except alae
           nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses. V-I

        6. Optic nerve via ophthalmic nerve routing and electricity propagation.

        7. Pterygopalatine ganglion as peripheral and CNS coordinator center.

      An intracranial CNS reaction follows in response to the perception of pain materialized in
      neuroimaging during the activity of ECCH.
