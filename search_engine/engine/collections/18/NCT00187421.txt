      high quality anastomosis with a durable conduit to an appropriate target coronary vessel.
      Significant advances in medical therapy including early post-operative aspirin administration
      and increased use of arterial grafting have improved early, midterm and late graft patency.
      However, modern coronary bypass series continue to report perioperative graft occlusions
      rates as high as 11%. These very early graft failures have been predominantly ascribed to
      technical problems at graft anastomosis sites and may be preventable. New intraoperative
      graft assessment technologies have recently become available which can identify technical
      problems such that they can be repaired in the operating room. However, these techniques
      increase the length of the bypass operation and may have false positives, which may lead to
      unnecessary and potentially damaging graft revisions. The primary objective of the proposed
      study is to determine if a strategy of intraoperative patency assessment and graft revision
      can decrease the rate of graft occlusion or significant stenosis(>50%) at 6-12 weeks after
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus traditional operative management without
      routine intraoperative patency assessment.
