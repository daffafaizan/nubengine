    
      This is a phase II, open label, non-randomized study in patients with
      histologically/cytologically confirmed stage IIIB (pleural or pericardial effusion) or stage
      IV NSCLC who have not received prior chemotherapy. The trial will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety profile of the combination of docetaxel, carboplatin and cetuximab for patients with
      advanced NSCLC.

      Patients will receive a combination of docetaxel and carboplatin administered every 3 weeks
      plus cetuximab given weekly. A maximum of four cycles of chemotherapy will be administered to
      patients. Patients who demonstrate an ongoing response (CR/PR/SD) at the end of 4th cycle of
      chemotherapy, may receive two more cycles of treatment. Patients who continue to respond
      (CR/PR/SD) after six cycles of therapy may receive therapy with single agent cetuximab (250
      mg/m2/week) for up to 1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever
      occurs first.

      Patients will be evaluated for response, time to progression, and overall survival. In
      addition, the safety profile of the combination will be assessed.
