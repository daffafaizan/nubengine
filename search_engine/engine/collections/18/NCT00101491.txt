      STORIES is one of two intervention trials conducted as part of the "Deep South Partnership
      for the Prevention of CVD Disparities" under the NHLBI Partnership Programs to Reduce
      Cardiovascular Disparities. STORIES is an innovative approach to smoking cessation programs
      provided in medical facilities for patients seeking assistance with quitting smoking. Our
      approach is to provide the patient with counseling prior to being discharged from the
      hospital in an effort to assist them with quitting smoking. The DVD will include current and
      previous smokers telling their stories regarding their tobacco use. We feel having the
      patient see other people similar to them express their views, struggles and successes with
      quitting smoking will motivate them to quit smoking. The patient will also receive 3 follow
      up telephone calls to check on their progress. Our hypothesis is that patients exposed to the
      interactive DVD will be more likely to quit, compared with those not exposed. The specific
      aims for this health communication project are: (1) to develop a series of interactive,
      testimonial-base stage of change-matched Health Communication DVD video interventions
      targeted at low-income, low-literacy African Americans in the Deep South and a health
      information interactive DVD for the patients selected in the randomized control group; (2) to
      train a peer health counselor/research assistant to counsel inpatient smokers to quit and
      assist the community members with learning to use the DVDs and then to follow-up by telephone
      at two weeks, three months and six months after discharge following enrollment in the
      project; and (3) to evaluate the impact of the intervention on processes of change and six
      month cessation rates among smokers using a group-randomized controlled trial.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Query View Report (QVR) record.
