    
      This is a randomized controlled trial. Patients suffering from recurrent acute sinusitis
      episodes will be randomly allocated to two groups: intervention group, where they will
      receive endoscopic sinus surgery in addition to medical treatment and control group, where
      they will receive mere medical treatment. Both groups will be followed-up for 5 to 6 months.
      At baseline and after 5 to 6 months, patients will answer the life quality questionnaires
      SNOT-22 and RAND 36-item Health Survey. The numbers of sinusitis episodes, medical
      appointments for respiratory symptoms, use of medications, numbers of days lost from work or
      studies and numbers of days with various respiratory and adverse symptoms will be recorded
      with patient diaries. The potential serious adverse events (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid leak,
      orbital complications) related to surgery will be collected from the medical records.
