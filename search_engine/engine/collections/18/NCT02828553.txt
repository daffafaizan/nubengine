      half of a day, decrease the percentage of patients being discharged to an extended nursing
      care facility, and improve quality of life for the patient. Fiscal year 2014 the average
      length of stay for a CHF patient at Lancaster General Health was 6.0, and as of fiscal year
      2015 this was decreased to 5.8. According to Harlan M Krumbholz's theory of post hospital
      syndrome, patients are subjected to a time of increased risk of impaired stamina,
      coordination, strength and readmission for about thirty days after discharge due to
      deconditioning during their hospitalization. By implementing the ambulatory study, the hope
      is to prevent such extensive deconditioning to help improve the patient's quality of life
      after discharge; thereby reducing length of stay, discharges to skilled nursing facilities,
      30 day readmissions and costs.

      The advent of wearable activity and/or health monitors in the health and fitness industry
      segment has the potential to revolutionize the industry. More importantly, these devices
      allow new variables to be collected to provide an impact on patients' care and outcome such
      as steps taken per day.

      The intention of the ambulation study is to prevent hospital acquired deconditioning; which
      in turn would not only decrease the length of stay, but also improve the discharge
      disposition and place them at home rather than hospice, an extended care facility or rehab.
      Not only is the intent of the study to decrease the length of stay and also improve the
      patient's disposition, but also improve their quality of life. In addition, the study will
      test the effectiveness of the addition of a mobility aide to assist with patients walking on
      the nursing units.
