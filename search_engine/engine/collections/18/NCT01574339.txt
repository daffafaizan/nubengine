      electrical stimulation to the LES and has completed two clinical feasibility studies using an
      external version of the EndoStim stimulation system in fifteen subjects. In these two
      short-term studies, electrical stimulation resulted in significant increases in LES pressure.

      This study will further evaluate the safety of the procedure and its feasibility for use in
      this group of patients.
