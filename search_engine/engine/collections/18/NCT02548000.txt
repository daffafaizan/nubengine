      as it is known to increase muscle mass and quality, strength, functional capacity, vascular
      health, and decrease inflammation status and blood lipids, besides leading to improves in
      glycemic control. To test this hypothesis, 42 diabetic patients will be recruited and
      randomized to two groups that will be evaluated before and after 12 weeks of both
      intervention or control period. The resistance training group will perform all body
      resistance exercises three times per week, while the control group will perform a stretching
      session one time per week.
