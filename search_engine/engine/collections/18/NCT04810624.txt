      little information about which treatment elements confer benefit. In this preliminary
      (preparation phase) trial, Relapse Prevention and Changing Habits (REACH+) targets the
      habitual control of maladaptive behavior to support patients with AN in the 6 months after
      acute treatment, a time of high vulnerability to relapse. Each component of REACH+ addresses
      a question that is critical to answer in order to identify and optimize a relapse prevention
      treatment package that balances efficacy and burden. We will test the acceptability and
      feasibility of 5 components that together target habits: 1) Behavioral, 2) Cognitive,
      3)Motivation, 4) Food Monitoring, and 5) Skill Consolidation.
