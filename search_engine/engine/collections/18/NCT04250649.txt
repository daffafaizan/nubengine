      with Betadine standard solution during primary shoulder surgery compared to electrosurgical
      dissection. They will randomize 105 patients on two arms. The control group receiving no
      disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue but a dissection with an electric cautery(A) and
      intervention group receiving a disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue (B). They believe that
      the duration of 4 years is sufficient to recruit the number of patients necessary for this
      study.

      All patients 18 years of age or older admitted to Valais Hospital for primary shoulder
      surgery and having signed the consent of the study will be eligible.

      The use of disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue during primary shoulder surgery could
      reduce contamination of the operating field and theoretically the post-operative infection
      rate after primary shoulder surgery.

      The study focuses on disinfection with Betadine solution of the subcutaneous tissue during
      primary shoulder surgery. This action could decrease contamination of the operating field and
      the infection rate after primary shoulder surgery.

      This solution is already widely used for disinfecting the skin and traumatic or surgical
      wounds.

      The investigators will use it according to the recommendations made in the Swiss Compendium
      of Medicines.

      No evidence has been brought to a decrease in this contamination if the dissection is carried
      out with an electric cautery. Scalpel dissection is used as standard in orthopedic surgery as
      well as in other surgical disciplines.
