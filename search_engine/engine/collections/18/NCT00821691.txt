      after stroke includes the treatment of acute stage in stroke unit, followed by rehabilitation
      program. However, most non fluent aphasic patients remain chronically handicapped despite of
      intensive logopedic training.

      The objective of this clinical project is to test the action of pharmacologic agents on
      verbal fluency of aphasic patients victims of cerebral infarctions. Only a few studies have
      been done with various pharmacologic agents, and although the results were not clearly
      conclusive, they were sufficiently positive for suggesting to launch a well controlled
      randomized cross-over study.

      Then the objective of study is to test the action of the amantadine, as DOPA-agonist, in a
      double blind cross-over trial, amantadine / placebo, on the verbal fluency of chronic post
      stroke aphasic patients.
