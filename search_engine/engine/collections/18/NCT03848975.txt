      situations encountered in the clinical practice during postgraduate training. This has some
      disadvantages like inequality of exposure to these situations, inadequate learning
      environment (emergencies, impossibility to repeat the maneuver, etc.) and risk complications
      related to the learner'slack of experience. To evaluate the benefit for learning external
      cephalic version (ECV) or vacuum assisted vaginal delivery (hereafter vacuum extraction
      [VE]), the investigators are conducting a multicentric randomized control trial composed by
      two parallel studies. Each group will represent the control group in relation to the maneuver
      to which it will not be trained.

      The objectives of the first one is to evaluate the impact of simulation training on the
      success of ECV, the complication rate, as well as the patient's and learner's satisfaction.
      The objectives of the second one is to evaluate the impact of simulation training on the
      success of VE, the complication rate, as well as the patient's and learner's satisfaction.

      The overall goal is to evaluate the effects on clinically relevant outcomes of the teaching
      by simulation in obstetrics. If simulation training improves the success rate of these
      maneuvers and the satisfaction of the patient and the learner, simulation learning will be
      included in a formal and systematic way during postgraduate training in obstetrics.

      The subjects are the resident doctors or consultants who have had no or few prior simulation
      training (maximum 1 session) and little clinical experience of the maneuver evaluated
      (maximum of 19 of each maneuver).
