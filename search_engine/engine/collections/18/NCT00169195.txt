    
      This is a multicentric, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, evaluating the efficacy
      and the safety of R-GEMOX in refractory/relapsed patients aged from 18 to 75 years with
      CD20-positive large B-cell lymphoma non eligible for autologous transplantation.

      It is anticipated that 50 subjects will be enrolled over 4 years (from April 2003/January
      2007), but inclusion could stop earlier according to the analysis performed every 5 patients
      (based on triangular test).

      The duration of the treatment period is approximately 16 weeks and patients are followed
      until death.

      The total duration of the study is expected to be 3 years.
