      childhood and neurodevelopmental features in later life. However, these studies are
      criticized for retrospective design, non homogenous population, social confounders, diversity
      of surgical procedures and anesthetic management.

      Monitoring of neurological function has become standard during surgical procedures at risk
      for neuronal injury (e.g. cardiac surgery). There is also some data on possible predictive
      value of certain methods of neuromonitoring (such as cerebral near infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS)) for neurodevelopmental outcome.

      General neonatal/infant surgery and the whole perioperative period carry the risk of
      significant physiologic disturbances, which may affect cerebral perfusion, oxygenation or
      metabolism. This study is the continuum of prospective observational trial, which
      investigated the value of the neuromonitoring measures in neonates and young infants
      undergoing general surgery. The present study will apply the behavioral assessment of these
      patients who are now between 2 and 5 years of age.
