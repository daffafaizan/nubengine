      associated infections carrying a 5 to 20-fold increase in the risk of developing sepsis.
      Research done in MRRH showed a post-surgery wound sepsis prevalence of 82% on all surgical
      wards in the hospital and the prevalence of post caesarean section wound infection at MRRH is
      15.5%. At MRRH, surgical site infections remain a substantial cause of morbidity, prolonged
      hospitalization and mortality. SSI is associated with a mortality rate of 3%, and 75% of SSI
      associated deaths are directly attributable to the SSIs. Universal practices like
      preoperative bathing of patients are currently not being practiced at MRRH and thus their
      impact on reducing the burden can only be speculated upon. The aim of this study was to
      assess the impact of preoperative bathing with chloroxylenol antiseptic on the incidence of
      post caesarean section surgical site infection.
