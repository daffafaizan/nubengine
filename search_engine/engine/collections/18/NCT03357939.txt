    
      This is a randomized, doubl-blinded, parellel-controlled phase 1 PK, safety, tolerability and
      immunogenicitiy study to compare HLX03, designed as an Adalimumab biosimilar, with China
      sourced Humira in Chinese health volunteers. All enrolled subjects will receive a single dose
      of HLX03 (40 mg）or Humira(adalimumab, 40 mg) in subcutaneous injectioin after randomization.

      The purpose of this study to prove the similarity in PK, Safety, tolerability and
      immunogenicity beween HLX03（adalimumab biosimilar） and China sourced Humira and provide
      evidence for Phase III comparison study.

      The blood will be collected before drug administration, and at 1 hr、4 hr、8 hr、24 hr (1d)、48
      hr (2d)、72 hr (3d)、96 hr (4d)、、144 hr (6d)、192 hr (8d)、240 hr (10d)、 336 hr (14d)、504 hr
      (21d)、672 hr (28d)、840 hr (35d)、1008 hr (42d)、1176 hr (49d)、1344 hr (56d)、1680 hr (70d) after
      drug injection for PK, ADA, etc analysis. All subjects also will be followed up at 0,
      1,2,3,4,6,8,10,14,21,28,35, 42, 49, 56, and 70 days after drug administration for AE and
      other specified outcomes.

      The main endpoint is AUC from time zero to ∞. The second endpoints include Cmax, Tmax, T1/2,
      CL, Vd and AUC（0-last）.

      This is single center study in China.
