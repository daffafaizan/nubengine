    
      Patients with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), ischemic (including those with hemorrhagic
      transformation), are given a new combination of medications which aims to improve neuronal
      survival, stimulate mitochondrial genesis and the formation of new synapses. This combination
      is given as an intravenous perfusion with a 2-hr duration and consists of vitamins B1, B6,
      B12, C, Actovegin, etc.

      Before treatment a NIHSS score is given. Each patient receives 3-4 such perfusions in 1 month
      and afterwards another NIHSS score is obtained.

      Patients are monitored afterwards and those who show improvements receive more such
      treatments, and new NIHSS and Barthel scores are obtained.

      Patients are grouped on the basis of the time interval between CVA occurence and first
      treatment:

        -  Group 1: 0-35 days

        -  Group 2: 36-100 days

        -  Group 3: 101-360 days Improvement of motor function is compared using NIHSS scores
           between groups, and between literature and groups
