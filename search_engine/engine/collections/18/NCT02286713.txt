      Institute to help heavy smokers make informed decisions about lung cancer screening with
      low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). The aim of this phase is to compare outcomes for
      promoting informed screening decisions about lung cancer screening in a randomized trial of
      patients who smoke recruited through state-based smoking cessation quitlines, where patients
      will be randomly assigned to the updated patient decision aid or to standard educational
      materials on lung cancer screening.
