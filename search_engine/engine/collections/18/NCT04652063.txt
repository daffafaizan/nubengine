      to the standard supportive care, will have improved neuromotor development scores on the
      TIMP.

      Specific Aims and Objectives:

      Primary aim: To determine the difference in TIMP scores between infants who receive OMM and
      those who receive only standard neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care.

      Secondary aims:

        -  To compare length of stay between infants who receive OMM and those who receive only
           standard NICU care.

        -  To compare growth parameters including weight, length, and head circumference, (both
           means and Z scores) prior to discharge between infants who receive OMM and those who
           receive only standard NICU care.

        -  To compare percentage of subjects requiring nasogastric, orogastric, or gastrostomy tube
           feeds at discharge between infants who receive OMM and those who receive only standard
           NICU care.
