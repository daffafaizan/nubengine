      parents. The age at which children start toilet training has increased during the last
      decades in the Western world. 50 years ago most children were out of nappies by 1,5 years of
      age. Today, wearing nappies by 3-4 years of age is considered normal. Meanwhile an increase
      in functional gastrointestinal and urinary tract disorders and toileting problems is reported
      by health care professionals.

      A randomized multicenter intervention study is conducted at Child Health Care Centers in
      Sweden to investigate whether assisted infant toilet training initiated during the first year
      of life can prevent functional bowel and bladder disorders.
