    
      Study Visits and Surgeries:

      You will be hospitalized 2-4 times for 1-5 days depending on your condition. If you agree to
      take part in this study, you will be scheduled for a skin-sparing mastectomy. The following
      tests and procedures will be performed:

      Pre-Operative Visit:

        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.

        -  The doctor will determine what type of reconstructive surgery can be done.

        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts. Your face, hair, or jewelry will not be
           photographed. These photos will be kept in a password-protected computer accessible only
           by the principle investigator and people directly involved in this study.

        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire. The questionnaire asks about how
           satisfied you are with your appearance. The questionnaire will be sent by email, US
           postal service mail, or in person when you come for your follow up visits. The
           questionnaire should take about 20 minutes to complete. If sent by US postal service,
           you will be given a postage-paid envelope to return the questionnaire.

      At your Mastectomy Surgery:

        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.

        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.

        -  During the surgery, a tissue expander will be placed in your breast. Sterile salt water
           will be added to inflate the expander and a small skin sample (about the size of a
           pencil eraser) from the breast will be taken to study stretching and scarring of the
           skin. The tissue will be securely maintained at MD Anderson.

        -  You will be monitored for any problems.

      Post-Operative Visit - 7 to 10 Days after Mastectomy Surgery:

        -  The study staff will look at the results of your surgery.

        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.

        -  You will complete the quality of life questionnaire.

        -  You will be asked about any problems you may be having.

      Deflation Visit - Week 5:

        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.

        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.

        -  The sterile salt water in the expander will be let out, causing the breast to go flat.
           This is done by inserting a needle into a special port and withdrawing the fluid with a
           syringe.

      Radiation Visit - Week 8:

        -  You must have radiation either at M. D. Anderson or an M. D. Anderson-affiliated site.

        -  Extra fluid may be added to the tissue expander before radiation.

        -  The study staff will look at the results of your surgery.

        -  You will be asked about any problems you may be having.

        -  You will receive radiation, typically 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

      Post-Radiation Visits - About Week 13 and every 2 to 4 Weeks after:

        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.

        -  The study staff will look at the results of your surgery.

        -  You will be asked about any problems you may be having.

        -  You will complete the quality of life questionnaire.

        -  Your expander will be re-inflated.

      Delayed-delayed Reconstruction Surgery - At about Week 23:

        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.

        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.

        -  During surgery, you will be monitored for any problems. A tissue sample will be
           collected to study stretching and scarring of the skin from the mastectomy incision and
           the tissue that is used to form the new breast. The tissue will be securely maintained
           at MD Anderson.

        -  During surgery, you will have tissue moved from your lower abdomen, back, or buttock to
           be used for reconstruction. A silicone or saline breast implant may or may not be used
           to help construct the breast. The amount of tissue used for building the breast will
           depend on your body size and donation site. Your reconstructive surgeon will discuss
           this with you before surgery.

        -  During surgery, the expander will be removed and reconstruction of your breast will
           occur.

      Follow-Up Surgery - At about Week 47:

        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.

        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.

        -  You will complete the quality of life questionnaire.

        -  During surgery, you will be monitored for any problems and a tissue sample will be
           collected.

        -  During this surgery, procedures will be done to improve the appearance of the breast.

      Long-Term Follow-Up Visits - At 6, 12, 24, and 36 Months:

        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.

        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.

        -  You will be asked about any problems you may be having.

        -  At Months 12 and 24, you will complete the quality of life questionnaire.

      This is an investigational study. The implants in this study have been FDA approved for skin
      expansion as a method of breast reconstruction. The use of the implants is investigational in
      this study.

      Up to 200 women will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
