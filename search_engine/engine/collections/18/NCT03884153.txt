      damaged tissue. This in turn activates the complement system and the cellular immune system
      engaging the unspecific immune system in an inflammatory tissue-degrading reaction. Such a
      pattern is observed in ischemic stroke, and elevated CRP levels can be measured in stroke
      survivors' sera. Several observational studies reproduced higher CRP levels with negative
      outcome in stroke. In another vascular model disease, myocardial infarction, selective CRP
      apheresis reduced infarct size in humans. The investigators therefore designed this pilot
      study to explore the effects of selective CRP reduction in ischemic stroke patients.
