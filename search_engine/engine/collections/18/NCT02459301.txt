      Although some types of chemotherapy may cause this cancer to shrink for a time, better
      options are needed. In laboratory tests and animals, IPH2201 has been shown to have effects
      which result in shrinkage of tumours. IPH2201 has been studied in people with rheumatoid
      arthritis but it has not yet been studied in people with cancer and the investigators do not
      know if it can offer better results than standard treatment.

      The standard or usual treatment for this disease could include surgery, chemotherapy or
      radiation.
