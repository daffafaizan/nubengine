      infarction caused by left main coronary artery occlusion is associated with significantly
      higher mortality and risks of major cardiac adverse events. Deferred stent implantation may
      improve prognosis of primary PCI through reducing distal embolization and no-reflow
      phenomenon. There is no randomized clinical trial focuses on the effect and outcome of
      deferred stent implantation on primary PCI for left main coronary artery occlusion in
      contrast with conventional strategy.

      This prospective, multicenter, randomized trial is aimed to compare immediate stenting with
      deferred stenting for LM-AMI with 30 centers in China involved. We hope to determine whether
      deferred stenting is superior to conventional strategy for primary PCI of AMI caused by left
      main coronary artery occlusion in improving long-term clinical outcomes and cardiac function.
