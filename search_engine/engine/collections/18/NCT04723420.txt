      (RRD). In our centre, PR is the most commonly performed procedure for primary RRD repair with
      a high retinal reattachment success rate. In this procedure, patients are required to
      position according to the site of pathology following injection of an intravitreal gas
      bubble. Some practitioners position the patient so that the gas bubble is immediately apposed
      directly against the retinal break (direct technique). Others favour the steamroller
      technique whereby the patient is initially positioned face down, then after 4-6 hours, the
      position is changed sequentially so that the bubble is rolled over the retina towards the
      break responsible for the detachment (steamroller technique). Variable visual acuity (VA)
      outcomes and metamorphopsia are common post-procedure complaints despite successful RRD
      repair with PR. It has been suggested that variability in functional outcomes may be
      associated with the timing and ease of reattachment of macula. The purpose of this
      prospective study is to evaluate whether the steamroller technique is superior to the direct
      technique in faster reattachment of macula with less macula displacement.
