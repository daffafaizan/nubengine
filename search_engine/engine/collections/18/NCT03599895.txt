      to try to print gastric cancer model and guide the operation. After obtaining the approval of
      the Hospital Ethics Committee, 20 patients with gastric cancer were collected for imaging
      examination and evaluation, and the normal physical model of 70% normal volume was printed
      with Guang Min resin material.The investigators will analyse the anatomical relationship
      between the tumor and surrounding tissues,and determine the range of tumor excision and the
      feasibility and safety of radical gastrectomy with Leonardo da Vinci robot for gastric
      cancer.Through the assistance of the 3D model,The investigators will select the suitable
      operation path to determine the extent of tumor excision and lymph node
      dissection.Furthermore, 3D print model is used to provide real-time navigation for key steps
      of surgery. The purpose of this research is to observe the application value of 3D printing
      technique in gastric cancer laparoscopic surgery with Leonardo da Vinci robot radical
      gastrectomy, and to provide reference for the development of 3D printing model of other
      complicated digestive tract surgery.
