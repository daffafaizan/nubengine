    
      In the experimental arm patients receive subcutaneous injections of TG4010 at the dose of 108
      pfu in combination with chemotherapy treatment whereas patients in the control arm receive
      chemotherapy alone. The chemotherapy associates cisplatin and gemcitabine and is given for up
      to 6 cycles or progressive disease, whichever occurs first.

      TG4010 is administered once per week for 6 weeks, then once every 3 weeks in combination with
      chemotherapy and thereafter as monotherapy until documentation of progressive disease.

      Tumor response will be evaluated every 6 weeks by a CT-scan and results will be available
      before starting an additional treatment period of 6 weeks. The tumor response taken into
      account will be for each patient the best overall response obtained during the study.

      The endpoint of the study is based on Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 months.
