      tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a prevalent aging-related disorder. Amyloid deposition in the
      tenosynovial tissue has been reported in ~35% of patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel
      syndrome.

      Otherwise, CTS has been shown to be the most common initial symptom of systemic wild-type
      transthyretin amyloidosis. The clinical significance of subclinical ATTRwt deposits in the
      heart in elderly patients has yet to be determined, but these deposits could contribute to
      the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. ATTRwt has been reported
      in ~15% of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Early detection of
      amyloid deposition in the transverse carpal ligament of patients with CTS could anticipate
      cardiac damage and progression to heart failure.The aim of this study is to determine the
      prevalence of transthyretin amyloidosis in pathology of the transverse carpal ligament and
      cardiac involvement using natriuretic peptides, electrocardiography and echocardiography in
      patients referred for carpal tunnel release surgery of idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome.
