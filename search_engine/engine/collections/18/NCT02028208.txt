    
      This is a single-center, double-blind, randomized study to compare the diagnostic performance
      (primary) and safety (secondary) of ascending doses of mercury, aluminum and palladium in 20
      adult subjects who have a clinical history of contact dermatitis and have had a past positive
      patch test to one of the allergens on this study. Investigators and subjects will be blinded
      to the exact location of each dose within the allergen panel but will not be blinded to the
      allergen being tested, nor the range of allergen doses within each panel.
