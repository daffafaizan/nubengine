    
      A correlational (non-experimental), longitudinal, prospective follow-up design will be used
      for descriptive and predictive purposes.

      The sample will consist of 150 subjects who meet the inclusion criteria, sign the informed
      consent and who will be treated during the year 2018 at the Hospital and the Clinic.

      The study will include three measurement times: Time 1, during the first 10 days of
      hospitalization (T1); Time 2, at 3 months after T1; and Time 3, at 12 months after T1.

      At each time of measurement, the study variables will be evaluated by 4 professionals trained
      in the following instruments: the Ashworth Scale to assess spasticity; To measure global
      functionality, the Barthel Index will be applied and, to assess functionality of the upper
      extremity, the Action Research Arm scale will be used; The Quality of Life Scale for
      Stroke-38 will be used to assess quality of life and emotional level. In addition, in time 1
      the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the sample will be evaluated through a
      clinical record prepared for this purpose.
