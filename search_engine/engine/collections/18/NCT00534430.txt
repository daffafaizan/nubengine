        -  To determine the efficacy of a preparative regimen comprising dose targeted busulfan,
           etoposide, and fractionated total-body irradiation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic
           stem cell or bone marrow transplantation in patients with advanced hematologic
           malignancies.

        -  To determine the efficacy of this regimen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in
           first remission with unfavorable cytogenetics.

        -  To evaluate the early and late toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative chemotherapy regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 2 hours once every 6
           hours on days -14 to -8 for a total of 16 doses and etoposide IV on day -3.* NOTE:
           *Patients also receive oral or IV dilantin 1-3 times daily on days -18 to -5 for
           prophylaxis of grand mal seizures.

        -  Fractionated total-body irradiation (FTBI): Patients undergo FTBI on days -7 to -4 for a
           total of 10 fractions.

        -  Allogeneic transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation or bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally
           on days -1 to 50 followed by a taper to day 180 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also
           receive mycophenolate mofetil orally or IV over 2 hours twice daily on days 0-27,
           followed by a taper until day 56.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually for 2 years.
