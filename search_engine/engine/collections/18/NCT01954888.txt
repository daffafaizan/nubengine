      in producing a greater than 1.5 degree Celsius rise in ipsilateral arm temperature after a
      stellate ganglion block.

      Blocks will both be performed with 10 mL of xylocaine/bupivacaine. Secondary outcomes will be
      the impact of the approach (blind vs ultrasound) on pain reduction, horner syndrome, side
      effects (hoarseness, dysphagia, pharyngeal discomfort) and complications (blood aspiration,
      intravascular injection).
