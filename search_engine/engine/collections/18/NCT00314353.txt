      seen an increased use of the combinations of capecitabine with oxaliplatin (CAPOX) and
      capecitabine with irinotecan (CAPIRI). Given the data documenting the improved efficacy for
      5-FU based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab, it is important to investigate the
      potential advantages of adding this agent to regimens containing capecitabine.
