      Primary outcomes To compare progression free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR)
      in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer receiving Bifico versus placebo
      plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy for first-line treatment.

      Secondary outcomes To compare overall survival (OS) between the two arms； To evaluate the
      nature, severity, and frequency of toxicities between arms； To correlate the blood markers
      and fecal microbiome (at diagnosis) with outcomes and response.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients are
      stratified according to center, performance status (0 or 1), tobacco use (never vs past or
      present), weight loss (< 5% vs ≥ 5% or unknown). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      BIFICO Group: Patients receive Bifico (420mg, 3 times a day, p.o) plus platinum-based doublet
      chemotherapy. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Placebo Group: Patients receive placebo (420mg, 3 times a day, p.o) plus platinum-based
      doublet chemotherapy. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood, tissue and fecal samples are collected and examined for biomarkers, gene mutations and
      fecal microbiome, and may be banked for future studies.
