      gut microbiome, which plays a central role in health and disease. Childhood obesity is an
      epidemic and animal models have linked antibiotic induced changes in the microbiome with
      increased adiposity. Infants become colonized with trillions of bacteria in the first few
      hours of life. During this time period, their nascent immune system develops tolerance to
      commensal microbes

      The primary objectives are to measure the impact of common perinatal and early childhood
      antibiotic exposures on the structure and function of the developing gut microbiome. To
      determine the association between common perinatal and early childhood antibiotic exposures
      and weight/adiposity gain in a large birth cohort of children. To determine mechanisms for
      the association between microbiome changes over time and the rate of weight/adiposity gain in
      a large birth cohort of children. To determine the normal developmental pattern by which
      healthy children develop antibodies in their blood against the microbes that naturally
      colonize their intestines. To determine the association between immunostimulation and
      protection from persistent colonization in humans.
