      to environmental cues associated with smoking behavior. This pilot study is designed to
      increase understanding of the neural circuitry underlying these differences. In the proposed
      study, adult male and female (10 per group) treatment-seeking nicotine-dependent individuals
      will participate in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the presentation of
      smoking-related cues under three conditions during a seven day period: baseline, after NRT,
      and after denicotinized cigarette facilitated-extinction. After baseline scanning, subjects
      will receive three days of 21 mg nicotine patch. Scanning procedures will be repeated on day
      3. Subjects will then receive denicotinized cigarettes for ad lib smoking on days three
      through seven. Subjects will be asked to remain abstinent throughout the study period and
      they will be assessed daily with self-report, Carbon Monoxide (CO) monitor and for nicotine
      withdrawal.
