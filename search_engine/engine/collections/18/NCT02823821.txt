    
      RESOLVE is a pragmatic, cluster-randomised, open-label trial designed to evaluate in
      real-world conditions the comparative effectiveness of two default dialysate sodium
      concentrations.

      Dialysis sites will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to a default dialysate sodium concentration
      of 137mmol/l or 140mmol/l. 'Default' is defined as the use of the allocated dialysate sodium
      for â‰¥ 90% of delivered dialysis sessions in the unit. All other care will be according to
      standard local practices as determined by the site.

      Outcomes will be assessed on individual patients dialysing at those sites. Sites will be
      asked to consent to participation while waiver or opt-out consent will be sought for
      individual patients.

      It is anticipated that site accrual will occur over 2-5 years with average study duration
      expected to be approximately 5 years. The actual length of the study will be end-point
      determined.

      The study will involve a staged roll-out. The initial Development Phase will ascertain the
      feasibility of implementing the study protocol. The vanguard phase will continue to implement
      the protocol and allow testing of study assumptions. The main phase will conclude the study.
