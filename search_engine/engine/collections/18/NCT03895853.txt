      I. To assess the efficacy of administering early metabolic resuscitation with standard of
      care (SC + EMR) in patients diagnosed with septic shock for reducing 28-day mortality versus
      using the standard of care alone (SC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether early metabolic resuscitation with standard of care (SC + EMR) is an
      effective strategy to reduce intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, hospital mortality, and
      90-day mortality of septic shock patients relative to SC.

      II. To compare the time to death from any cause between patients administered SC + EMR versus
      SC after being diagnosed with septic shock.

      III. To assess whether SC + EMR is an effective strategy to reduce complications of septic
      shock such as: i) acute kidney injury, ii) dialysis requirements, iii) need for
      cardiovascular support or days on vasopressors, iv) need for invasive ventilation, days on
      ventilator support, v) duration of ICU stay, and vi) duration of hospital stay versus SC.

      IV. To describe the presence of any adverse effects between the two study groups (SC + EMR
      group versus [vs] SC group); thus, characterizing their safety.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive standard of care for septic shock.

      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care treatment for septic shock and early metabolic
      resuscitation (IV) over continuous infusion for up to 7 days.
