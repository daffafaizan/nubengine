      This is a monocentric open label explorative study (with primary objective to assess the
      predictive value of daily steps for MACE). Patients will be asked to wear an activity tracker
      for two weeks following hospital discharge. Patients who participate in any form of CR in our
      institution and attend the routine check-up 12 month after PCI in our institution will be
      asked to wear the activity tracker again for two weeks.

      Study intervention

      Patients will be informed about the study by the prevention team (advanced nurse
      practitioners) usually on the day of discharge from PCI during the routine visit by this team
      to inform patients about the different options of CR. Patients will be provided with an
      activity tracker in the form of a wrist band, the patient information sheet including
      informed consent (IC), the International Physical Activity Questionnaires Short-Form
      (IPAQ-SF) and an addressed and prepaid envelope. They are asked to read the patient
      information when arrived at home, sign the IC when willing to participate and wear the wrist
      band continuously for two weeks after hospital discharge. After that, they should send the
      wrist band, the filled in IPAQ-SF and signed IC in the provided envelope to our institute. If
      they are unwilling to participate, they can send the activity tracker back straight away.
      Patients attending the clinical routine check-up after 12 months in our institution will be
      asked to wear the activity tracker again for two weeks.
