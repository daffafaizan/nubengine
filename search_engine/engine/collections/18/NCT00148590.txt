      treatment for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction and negative symptomatology in patients
      with acute schizophrenia. The trail is double-blind, prospective, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group and consisting of a 'placebo-run-in' period, treatment,
      and follow-up periods. Study personnel and participants were blinded to group assignment. In
      the 'run-in' period, patients received Lorazepam for the treatment of anxiety and tension
      states for two weeks before starting antipsychotic therapy. After the 'run-in' period
      treatment, patients began receiving antipsychotic therapy with Risperidon with continuous
      concomitant administration of Memantine, 20 mg/d, or placebo for six weeks. Adherence was
      assessed at each clinic visit by pill count. In cases of anxiety and tension states, an
      experienced psychiatrist decided whether patients should receive Lorazepam, 5 mg/d, as rescue
      medication in addition to the study medication (Memantine or placebo), to which the patients
      remained blinded. In cases of pseudo parkinsonism patients were allowed to receive Biperiden,
      up to 8 mg/d, and for the treatment of patients suffering from sleep disorders Zopiclon (15
      mg/d) was allowed. The consumption of alcohol and drugs were not allowed during the trial. In
      both study parts, psychiatric assessments were performed at baseline as well as after 2; 4;
      6; 12 and 24 weeks after treatment (that is, during the follow-up period). The
      neuropsychological examination was performed at baseline, and after 6 and 24 weeks.
      Psychiatric changes, adverse events, laboratory values, dose adjustments of the antipsychotic
      therapy, and possible pharmacologic adverse effects were systematically monitored throughout
      the study.
