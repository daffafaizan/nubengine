      I. Determine the efficacy of SGN-00101, in terms of complete histologic regression, in
      patients with grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine change in lesion size in these patients after treatment with this drug.

      II. Compare histologic response before and after treatment with this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously once on weeks 1, 4, and 8 in the absence of
      disease progression.

      Arm II: Patients receive standard care.

      At week 15, all patients undergo large loop excision of the transformation zone under
      colposcopy.

      Patients are followed at 19 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-84 patients (14-42 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 12-48 months.
