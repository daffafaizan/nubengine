    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxicities, response rate, and duration of response associated with
      high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carmustine or high-dose cyclophosphamide and
      total-body irradiation followed by autologous, allogeneic, or syngeneic bone marrow
      transplant in patients with refractory or high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's
      disease, or multiple myeloma. II. Evaluate any prognostic factors.

      OUTLINE: Patients with prior radiotherapy (greater than 2,000 cGy) receive cyclophosphamide
      IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over at least 30 minutes on days -7 through -4 followed by
      carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -3. Patients receive allogeneic or autologous bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0. Patients with or without prior radiotherapy (less than 2,000 cGy)
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -8 through -5 followed by total body
      irradiation on days -4 through -1. Patients receive allogeneic or autologous bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0. Prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation and following
      myeloablative chemotherapy, patients undergo mobilization consisting of cytarabine
      subcutaneously every 12 hours for 6 doses. Approximately 24 hours later, patients receive
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously. Peripheral blood stem cells are collected every 1-3
      days beginning when blood counts recover and continuing until sufficient number of cells are
      reached.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
