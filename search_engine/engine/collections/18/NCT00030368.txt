      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when given in combination with
      paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 2 and 9 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8.
      For the first course only, patients do not receive paclitaxel on day 1. Courses repeat every
      3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity or greater than 80% 20S proteasome
      inhibition. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6-9 patients are accrued and treated at
      that dose.

      Patients are followed at 21 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
