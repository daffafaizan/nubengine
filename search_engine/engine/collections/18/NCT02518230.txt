      neonates and infants who are determined to be on stable ventilator settings in either the
      NAVA or SIMV(PC) + PS modes. This design will allow for direct comparison of two commonly
      used ventilator modalities in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine if one
      mode is superior to the other with regards to respiratory mechanics and energy expenditure.

      Infants will be screened for stability criteria including: being stable on the ventilator in
      either SIMV (PC) + PS or NAVA mode, on weaning or unchanged ventilatory support in previous
      12 hours, and no need of escalation of ventilatory pressure or rate in prior 12 hours.

      After screening criteria is met and consent has been obtained, data will be retrospectively
      collected for 12 hours prior to randomization. After the subject is randomized, the infant
      will be stabilized and data will be collected for 12 hours in the randomized mode. Data will
      then be collected for 12 hours afterwards in the crossover mode. Data will be collected in
      areas of patient demographics, diagnoses, indications for mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic
      variables and respiratory parameters. While in each mode, the patient will also have indirect
      calorimetry obtained to determine estimated energy expenditure of each mode.
