      imaging (CMR), is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with ischemic heart disease or
      cardiomyopathy. But the prognostic relevance of isolated non-ischemic LGE (i.e. with no
      underlying "labelled" cardiomyopathy) is unclear, and current guidelines do not state on the
      clearance of athlete with this type of findings as regards to competitive or intense sport
      practice.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of athletes with isolated
      non-ischemic LGE with no underlying "labelled" cardiomyopathy during a five-years follow-up.
      The secondary objective is the determination of prognostic factors based on the baseline
      inclusion data: indication of CMR (i.e. symptoms, abnormal ECG, presence and morphology of
      arrhythmias, abnormal echocardiography); localization and amount of LGE, left and right
      ventricular geometry and function, characteristics of sport practice (amount, type,
      competition).

      The management of the athletes will be let at the appraisal of each centre, as regards to the
      initial assessment, the follow-up and the medical clearance for competitive sports
      participation. Nevertheless, due to the absence of consensus, we propose that the patient
      should at least undergo clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise
      test (CPET) and holter ECG each year. A CMR should be performed at one and five years.
