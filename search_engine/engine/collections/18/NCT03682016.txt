      known about two thirds of diabetic patients died from these complication .Numerous
      epidemiological studies demonstrate that DM is commonly accompanied with hypertension and
      patients with diabetes and hypertension have higher renal and cardiovascular risks compared
      with those with either hypertension or diabetes. Therefore, better evaluating and managing BP
      in diabetic patients with hypertension is clinically relevant.

      Hypertension also is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and all-cause
      mortality . Numerous randomized controlled trials using antihypertensive drugs and
      meta-analysis demonstrate that lowering peripheral blood pressure (BP) is beneficial for
      reducing cardiovascular and renal events.

      In recent decades, some observational studies suggest that peripheral BP measured by brachial
      artery may not necessarily represent BP measured in the aortic artery which is known as
      central BP.

      In addition, some clinical trials also revealed that despite with comparable peripheral BP,
      patients with high central BP had significantly higher cardiovascular risk compared with
      those with low central BP indicating that central BP might be an independent predictor for
      CVD
