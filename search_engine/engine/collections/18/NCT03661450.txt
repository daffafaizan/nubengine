      supporting decision-making processes. Although many approaches for designing CDSS have been
      proposed, due to high implementation costs, as well as the lack of interoperability features,
      current solutions are not wellestablished across different institutions. Recently, the use of
      standardized formalisms for knowledge representation as terminologies as well as the
      integration of semantically enriched clinical information models, as openEHR Archetypes, and
      their reuse within CDSS are theoretically considered as key factors for reusable CDSS. The
      investigators already successfully transferred their concept into a prototype and evaluated
      the practicability on clinical data sets and in close cooperation between the clinicians and
      the technical experts. To the author's knowledge, currently, there are no openEHR based CDSS
      approaches which have been implemented and evaluated with such complex and important clinical
      contexts. Hence, the first clinically evaluated CDSS based on openEHR was successfully
      designed. When enhancing the described approach and implementing a live system, it might
      support clinicians to identify the patient's course of disease at an early stage, which can
      lead to better outcome for the patient. Furthermore, the system can serve as a basis for
      integrating (cross-institutional) machine learning components that could facilitate dealing
      with other high-complex decision problems or revealing yet unknown disease patterns.
