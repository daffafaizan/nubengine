    
      A number of epidemiological studies, systematic reviews, and consensus reports highlight the
      importance of non-pharmacological, sociobehavioural interventions to address the health,
      psychological, and social effects of caregiving for persons living with dementia, and the
      need for tangible information and resources.

      The investigators will conduct a hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial intended to address
      these gaps by testing the efficacy-effectiveness of two multi-family group interventions, and
      on 250 English-speaking adults: Savvy Caregiver Expressâ„¢ (3-session, newly piloted in Los
      Angeles County for feasibility) and Savvy Caregiver Program (original 6-session
      evidenced-based intervention), across post-intervention, 3- and 6-months. It is hypothesized
      that no differences (comparable effects) between the programs in their efficacy/effectiveness
      and moderating conditions.

      Focus groups (~25 participants) will be conducted to ascertain program acceptability and
      satisfaction.

      The analyses will include a multiple linear mixed-effects modeling for our trial outcomes,
      and thematic analyses for our focus group interview data.
