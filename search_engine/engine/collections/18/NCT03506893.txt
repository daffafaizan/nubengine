      cirrhotic patient. To date, its treatment consists of evacuating punctures, performed in day
      hospitalisation, whose frequency is adapted to the rate of ascites synthetis. Paracentesis,
      which does not affect the mechanisms of ascites formation, contributes to protein catabolism
      and undernutrition. They also have an inconvenience linked to the gesture, making frequent
      hospital stays necessary. For all these reasons, the patient's quality of life is diminished.
      The AlfapumpÂ® system is a new method for the treatment of refractory ascites. It is a
      completely internalized medical device, implanted under the skin, which mobilizes ascites
      from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder, where ascites is eliminated by urinary tract.
