      effect of new chemical entities on ECG parameters with focus on cardiac repolarization as
      measured by the QTc duration. Though many Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials may be conducted they
      usually have insufficient sample size, infrequent sampling of ECG data, or the use of
      inadequate controls to overcome the high rate of spontaneous change in QTc duration. This has
      resulted in regulatory guidance recommending a dedicated or thorough trial to define the ECG
      effects of new drugs.

      This study will be conducted in healthy volunteers to eliminate variables known to have an
      effect on ECG parameters (concomitant drugs, diseases, etc.). A supra-therapeutic dose of
      fedovapagon is required to mimic the exposure in healthy volunteers that may occur in the
      target population under the worst of circumstances (e.g., concomitant use of CYP3A4
      inhibitor, concomitant liver disease, presence of heart disease, taking more than the
      clinical dose prescribed, etc.) and to allow for PK to QTc modeling to assess the effect of
      drug concentration on cardiac repolarization.

      A cross-over trial is the preferred design as subjects act as their own controls and since
      there is no accumulation of any clinical relevance and the plasma concentration of parent
      dissipates before 24 hours, a single dose trial will be employed. During the course of the
      study each subject will be administered fedovapagon at both a clinical and supra-therapeutic
      dose, placebo and moxifloxacin (as a positive control).

      The sample size is driven by the need to do a time-matched statistical analysis on the
      primary endpoint as per ICH E14 guidance.
