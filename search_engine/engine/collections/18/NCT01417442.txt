      V600E mutation is the most common genetic alteration identified in PTC, ranging from 25 to
      80%, with the average rate about 45%. Various studies demonstrated a relationship between
      BRAF V600E mutation and aggressive characteristics of the cancer, including the worse patient
      prognosis. But,there are no studies from Turkey regarding this topic. So the investigators
      will examine BRAF V600E mutation in our patients with PTC and try to assess the role of this
      mutation in prognosis and further management of the patients.
