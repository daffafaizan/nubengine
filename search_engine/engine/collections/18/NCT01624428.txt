      influence of varenicline on reward processing, cognitive control, and regulation of craving
      in adolescent smokers. We hypothesize that adolescent smokers receiving varenicline, when
      compared with those receiving placebo, will have increased activation of the ventral striatum
      (VS) in response to anticipation of rewards in the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT),
      decreased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during exposure to
      incongruent stimuli in the Stroop task, and reduced activation of the ventral striatum in
      response to tobacco cues, and increased activation of the dlPFC during regulation of
      responses to tobacco cues during the Regulation of Craving (ROC) task. The results of this
      pilot project will have important implications regarding the use of varenicline for treating
      tobacco dependence and understanding varenicline's neurobiological effects in adolescent
      smokers.
