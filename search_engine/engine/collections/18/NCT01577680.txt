      treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This study will assess the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of inhaled GSK573719/ vilanterol (VI) and GSK573719 in healthy
      subjects and in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. Nine subjects with moderate
      hepatic impairment will be recruited, together with nine matched healthy volunteers.

      There is a possibility that when used by patients with impaired hepatic function the
      pharmacokinetics of inhaled GSK573719 or GSK572719/VI may be altered. The results of this
      study will therefore provide guidance on the use of GSK573719 and GSK573719/VI in moderate
      hepatically impaired patients.
