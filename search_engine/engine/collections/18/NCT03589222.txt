    
      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, open, non-randomized, multicenter study of the SINEâ„¢ compound
      selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone, in combination with bortezomib and daratumumab.

      Sixty-two patients with R/R MM who meet eligibility criteria and have none of the exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled to receive SVDd until either disease progression or intolerance has
      occurred.

      Enrolled patients will take a fixed milligram dose of 100 mg selinexor (on days 1, 8, 15 and
      22), plus 40 mg dexamethasone (20 mg IV the day of daratumumab and selinexor and 20 mg oral
      administration the day after daratumumab and selinexor) both weekly as continuous therapy.

      Bortezomib will be given via subcutaneous at dose of 1.3 mg/m2 once weekly on days 1, 8, 15
      and 22 during the cycles 1 to cycle 8, and on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle thereafter as
      continuous therapy.

      Daratumumab will be given via intravenous at dose of 16 mg/Kg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22
      (weekly) during the cycles 1 and 2, every two weeks (on days 1 and 15) during the cycles 3 to
      6 and on day 1 of each cycle thereafter as continuous therapy.

      Patients may continue indefinitely and there is no maximum treatment duration
