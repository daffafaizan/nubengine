    
      Oxazyme is an oxalate degrading compound that can potentially degrade food-borne oxalate and
      hence prevent its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.

      We propose a 20-patient open-label trial pilot study of one month of Oxazyme twice daily (1gm
      Oxazyme sachet dissolved in 150 ml water) among adult subjects with a history of calcium
      oxalate nephrolithiasis. Patients will be stratified into those with enteric hyperoxaluria
      after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB, n=10) and those with idiopathic hyperoxaluria (n=10).
      The patients will perform two, 24-hour, urine collections immediately before starting Oxazyme
      and on the last two days of the treatment period.
