      procedure compared to other endoscopic procedures. Most ERCP procedure had been performed in
      sedation using tranquilizers and pain-killers.

      Until recently, midazolam and opioid combination regimen recognized as a standard therapy is
      widely used, but the sedative effect is insufficient and intermittent paradoxical reaction
      has been questioned. Another drug, such as propofol, has been known that the sedative effect
      is superior one of the midazolam but disappointed due to narrow therapeutic range of
      respiratory distress and absence of antagonist. Meanwhile, recently up-coming drug, etomidate
      which is a modulator of GABA-A receptor has been known that it maintains the appropriate
      sedative levels and affects little effects on respiratory system.

      For these advantages, this short acting sedative drug has been widely used in the emergency
      room during minor operation and in the operation room for induction. However, research on the
      efficacy during ERCP was not yet published.

      In this regards, the purpose of the investigators study is to prove the efficacy of etomidate
      for sedation and to establish new evidence based sedation guidelines during ERCP procedure.
