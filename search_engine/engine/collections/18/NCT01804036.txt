      reduced performance of military duties. Under extreme conditions, army personnel could
      endanger themselves and their comrades. Increasingly, non-pharmacological treatments for
      insomnia are showing promise as complementary and alternative medicine treatments. Many of
      these awareness training programs (ATPs) perform as well as, or even better than,
      medications. This study will determine whether Mind-Body Bridging (MBB), an ATP that teaches
      awareness/mindfulness and cognitive skills, is more effective than a common sleep medication,
      Zolpidem. The study will also determine whether MBB exhibits additional benefits in co-morbid
      mental health conditions, including, stress, PTSD, depression, etc, compared with that of
      Zolpidem. This will offer soldiers additional treatment options for insomnia in the hope that
      it will improve both sleep and other common comorbidities.
