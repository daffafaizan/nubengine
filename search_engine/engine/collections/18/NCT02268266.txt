      sensorimotor stimulation are key factors for therapeutic success. Early activation and
      stimulation of the patient intend enhancement of neuroplasticity and recovery. Furthermore,
      it improves the patient's communication and cooperation skills and counteracts secondary
      damages due to immobilization.

      The study combines gradual verticalization during monitoring of vital parameters, with cyclic
      leg movement and foot loading. The table to ensures the necessary safety for the
      stabilization of the patient in the upright position. The patient stimulation is additionally
      enhanced by synchronized functional electrical stimulation (FES). By providing a safe
      solution for early mobilization, the Erigo counteracts the negative effects of immobility and
      accelerates the recovery process through intensive sensorimotor stimulation. It is the first
      choice therapy device for the early and safe mobilization of severely impaired, bed-ridden
      patients even in acute care.
