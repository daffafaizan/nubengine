      obesity and their associated adverse impact on health. The lack of a proven intervention may
      deter health professionals in primary care from providing support to their overweight
      patients as few obese people recall receiving weight control advice from a health
      professional.

      In this study we aim to conduct a large scale randomised controlled trial to assess the
      effectiveness of a longer-term structured lifestyle support programme provided by a research
      nurse and the provision of pedometers compared to usual care in overweight/ obese adults who
      wish to lose weight. We will assess the degree of weight loss over a period of 12 months as
      well as related factors such as changes in waist circumference, quality of life and
      cost-effectiveness of the interventions.

      The research is highly relevant to policy making at both national and local levels.
