    
      This study aims to characterize the SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in convalescent individuals.

      The observational cohort study will include 3 groups, as described in the table below.

      Participants will complete a minimum of one visit (1-8 weeks post resolution of COVID-19 OR
      2-10 weeks post most recent positive SARS-CoV-2 test, if asymptomatic) and optional visits
      approximately 2 months, 4 months, and 1 year later. Participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2
      infection at an optional follow-up visit may be contacted more frequently. Additional follow
      up visit(s) may be added over time in response to evolving information regarding SARS-CoV-2
      infection and COVID-19.

      Study visits may include physical examinations, medical history, questionnaires, pregnancy
      tests (for participants assigned female at birth), blood draws, optional nasal samples, and
      optional HIV testing.
