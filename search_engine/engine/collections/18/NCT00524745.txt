      Primary objective:

      To test the hypothesis that Gardasil® vaccine, when administered to girls 11-13 years of age
      according to 1 of 3 alternative 3-dose schedules (0,3,9 months; 0,6,12 months; or 0,12,24
      months), results in anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 responses 28 days post-dose 3 that are
      similar to those obtained when the vaccine is administered on the standard 3-dose schedule of
      0,2,6 months.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To test the hypothesis that Gardasil® vaccine, when administered to girls 11-13 years of
           age according to 1 of 3 alternative 3-dose schedules (0,3,9 months; 0,6,12 months; or
           0,12,24 months), results in anti-HPV 6 and anti-HPV 11 responses 28 days post-dose 3
           that are similar to those obtained when the vaccine is administered on the standard
           3-dose schedule of 0,2,6 months.

        2. To describe the safety profile of the administration of Gardasil® according to each of
           the four schedules by assessing:

           (i) immediate reactogenicity (reactions within 30 minutes after each injection); (ii)
           solicited (local reactogenicity and fever) and unsolicited events occurring during the
           first 7 days following each vaccination; (iii) serious adverse events occurring up to
           one month following the last dose of vaccine; (iv) deaths or adverse events occurring at
           any time determined to be vaccination-related.
