      less treatment, and resistance to treatment. Advanced patients have shorter survival than
      other subtypes. Maintenance therapy after combination chemotherapy can prolong the disease
      control time in patients with advanced TNBC. How to prolong the disease control time of
      patients with advanced TNBC without affecting the quality of life has become the focus of
      current research.

      Anti-angiogenic drugs are currently one of the few targeted therapies that have achieved some
      efficacy in TNBC. Apatinib, a targeted inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), shows
      significant antitumor activity in the patients with breast cancer. The results of this study
      will help explore the new treatment of small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs for TNBC
      maintenance therapy, and provide some new ideas for improving individualized treatment
      options for patients with advanced TNBC.
