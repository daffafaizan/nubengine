      on demographic statistics, medical history,physical examination and fasting blood sample will
      be collected for all patients. Adipose tissue of adults will be collected from different
      regions, such as cervical, perirenal, along the large blood vessels and trachea, because they
      are included in the range of surgical therapy and are the major locations of BAT. Adipose
      tissue samples will be used to immunohistochemical stain, to detect the expression of BAT
      related genes.
