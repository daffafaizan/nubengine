      versus placebo for adjunctive pain control in the setting of oocyte retrieval in an in vitro
      fertilization clinic setting.

      HYPOTHESIS: Our hypothesis is that patients receiving IV acetaminophen pre-operatively will
      have improved postoperative pain scores, lower overall opiate consumption, and shortened time
      to discharge from PACU than those receiving PO acetaminophen or placebo.

      Participants will be consented and enrolled in the study prior to their oocyte retrieval. The
      patient will then be randomized to one of three treatments:

      Group 1: In the pre-op suite, these patients will receive 1000mg IV acetaminophen and PO
      placebo, followed by standard protocol anesthesia and pain control as needed.

      Group 2: In the pre-op suite, these patients will receive 1000mg PO acetaminophen and IV
      placebo, followed by standard protocol anesthesia and pain control as needed.

      Group 3:

      In the pre-op suite, these patients will receive PO and IV placebo, followed by standard
      protocol anesthesia and pain control as needed.

      The patient and care team will be blinded to the treatment group.

      A member of the study staff will review participants' medical record to collect data
      regarding demographics, clinical history, cycle and pregnancy outcomes, up to 12 months
      following study completion.
