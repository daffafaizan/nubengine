      thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement in order to detect recurrence. Classically, withdrawal from
      levothyroxine (L-T4) during 4-6 weeks is needed for TSH elevation (> 30mUI/L), to allow
      iodine uptake and Tg production. As a result, patients become hypothyroid with impaired
      quality of life and a potential for tumour flare-up. Recombinant hTSH before WBS prevents
      hypothyroidism but is not yet approved for radioiodine treatment and is an expensive therapy.
      L-T3 substitution during the first 2-3 weeks of withdrawal is an alternative used empirically
      to prepare patients; however, no data exists to prove its benefit upon reducing
      hypothyroidism.

      Objectives: 1) To compare the hypothyroid state in patients prepared either by placebo or
      L-T3 following L-T4 withdrawal. 2) To evaluate the time needed for TSH elevation (> 30 mUI/L)
      on placebo vs. L-T3.

      Method: At the time of L-T4 withdrawal or after thyroidectomy, patients with DTC awaiting WBS
      or radioiodine treatment were randomized in two groups (double-blind): L-T3 (50 mg qd) or an
      identical placebo for 3 weeks, after which treatment was stopped for 2 weeks. A validated
      questionnaire of signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism (Billewicz's scale) was administered
      every 2 weeks until the WBS. TSH, fT4 and fT3 were measured weekly.
