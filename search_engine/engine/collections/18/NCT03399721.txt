      with non-allergic rhinitis will receive intranasal stimulation with the Chordate System at
      two occasions. Objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of the procedure in reducing disease
      specific symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching and sneezing, but also
      to investigate the influence on quality of life, safety and tolerability.
