      Stimulation (iTBS) in order to maximize the effects coming from each of the techniques on
      their own. A group of 74 healthy participants wil be submitted to two different stimulation
      protocols (sham tDCS + active iTBS and active tDCS + active iTBS) with one-week in between
      and results on stress reactivity will be examined. In order to improve therapeutic protocols,
      this study with healthy participants is a crucial first step in order to further conduct
      clinical studies with psychiatric samples.
