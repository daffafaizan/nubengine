      1 and 2), one of the contact-free devices will be used to monitor the HR and RR, while being
      compared with the Patient Monitor. The RHEA investigational device and reference device will
      be used to monitor the same subject at different times, as the sensors of the two devices are
      placed at a similar location of the bed. HR and RR will be recorded for all three devices.

      The primary hypotheses for HR, are as follows:

      Adults HO: μ = 3.25 vs. HA: μ < 3.25

      The primary hypotheses for RR, are as follows:

      Adults HO: μ = 2.25 vs. HA: μ < 2.25 where μ represents the population mean HR or RR. If the
      upper bound of the confidence interval is less than the hypothesized value, the corresponding
      null hypothesis will be rejected. Comparison of the performance of the two contract-free
      devices will be performed on the recorded results via statistical analysis. The hypothesis
      here is that the two devices have equivalent performance. The third test will assess the
      ability of the RHEA device to accurately detect motion in or exit from the bed, as compared
      to the manual observation. Motion and no motion accuracy will each be calculated along with
      their respective two-sided 95% confidence intervals.
