      multifactorial. Available treatment options for this disease process are limited and have
      achieved moderate success at best. Unlike conventional intravenous fat emulsions, Omegaven™
      is comprised solely of fish oils containing primarily omega-3 fatty acids. The investigators
      hypothesize that administering Omegaven™ to patients with PNALD in place of conventional fat
      emulsion may reverse cholestasis allowing patients to be maintained on adequate PN until they
      are able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally.
