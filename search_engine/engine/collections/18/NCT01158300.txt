      Primary

        -  To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of VEGF
           inhibitor PTC299 (PTC299) in pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive primary
           central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

        -  To evaluate and characterize the adverse events associated with this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate and characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen
           in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To investigate the relationships between PTC299 plasma exposure and other outcomes
           measures.

        -  To evaluate the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate changes in angiogenic and inflammatory markers in the blood and the
           relationship between these changes and other outcome measures.

        -  To obtain preliminary evidence of biologic activity of PTC299 by using magnetic
           resonance diffusion to assess tumor cellularity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral VEGF inhibitor PTC299 twice or thrice daily. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies by ELISA.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.
