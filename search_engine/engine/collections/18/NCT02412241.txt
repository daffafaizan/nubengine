    
      The goal of this proposed study is to establish a valid, clinically useful measurement
      battery for head and neck LEF by achieving these specific aims:

      Aim 1: To determine the reliability and validity of the patient-reported outcome measure
      (LSIDS-H&N) for assessing LEF-related symptoms in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer
      patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival.

      Aim 2: To determine the reliability and validity of the clinician-reported outcome measures
      (HN-LEF Grading Criteria and Modified Patterson Scale) for assessing external and internal
      LEF in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients across the trajectory of treatment,
      recovery, and survival.

      Aim 3: To determine the reliability and validity of imaging techniques (CT scan and
      ultrasonography) in identifying site-specific LEF in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer
      patients across the trajectory of treatment, recovery, and survival.
