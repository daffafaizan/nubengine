      a more serious and possibly fatal form of Leishmania disease. All available medical therapies
      require weeks of treatment and cause significant toxicity.

      It appears that Leishmania infections can be eliminated or prevented by T helper 1 immune
      responses. These findings argue that a vaccine that generates a T helper 1 response against
      the parasite will prevent the infection and disease. This is a phase 2, randomized, double
      blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in
      Montenegro skin test (MST)-negative healthy adults of an investigational vaccine being
      developed for the prophylaxis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The vaccine, identified as
      Leish-111f + MPL-SE, consists of a recombinant three-antigen Leishmania polyprotein
      (Leish-111f, 10 μg) together with the adjuvant MPL-SE (25 μg). In addition, the safety and
      immunogenicity of the vaccine will be compared to that of the Leish-111f protein (10 μg)
      given alone. The vaccine, Leish-111f protein alone or placebo will be given to each study
      subject three times at 4 week intervals.
