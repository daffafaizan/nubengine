      imatinib treatment in patients with suboptimal response to imatinib. The patients were
      stratified by prior duration of initial imatinib treatment, and were randomized to receive
      either 400 mg/twice daily of continuous nilotinib or imatinib treatment. The first stratum
      patients were treated with imatinib = 6 to < 12 months and having at least a minimal
      cytogenetic, but no partial cytogenetic response; and the second stratum patients were
      treated with imatinib = 12 months to < 18 months and having partial cytogenetic response
      (PCyR), but no CCyR.
