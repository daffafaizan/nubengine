      clinical treatment. The trabecular tissue was scraped away from the angle (goniocurettage) in
      about 100 degrees by means of an instrument similar to a microchalazion curette. The
      goniocurettage was done under direct visualization of the angle through a gonioscopy lens
      (Swan-Jacob) and a surgical microscope. Using the 17.0 SPSS software the investigators
      compared the intraocular pressure, the numbers of antiglaucomatous medications, the best
      correct visual acuity, the development of cataract, the central corneal thickness,the impact
      on the visual field, the impact on the optic nerve head and the central corneal endothelial
      cell density before and after the goniocurettage, and the intra and post operative
      complications.
