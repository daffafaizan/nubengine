      orthopaedic surgery in the adult patient. If, as suggested, DVT formation begins
      intra-operatively then targeting this period to prevent clot formation could substantially
      reduce DVT rates in the TKA population. The present study aims to determine whether this
      intra-operative regional heparinization technique is effective in preventing the
      intra-operative formation of DVT following TKA, as evidenced by venography in the early
      post-operative period.
