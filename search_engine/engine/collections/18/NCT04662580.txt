    
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single arm, dose escalation, and
      dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of
      ARX517 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor who failed prior standard therapies. The
      study includes 2 parts: a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and a dose-expansion part (Part 2).
      In Part 1, the subject will be enrolled with a starting dose of 0.32 mg/kg, and the study
      will evaluate up to 6 dose levels of ARX517 (0.32 mg/kg, 0.64 mg/kg, 1.07 mg/kg, 1.4 mg/kg,
      1.7 mg/kg, and 2.0 mg/kg) by intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (Q3W). If the planned
      highest dose level of 2.0 mg/kg is well tolerated, a higher dose level of ARX517 may be
      evaluated based on the SMC recommendation. Similarly, doses lower than the pre-specified
      lowest dose of 0.32 mg/kg and additional intermediate dose levels of ARX517 may also be
      considered if needed. Decisions about enrollment suspension, resumption, and study
      termination will be made by the Sponsor based on recommendations from SMC. DLT will be
      evaluated in the first cycle of 21 days for Q3W. MTD and /or putative recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D) will be selected based on all available safety, tolerability, PK, and primary
      anti-tumor activity data. To ensure that the selected RP2D is not associated with an
      increased risk of serious adverse events, multiple "putative RP2D" doses may be selected for
      further evaluation based on SMC recommendation. The number of subjects to be enrolled in the
      dose-expansion part will be based on the number of doses selected for expansion and the
      results of the dose escalation part. Part 2 will not exceed 40 subjects.
