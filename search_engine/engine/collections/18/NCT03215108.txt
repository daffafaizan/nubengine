    
      Covered self-expandable metal stent (C-CSEMS) has the risk of obstruction of the cystic duct,
      and the main and branch pancreatic ducts due to strong radial force and covering material,
      which results in cholecystitis and pancreatitis.

      A flower-type covered self-expandable metal stent (F-CSEMS) having a five-petal-shaped design
      with side grooves was constructed to prevent the obstruction of the cystic duct orifice.

      This study investigated the value of the F-CSEMS in protection for cholecystitis and
      pancreatitis.

      The investigators will enroll patients with distal MBO (Malignant Biliary Obstruction) who
      received placement at the Samsung Medical Center. Transpapillary flower-type covered
      self-expandable metal stent (F-CSEMS) placements will be included in this study.

      The diagnosis of MBO will be based on imaging and/or pathological findings. Malignancy was
      proved by histopathological confirmation obtained by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided
      fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), bile duct biopsy (cytology), pancreatic duct cytology, or
      liver biopsy.

      The investigators will evaluate the frequency of pancreatitis and cholecystitis.

      Furthermore, the investigators will evaluate various parameters to clarify the predictive
      factors of pancreatitis and cholecystitis. The following 10 variables will be evaluated in
      pancreatitis by univariate analysis: [1] sex, [2] age, [3] primary disease, [4] Covered type
      (partially or fully), [5] SEMS with high AF, [6] F-CSEMS with high RF, [7] EST before
      F-CSEMS, [8] previous biliary stent, [9] contrast injection into the pancreatic duct
      (pancreatogram), and [10] the position of the distal stent edge.

      The following 11 variables will be evaluated in cholecystitis by univariate analysis: [1]
      sex, [2] age, [3] regions of stricture, [4] F-CSEMS with high AF AF (axial force), [5]
      F-CSEMS with high RF, [6] previous biliary stent, [7] gallbladder stone, [8] contrast
      injection into the gallbladder (GB injection), [9] involvement to the orifice of the cystic
      duct (OCD), [10] position of distal stent edge, and [11] cystic duct occlusion by F-CSEMS.
