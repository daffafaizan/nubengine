      study is looking at people who have a new condition called erosive reflux esophagitis.
      Esophagitis is defined as mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents
      into the esophagus. Acid reflux, over time, can wear away or erode the lining of your
      esophagus. This condition is called erosive esophagitis. The treating physician may start you
      on prescription strength acid reducing group of medications called Proton Pump Inhibitors
      (PPI). PPI medications can provide 24-hour relief from your painful heartburn symptoms and it
      can help you heal the erosions in the esophagus that acid reflux may cause.
