      (TC). Despite not containing all the harmful substances seen in TC, EC are known to contain
      impurities that may have a detrimental impact on human health. The effects of ECs compared
      with TC on vascular function, inflammation and oxidative stress are unknown. It is
      increasingly recognised that nicotine itself has significant atherothrombotic effects.
      Therefore, clinicians are unable to confidently recommend ECs as a less risky alternative to
      TC.

      Hypothesis: Endothelial function will be improved on EC compared to TC when measured by flow
      mediated dilatation (FMD).

      Potential benefit: This study will provide further information on the potential use these
      devices and the risks and/or benefits associated with them, specifically in relation to
      vascular health.
