      It seems more sensible than structural MRI including DTI. the study goal will be to assess
      rugby players using fMRI at 3 different times after concussion: just after concussion (V1),
      once players have clinically recovered (V2) and 3 months after V2 (V3). The study would
      specifically like to challenge clinical examination supposed to be normal at V2 to
      connectivity maps using resting state fMRI preformed at the same time. fMRI performed at V1
      and V3 will serve as comparators (respectively very altered at V1 and back to normal at V3).
