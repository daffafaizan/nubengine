      subjects (30 Type 1 and 36 Type 2) with at least one foot ulcer. The study will take place at
      three medical centers. Each center will enroll 22 subjects (10 Type 1 and 12 Type 2).
      Subjects will be required to participate in eleven (11) clinic visits over a 6 month period.
      The first visit will last approximately three hours and each of the other visits will last
      about two hours. The eleven visits will be scheduled as follows in the Table to the right.

      At the initial visit the subject will give informed consent and a full medical history, and
      will schedule the dates of the remaining visits for the study. The subject recruiter will
      contact each subject one week prior to each subsequent visit to either confirm the subject's
      attendance or to re-schedule the visit.

      NEW ULCER PREDICTION STUDY: This is a study comparing measurements of 210 "high risk"
      diabetic subjects (90 Type 1 and 120 Type 2) over an 18-24 month period. The study will take
      place at three medical centers. Each center will enroll 70 subjects (30 Type 1 and 40 Type
      2). Subjects will all be required to participate in nine (9) clinic visits. The nine visits
      will be scheduled as follows in the Table to the right.

      The first visit will last approximately three hours and each of the other visits will last
      about 2 hours. At the initial visit the subject will give informed consent and a full medical
      history, and will schedule the dates of the visits for the rest of the study. The subject
      recruiter will contact each subject one week prior to each subsequent visit to either confirm
      the subject's attendance or to re-schedule the visit.
