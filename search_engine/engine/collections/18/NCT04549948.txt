      randomly divided into three groups; Group one (17 patients): leveling of COS using
      0.017X0.025-inch stainless steel archwire. Group two (17 patients): leveling of COS using
      0.019X0.025-inch stainless steel archwire. Group three (17 patients): leveling of COS using
      0.021X0.025-inch Titanium molybdenum archwire.

      In the three groups, a 5mm depth reverse COS will be inserted. Records consisted of lateral
      cephalograms (pre-treatment, at T0 and post-treatment), peri-apical radiographs (at T0 and at
      T5), study casts (pre-treatment and at each time point during the tudy). Patients will be
      followed up on monthly visits without removing leveling archwires where alginate impressions
      were taken for the lower arch. Pain scores during the first week of leveling will be recorded
      using visual analogue scale (VAS).The amount of COS correction in mm, changes in intercanine
      in mm, intermolar and arch length in mm, pain scores and lower incisors root resorptions in
      mm will be measured.
