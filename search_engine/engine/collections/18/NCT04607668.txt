    
      Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive placebo or trilaciclib on Days 1 and 2
      administered intravenously (IV) prior to FOLFOXIRI/bevacizumab in 14-day cycles for up to 12
      cycles (Induction).

      Following completion of Induction, patients will continue in Maintenance, where they will
      receive trilaciclib or placebo per randomization allocation at study entry.
      Trilaciclib/placebo will be administered prior to infusional-5FU/leucovorin/bevacizumab at
      the same dose and schedule used during Induction. The patient may continue to receive
      treatment on study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent,
      discontinuation by Investigator, or the end of the trial, whichever occurs first. Treatment
      cycles will occur consecutively without interruption, except when necessary to manage
      toxicities or for administrative reasons.
