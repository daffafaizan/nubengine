      single session of WBV lasting for a total of 6 minutes (delivered in eight 45-sec bouts) at a
      high-frequency (50Hz) was associated with the largest decrease in spasticity (as measured by
      the pendulum test). The goal for Phase 2 is to determine whether longer doses of WBV result
      in greater reductions in spasticity as well as improvements in walking ability. Two different
      doses of WBV, a short dose and a long dose, will be tested.
