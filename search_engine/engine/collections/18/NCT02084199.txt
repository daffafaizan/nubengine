      In Part 1, 3 subjects with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not yet
      requiring dialysis (Group 1) will be recruited first. Thereafter, 3 subjects with normal
      renal function (Group 2) will be recruited. If a substantial effect on the PK in renal
      impaired subjects is observed on Day 10, the sponsor may elect to stop Part 1 of the study
      without enrolling the complete set of subjects and Part 2 will be initiated. In case no
      substantial effect on the PK is observed, 3 further subjects in both Group 1 and 2 will be
      recruited and analysed. If a substantial effect on the PK is observed, the study will proceed
      to Part 2. Part 2 of the study will not be conducted, if in Part 1 no substantial difference
      in PK is seen.

      In Part 2, Group 3 (mild renal impairment) and Group 4 (moderate renal impairment) will be
      recruited first. After completion of the mild and moderate impairment groups, Group 5 (normal
      renal function) will be recruited.
