        -  Determine the maximum tolerated doses of docetaxel and mitoxantrone in combination with
           a fixed dose of estramustine and prednisone, when given to patients with advanced
           prostate cancer.

        -  Characterize the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of mitoxantrone and docetaxel. Patients are
      stratified into one of two risk groups (good risk group or poor risk group) based on the
      number of prior chemotherapy regimen(s) and the occurrence and sites(s) of prior radiation.

      All patients receive oral prednisone twice daily on days 0-3, oral estramustine three times
      daily on days 1-5, mitoxantrone IV bolus on day 2, and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression.
      Patients with stable disease may go off treatment after 6 courses.

      Dose escalation proceeds independently for each risk group. Cohorts of 3 patients are entered
      into each risk group. If 1 of 3 patients at a dose level experiences dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT), then 3 additional patients are accrued into this level. If 2 of 6 patients at a dose
      level experience DLT, then dose escalation stops and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      defined at the previous dose level. At least 6 patients must be treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 12 patients (6 in each risk group) will be accrued into this
      study.
