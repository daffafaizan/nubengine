      stroke risk reduction in patients with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation
      remains conflicting and insufficient. Patients on dialysis continue to be routinely excluded
      from randomized controlled trials, and evidence from observational studies is plausibly
      biased. The main objective of the following parallel-group open randomized clinical trial
      presents a nationwide study aimed at investigating the benefit, tolerability, and safety of
      initiating warfarin versus no treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation on dialysis. The
      anticipated results from this project will provide conclusive evidence as to the
      appropriateness of initiating oral anticoagulation for stroke risk reduction in dialysis
      populations with atrial fibrillation with direct effects on clinical management and
      international guidelines pertaining to these patients.

      The study is planned as a multicentre, randomized, open label, parallel group trial with
      planned inclusion of a total of 718 patients (359 patients per arm).Dialysis-treated patients
      with end-stage renal disease with de novo diagnosis of paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent
      atrial fibrillation will be enrolled and randomized to either treatment with warfarin or no
      treatment. Randomization with be attained using a 1:1 allocation as per a computer-generated
      randomization schedule stratified by gender, age by decade, and center using permuted blocks
      of random sizes. Study participants will be allocated to treatment in accordance with the
      randomization for the full duration of the trial i.e. at a minimum one year following
      randomization, and followed with regular monitoring for the the primary efficacy outcome of
      ischemic stroke or death due to ischemic or unspecified stroke and the primary safety outcome
      of major bleeding defined in accordance with the International Society on Thrombosis and
      Hemostasis definition.
