      children conceived by infertility treatment and children conceived naturally. In the first
      phase of the study, the focus was on growth and development through age 3 years. In the
      second phase of the study, the focus is turning to cardiometabolic factors through age 9
      years. Infertility treatments include assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in
      vitro fertilization (IVF), controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and ovulation induction
      (OI). The study was originally designed as a matched exposure cohort. Specifically,
      singletons whose birth certificates indicated the use of infertility treatment were
      considered 'exposed' singleton infants and subsequently frequency-matched on perinatal region
      of birth at a ratio of 1:3 to 'unexposed' singletons. Twins and higher order multiples were
      invited to participate regardless of mode of conception. Mothers and their newborns were
      recruited approximately 2-4 months postpartum. The first phase of the study was completed in
      2014 and main findings can be found under publications.

      The second phase objectives are:

      To determine whether infertility treatment is associated with differences in growth and
      development from age 6 to 8 years with particular focus on childhood cardio-metabolic
      outcomes by follow-up of children conceived by ART or other infertility treatments and
      children who were conceived without treatment. Secondarily, to assess epigenetic differences
      as measured by DNA methylation using collected biospecimens.
