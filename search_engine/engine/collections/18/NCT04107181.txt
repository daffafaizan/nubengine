      during a routine Pap smear. For the patient arm, the introducer will be used in conjunction
      with standard of care procedures. The healthy volunteer arm will include taking the
      introducer home for a week to determine if each person can find their cervix without the help
      of a physician. As well as completing surveys on ease of use and demographics related to
      their medial history.
