    
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diffuse lung disease with a histological picture of
      usual interstitial pneumonia and a deteriorating clinical course. The prognosis is poor.
      Chronic alveolar inflammation with associated parenchymal remodeling is theorized to promote
      an ongoing abnormal fibrogenic repair response. Corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents
      have not been shown to benefit IPF patients. Recently several published clinical studies have
      indicated a strong correlation between IPF severity and/or disease progression and the levels
      of specific plasma biomarker proteins related to epithelial cell health and extracellular
      matrix turnover.

      PRM-151 is being developed for potential therapeutic uses to prevent, treat, and reduce
      fibrosis.

      This study is the first intravenous multiple-dose study in humans, and will be conducted in
      patients with IPF. Patients will be randomized to receive either PRM-151 or placebo.
