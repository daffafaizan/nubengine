      exercise and functional status monitoring telerehabilitation program, known as TEL-REHAB, for
      older adults 60 years of age and over who are deconditioned following their discharge from
      the inpatient setting, or recruited from GLA outpatient clinics. Deconditioning is a
      modifiable risk factor for preventing institutionalization of frail elderly patients who
      would otherwise be able to live independently. Home exercise programs are an effective
      intervention to reduce the risk, but patient compliance with home exercise programs, and
      assessments of patients during home exercise programs, are barriers to achieving maximal
      benefits. Face-to-face visits with physical medicine professionals are an effective means to
      perform these functions, but are problematic because of professional time impacts and patient
      transportation problems. A TEL-REHAB program will empower these patients to take
      responsibility for their own health by providing ongoing communication with a healthcare
      provider. In this way, telerehabilitation may assist older adults to remain independent in
      their homes as long as possible.
