      NOAC as dabigatran or rivaroxaban in therapeutic doses are recruited and informed consent of
      two blood sampling times will be obtained in correlation to the time of drug intake (two and
      24 hours after drug intake). The bedside measurements will be performed and compared directly
      with the concentrations determined by plasma concentration assays. These investigations will
      be performed at the department of Angiology at the university hospital Frankfurt.
