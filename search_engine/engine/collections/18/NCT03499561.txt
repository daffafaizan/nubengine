    
      ASB is common in women and increases in prevalence with age and/or sexual activity, due to
      short urethra, pregnancy, easy contamination of urinary tract with fecal flora

      The pregnant women are two times more commonly affected than age matched non pregnant
      females. This is due to urinary stasis due to progesterone effect in pregnancy in addition to
      different morphological and physiological changes occurring during pregnancy The prevalence
      of ASB is about 3 times higher in diabetic women (ranging from 15% to 30%) than in
      non-diabetic women (less than 10%)
