      Princess Grace Hospital are particularly aware of evaluation, management and monitoring of
      patients who have suffered brain trauma, or concussions, and the study of possible long-term
      consequences.

      They regularly receive patients, referred by neurologists or spontaneously coming for
      consultation, for whom the carrying out of a complete in-depth evaluation is recommended,
      because of their medical history and their personal history.

      In partnership with the "Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile" (FIA) and the "Automobile
      Club of Monaco" (ACM), the Princess Grace Hospital team hopes ultimately to set up a
      screening campaign for traumatic brain injuries among a particularly exposed population:
      motorsports people.

      In this context, inspired by the work carried out by the Cambridge University team (the
      Rescue Racer Study) and the FIA recommendations, the Sponsor wishes to carry out an
      observational study with retired motor sportspeople.

      The objectives are to study a population particularly exposed by the past to brain trauma and
      concussion (who is retired from a professional practice of motor sport), to report results of
      their neuro-cognitive evaluations, and to determine if specific profiles emerge, to evaluate
      potential consequences of these traumas' history at a cerebral, physical and psychological
      level.
