    
      A randomized, controlled, cross-over study in 21 healthy volunteers. The participants will
      receive a fluid bolus of 500 ml Ringer's Acetate at either 22°C or 38°C over 15 minutes in a
      randomized order. Non-invasive measures will be made of cardiac index, mean arterial
      pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart and pulse rate, saturation
      and temperature. Hemodynamic measure will be made using the Clearsight® system. Measurements
      will be made during 120 minutes. The second session will take place at least one day later,
      and the participant will then receive the other fluid temperature.
