      (off-days). On the off-days the patient will take a placebo (sugar pill). Over the 4 weeks of
      the actual study there will be 6 random off-days of study medicine and neither the caregiver,
      patient nor study doctor will know which days are the missing days.

      To cover all aspects of the patients' lives and notably their school time, aside from
      investigator's assessments, evaluations will also be performed on a daily basis by those
      involved in their day-to-day life: parents, teachers (on school days) and the patients
      themselves, using an electronic diary.
