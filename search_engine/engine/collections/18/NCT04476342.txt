      (1) To develop a minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation integrated system, and to form
      a new product package, the package of the system should include the extracorporeal
      circulation off-set supplies for a routine heart operation.(2) To explore the influence of
      integrated minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system on the recent clinical
      outcome of patients.(3) To explore the influence of integrated minimally invasive
      extracorporeal circulation system on blood dilution of patients.(4) To explore the influence
      of integrated minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system on inflammatory response
      in patients.

      Research and development of integrated minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system

      (1) Appropriate CPB tubes should be determined according to clinical needs. Adopt 3/8 inch
      vein tubes and elevate the position of blood storage tank to reduce the length of the tubes
      and precharge.The piping jacket shall include the main pump pipe, the infusion pipe, the
      platform package (static and static vessels), the left and right core suction pipe, and the
      negative pressure suction pipe.The total precharge should be kept at about 800ml (284ml
      static precharge of the self-equipped micro-plug oxygenator, and about 500ml precharge of the
      pipeline and stopping liquid perfusion system).(2) Cooperate with integrated membrane
      oxygenator manufacturers in the design of pipelines to form a wrapper that integrates
      membrane oxygenator and pipeline.Among them, oxygenator and pipeline should be well connected
      in the sheath.

      Clinical research methods:

      A prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study was designed. 80 patients should be
      included.Clinical study grouping: The control group was CCPB group, which was equipped with
      ordinary oxygenator, microemboli filter and 4:1 cardioplegia solution.The experimental group
      was MICPB group, with built-in micro-thrombotic oxygenator and MP formula (15ML15% KCl+10ml
      compound potassium, calcium and magnesium +25ml normal saline).

      Research method:

      A: Before, in, and after CPB blood collection, Hb, Hct, and blood lactate values of the two
      groups of patients were measured and analyzed statistically.B: Blood transfusion volume,
      urine volume and ultrafiltration volume were collected during CPB in the two groups of
      patients, and the data of the two groups were statistically analyzed.To investigate the
      effects of integrated minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system on inflammatory
      response indicators WBC, CRP, IL-6, TNF- and C3a in patients before (T0), CPB (T1) and 2
      hours after CPB (T2), blood samples were collected from the two groups, centrifugated,
      superfluid was taken, and stored at -80â„ƒ.The concentrations of CRP, IL-6, TNF- and C3a were
      determined by ELISA.Statistical analysis was performed.WBC was measured in blood routine.(3)
      To investigate the influence of integrated minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation
      system on the recent clinical outcome of patients. The mechanical ventilation time, ICU time,
      length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality of patients in the two groups were
      statistically analyzed.
