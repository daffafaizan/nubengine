      rarely possible, patient management is often aimed at symptom control. Breathlessness, cough
      and fatigue are common and distressing symptoms occurring in up to 90%, 47-86% and 50-90% of
      patients respectively. To date, research in relation to this group of symptoms has focussed
      on breathlessness, cough or fatigue as single symptoms. However, it is likely that ifa
      patient suffers from one symptom, they also suffer from one or both of the others.
      Collectively these symptoms are referred to as the Respiratory Distress Symptom Cluster.

      Our group has developed a multi-modal Respiratory Distress Symptom Intervention (RDSI) for
      the self management of breathlessness, cough and fatigue. This study aims to determine the
      effects of adding the RDSI to usual care for the self-management of the Respiratory Distress
      Symptom Cluster for patients with lung cancer.

      Patients who take part will be assigned to one of two groupsÍ¾ usual care or usual care plus
      the RDSI.
