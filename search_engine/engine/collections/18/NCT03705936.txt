      is a well-established and tried and tested non-invasive (no surgical procedures involved)
      brain stimulation technique that can vary brain activities, may be used as a treatment for
      patients with swallowing difficulties. However, results have also showed that the response to
      the treatment is different among individuals. A possible explanation for this variation is
      related to the brain's level of activity preceding rTMS. The hypothesis of this study is that
      this variation may be minimized by regulating the brain state with an additional dose of rTMS
      prior to the intended rTMS session (preconditioned rTMS). This may subsequently improve the
      outcomes of rTMS.

      Therefore, this study aims to better regulate the response of the brain to rTMS. The findings
      of this study will provide the basis for future development of optimal rTMS treatment
      protocols for patients with swallowing difficulties.
