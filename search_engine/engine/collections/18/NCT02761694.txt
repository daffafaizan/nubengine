      protein called AKT. A number of genes, namely, PIK3CA, AKT and PTEN, may cause the AKT to
      behave abnormally, so by blocking the action of these genes on AKT with the drug like ARQ
      751, the cancer spread may be stopped or slowed down. Paclitaxel and fulvestrant are standard
      anticancer agents, paclitaxel is given to destroy cancer cells and fulvestrant to lower the
      amount of estrogen the body makes. ARQ 751 in combination with paclitaxel or fulvestrant may
      potentiate effect of a single therapy in tumors driven by PIK3CA/AKT/PTEN mutations.
