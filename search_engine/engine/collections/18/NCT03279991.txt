      point for digital medicine in the future, a sort of Copernican revolution: the starting point
      is no longer the disease, but the patient around whom pathologies and risk factors rotate,
      not as distinct and uniquely defined entities, but as communicating and interconnected
      possibilities that define their form only in relation to the individual, his genome, his
      personality, his habits of life and the environment in which he lives. From these
      interactions, a personalized, dynamic, integrated, and continuous diagnostic and therapeutic
      pathway is created that accompanies the person not only in the stage of the disease but also
      in the previous and subsequent phases, becoming a way of life oriented towards the health of
      the person rather than a way to cure a disease.

      An Integrated Health Life Platform enables you to develop an interactive healthcare health
      model among all actors who manage the health of the person, healthcare professionals in the
      area, and hospitals, caregivers, and community through the integration of remote monitoring
      of data with A virtual community.

      The platform is thought not as a pure aggregation of data, but as a digital hub centered on
      the patient, with his (clinical and personal) data, but also the environment in which he
      lives, his behaviors, accessibility to services and The relationships that come to them and
      from them. The platform aims to effectively integrate self management, personalization of the
      path, and co-production of health, demonstrating that these three key dimensions of care are
      mutually reinforcing.
