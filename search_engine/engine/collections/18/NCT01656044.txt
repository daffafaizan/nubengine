    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether negative pressure therapy applied to closed laparotomy incisions can
      decrease the incidence of incisional surgical site infections in patients undergoing
      clean-contaminated resections for colorectal, pancreatic, and peritoneal surface malignancies
      compared to standard post-operative sterile gauze dressings.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard sterile dressing (SSD) over their closed laparotomy incision
      at the conclusion of their surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive negative pressure therapy (NPT) dressing over their closed
      laparotomy incision at the conclusion of their surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
