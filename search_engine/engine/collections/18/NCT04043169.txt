      integrated digital test which is intended for the detection of pregnancy. The test is
      indicated for use from 6 days before the day of the missed period (5 days before the day of
      the expected period). The test is intended for home use.

      This study aims to demonstrate that the Pregnancy Test has the required performance
      characteristics in lay-user testing, and when testing samples provided by lay-users. The
      study will recruit a cross-section of the target pregnancy test user population, that is,
      women aged between 18 and 45 representative of the intended user.

      A minimum of 204 volunteers will be required to complete the study. The study site will aim
      to recruit an equal number of pregnant and not-pregnant volunteers (a minimum of 102 of
      each). Each volunteer will conduct the pregnancy test using both the 'in stream' and 'dip'
      method of sampling. Volunteer results will be evaluated against confirmed pregnancy status.
