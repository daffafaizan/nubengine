      Subjects presenting at participating hospitals with AO/OTA 31-A1 or A2 fractures will be
      assessed against the eligibility criteria and approached for Informed Consent.

      Subjects who are considered eligible and who have provided Informed Consent will be
      randomised using iDataFax to one of the two treatment options.
