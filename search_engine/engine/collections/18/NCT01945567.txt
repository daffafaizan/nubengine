      for 3 months: (1) caudal zona incerta and (2) dorsal zona incerta. This 6-month-long
      randomised phase is followed by 6 months of unblinded individualised empirically optimised
      settings programmed by a neurologist. Each of the three treatment periods ends with a full
      clinical, functional and quality of life assessment.
