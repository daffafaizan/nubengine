      to being breast-fed. A previous study identified items that place an infant at a high risk
      for developing complications related to being breast-fed. The present study will use the same
      survey and collect data from more participants. These additional participants are necessary
      to provide statistical analysis for the survey. The survey being developed will assist health
      care professionals to identify those infants at risk for developing health problems related
      to being breast-fed and provide care that will minimize the chances of developing
      complications.
