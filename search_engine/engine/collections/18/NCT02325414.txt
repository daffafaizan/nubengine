      its efficacy and safety over a 2 year period for the prevention of bone loss and maintenance
      of bone strength in individuals with recent onset SCI (see diagram below). Subjects will be
      randomized at the baseline visit to receive either zoledronic acid or placebo. At the end of
      the first year of the study, each treatment group will be re-randomized to either zoledronic
      acid or placebo to evaluate the durability of response to zoledronic acid and the utility of
      serum bone markers to guide therapeutic decision making. DXA imaging, CT imaging and bone
      markers will be obtained at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months.
