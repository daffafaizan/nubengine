      clinical diagnosis and treatment of acute aortic dissection. However, most patients from the
      IRAD are Caucasian. These data were not sufficient to reflect clinical profiles and outcomes
      of Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection. In China, little is known about clinical
      features, managements and outcomes of acute aortic dissection involving a large number of
      patients. The investigators established clinical multicenter registry of acute aortic
      dissection. Between January 2009 and February 2012, about 2000 were enrolled in the Chinese
      registry of acute aortic dissection(CRAD) database. The aim of this study is to analyze
      clinical profiles and outcomes of Chinese patients with acute aortic dissection.
