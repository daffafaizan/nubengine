      stratified randomization codes by the pharmacy. Clinicians, researcher, and primary
      caregivers will be masked. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment arms or
      to a placebo concurrent control.

      Early vitamin D supplementation/placebo will be initiated within the first 7 days after
      birth. Premature infants will be randomized to receive one of the 3 fixed doses of vitamin D:
      either placebo (zero dose), 200 IU/day, or 800 IU/day. The supplementation will be started
      within 72 hours of enteral feeds being initiated and will continue until postnatal day 28.
      After this period of supplementation, routine supplementation will be conducted in all
      groups.

      Remnant cord blood samples will be analyzed for vitamin D levels (serum hydroxyvitamin D
      [25(OH)D]. Two circulating vitamin D concentrations (25(OH)D concentrations) will be measured
      on postnatal days 14 and 28. Urine samples will be collected weekly, to determine calcium
      excretion if high serum calcium concentrations are found.

      Supplementation will be discontinued and infant will exit the study if surgical necrotizing
      enterocolitis/bowel perforation is diagnosed, if 25 (OH)D concentrations >60ng/mL
      (>150nmol/L; potentially toxic) are detected or, if infant NPO for greater than 24 hours. If
      infant made briefly NPO (<24h) for feeding intolerance, suspected sepsis,
      hypotension,hemodynamically significant PDA, or respiratory difficulties, enteral vitamin D
      will not be discontinued.

      All infants will be followed to discharge for primary, secondary outcomes as well as adverse
      events.
