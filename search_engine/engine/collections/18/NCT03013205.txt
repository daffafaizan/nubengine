      pain and shoulder range of motion limitation. Steroid injections are widely utilized to
      reduce inflammation and fibrosis. The thickening of the coracohumeral ligament was thought to
      play an important role in the pathogenesis of frozen shoulder, resulting in limited external
      rotation of the shoulder. While the elastogram of coracohumeral ligament will significantly
      increase stiffness under the shear-wave ultrasound (shear-wave elastography).

      Therefore, in this study, investigators will compare intra-articular steroid injections with
      direct coracohumeral ligament steroid injection to conventional intra-articular steroid
      injection. Investigators will measure the primary outcome as shoulder function improvement
      and secondary outcomes as ROM, pain scale and stiffness of coracohumeral ligament under
      elastogram.
