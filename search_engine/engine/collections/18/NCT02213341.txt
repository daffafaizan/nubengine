    
      This is a single-site study of infants who are scheduled to receive their third series (~6
      month) vaccinations, as routine care, to investigate whether the diphtheria, tetanus, and
      pertussis (DTaP) vaccination has an effect on specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels to milk,
      egg, or peanut. Infants will be assigned to one of two groups depending on the infant's
      sensitization to milk, egg, and peanut.
