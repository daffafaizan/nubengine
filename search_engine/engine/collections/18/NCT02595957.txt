      particularly with respect to the return of medically-actionable secondary findings (SF). This
      study seeks to investigate the utility and effectiveness of returning SF generated via
      research or clinical sequencing by studying individuals who have received such findings. Our
      objectives with this protocol have evolved over time and have been substantially informed by
      our experiences in returning SF through sequencing initiatives such as the ClinSeq study, the
      Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO), and the Secondary Genomic Findings Service
      (SGFS). Our work with these studies/initiatives suggests that much remains unknown about how
      recipients of SF understand these findings, communicate them to their health professionals
      and families, and whether they adhere to recommended health-preserving actions in both the
      short and longterm. As well, recipients of SF are an unselected population in which to
      investigate penetrance of disorders associated with SF genes. Thus, this protocol aims to
      explore important questions of clinical utility associated with SF return and penetrance of
      SF-related disorders. Healthcare actions and family communication (clinical utility) are
      assessed by interviews and surveys with SF recipients. This protocol also includes a pilot
      program in which selected participants will be invited to the NIH for bespoke phenotyping to
      uncover the presence of disease and explore avenues to develop interventions to enhance
      outcomes.
