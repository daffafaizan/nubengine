      with the SynerGraftÂ® (SG) process,which is designed to reduce the donor cells present on the
      graft. The valve is then cryopreserved for storage until use. Removing cells from the heart
      valve has been shown to reduce a component of the immune response after implant compared to a
      standard allograft valve. However, it is not known how this affects the long-term durability
      of the valve.
