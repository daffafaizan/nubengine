      symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as assessed by the International Prostate
      Symptom Score (IPSS) and the improvement of QoL assessed by QoL questionnaire in patients
      undergoing prostatic artery embolization (PAE) to patients of similar characteristics
      undergoing conventional transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
