    
      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to 2 groups:

        1. 1st group will undergo prone-flexed PCNL.

        2. 2nd group will undergo prone PCNL.

      III. Recruitment of participants Patients appointed for an outpatient diagnostic cystoscopy
      will be reviewed for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Legible patients will be asked to
      participate in the study and to sign the informed consent form.

      IV. Randomisation Randomization will be performed using computer generated random tables
      using stratified blocked randomization in 1:1 ratio.

      V. Study procedure Preoperative evaluations included

        1. Detailed medical history

        2. Physical examination

        3. Routine blood examination

        4. Urinalysis & urine cytology

        5. Renal and liver function tests

        6. Coagulation profile

      8. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis

      Operative Technique

      Prone-flexed positioning i. Retrograde access will be obtained ii. The patient is
      repositioned prone with adequate padding under the pressure points of the head, chest, knees,
      and feet.

      iii. The table is flexed 30 degrees at the level of the patient's mid lumbar region to open
      the space between the 12th rib and the posterior iliac crest dropping the gluteal muscles
      from the working plane.

      Ancillary intervention

      Patients will receive a 20-mL infiltration of 0.25% bupivacaine. Under fluoroscopic guidance,
      the local analgesic was infiltrated with a 22-gauge spinal needle (10-cm length) along the
      nephrostomy tract at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock positions (5 mL in each tract), including
      the muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and skin.

      Patients will receive 1 g tranexamic acid at induction followed by three further doses of 500
      mg over the next 24 h.
