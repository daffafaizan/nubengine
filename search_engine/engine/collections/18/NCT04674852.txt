    
      Nonrandomized clinical trial to evaluate the Mayo-designed twinkling marker for ultrasound
      conspicuity at the time of preoperative ultrasound-guided localization.

      Study participants are breast cancer patients with pathology-proven metastatic axillary lymph
      nodes. Per standard of care, a biopsy marker will have already been associated with the
      positive lymph node. 10 such patients scheduled for surgery at Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN with
      Dr. James Jakub will be enrolled. Preoperative radioactive seed localization will proceed as
      usual, but the twinkling marker will be additionally loaded with the seed into the needle
      using standard protocol. Before surgery, ultrasound will be performed to evaluate twinkling
      of the twinkling marker.
