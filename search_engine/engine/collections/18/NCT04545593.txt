      mental health and physical disability among minority elders. The core Positive Minds
      intervention includes 10 sessions offered by Community Health Workers over a maximum of 6
      months, designed to identify and correct negative distortions or cognitions, promote
      behavioral activation and encourage supportive relationships. Strong Bodies is a 36-session
      physical intervention consisting of a series of exercises conducted while wearing a weighted
      vest in a group setting over 6 months; both interventions include a group maintenance
      component to maintain gains. The investigators will evaluate the acceptability, effectiveness
      and twelve-month sustainability of the Enhanced Positive Minds-Strong Bodies intervention
      (E-PMSB) offered by Community Health Workers (CHWs) and Exercise Trainers in community-based
      organizations (CBOs) and community clinics. The intervention is offered in English, Spanish,
      Mandarin or Cantonese.
