      Primary

        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with unresectable or
           metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with gefitinib and PEG-interferon alfa-2b.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate (by RECIST criteria), duration of response, time to
           treatment failure, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pre-treatment expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, the
           epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and p27, and correlate with response to
           treatment.

        -  Determine post-treatment alteration of EGFR and p27 expression in patients with tumors
           accessible for serial biopsy.

        -  Assess changes in EGFR levels in buccal epithelial cells in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily and PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once
      weekly in weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a partial response or stable disease
      after completion of course 2 continue to receive gefitinib alone as above in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
