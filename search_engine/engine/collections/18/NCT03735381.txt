      prevention of the appearance of insomnia in the third trimester of pregnancy, in the increase
      of the quality of sleep and in the improvement of the quality of life throughout pregnancy.

      Specific Objectives: Comparison of the interventions group versus the control group; at the
      beginning, middle and end of the program of the following indicators: 1. Average steps/day;
      2. Frequency of insomnia; 3. Hours of night sleep and quality of sleep; 4. Quality of life
      level.

      Methodology: Randomized Control trial in parallel in healthy sedentary pregnant women
      belonging to the Virgen de las Nieves Hospital in Granada, Spain. At 12 weeks of gestation
      (GW) they will be invited to participate and randomly assigned to the intervention group I2
      (pedometer, with goal of 11,000 steps / day), intervention group I1 (pedometer without goal)
      and control (without pedometer). Duration of the intervention: 13-32 GW. At 12, 19 and 31GW
      the average steps/day will be measured in groups I2 and I1. In weeks 13, 20 and 32GW, the
      following variables will be collected: the Athens Insomnia Scale, the Sleep Quality Index
      (Pittsburgh), adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (Predimed), physical activity (short IPAQ),
      quality of life (PSI), the consumption of toxic substances (caffeine, illegal drugs, alcohol
      and tobacco), the anthropometric variables of pregnant woman.
