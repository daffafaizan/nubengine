      Survival after out of hospital cardiac arrest has improved and long term follow up of the
      patients is not routinely effective. Patients showing sign of awakening very early are
      considered in a good outcome group. Nevertheless they can experience some restriction and
      difficulties when they try to return to their premorbid level of functioning.

      We aim to study their long term functional outcome and their level of anxiety, depression,
      quality of life and caregiver burden as well as their general cognitive functioning.
      Prognosis factors will be studied in the acute phase.
