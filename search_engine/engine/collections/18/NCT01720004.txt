      and one in the USA. Nurses at both hospitals were trained in how to assist women into the
      hands-and-knees position in bed. Repeated hands-and-knees position was defined as attempts to
      use the position for 15 minutes, hourly from randomization until delivery. Women were not
      asked to assume hands-and-knees for delivery.
