      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (15:15) for non-pharmacological treatment and
      pharmacological treatment group. Participants of each group will receive twice a week for
      total 8 weeks of intervention. This is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, so physicians
      will have medical decision making according to each participant's conditions and choose the
      specific intervention and dosage of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment.
