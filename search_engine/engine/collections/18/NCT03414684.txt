      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for your specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses. The FDA has approved carboplatin as a
      treatment option for your disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well carboplatin, by itself, or
      together with nivolumab, works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of
      the body. Nivolumab is a recently discovered human monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a type
      of protein that your immune system (the system that defends your body against potentially
      harmful particles) uses to find and destroy foreign molecules (particles not typically found
      in your body, such as bacteria and viruses). Scientists can now make antibodies in the
      laboratory and produce them for the treatment of many different diseases.

      Nivolumab works by attaching to and blocking a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a different
      molecule that can turn off the immune system by interacting with PD-L1 on the cancer cell.
      Nivolumab has been shown in research studies to prevent PD-1 from shutting down the immune
      system, thus allowing it to recognize and help your body destroy the cancer cells. You are
      being asked to participate in this study because triple-negative breast cancer has shown
      elevated rates of PD-L1 expression.

      Nivolumab has been used in other research studies and information from those research studies
      suggests that nivolumab may help shrink or stabilize your triple negative breast cancer in
      this study
