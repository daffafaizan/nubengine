      I. Time to clinical recovery based on reducing the need of supplementary oxygenation in COVID
      19 patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate (1) clinical, (2) radiographic, and (3) immune marker response to
      whole-lung LDRT compared to best standard of care.

      II. Secondary clinical improvements will look at time to hospital discharge, prevention of
      ICU admissions, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are blindly randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive best supportive care plus physician choice of treatment

      ARM II: Patients receive best supportive care plus LDRT (experimental arm).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 14 days.
