      approximately 75-87% percent of women are discharged from the hospital with an opioid
      prescription. Most women fill that prescription and 1% continue to use those opioids 90 days
      after delivery despite no longer requiring them for pain control, predisposing them to opioid
      dependence. This study aims to determine if transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block using
      bupivacaine liposome suspension injection (EXPARELÂ®) significantly reduces the use of opioid
      medications after discharge in women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery. The study is a
      proposed double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Pregnant women who have completed 37
      weeks gestation and are scheduled for cesarean delivery will be randomized to receive a TAP
      block with 80 ml of mixed liposomal bupivacaine or saline. Based on its use in other surgical
      settings, the investigators hypothesize that women who receive a liposomal bupivacaine TAP
      block will use significantly less opioids by postoperative day 7 as calculated in morphine
      milligram equivalents. In addition to overall consumption of opioids after discharge, other
      aims to be studied include inpatient opioid use, effect on pain scores, rates of postpartum
      depression, patient-perceived quality of breastfeeding, patient quality of recovery, and
      composite adverse outcomes.

      With better overall pain control and less dependence on opioids postpartum, liposomal
      bupivacaine TAP blocks at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery may offer a highly
      effective analgesic alternative that can help shift the tide in the ongoing opioid epidemic
      among reproductive females.
