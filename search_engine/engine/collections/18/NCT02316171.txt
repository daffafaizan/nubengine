      alone and in sequential combination with low-dose mitomycin C in patients with non-muscle
      invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who were candidates for and were planning to undergo TUR for
      treatment of their disease. This gave a relatively homogeneous study population and
      facilitated collection of resected tumour tissue for histological, pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses.
