      development can be prevented or delayed if the virus is depressed successfully. Lamivudine is
      often used and usually has good efficacy. However, lamivudine resistance and virus mutation
      happens a lot. Telbivudine, which is superior to lamivudine in the treatment of CHB,is
      considered to be appropriate for the antiviral treatment on CHB patients with liver
      cirrhosis.
