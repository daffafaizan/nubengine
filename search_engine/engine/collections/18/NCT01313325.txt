      of children with developmental disorders that cause mild to moderate balance problems. The
      secondary purpose is to determine if the use of hippotherapy also improves perceived
      functional abilities and thus quality of life as measured by the pediatric balance scale and
      Activities Scale for Kids (respectively)
