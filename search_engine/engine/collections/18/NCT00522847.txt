      which are often poorly correlated. Recent work has shown that not only are there changes in
      the composition of the tear film (including cytokines and the presence of various mucin
      species and tear film proteins) but also quantifiable changes in both the structure and
      function of the ocular surface, including corneal sensitivity and the appearance of the
      epithelial cells and the sub-basal neural network. To-date, no published study has attempted
      to correlate various clinical and morphological changes found in dry eye with tear film and
      ocular surface biomarkers.
