    
      Primary objectives:

      1. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of a single target dose of 5 times 10e9 total
      cells, acceptable range of 1.5 times 10e7 to 5 times 10e9 total cells comprised of autologous
      CART-19 cells that express the TCR zeta and 4-1 BB costimulatory domain.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Proof of mechanism: determine if 2nd generation CAR expressing 4-1BB costimulation
           domains have improved persistence in patients.

        2. Proof of concept: determine the effects of CART-19 on CD19 expression in vivo.

        3. Proof of bioactivity: Evaluate changes in systemic soluble immune factors in patients

        4. Proof of bioactivity: Evaluate impact of CART19 treatment on tumor burden

        5. Explore whether CART-19 cells retain anti-tumor activity in vivo.

        6. Determine if host immunity develops against CART-19.

        7. Characterize the relative subsets of CART-19 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

        8. Describe survival and response rates
