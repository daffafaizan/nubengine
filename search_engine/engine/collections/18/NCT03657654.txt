      injury to laryngeal nerves involved in voice production, voice difficulty is common even in
      the absence of evident injury to these nerves. The cause of voice change in these situations
      is not well defined, and multiple mechanisms have been suggested. Some potential mechanisms
      include trauma to the laryngeal skeleton from intraoperative manipulation of the strap
      muscles, cricothyroid muscle, thyroid, cartilage, or trachea. However, it is also possible
      that irritation due to intubation and edema to the neck and oral or pharyngeal soft tissues
      that develops after the surgery as a result of intubation plays a role in postoperative voice
      change. These mechanisms can occur in any operation requiring general endotracheal anesthesia
      even when the laryngeal nerves are not specifically at risk of injury.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate voice outcomes after thyroidectomy (both objective
      and subjective patient and clinician reported) and compare those to voice outcomes after
      other surgeries that do not put the recurrent or superior laryngeal nerves at risk or
      traumatize the laryngeal skeleton, but do require general endotracheal anesthesia. The
      primary assessment tool will be the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), which is a
      questionnaire that asks about the patient's interpretation of his/her voice quality and the
      impact it is having on daily activities. Data analysis will be done to see if participants
      have a significant change in their pre-operation VHI-10 score at approximately 1 week and 3
      months post-operation. Additional assessments tools will include nasolaryngoscopy and
      nasolaryngeal stroboscopy to assess global vocal fold function, Consensus Auditory Perceptual
      Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and computerized speech lab (CSL) acoustics to assess voice
      quality, and vocal aerodynamic analysis to determine air flow through the larynx.
