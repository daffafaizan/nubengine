      for non-tumor DNA. Participants diagnosed with HL at outside institutions will be requested
      to sign a release form to allow the outside institution to send their pathology report
      confirming their HL diagnosis. If available, previously banked tumor tissue samples will be
      utilized to assess genetic alterations related to HL. Detailed history will be obtained
      (e.g., demographics, environmental exposures, cancer risk factors, and family pedigree) to
      facilitate the analysis of phenotype-genotype correlations, taking into account potential
      confounding factors.

      Investigators will examine the germline and possibly the tumor DNA of each individual
      participant and use the data from all participants to determine if a gene change is related
      to HL.
