      patients with moderate to severe chronic pain who are switching from opioid analgesics. It
      will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment (52 weeks) after switching
      to JNS020QD. The study will enroll patients with moderate to severe chronic pain which is
      adequately controlled with a regular treatment with an opioid analgesic agent other than the
      study drug because these patients are considered appropriate to investigate the conversion
      ratio in switching from JNS020QD to other opioid analgesics, and to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the study drug. This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention), uncontrolled (the study does not involve a control treatment), multicenter
      study. This study consists of Screening period (1 to 2 weeks), Period I (3-week titration
      period+ 1-week maintenance period), Period II (48 weeks long-term treatment period), tapering
      period (if required, 0 to 6 weeks), and follow-up period (1 week). JNS020QD is a transdermal
      system in which fentanyl base is incorporated directly into a single layer of
      pressure-sensitive high polymerized adhesive, and is changed once a day (every 24 hours).
      JNS020QD is available in 5 formulations containing fentanyl 0.84 mg, 1.7 mg, 3.4 mg, 5 mg, or
      6.7 mg per system.. The study drug patch will be applied to the breast, abdomen, upper arm,
      femoral region, etc. exchanged daily and for consecutive 52 weeks.
