    
      A total of 750 subjects with mild to moderate hyperkalemia (i- STAT potassium levels between
      5.0-6.5 mmol/l, inclusive) will be enrolled in the study where they, in a double-blind
      fashion, will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive one of four (4) doses of ZS (1.25g, 2.5g,
      5g, and 10g) or placebo control, administered 3 times daily (tid) with meals for the initial
      48 hours (Acute Phase), followed by a Subacute Phase (randomized withdrawal) during which
      patients treated with active doses in the Acute Phase, who achieve normokalemia (i-STAT
      potassium values 3.5 to 4.9 mmol/l, inclusive) will be randomized to 12 days of subacute,
      once a day (qd) dosing. There will be a one-time randomization to assign the Acute Phase
      treatment and the Subacute Phase treatment. The Subacute Phase will include subjects who
      became normokalemic on active drug and those who became normokalemic on placebo. The former
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the same dose of ZS they received during the acute
      phase but only administered once a day (qd) or placebo, qd. Subjects on placebo during the
      Acute Phase who are normokalemic in the morning of Study Day 3, will be randomized to receive
      either 1.25 or 2.5 g ZS, qd as Subacute Phase treatment.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed on an ongoing basis by an Independent Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB). Each active dose group will consist of 150 patients per treatment
      group including the placebo control group for a total of 750 patients; the 1:1:1:1:1
      allocation helps to optimize the multiple active dose comparisons to the respective placebo
      controls for the Subacute Phase.
