      study comparing comfilcon A versus samfilcon A lenses over 8 weeks of daily wear (2 x
      4-weeks). Both eyes will wear the same lens (test or control) for 4 weeks in a randomized
      fashion. Subjects will be masked to lens type and investigators will be masked to the lens
      codes.
