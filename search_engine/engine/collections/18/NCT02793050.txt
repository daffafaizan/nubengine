      study of treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in a subset of patients with Soft Tissue
      Sarcoma who received trabectedin as per licensed indication.

      In the absence of availability of existing databases, a retrospective chart review design was
      selected.

      It is anticipated that the medical charts will contain the information required to answer
      study objectives. This chart review study will be conducted in 25 sites in Italy An estimated
      total of 900 charts will be abstracted. This study requires no intervention or interference
      with standard medical care, and thus it will not affect patient treatment.

      The study is sponsored by Italian Sarcoma Group Charts of patients who initiated trabectedin
      as part of the approved treatment for a Soft Tissue Sarcoma , will be identified by site
      staff. Each identified chart will be assigned a unique study identification number. Site
      staff will review the medical charts for all identified patients to determine patient
      eligibility. Those patients who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the final
      study cohort as subject.

      Data from subject medical charts will be abstracted by local site study staff and entered at
      the site into an electronic data capture (EDC) system. The system will also facilitate the
      monitoring of the completeness and quality of study data as the study data accrue.
