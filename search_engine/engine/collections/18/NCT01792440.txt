      in our study from September 2009 till July 2010. Control healthy subjects were recruited
      among peers of the patient or hospital staff during the same period. For the NCFB patients,
      underlying etiologies of NCFB and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization status were
      analyzed and each patient was evaluated by means of spirometry (FVC and FEV1), Leicester
      Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and Sputum Colour Chart (SCC). SCC assessment was both done by
      letting the patient predict his sputum purulence prior to sputum induction and by SCC scoring
      after sputum harvest by the physician.
