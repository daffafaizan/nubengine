    
      More than 1 billion people world wide suffer from hypertension (HT), leaving it the worldÂ´s
      top rank risk factor and contributor to global disease burden. Cardiac disease, stroke,
      kidney disease and dementia are diseases related to HT with high economic burden on societies
      and each year 9.4 million people die as a direct consequence of HT.

      Estimated < 50 % of hypertensive patients adhere to preventive hypertensive medication after
      1 year of treatment.

      Poor adherence to antihypertensive treatment have by many been explained partly by the silent
      nature of hypertension, the risk of side effects from antihypertensive medication, treatment
      expenditures and the patient health perspectives.

      In a randomized controlled trial design we plan to enrol 20 subjects, the limited number
      explained by the study being part of the initial planning of a larger scale trial organized
      by the research group, to invistigate the change in ambulatory bloodpressure with or with out
      Direct Observed Theraphy prior to meassurement, as a one-time-only medication adherence
      check.
