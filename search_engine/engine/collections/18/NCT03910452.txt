      unrelated, has proven curative for patients with various immunodeficiencies, including those
      with ongoing infections. However, donor availability remains a limiting factor in the
      application of this treatment modality. For this protocol, a haploidentical donor is a
      related donor with more than 1 HLA antigen mismatch. The use of haploidentical related donors
      has in the past been fraught with a greater rate of complications related to both higher
      rates of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and delayed immunorecovery. Newer transplant
      regimens appear to have diminished these risks and improved outcomes. We propose using a
      reduced intensity novel conditioning regimen using alemtuzumab, targeted busulfan, and low
      dose total body irradiation followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide for patients with
      chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) who do not have an HLA matched donor but whose
      circumstances necessitate the use of a potentially curative, albeit high-risk treatment
      modality. However, patients with CGD have high rates of Crohn s Disease-like inflammatory
      bowel disease, predominantly colitis, where uncontrolled severe IBD may increase risk of
      GvHD. For this reason, the first 10 patients enrolled will exclude those deemed to have
      intestinal inflammation in the severe category.

      As part of the study design, the protocol will enroll patients sequentially.
