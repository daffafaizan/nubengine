      result. This translates into substantial economic cost with far reaching psychological,
      emotional and social implications. Unfortunately, the treatment options for chronic low back
      pain (CLBP) are limited and typical medical/pharmacological approaches entail potentially
      serious side-effects (e.g., opioid addiction). There is a critical need for the development
      and evaluation of innovative interventions that have the capacity to target the
      multidimensional nature of CLBP.

      Research indicates that psychosocial interventions for CLBP are viable treatment approaches
      that entail few (if any) deleterious side effects and can have benefit beyond pain reduction.
      Cognitive Therapy (CT) and Mindfulness Meditation (MM) have both been found to be feasible
      and effective for CLBP. A promising recently developed treatment that combines aspects of CT
      and MM is Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). MBCT has been successfully applied to
      problems such as depression and headache; however, this approach has not been investigated
      for CLBP.

      Thus, the current study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to examine the
      effects and mechanisms (i.e., how and for whom do these treatments work) of CT, MM, and MBCT
      for CLBP. Brain state data (electroencephalogram (EEG)) as well as self-report data will be
      examined to investigate the potential unique and shared mechanisms underlying treatment
      effects. Furthering the field's understanding of these treatments and their mechanisms will
      lead to the development of streamlined interventions designed to efficiently maximise benefit
      for individuals with CLBP, and that optimise relief from suffering.
