      adenoviral p53 gene therapy in patients with advanced, recurrent, or persistent ovarian
      carcinoma. II. Evaluate the vector pharmacokinetics and biologic efficacy of gene transfer,
      gene expression, and cell death in these patients. III. Determine the immunologic response to
      therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of adenoviral p53 gene therapy. Patients undergo
      removal of ascites, if present, from the peritoneal cavity followed by a bolus infusion of
      adenovirus p53 once a week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2 week rest. Treatment
      continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who experience palliative results with at least stable disease may continue
      treatment weekly without the rest period. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each level
      of adenovirus p53. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level below that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients who receive the MTD without
      unacceptable toxicity may continue to receive treatment on a weekly basis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued over 16-18 months for this
      study.
