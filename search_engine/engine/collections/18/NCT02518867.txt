      the treatment and managing of motor disability of CP. The first is to find out the optimal
      intensity of rTMS. The second is to find out the optimal duration of rTMS and long term
      effects. The third is to compare the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection, rTMS, and
      combined therapy (botulinum toxin injection and rTMS) for children with CP.
