      C. difficile as primary prophylaxis in high risk patients. Chemoprophylaxis theoretically can
      prevent C. difficile infection by two mechanisms. It may reduce transmission from
      asymptomatic C. difficile carriers by reducing the number of spores shed in the stool and
      prevent replication and subsequent toxin production of the organisms in patients at risk for
      C. difficile infection.
