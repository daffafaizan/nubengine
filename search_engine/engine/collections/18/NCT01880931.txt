      during induction can stimulates sympathetic activity, which, as a results, prolong the QTc
      interval. Therefore, the aim of study is to find out the effect site concentration of
      remifentanil for preventing QTc interval prolongation during intubation under
      propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in normotensive and hypertensive patients.
