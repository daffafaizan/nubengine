      important and widely used non-pharmacologic approach to treating depression. Establishing
      QEEG technology as a predictor of response to CBT could help to guide treatment selection for
      individual patients. It is probable that certain patient populations are more likely to
      respond to either psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological interventions, while others may
      benefit from a combination of treatment modalities. This study will provide preliminary
      information about the utility of QEEG as a predictor of response in psychotherapy and will
      furnish the knowledge base of QEEG changes related to clinical variables, providing pilot
      data for a study in a larger sample. We have hypothesized that clinical response will
      correlate with changes in QEEG metrics from beginning to two weeks after treatment, and that
      QEEG parameters, different from those that predict response to pharmacotherapy, will be
      associated with response to CBT.
