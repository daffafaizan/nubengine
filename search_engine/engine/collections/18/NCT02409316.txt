      in endocrine refractory recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients starting a new therapy
      regimen including endocrine targeted therapy. Imaging will occur prior to starting new
      therapy. Some patients may also undergo a second FES PET/CT scan at the time of suspected
      progression of disease to compare for changes in FES uptake measures. This is an
      observational study in that [18F]FES PET/CT will not be used to direct therapy decisions.
