      vision loss. Loss of blood flow causes ischemic damage to the retina. The extent of damage
      depends on the area affected.

      Following the acute phase of the disease re-canalization occurs and lesser blood flow can be
      detected usually without functional recovery.

      Purpose of the study is to examine the retinal blood flow in chronic cases of retinal artery
      occlusion.

      Standard procedures to examine this disease include retinoscopy following pupil dilation,
      fluorescein angiography and more recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT).

      The latest direction in OCT development was OCT angiography (OCTA) which is a software
      upgrade that allows detection of blood flow based on motion contrast. Similar to previous OCT
      machines OCTA is also non-invasive and non-contact and does not require any intravenous
      agents.

      OCT machines are approved in the EU and the US and are not experimental devices.

      The device used in this study is the commercially available Zeiss Cirrus HD OCT Angioplex
      5000 that operates with spectral-domain technology.
