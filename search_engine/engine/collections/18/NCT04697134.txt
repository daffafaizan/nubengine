      neurodevelopment in 2-year-old children. The CD intervention promotes improved
      social-emotional connections between parents/guardians and children that reduces harsh
      discipline and corporal punishment and provides an ideal environment for the development of
      higher cognitive functioning (e.g. working memory, inhibition, emotional regulation).

      The intervention is implemented by using a distributed local, train-the-trainer model in
      partnership with the Grenada Roving Caregiver Program, managed by GRENCASE. CD training was
      provided to 85 existing Roving Caregivers, 70 of whom were certified as Conscious Discipline
      Paraprofessionals (CDPPs). Certified CDPPs traveled out to communities and villages
      throughout Grenada, to impart knowledge and skills to new and expecting parents.

      Following the intervention, parents who received CD training were assessed in their ability
      to implement CD skills with their child(ren). Neurocognition was assessed in children
      post-intervention using the INTERGROWTH 21st Neurodevelopmental Assessment (INTERNDA).
      Neurocognitive outcomes were compared between the intervention arm and the waitlist control
      arm of the study.
