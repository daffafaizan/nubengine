    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the complete and partial response rates in patients with stage II or IIIA
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with neoadjuvant carboplatin, gemcitabine
           hydrochloride, and thalidomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the mechanism of action and activity of thalidomide against
           lung cancer.

        -  Determine the 1-year and 2-year survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the operative mortality of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and oral thalidomide once daily on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-6 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy, patients with
      resectable tumors undergo surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
