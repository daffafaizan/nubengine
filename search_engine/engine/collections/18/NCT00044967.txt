        -  Evaluate the prognostic significance (e.g., overall survival) of microsatellite
           instability (MSI) status in patients with early age-of-onset stage I-III colorectal
           cancer, assuming the presence of a quantitative interaction between MSI status and
           family history of cancer.

        -  Evaluate the development of metachronous neoplasms in this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the histologic features and genetic changes associated with hereditary
           nonpolyposis colorectal cancer in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to family history
      using the Amsterdam II criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (positive vs
      negative).

      Patients undergo baseline colonoscopy before or within 6 months of initial curative resection
      and then surveillance colonoscopy at 1, 3, and 5 years (+/- 6 months) after resection. The
      number, size, location, histology, and method of removal of polyps are documented at the time
      of colonoscopy. Patients also undergo microsatellite instability (MSI) status testing and
      complete family history questionnaires at baseline.

      The prognostic significance of family history and MSI status is evaluated. The individual
      histologic features of the tumors are compared with the MSI status to determine their
      predictive value. The histologic features are also correlated with outcome to determine their
      prognostic significance.

      Patients may be referred for genetic counseling.
