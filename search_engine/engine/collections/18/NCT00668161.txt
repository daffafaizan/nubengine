        1. To measure the effects of a one-year moderate/vigorous intensity aerobic exercise
           program vs. a delayed-exercise control program in persons that have undergone a
           colonoscopy within the past 36 months on proliferation rate in the upper part of colon
           and rectal mucosa crypts.

        2. To also measure the effects of a one-year moderate/vigorous intensity aerobic exercise
           program vs. delayed-exercise control program in persons that have undergone a
           colonoscopy within the past 36 months on:

             -  expression of apoptosis-related proteins (bax/bcl-2 ratio) in colon and rectal
                mucosal biopsies

             -  rectal mucosal prostaglandin levels

             -  fasting serum/plasma insulin, glucose, triglycerides, insulin-like growth factor
                1(IGF-1), and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFPB-3)

             -  body fat mass and distribution (body mass index, waist and hip circumferences,
                bioelectrical impedance, DEXA scan)

             -  subcutaneous abdominal and intra-abdominal fat mass (measured by one-slice CT scan
                at the L4 level)

             -  fitness (VO2max)

             -  quality of life (measured by standardized self-report instruments)

             -  sleep quality
