      infection worldwide.

      Objective: To determine whether sequential treatment eradicates H. pylori infection better
      than standard triple-drug therapy for adults with dyspepsia or peptic ulcers in Taiwanese
      people.

      Design: Randomized, single-blind, prospective controlled trial. Setting: A large tertiary
      referral hospital in eastern Taiwan. Patients: 450 patients with dyspepsia or peptic ulcers
      and infected by H. pylori.

      Measurements: 13C-urea breath test, upper endoscopy, histologic evaluation, rapid urease
      test, bacterial culture, assessment of antibiotic resistance and CYP2C19 genotype of host.

      Intervention: 450 patients with H. pylori infection are randomly assigned to receive one of
      the following therapeutic schemes: group A (5RA5RCT): rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus
      amoxicillin (1 g bid) for 5 days, followed by rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus clarithromycin
      (500 mg bid) and tetracycline (1g bid) for a further 5 days; group B (5RA5RCM): rabeprazole
      (20 mg bid) plus amoxicillin (1 g bid) for 5 days, followed by rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus
      clarithromycin (500 mg bid) and metronidazole (500mg bid) for a further 5 days; group C as
      control: rabeprazole (20 mg bid) plus amoxicillin (1 g bid) and clarithromycin (500 mg bid.)
      for 10 days.
