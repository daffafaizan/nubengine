      osteonecrosis of the femoral head in older patients. In association with the investigators
      aging society, the number of patients who will need THA may increase significantly in the
      next few years [1]. However, in THA, considerable blood loss remains a major problem, which
      can lead to a need for allogeneic blood transfusion. Such transfusion of allogeneic
      erythrocytes is not free of adverse events and has been associated with transmission of
      infectious diseases, increased postoperative bacterial infection, immune sensitization,
      transfusion-related acute lung injury, intravascular hemolysis, transfusion-induced
      coagulopathy, renal failure, admission to intensive care, and even death. Several effective
      interventions have been developed to reduce blood loss and postoperative transfusion rates,
      such as preoperative autologous donation, cell salvage, controlled hypotension, regional
      anesthesia, and the use of erythropoietin and antifibrinolytics. The antifibrinolytics
      include aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), and Îµ-aminocaproic acid, which have different
      mechanisms of action [8]. TXA is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine and a
      competitive inhibitor of plasminogen activation, and thus interferes with fibrinolysis.
      Compared with other antifibrinolytic drugs, TXA is cheaper and safer than aprotinin and more
      potent than the others. Numerous studies have evaluated the use of antifibrinolytics in
      orthopedic surgery and have shown them to be effective in reducing blood loss. However, the
      available clinical trials and meta-analyses lack sufficient statistical power to determine
      the effectiveness of antifibrinolytic agents in total hip arthroplasty.
