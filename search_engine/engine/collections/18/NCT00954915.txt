      teplizumab is well tolerated in subjects with moderate or more severe psoriasis, and that
      this treatment ameliorates the immunopathology of psoriasis. This study will evaluate the
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of subcutaneous (SC) administration
      for 6 days. Once the SC maximum tolerated dose is identified, this dose will be administered
      to a cohort of subject by intravenous for comparison of PK and PD.
