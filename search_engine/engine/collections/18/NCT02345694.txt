      controlled trial to our knowledge to assess the impact of CPAP upon gait and postural control
      in severe sleep apnea patients. Based on a dual-task paradigm, posture and gait analysis will
      be perform before and after 8 week of intervention.

      Beside gait parameters, the cerebral metabolism will be assessed using a Near Infrared
      Spectroscopy (fNIRS) device during normal walking and during walking while dual-tasking,
      using a visual and a verbal task.
