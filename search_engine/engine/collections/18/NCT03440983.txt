      method, etc.) can be changed to optimize the diagnostic quality of the examination.

      The primary objective of this study is to optimize the imaging protocols and to validate the
      choice of the technical parameters in healthy volunteers.

      The quality of the images, cartographies or spectres will be compared to standard
      acquisitions. This evaluation will be based on qualitative visual criteria assessed by expert
      radiologists or on quantitative criteria assessed by data processing tools.

      Prospective, single-center, observational MRI study A screening visit is planned to check the
      inclusion/non inclusion criteria followed by an imaging visit during which the MRI
      examination will be performed.

      Theses 2 visits are scheduled at the subject's convenience. The number of participations to
      the study is limited to 5 per year per subject.
