      progression and improve overall survival in participants who have newly diagnosed multiple
      myeloma (NDMM). This study looked at the safety, tolerability and response in participants
      when administered in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone.

      The study enrolled 64 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups:

        -  Phase 1 Ixazomib 3 mg

        -  Phase 1 Ixazomib 3.7 mg

        -  Phase 2 Ixazomib 3 mg

      All participants were administered with Ixazomib capsules, orally, twice-weekly on Days 1, 4,
      8, and 11 along with lenalidomide capsules, orally, once daily on Days 1-14 and
      dexamethasone, capsules, orally, once daily on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 for up to 16
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity as induction therapy
      during Phase 1. Participants with stable or responding disease continued receiving ixazomib
      capsules, orally, twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in 21-day treatment cycles as
      maintenance therapy until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

      This multi-center trial conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in
      this study was 2037 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a final
      visit after 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
