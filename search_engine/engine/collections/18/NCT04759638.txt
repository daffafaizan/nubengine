    
      Background:

      Obesity and underweight are associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity in
      colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery. There is a controversy regarding the effect of
      the two Body Mass Index (BMI) extremes on the oncological outcome of rectal cancer.

      Objective:

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BMI on short- and long-term oncological
      outcomes as well as postoperative complications in rectal cancer patients who received
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery.

      Setting:

      Tertiary Cancer Center serving pediatric and adult patients in Jordan and the Middle East.

      Patients:

      The medical records of patients with stage II-III rectal cancer who received nCRT followed by
      surgery during 2006 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were subdivided
      according to their BMI into less than 20 kg/m2 defined as underweight; between 20 to 30 kg/m2
      defined as normal range weight, above 30 kg/m2 defined as obese.

      Main Outcome Measures:

      Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Overall Survival, Pathological Complete Response (CR)
