      decision making. The intervention will attempt to increase clinician mindfulness and reduce
      environmental distractions to promote system 2 thinking. A meta-cognitive intervention using
      a structured checklist will be evaluated to identify improvement in diagnostic and
      therapeutic decision-making and examine the role of mindfulness and architectural design in
      enhancing patient safety.

      This a pretest-posttest design study that will be conducted with hospitalist physicians
      working at Michigan Medicine and/or the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System. The proposed
      intervention will provide the participants with tools to help promote mindfulness and focus
      to assist with the diagnostic process. To reduce distraction, headphones to block out
      surrounding noise and table screens to limit distractions will be offered. To assist with
      diagnosis, a diagnostic checklist and use of a IPad to use an online diagnosis application
      will be provided.
