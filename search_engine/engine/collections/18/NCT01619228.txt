      significant risk for increased permeability to external agents, skin compromise, high water
      loss and infection. While the skin develops rapidly after birth upon exposure to the dry
      environment, the ontogeny of the skin maturation and the time to a fully functional and
      protective stratum corneum (SC) barrier is largely unknown. The impact of a poor skin barrier
      on nosocomial infections and the morbidity associated with prematurity is not well defined.
      The purpose is to evaluate skin barrier maturation in premature infants compared to full term
      infants. The skin barrier lipids will be lower in premature infants than in full term infants
      and will become normal over 3-4 months after birth. The higher skin surface acidity in
      premature infants will be related to an altered lipid composition which will change as the
      skin acidifies.

      Full thickness skin samples will be collected from premature and full term infants during the
      time of medically necessary surgical procedures for genomic/transcriptomics analyses. The
      gene profiles will be compared to the corresponding biomarker profiles to determine the
      relationship between genes and gene expression products, i.e., biomarkers. The
      genomic/transcriptomics, biomarker, instrumental and clinical assessments will be examined
      for relationships and compared between premature and full term cohorts.
