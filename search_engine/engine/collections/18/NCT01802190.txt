      involved in these dominant deafness, with an unknown prevalence.A 22nd gene responsible of
      the disease has been found. This SLC17A8 gene encodes for the VGLUT3 protein which is
      specifically expressed in sensorial cells of the audition. VGlut3-/- mice present a deep
      deafness due to a deficiency of neurotransmitter release, although sensorial cells and
      neurons are intact. This kind of deafness is an ideal candidate for a genetic therapy because
      of the cells integrity.Mutations of SLC17A8 gene have been found in 2 american families that
      suffer from progressive deafness.The study aims to look for european families from the
      Mediterranean basin, which carry SLC17A8 gene mutations, and may benefit in a medium-term
      from genetic therapy. The study will allow to identify the prevalence of the SLC17A8 gene
      mutations in patients suffering from deafness. This phenotype also corresponds to DFNA15
      deafness caused by POU4F3 : mutations of this gene will be screened as well.
