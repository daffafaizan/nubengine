    
      240 participants, aged 55 or above, will be recruited (120 Norwich, 120 Melbourne; to include
      both MCI and SCI participants).

      Participants will be asked to take the study food each day for 12 months, and to come to the
      clinical assessment unit on 3 occasions, at baseline, 3 months and 12 months, to complete a
      cognitive task battery such that their performance may be investigated in the context of the
      intervention.

      Urine, blood and faecal samples will be collected and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will
      be applicable to half of each population (i.e to 60 MCI and 60 SCI, 30 of each at Norwich and
      Melbourne).
