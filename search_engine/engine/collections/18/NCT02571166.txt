      with recurrent genital HSV-2 lesions in an area amenable to genital biopsy. Participants will
      enroll when they have a genital lesion. They will undergo a lesion biopsy and a non-lesion
      biopsy. They will start suppressive valacyclovir 500 mg po daily for 4 weeks. Three days
      after completion of the 4 week valacyclovir course, participants will initiate vaccination
      with HSV529 on a 0, 1, and 6 month dose schedule. At each vaccination visits and at the 10
      days post vaccination visits, genital biopsies will be performed. Genital biopsies will be
      performed at the site of genital lesion and at a non-lesional genital site. PBMC will also be
      drawn. Two days after the second vaccination, an optional biopsy will be offered. Overall, a
      minimum of 14 genital biopsies will be performed for each participant: 7 at the genital
      lesion site, and 7 at the genital non-lesion site. Four control biopsies from the upper arm
      will also be performed. For participants who undergo the optional biopsy two days after Dose
      2, two additional genital biopsies will be performed. Participants will also collect daily
      genital swabs for HSV PCR for 30 days after each vaccination.
