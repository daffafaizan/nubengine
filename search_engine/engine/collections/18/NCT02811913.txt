      touch or pain impairs the investigators' ability to interact with environment and diminished
      the quality of life. These sensory deficits significantly impair functional activity and slow
      down recovery during rehabilitation. Currently available sensory rehabilitation techniques
      can only partially restore sensory function. The main objective of this study is to test a
      novel approach to improve sensory function after stroke using non-invasive brain stimulation.
      This pilot study will measure an immediate effect of different repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) paradigms in a crossover single session design. The effect of
      intervention is measured with clinical measures of sensory and motor function and with
      neurophysiological assessment of sensory pathways. If the concept is demonstrated in this
      pilot study, then following the lead of other investigations of this type, this pilot will
      provide the foundation to test the efficacy of a long-term multi-session intervention of
      combined rTMS and peripherally directed therapy.
