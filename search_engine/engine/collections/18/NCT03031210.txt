      trial will be conducted in an urban, university-affiliated, tertiary care pediatric hospital
      ED. All patients three months old to 18 years of age who had symptoms and signs suggestive of
      non-severe community acquired pneumonia based on respiratory complaints and a pulmonary
      infiltrate identified by trained paediatricians or emergency physicians will be eligible to
      the present study. Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive either
      amoxicillin (90mg/kg per day) in twice or thrice daily regimen. Primary outcome will be
      treatment failure within 10 days of enrolment as defined by hospitalisation, need for a
      change in antibiotic (persistence of fever at 72 hours, clinical deterioration, comorbid
      condition or development of serious adverse reactions) and death. ED revisits within 72
      hours, second course of antibiotic and clinical recurrence rates will be evaluated in the
      follow-up assessments as well as percent of adverse events encountered, number of days missed
      (work, school or daycare), coverage vaccination rate, protocol adherence and patient and
      parental satisfaction. The primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach.
      Per-protocol analysis will also be carried to compare the failure rate. Accounting to a
      maximal 10% drop-off rate, a sample size of 685 participants per arm was calculated to have a
      power of 90% to identify a difference of â‰¤ 5% with an alpha value of 0.05.
