    
      The active arm of this study (medication related hospital discharge counseling by a
      pharmacist, home medications, and 7 day follow-up visit at a pharmacist run MTM clinic) is
      available to all subjects. To study the primary goal of reducing the 30 day readmission rate
      the data obtained from the active arm subjects will be compared to a match group of
      hospitalized patients that were previously discharged with a diagnosis of heart failure. The
      data for all secondary study goals will be obtained directly from the active arm subjects.
