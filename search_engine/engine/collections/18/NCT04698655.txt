    
      3-arm superiority online randomised controlled trial (delivered within one survey).
      Participants will complete an online survey, during which they will be presented with a
      hypothetical scenario asking them to imagine that they had recently developed knee pain and
      have gone to see their general practitioner. Participants will then be randomised to one of 3
      different groups (described below). Each group will be shown different types of educational
      material and asked to read the information carefully. Once they have finished reading the
      material, they will be asked to complete follow-up outcome measures to determine whether
      their beliefs about osteoarthritis management strategies have changed.

      The 3 trial groups are:

      I. Control group: asked to read a single-A4 page of brief osteoarthritis information ("what
      is osteoarthritis"); II. Treatment options group: asked to read brief osteoarthritis
      information + two A4 pages of information on treatment options ("osteoarthritis treatment
      options"), and; III. Treatment options + recommendation group: asked to read brief
      osteoarthritis information + information on treatment options + receive a hypothetical GP
      recommendation for exercise
