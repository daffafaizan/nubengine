      of the study. Men randomized to the control condition will receive standard PrEP care at each
      clinical site. Men randomized to the experimental condition will receive standard PrEP care
      and also will be asked to recruit a supportive contact from their social network. The support
      contact will then be engaged in a brief intervention designed to support their friend/family
      member around PrEP Care. Men and support contacts in the WERK intervention also will receive
      booster sessions via telephone and text. All participants will complete surveys at baseline
      and at three and twelve months post intervention.
