      in a single study arm. RhLF, at a dose of 1.5 g [1 vial], twice a day (b.i.d.), will be
      administered orally for two cycles each of 12 consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks off. A
      maximum of two additional cycles may be given if an objective response is obtained or if the
      patient has stable disease and no increase in the size of the target tumor(s) relative to
      either the Screening CT or the most recent CT measurement, measured according to RECIST prior
      to the additional cycle(s). Response and progression-free survival will be evaluated for the
      first 20 patients enrolled. If no patient has an objective response and less than 10% of the
      patients are alive and progression-free at 14 weeks from the start of Study Drug, then the
      study will be terminated. If in either Cycle 3 or Cycle 4, more than three out of the first
      ten patients or more than six out of the first twenty patients entering the cycle experience
      a Grade 3 or 4 Study-Drug-related adverse event, no further patients will advance into Cycle
      3 or Cycle 4.
