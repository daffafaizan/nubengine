      I. To determine the feasibility of conducting an exercise program during and after radiation
      therapy and to determine what percent of patients will complete the exercise program. (Pilot)
      II. To determine the percent increase in fitness as measured by the 6 minute walk test in
      women receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer randomized to an exercise program at 1
      year. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Percent adherence to exercise at 1 year as measured by the International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire and exercise logs.

      II. Subjective arm health at 1 year as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      Questionnaire for Breast Cancer version 4 (FACT-B+4).

      III. Arm lymphedema at 1 year as measured by arm circumference. IV. Arm range of motion at 1
      year as measured by goniometry. V. Quality of life at 1 year as measured by FACT-B+4. VI.
      Percent increase in arm strength as measured by one repetition maximum at 1 year.

      VII. Change in weight and body mass index (BMI) 1 year after completion of radiation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive usual care for 6 weeks during radiation therapy and for 12 weeks
      after completion of radiation therapy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo a supervised aerobic and strength training exercise session over
      40-60 minutes 3 times weekly for 6 weeks during radiation therapy and for 12 weeks after
      completion of radiation therapy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 year.
