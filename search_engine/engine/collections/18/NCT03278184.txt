      of analgesia. Moreover, the understanding of pain physiology at the molecular level supports
      the development of new specific drugs. Indeed, new neurophysiological models of pain
      processing by the brain are becoming exquisitely refined and are supported by
      electrophysiological and functional brain imaging studies. One of the interesting concepts
      that stemmed from these studies is the evidence that the experience of pain is reflected in
      the central nervous system by widespread activations and excitability changes within a
      network of interconnected cortical areas and subcortical structures. The network processing
      of noxious information and their limbic and emotional consequences has been termed the "pain
      matrix." The continuous observation of the activity and excitability changes that parallel
      the pain experience led to the development of a new therapeutic approach: the use of central
      nervous system stimulation techniques.
