      (validity and reliability) of a novel step test for the assessment of exercise capacity in
      patients with COPD.

      The investigators will perform two cross-sectional studies for validity and reliability in
      patients with COPD. Participants attending a pneumology consultation at the hospital will be
      asked for permission to be contacted about the study. The participants who agree will be seen
      by the principal investigator who will explain the nature of the study and assess eligibility
      for the study. The participants will sign informed consent.

      The validity study will be performed in two days (separated >48h). During the first session,
      the participants will perform the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) twice (a valid test for COPD). On
      the second day, the step test will be performed twice.

      The reliability study will be performed in two days (separated for 7 days). On both days, the
      step test will be performed one time.

      The investigators predict that 50 patients with COPD will be followed in each study (validity
      and reliability).

      The investigators hypothesize that the step test can be a good option to apply in pulmonary
      rehabilitation programs with good measurement properties for the assessment of exercise
      capacity in COPD patients. The validation of the test can contribute to applying the step
      modality in the exercise training as an alternative for the prescription of the exercise
      intensity. For that, the investigators also hypothesize that the test can be reliable and one
      test must be enough for the assessment of the patients.
