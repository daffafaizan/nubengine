    
      In contrast to reported short-term advantages of minimally invasive (MI) total hip
      arthroplasty (THA) there exists only limited scientific evidence concerning medium- to
      long-term benefits.

      The investigators therefore sought to answer the following questions: Is the functional
      medium-term outcome in THA patients with MI-anterior(MI-A) and MI-anterolateral (MI-AL)
      approach superior to those treated by direct lateral approach (DLA)? Is the level of life
      quality increased by MI-THA? Is patient satisfaction higher by MI-THA? Is the revision rate
      reduced by MI-THA?
