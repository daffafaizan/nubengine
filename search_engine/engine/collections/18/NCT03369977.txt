    
      A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial is designed to investigate the safety
      and efficacy of BioGlue as an adjunct for structural repair and hemostasis in Chinese
      subjects with acute type A aortic dissection. The trial consists of three phases:

      Phase One - A non-randomized, lead-in phase. During the lead-in phase, the first 2-3 eligible
      subjects at each center will receive BioGlue in open surgery. These subjects will be
      evaluated for safety separately from the randomized phase of the trial.

      Phase Two - A randomized, controlled phase. Type A aortic dissection subjects will be
      randomized into TSR group (control group) and surgical repair with BioGlue group (test group)
      with a ratio of 1:1, so that equal number of subjects in test and control groups can be
      ensured.

      Phase Three - A Follow-up of Late Safety Outcomes of using BioGlue in "The CHINA Trial" .
      Subjects enrolled in "The CHINA Trial," from both the BioGlue and the control (TSR) group,
      will be invited to participate. Clinical data evaluating mortality, adverse events, and
      re-operation rates will be collected from subject's medical charts.
