      of STX209 for management of typical problem behaviors in subjects with FXS. These are Study
      209FX301, "A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and
      Tolerability of STX209 (Arbaclofen) Administered for the Treatment of Social Withdrawal in
      Adolescents and Adults with Fragile X Syndrome;" Study 209FX302, "A Randomized, Double-Blind,
      Placebo-Controlled, Fixed- Dose Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of STX209
      (Arbaclofen) Administered for the Treatment of Social Withdrawal in Children with Fragile X
      Syndrome;" and Study 22002, "An Open-Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety,
      Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of STX209 in Subjects with Fragile X Syndrome." This study
      will enroll subjects who have completed Protocols 209FX301, 209FX302, or are currently
      participating in Protocol 22002 into a long-term, open-label study. The open-label extension
      protocol will provide data on the long-term safety and tolerability of STX209 among subjects
      with FXS who receive treatment under conditions reflective of their typical medical care
      rather than in their previously completed study.
