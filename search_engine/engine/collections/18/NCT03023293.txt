      Studies have shown that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are associated with
      improving insulin resistance and prevent type 2 diabetes in the general population; a newly
      discovered myokine, irisin, is associated with reduced insulin resistance and plays an
      important role in human glucose metabolism; and results from cell studies suggested that n-3
      PUFA might increase the expression of irisin. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that
      n-3 PUFA could improve glucose metabolism via the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT insulin signaling pathway by
      increasing expression of irisin and thus improving postpartum glucose metabolism in women
      with GDM. In order to test this hypothesis, the investigators plan to establish a prospective
      GDM cohort and collect related information at 24-28 weeks' gestation, 42 days postpartum, 1
      year postpartum and 2 years postpartum, respectively. Then the following would be tested: the
      changes of n-3 PUFA and irisin during pregnancy and after delivery, and their association
      with postpartum abnormal glucose metabolism; and the correlation of n-3 PUFA and irisin.
      Furthermore, using a cell model of insulin resistance the investigators would examine the
      dose-response and time-response relationships between n-3 PUFA and irisin, and next explore
      the role of irisin in n-3 PUFA regulation of IRS-1/PI3K/AKT insulin signaling pathway. This
      study would help to clarify the relationship between n-3 PUFA and irisin in regulating the
      glucose metabolism, and might provide scientific evidence for the prevention of type 2
      diabetes after GDM.
