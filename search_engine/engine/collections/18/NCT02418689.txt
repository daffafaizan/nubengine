    
      To evaluate the efficacy of NOV120101 (Poziotinib) as a therapeutic agent for
      HER2-overexpressed recurrent stage IV breast cancer, patients who have received at least two
      prior HER2-directed regimens will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will receive NOV120101
      (Poziotinib) 12 mg PO once daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week drug-free intervals between
      cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity development. Progression Free
      Survival (PFS) will be analyzed as the primary endpoint in this trial. Secondary endpoints
      including PFS rate at 12 weeks, ORR, DCR, OS and TTP will also be analyzed.
