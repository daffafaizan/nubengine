    
      TIRCON2012V1-EXT is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label study. All patients who completed
      the earlier study TIRCON2012V1 (NCT01741532) are eligible to take part. In the initial study,
      patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 18 months of treatment with either the
      iron chelator deferiprone or placebo, respectively. In this extension study, all participants
      will receive deferiprone for 18 months. Thus, depending on which product was received
      earlier, patients will be on deferiprone for a total of either 1.5 years or 3 years. As in
      the earlier study, assessments will be carried out every six months to look at the safety of
      the drug and to see if patients are showing any improvement in dystonia and other symptoms of
      PKAN.
