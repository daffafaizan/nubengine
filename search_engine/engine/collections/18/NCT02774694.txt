      all patients profit equally from such procedures. For those who do not benefit, the risk of
      potential complications is futile, and the resources are wasted. Therefore, a possibility to
      distinguish responding patients from non-responders would be important.

      Central pain sensitization has been related to poor outcome, and electrical pain and reflex
      thresholds are a good measure of pain hypersensitivity at least in chronic low back pain.
      Especially the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) threshold has been identified to correlate
      well with central pain hypersensibility. Successful interventional pain treatment has been
      shown to reverse central hypersensibility as measured by the NFR threshold.

      NFR threshold, in contrast to pain threshold, seems to be a measure independent of
      psychological factors. Thus the NFR threshold could give information independent of
      psychological factors in order to predict poor outcome of interventional pain management
      procedures.

      The study will be a prospective observational trial of diagnostic accuracy.
