    
      The drug being tested in this study is MLN4924. MLN4924 is being evaluated to assess
      drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with the moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors, fluconazole and
      itraconazole, respectively, in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study will look
      at the blood concentrations of MLN4924 as it relates to treatment with fluconazole and
      itraconazole.

      The study will enroll approximately 52 participants. In Part A, participants will be
      administered MLN4924 via a 1-hour (+- 5 minutes) intravenous (IV) infusion in combination
      with either fluconazole or itraconazole administered orally. After participants complete Part
      A, they will have the opportunity to begin treatment in Part B. In Part B, participants will
      be administered MLN4924 via a 1-hour (+- 5 minutes) IV infusion in combination with either
      docetaxel or carboplatin + paclitaxel, the three of which would also be administered
      intravenously.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participation in Part A of
      this study will include a screening visit and two weeks of treatment; participation in Part B
      of this study will include up to an 8-week drug washout period (from last dosing in Part A)
      and treatment until participants experience symptomatic deterioration, progressive disease,
      until treatment is discontinued for another reason, or until the study is stopped.
