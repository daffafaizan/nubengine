    
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a relatively common, distressing and disabling
      condition that may occur after trauma related events including injury. The emergence of Acute
      Stress Disorder shortly after the trauma appears to be a strong predictor of who will later
      develop PTSD (Brewin et al., 1999). Although SSRIs are commonly administered in general
      medical practice and have been demonstrated effective for the treatment of PTSD, there has
      not been systematic study of their use for the treatment of ASD, ASD symptoms, or the
      prevention of PTSD, and this study represents one of the first attempts to systematically
      evaluate their use for this indication.

      Sixty study participants (for 30 randomized) will be drawn from patients admitted to the
      Massachusetts General Hospital medical/surgical inpatient units for a traumatic injury that
      occurred in the prior 3 weeks. Study participants must meet criteria for the A1, A2 and at
      least one additional category of Acute Stress Disorder symptoms (i.e., B, C and or D
      criteria), as determined by the Acute Stress Disorder Interview upon initial evaluation, to
      qualify for randomization in a 12 week, double-blind flexible-dose treatment trial of
      escitalopram (10-40 mg/d) versus placebo.
