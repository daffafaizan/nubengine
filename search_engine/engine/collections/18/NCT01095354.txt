      respiratory disease (cystic fibrosis and asthma). However, the majority of studies have
      examined asthmatics with ongoing evidence of reversible disease on spirometry. There is a
      very limited body of research comparing LCI values in well-controlled asthmatics to healthy
      controls. Furthermore, the type of inflammation occurring in asthma may have a different site
      of action, we will prospectively study whether there is a difference in LCI between
      eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation to give us an indication of whether the site of
      non-eosinophilic inflammation is primarily in the small airways as well.
