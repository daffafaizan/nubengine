      platinum-based combination therapy can improve the objective response rate of patients with
      advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer by 20% to 28% and improve survival. Data
      from these published literatures suggest that the improvement in objective response rates is
      due mainly to patients with stable disease of chemotherapy. It has been reported that 15% of
      patients achieved objective remission after continuing treatment with the regimen after
      receiving 2 cycles of platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Therefore, the use of 2 cycles
      of chemotherapy after stabilization of patients with bevacizumab, hoping to improve the
      objective response rate of such patients 20%, and may improve survival. For the above
      reasons, design this study to validate our hypothesis.

      So a prospective cohort study has been designed to confirm this hypothesis, patients with
      advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma who are stable after two cycles of platinum-based
      combination chemotherapy are objects of this study, and they can choose to continue the
      previous treatment regimen according to the guideline or adding bevacizumab to the regimen
      independently until the progression or intolerance of toxicity, or 4 to 6 cycles of
      chemotherapy in stable disease. The objective response rate in these two groups who received
      different treatment is the primary endpoint and the toxicity, quality of life, the
      progression free survival are the second endpoints.
