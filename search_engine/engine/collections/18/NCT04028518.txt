      Patients with acute ischemic stroke need to undergo CT or MRI to exclude intracranial
      hemorrhage and perform NIHSS score before enrollment. Subjects who have passed the screening
      criteria according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to
      low-dose test drugs, high-dose test drugs or reference drugs for thrombolytic therapy at a
      ratio of 1:1:1. The random stratification factor is the thrombolysis time window ("≤3h" vs
      "3~4.5h").

      The start of administration of the study drug is recorded as 0h, CT or MRI and NIHSS score,
      laboratory test, and electrocardiogram were performed at 24 hours; NIHSS score was performed
      at 72 hours; NIHSS score，laboratory test and electrocardiogram were performed on the14th
      day(the start of administration is recorded as Day 1 ,then the 14th day after administration
      should be recorded as Day 15 ); mRS score and Barthel index score were performed on the 30th
      day (Day 31); mRS score and Barthel index score were performed on the 90th day (Day 91).
