      in Sao Paolo and Ribeir√£o Preto, Brazil. These were matched with and group of healthy
      controls.

      The functional state of superficial lymphatics in the lower leg will be investigated, using
      near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging. The capillary filtration of fluid and leakiness of
      the capillaries will be measured using strain gauge plethysmography and the peripheral blood
      flow will be measured using venous occlusion plethysmography. Furthermore, plasma
      concentration of noradrenaline will be estimated.
