      be due to immunosuppressive agents, however it is currently unknown the mechanisms by which
      this occurs. Dietary interventions have frequently been unsuccessful in these patients, which
      may be due to single-nutrient interventions and lack of support and guidance. This research
      will use stable isotope methods to estimate cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis to determine
      if these pathways are affected by immunosuppression in patients before and after islet and
      liver transplant. In addition, it will be determined if a multi-nutrient dietary intervention
      will be implemented post-transplant can reduce blood lipid levels in to prevent further
      polypharmacy these patients.
