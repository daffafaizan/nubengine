      (total 1 g/ day). The first testing took place on the screening day (baseline). Subsequently,
      participants were supplied with supplements for 19 days intervention (sachets which had to be
      dissolved in 200-ml water). After 19 days, participants were tested again (same tests as on
      the baseline day). An additional facet was the completion of a 'sleep diary', which asks
      questions about sleep quality and latency, and bed-time mood, as well as allowing recording
      of timing of supplement taking.
