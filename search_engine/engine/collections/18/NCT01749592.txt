      in one ear and severely impaired hearing in the other ear. The condition induces multiple
      changes of neural plasticity in central auditory pathways. One manifestation reflects an
      increased common activation of the contralateral and ipsilateral pathways after stimulation
      of the normal hearing ear which is correlated with an increased activity between the
      contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. As the left and right hemisphere are specialized
      for different auditory tasks, the proposed study aims at demonstrating different consequences
      of right or left-sided deafness for the affected individual. Furthermore, the question should
      be answered if auditory deficits and plastic changes can be partially reversed by cochlear
      implantation of the deaf ear. It is assumed that some changes induced by SSD can be detected
      only by reversal through a cochlear implant.
