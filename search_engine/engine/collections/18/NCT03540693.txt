      before RYGB surgery (n=15) SG surgery (n=15), and LAGB surgery (n=15), and then again after
      they lose ~16% of their body weight post-surgery. the investigators will also study the same
      variables in a cross-sectional design consisting of two groups: a weight success group (n=30)
      and a weight failure group (n=30) 2-5 years post RYGB or SG surgery. The weight success group
      will include subjects who lost â‰¥40% body weight by 2-5 years post-surgery and the weight
      failure group will include subjects who lost <25% body weight by 2-5 years post-surgery. In
      addition, the investigators will also explore the extent to which fat preferences and sensory
      perception in these subjects are affected by flavor related genes.
