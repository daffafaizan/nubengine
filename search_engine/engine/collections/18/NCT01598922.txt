      other barriers prevent many Soldiers from obtaining the help they need. Alternative mental
      health treatment approaches that mitigate stigma and increase access and compliance are
      greatly needed. One promising treatment approach that has shown efficacy in preliminary
      research and which may address issues related to stigma and barriers to care, is
      internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT). Internet-based treatments offer brief,
      interactive, and structured treatment approaches that can be completed by individuals
      relatively anonymously, in the convenience and privacy of their own homes, and according to
      their own schedules. Such interventions could offer Soldiers an alternative treatment method
      that minimizes stigma by allowing private and quasi-anonymous access to treatment and which
      minimizes barriers to care by enhancing access and maximizing schedule flexibility.

      Emerging evidence suggests that iCBT is a particularly promising and well-accepted approach
      for treating large numbers of individuals while minimizing cost and clinicians' time demand.
      The study of internet-based and other computer-assisted therapies is currently in its infancy
      and most studies still lack sufficient methodological rigor to firmly establish the efficacy
      and applicability of these approaches. The proposed project will provide the most
      comprehensive evaluation of iCBT to date by employing functional neuroimaging techniques,
      neurocognitive testing of implicit negative biases and responses to negative feedback, and
      assessment of resilience and coping capacities in addition to standard symptom-based outcome
      measures.
