      the study. Face to face interviews are held with the female participants based on the
      Information Forms and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)", "EORTC QLQ-BR23 Quality of Life
      Questionnaire", "Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)", "Body Cathexis
      Scale (BCS)" and "BETTER Model". Counselling programme of the women in the intervention group
      is held in four sessions one week apart and these women are provided with a counselling
      booklet accompanied by a CD. The scales are re-applied one month after the last session. In
      the control group, the women are left under routine hospital control after the scales are
      applied. The scales are re-applied to the control group after one month.
