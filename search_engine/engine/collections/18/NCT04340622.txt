      superior to a sham comparison treatment. The treatment is hoped to significantly aid in the
      battle against the opioid epidemic that is ravaging much of the country and the world. The
      treatment consists of using a 4-minute application of transcranial photobiomodulation, near
      infra-red mode, through a supra-luminous LED, to one side of the forehead over the brain
      hemisphere that we determine (through a proprietary test) to have a more positive emotional
      valence. Based on preliminary data, we anticipate that the treatment will be very effective
      in reducing drug cravings, anxiety, and depression as well as in reducing relapses. Aim I
      will offer twice-weekly treatments to two groups, active and sham, for 4-weeks and will look
      specifically for differences in opioid cravings, anxiety, depression, and opioid use. The
      investigators will evaluate participants weekly for safety and efficacy for 3-weeks
      post-treatment. In Aim II a highly-regarded product engineer will work with the company to
      design a marketable product that may have patentable elements.
