      of a short course to treatment of latent tuberculosis infection during 3 months with the
      standard course for 6 months.

      Methods: Prospective, comparative, randomized and open trial of patients with positive TST
      and the suitable criteria for treatment, in accordance with the guidelines of the CDC,
      excluding HIV infection. the group I was assigned to isoniazid (H) at a dose of 300 mg per
      day for 6 months and the group II was assigned to isoniazid at a dose of 300 mg per day plus
      rifampin (R) (600 mg per day) for 3 months. The patients were followed for five years.

      Results: 105 patients were included, of which 9 refused the treatment; 45 patients were
      included in the group I and 51 patients in the group II. Both groups were comparable at base
      level. The hepatotoxicity was 44% in the group 6H and 29% in the group 3HR (p = 0,07). The
      hepatotoxicity was severe in 6.7% in the group 6H and 5.8% in the group 3HR; these obliged
      the suspension of treatment in 4.4% and 1.9%, respectively (p =NS). The proportion of
      patients who completed the study treatment was 75.6% of the patients in the group 6H, and
      90.2% in the group 3HR (p = 0,05). Only a case of tuberculosis was detected in the second
      month treatment with 6H.

      Conclusion: In the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, a short course with isoniazid
      plus rifampin during 3 months shown better compliance with a lower percentage of abandonment
      that the course 6H. Tolerance is similar in the two courses.
