      (dementia) is expected to triple. The National Alzheimer's Plan recognizes that while the
      number of persons with dementia (PWD) is increasing substantially, the healthcare and long
      term care systems are unprepared to provide high quality, effective and efficient care to the
      PWD and their caregivers. PWD often have many behavioral and psychological symptoms of
      dementia (BPSD) including agitation, depression and sleep disturbances that affect both the
      quality of life (QOL) of the PWD and the caregiver. Unfortunately, due to a lack of programs
      to insert evidence-based care into the community, and hospice system specifically, PWD
      receive inappropriate and even harmful care. We have developed the Aliviado Dementia Care
      Program (formerly known as the Dementia Symptom Management at Home Program, or DSM-H) to
      implement dementia friendly care for PWD and their caregivers in the community. Initially
      developed for use in home healthcare (HHC), we have modified the program for use in hospice.
      The Aliviado Dementia Care-Hospice Edition is a systems level quality assurance performance
      improvement (QAPI) program that includes workforce training, and agency level workflow
      changes.
