    
      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested in adult
      participants with advanced solid tumors or relapsed refactory lymphoma. The study will look
      at the effect of the pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the body) of alisertib in
      the presence and absence of itraconazole.

      This is an open label study. Participants will receive:

        -  Alisertib tablets 30 mg in Part A and 50 mg in Part B

        -  Itraconazole oral solution 200 mg in Part A

      Participation in Part A is approximately 25 days. Part B participation is repeating 21-day
      cycles. The maximum duration of treatment with alisertib will be 12 months (approximately 16
      cycles) unless it is determined by the investigator, with agreement by the sponsor, that a
      participant would derive clinical benefit from continued treatment beyond 12 months.

      This multi-center study will take place in the United States.
