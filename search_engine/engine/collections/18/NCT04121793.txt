      Parkinson's disease (PD) who would benefit from advanced therapies (AT) and identify when AT
      recipients are in need of a therapy adjustment. This system will integrate ambulatory PD
      monitoring with context aware activity detection as the daily activities a patient performs
      are often the best predictors of quality of life (QoL). In this study the Kinesia 360 system
      will collect motion data to measure tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement), and dyskinesia
      (involuntary movements) from individuals with PD to track their symptoms throughout the day.
      A smartphone will collect information on subject location and activity using the GPS,
      accelerometers, and microphone within the phone to find correlations between activity and
      patient wellness. This data will be used to improve detection over time and predict whether
      patients are candidates for advanced therapies.
