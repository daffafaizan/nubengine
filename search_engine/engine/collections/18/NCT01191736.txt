      of its kind to examine the efficacy of ultra-brief video training for Hands-Only CPR without
      the use of a manikin. The results will inform future efforts to mass train citizens in CPR.
      Subjects were randomized to one of four training conditions, then assessed for CPR skills
      retention. The four groups were 1) no training; 2) ultra-brief training video (90 seconds);
      3) short training video (5 minutes) with no practice; and 4) short training video with
      hands-on practice. The subjects were then evaluated for CPR skills retention. One half of the
      subjects were evaluated on the training day, and the other half were evaluated two months
      later.
