      I. To compare 8-week postoperative function among elderly patients between sites randomized
      to implement the OPTI-Surg toolkit with or without a coach versus sites randomized to usual
      care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare postoperative morbidity between sites randomized to implement the OPTI-Surg
      toolkit with or without a coach versus sites randomized to usual care.

      II. To compare the penetration of the OPTI-Surg toolkit between sites randomized to implement
      the OPTI-Surg toolkit with a coach versus sites randomized to implement the OPTI-Surg toolkit
      without a coach.

      Trial Design:

      OUTLINE: Healthcare providers/institutions are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.
      Patients/participants receive the intervention based on which arm their healthcare provider
      is in.

      ARM I: Healthcare providers/institutions perform usual care.

      ARM II: Healthcare providers/institutions receive OPTI-Surg training and informational
      materials.

      ARM III: Healthcare providers/institutions receive OPTI-Surg training and informational
      materials and meet with a coach.

      After conclusion of study, participants are followed up at 8 and 12 weeks post surgery, and
      healthcare providers/institutions are followed up 6-9 months after the last patient is
      registered.
