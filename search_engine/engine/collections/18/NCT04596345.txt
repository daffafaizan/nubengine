      a series of job changes before life trajectories clarify and more lasting decisions are
      possible. These changes often produce distress and they might explain why most of the
      symptoms that impact the individual's mental health throughout their lives appear at this
      stage, although full-blown disorders are often only diagnosed subsequently. There are several
      studies that describe the prevalence of mental disorders in this age group, however, there
      are few studies that refer to how psychological distress changes during this phase of
      emotional, social, and financial instability. The few existent studies refer mostly to
      college student populations, with relative neglect of the non-student populations.

      The objective of this study is to analyze the intraindividual changes in psychological
      distress of emerging adults over one year. These changes will be compared between those
      participants who are college students and those who are not. Sociodemographic data will be
      recorded in the first assessment and the last assessment, while psychological distress and
      health-related quality of life will be monitored bimonthly for seven assessment points in
      total. Everyday relevant events will be also recorded bimonthly for seven assessment points,
      and this information will be used as a time-varying covariate. An electronic survey will be
      used for data collection through formr system (https://formr.org/).

      The results of this research will show if the distress changes significantly in the studied
      population for one year and it will be possible to identify some of the events and variables
      that are related to these changes. This knowledge might help to create interventions that are
      tailored to the needs of this population.
