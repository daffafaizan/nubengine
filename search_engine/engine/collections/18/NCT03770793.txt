      surgical view. However, pulmonary complications such as hypoxemia may be caused by OLV which
      might be preventable with adequate alveolar recruitment and positive end-expiratory
      pressure(PEEP). Alveolar recruitment has been performed with conventional methods without
      diagnostic tools in clinical setting.

      Ultrasound is a non-invasive, radiation-free device with high accuracy for the diagnosis of
      lung atelectasis. There are a few reports regarding the usefulness of lung ultrasound in
      other surgeries, but not in thoracic surgeries with OLV.

      Thus, investigators designed a study to observe the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided
      alveolar recruitment in thoracic surgery with OLV.
