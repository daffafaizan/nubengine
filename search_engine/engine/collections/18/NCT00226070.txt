      participated in a questionnaire study using SF- 36. The aim was to document self-rated health
      among this population.

      Fase 2: Results from the cross section study form the base for the RCT, where 160 patients
      over 65 years undergoing THR, 80 patients are in an intervention group and 80 patients in a
      control group. A nurse intervention program is tested, and results from the study will form
      the base for a structured rehabilitation program.
