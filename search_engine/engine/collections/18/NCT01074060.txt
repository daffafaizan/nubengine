    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous(IV) PLERIXAFOR when given in
      combination with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF as a mobilization regimen in patients with
      Multiple Myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if intravenous PLERIXAFOR, given with a cyclophosphamide and G-CSF mobilizing
      regimen, will allow collection of greater than or equal to 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg in 2 or
      less apheresis days.

      II. To review the timing of intravenous plerixafor administration prior to apheresis and
      describe our experience.

      OUTLINE:

      MOBILIZATION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV). Patients also receive
      filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning approximately 24 hours later.

      TREATMENT/APHERESIS: Beginning 10 days after cyclophosphamide, patients receive plerixafor IV
      over 30 minutes followed by filgrastim SC on each day of apheresis.

      Following the collection of an adequate number of stem cells, patients undergo high-dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue. Patients are followed post-autologous stem cell
      transplant for engraftment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
