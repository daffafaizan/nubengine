      patients. Vitiligo is caused by an immune-mediated destruction of melanocytes, or the cells
      responsible for producing melanin, which gives the skin its pigment. There are safe and
      effective treatments for vitiligo, which should be selected based on disease subtype, the
      percentage of body surface area involved, patient preference, and the impact of the disease
      on a patient's quality of life. Treatment aims to stabilize depigmented lesions, reduce
      disease progression and stimulate repigmentation. The current therapies available include
      topical and systemic immunosuppressants, phototherapy and surgical techniques.

      The autologous transplantation of hair follicles has the ability to treat hairless areas by
      introducing follicular stem cells to an area of skin that would otherwise not respond to
      current treatment options. The potential to treat glabrous areas is of particular relevance
      for this technique, and the question proposed in this study is whether the same procedure of
      follicular hair transplant that has been previously safely and successfully used to treat
      segmental/stable vitiligo in hair bearing areas can applied to treat vitiligo in glabrous
      skin.
