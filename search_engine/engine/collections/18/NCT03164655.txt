      oxaliplatin plus IV FOLFIRI plus targeted therapy (anti-epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) or bevacizumab) to conventional systemic CT alone plus targeted therapy (anti-EGFR or
      antiangiogenic antibody), in patients with liver-only CRLM not amenable to curative-intent
      resection (and/or ablation) after systemic induction CT in terms of conversion to complete
      (R0 R1) resection (or ablation) rate (CRR).
