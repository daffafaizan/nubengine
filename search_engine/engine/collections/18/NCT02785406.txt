      arousal/sleep, stress, and cue-induced reinstatement of drug taking (e.g., relapse). The role
      of stress/anxiety and drug cue reactivity in human drug relapse is well established, but to
      date, the role of the orexin system in modulating these phenomena has not been examined in
      humans with substance use disorders (e.g., cocaine). The goal of the present first-in-human
      study will be to examine the effects of an orexin antagonist (suvorexant) on interactions
      among stress/anxiety, sleep, and drug-cue reactivity. The study will utilize a battery of
      highly sensitive, drug-specific, laboratory measures of drug cue reactivity (a relapse risk
      model), and well-established metrics of stress/anxiety and sleep. The hypothesis is that
      antagonism of the orexin system will attenuate the link between (1) stress/anxiety and drug
      cue reactivity, and (2) sleep and drug cue reactivity. These results will elucidate a unique
      biochemical mechanism for understanding relapse, and provide a potential medication target
      for relapse prevention.
