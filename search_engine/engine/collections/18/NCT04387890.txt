      care and organization of care teams. SARS-CoV-2 antibody assessment provides a tool to
      evaluate antibody prevalence in hospital staff identifying previously exposed individuals.
      Serologic testing could identify new cases of COVID-19 in an early fashion and could help to
      investigate cases of reactivation or reinfection in hospital workers. The study purpose is to
      conduct a study using serological screening for health care workers in a University Hospital
      in Buenos Aires in order to assess the risk of COVID-19 on those who have not developed an
      immune response against the virus, or to detect it in an early fashion (either
      pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic). If a study participant is suspected to have potential
      reinfection or reactivation of COVID-19, the investigators will conduct genome sequencing in
      order to be able to differentiate each case. The investigators will include 50 participants
      chosen at random among health care workers from the hospital Emergency Department (ED),
      Internal Medicine wards, or Critical Care Units who are exposed to COVID-19. Participants who
      agree to join the study and sign the informed consent form will be screened at baseline for
      SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies, along with a physical exam and basic laboratory
      determinations. They will be re-screened with antibodies every 2 weeks for a total of 3
      months. If they contract COVID-19, antibody determinations and nasopharyngeal swabs will be
      carried out in order to identify those who are in favorable conditions to return to work. The
      main objective is to prospectively determine the incidence of COVID-19, Anti SARS-CoV-2
      antibody prevalence, and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection or reactivation of COVID-19 in a
      health care workers cohort.
