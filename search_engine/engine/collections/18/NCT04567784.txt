      neural circuits associated with the effects of CBD on craving and anxiety. Secondly, the
      investigators will conduct 1H MRS to characterize in-vivo neurochemical levels associated
      with CBD administration. Altogether, the data obtained will fill critical gaps of knowledge
      important in the development of a potential non-opioid medication for treating opioid use
      disorder.

      CBD has been shown to be safe in association with opioid use and not to have severe side
      effects. The oral CBD solution (Epidiolex) to be used in the current study is approved by the
      FDA for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of childhood
      epilepsy. This study will investigate the neurobiological effects of CBD which is critical
      for its development as a potential treatment for heroin use disorder in the future. Study
      participation duration will last 2 weeks and will include MRI imaging; CBD/placebo
      administration; MRI tasks such as the resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI); and
      questionnaires measuring craving, anxiety, depression, elements of cognitive function, and
      psychiatric history.

      Screening: Study candidates will be recruited through flyers, ads and referrals from AIMS
      clinics. At the initial phone contact candidates will be screened for exclusion criteria and
      provided study information and, if they remain interested and no exclusion criteria are
      encountered, invited for in-person screening. Candidates will then undergo the informed
      consent procedure, be fully screened for eligibility and complete baseline assessments.

      Randomization: Participants will be randomly assigned to either CBD or Placebo condition.
