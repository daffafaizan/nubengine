    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the effect of rosiglitazone on biochemical control in patients with newly
           diagnosed ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor (Cushing disease).

      Secondary

        -  To assess the effect of this drug on corticotrophin (CRH)-stimulated pituitary tumor
           ACTH secretion.

        -  To assess the overall safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  To assess the overall quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Percentage of Reduction in 24-hour Urinary-free Cortisol Levels

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral rosiglitazone once daily for 7 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood, urine, and saliva samples are collected periodically for laboratory studies.
      Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 [IL-6], serum sialic acid, soluble
      intracellular and vascular adhesion molecules [sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1], and amyloid A) are
      measured at baseline and at the completion of study treatment; salivary cortisol and 24-hour
      urinary-free cortisol levels are measured at baseline and weekly during study treatment;
      dexamethasone suppression tests with serum cortisol and corticotrophin (CRH) stimulation test
      are performed at baseline and at the completion of study treatment; prolactin, insulin-like
      growth factor-1 (IGF1), thyroid function, and sex steroid hormones are measured at baseline
      and at the completion of study treatment; and dynamic pituitary function testing
      (arginine/growth hormone-releasing hormone [GHRH] testing to measure growth hormone
      secretion) is performed at baseline.
