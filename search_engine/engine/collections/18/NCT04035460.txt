      endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately an invasive approach to
      support is associated with risks of lung injury, infection, need for heavy sedation, and
      increased mortality. Non-invasive oxygen delivery, by mask (BiPAP or CPAP), high flow nasal
      cannula or helmet interface, is better tolerated and reduces risks associated with invasive
      mechanical ventilation. A growing body of medical literature and clinical experience suggests
      that non-invasive oxygen delivery can prevent the need for endotracheal intubation in some
      patients. This proposal will compare two different modes of non-invasive oxygen delivery:
      helmet and high flow nasal cannula.
