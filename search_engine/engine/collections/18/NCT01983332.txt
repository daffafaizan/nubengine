    
      The study will occur at MDACC, a comprehensive cancer center in the Texas Medical Center
      (TMC) in Houston. The center is the largest freestanding comprehensive cancer center in the
      world. The facility provides inpatient and outpatient services and supports research and
      education.

      The facility has more than 50 buildings in the greater Houston area and in central Texas. The
      setting for this study will be the rehabilitation services area on the main campus in the
      TMC.

      There are private offices, conference rooms and treatment areas where video chats and monthly
      meetings will occur.

      The study is projected to occur over a one year period. Sessions will be videotaped (video
      chats - initial and follow ups and monthly group meetings) for further review. Analysis of
      the tapes will provide data for further research and education presentations. Sessions will
      also be audiotaped and transcribed for further review and data analysis purposes. Neither the
      videotapes nor audiotapes will be shared with anyone at the facility or any uninvolved
      parties. Audiotapes and videotapes will be stored in locked file cabinets and password
      protected computers will be used to view and analyze the audio and video tapes. Only the
      research team will have access to the stored data locked in the file cabinet.
