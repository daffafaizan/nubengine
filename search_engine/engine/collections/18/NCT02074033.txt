      will be assessed initially prescribed antibiotics empirically and what conduct adopted after
      culture results.

      We will be examined whether the antibiotic prescribed following the orientation of
      literature, considering the dose, interval between doses, dose adjustment for renal failure
      infusion time, treatment time and conduct after the culture results (deescalation, escalation
      or maintenance of antimicrobial initially prescribed ) . The deescalation consists of
      discontinuing the use of antimicrobial or antibiotic change to another with lower coverage
      and spectrum is performed, escalation occurs when adding a new antibiotic or antibiotic to
      change the coverage of other larger spectrum after culture results .
