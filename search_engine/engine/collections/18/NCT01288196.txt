    
      This is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      volunteer, physician, or study staff will know the identity of the assigned treatment), study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (blood levels of drug) and
      immunogenicity (development of antibodies to the drug) of a single dose of CNTO 6785
      administered to healthy adult volunteers intravenously (in the vein) or by subcutaneous
      (under the skin) administration to healthy adult volunteers.This will be the first
      administration of CNTO 6785 to humans; therefore, no clinical experience is available.
      Healthy volunteers will receive a single dose of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg of CNTO 6785 or placebo as
      a 30-minute intravenous (IV) (injection into a blood vessel) infusion or a single dose of 3
      mg/kg of CNTO 6785 administered in up to 3 subcutaneous (under the skin) (SC) injections.
