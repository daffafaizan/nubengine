    
      The main objective of this study is to expand the genetic and pathophysiological knowledge of
      this disease. For this, the following points will be developed:

        -  Identification of mutations in the B-RAF oncogene in Spanish patients with pulmonary
           LCHF.

        -  Development of ultrasensitive genetic analysis methods capable of identifying mutations
           in B-RAF in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples.

        -  To determine if patients with mutations in the B-RAF oncogene present distinct clinical,
           radiological and / or functional characteristics compared to those with absence of the
           mutation.

        -  Characterization of the inflammatory profile of patients with HPCL.
