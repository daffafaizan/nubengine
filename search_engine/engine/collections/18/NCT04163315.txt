      fMRI) with a specific High Resolution Angular Diffusion (HARDI) sequence and a functional
      acquisition at rest. Then, the investigators will record their cortico-cortical evoked
      potentials elicited by direct electrostimulation during the surgery, just before the tumor
      removal, following our usual protocol. Finally, all data (clinical, diffusion, electrical and
      functional connectivity) will be processed and correlated to each other.
