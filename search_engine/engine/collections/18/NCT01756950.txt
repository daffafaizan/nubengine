    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study will enroll up to 5
      cohorts of healthy subjects. Eight subjects will be enrolled in each cohort and will receive
      a single 2-hour intravenous infusion of CR8020 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects) on Day 1.
      Subjects will be dosed in pairs of two. Once all subjects in a cohort have completed Study
      Day 8, the preliminary safety data will be reviewed. Provided that no safety issues are
      identified, dose escalation to the subsequent cohort may be permitted. After the completion
      of Cohort 5 enrollment, and the preliminary safety and tolerability of the 50mg/kg dose is
      demonstrated, a sixth cohort will be enrolled. Cohort 6 will be comprised of 24 subjects
      (randomized 5:1 to CR8020 30 mg/kg or placebo) who will receive 2-hour intravenous infusions
      on Days 1 and 8.
