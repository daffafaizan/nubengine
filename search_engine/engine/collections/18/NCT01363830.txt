      restriction" group. Subjects will also be asked to provide/complete:

        -  demographical information

        -  VAS back and leg score

        -  Modified Oswestry questionnaire

      All of the surgeries will be performed using a so-called limited discectomy in which the
      herniated disc fragment is removed without an aggressive disc space curettage. Prior to
      surgery, the subjects' discs will be classified by the Primary Investigator and Site
      Responsible Investigator on a T-2 weighted MRI according to the Carragee Disc Herniation
      Classification system.

      The discs will be reassessed intraoperatively by the surgeon to confirm the assigned
      classification. In addition, a radiologist will review a random sampling set of discs on T-2
      weighted MRI to eliminate bias and validate the classifications.

      Subjects will be followed for a 2 year time period with study visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3
      months, 1 year, and 2 years. At every follow-up visit, the following will be completed and/or
      documented:

        -  A reherniation (any clinical symptoms of a reherniation will be verified and documented
           by MRI)

        -  Return to full activity and/or work (date)

        -  VAS back and leg score

        -  Modified Oswestry questionnaire
