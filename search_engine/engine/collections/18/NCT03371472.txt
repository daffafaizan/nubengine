      patients with isolated PVL or to those with a very high risk of repeat surgery. The
      transcatheter approach involves deployment of occlude devices or coils and adopting either a
      percutaneous or a transapical approach. Limitation of such approach is the fact that no
      PVL-dedicated device is available on the market, and either vascular-specific plugs or other
      types of occluders used commonly for closure of ventricular septal defects or patent ductus
      arteriosus can be used. Several technical issues can make the procedure challenging.

      The primary problem is the localization and track of the canal which can be very difficult to
      engage and cross with the guidewire. Also the maneuverability of the guide catheter in often
      enlarged left atrium and the passage of the occluder device through narrow and serpiginous
      canal between calcified annulus and sewing ring is challenging.

      Clearly the limitations of current devices and increasing number of patients with significant
      PVL warrant the attempts to design and validate new PVL-dedicated devices in the context of
      computer modeling, bench testing, preclinical evaluation and clinical translation. These
      devices, as sizing balloon, could significantly simplify and shorten the procedure, decrease
      the risk of complications and incomplete defect closure as well as optimize
      cost-effectiveness of the procedure by decreasing number of the occluders.
