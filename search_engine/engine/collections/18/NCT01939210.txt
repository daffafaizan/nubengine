      I. To evaluate the influence of regular breathing cycles using breathing relaxation
      techniques on efficacy of the respiratory-gated treatment as measured by: (1) real-time
      position management (RPM) parameters; (2) end inspiration or expiration length; (3) changes
      in gate width.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of breathing relaxation techniques on: (1) psychosocial outcomes;
      (2) treatment compliance.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Patients and staff members complete structured interviews at baseline.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients participate in 3 50-minute breathing training sessions, including a
      psycho-educational component and meditation-based breathing training, over 10 days. Patients
      then undergo four dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) on day 14 and undergo image-guided
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or standard radiation therapy 5 times a week for
      up to 5 fractions or 25 fractions, respectively.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard care over 10 days. Patients then undergo 4D-CT on day 14
      and undergo image-guided SBRT or standard radiation therapy 5 times a week for up to 5
      fractions or 25 fractions, respectively.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 or 5 weeks.
