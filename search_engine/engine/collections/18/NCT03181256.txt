      I. To provide screening for lung cancer in an underserved and high risk population for lung
      cancer.

      II. To collect clinical and demographic information and research bio specimens prospectively
      on high risk individuals.

      III. To analyze the association between suspected lung cancer risk factors and outcomes such
      as pre-malignant lesions and diagnosis of lung cancer.

      IV. To identify and validate biomarkers that are associated with lung cancer risk factors and
      premalignant lesions.

      V. To assess the association between patient characteristics and test results to the genetic
      and histological characteristics of lung preinvasive lesions and cancers.

      VI. To describe this high-risk cohort and to identify the patients eligible for future
      clinical trials (e.g. chemoprevention).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years and undergo collection of sputum, nasal
      epithelium, buccal epithelium, blood, and urine samples. Patients also undergo pulmonary
      function tests, chest CT, and review of medical records.
