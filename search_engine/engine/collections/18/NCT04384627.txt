      patients with newly-diagnosed locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients
      treated with induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The intervention is
      delineating the gross tumor volume according to pretreatment tumor extension (the pre-IC GTV
      group) or post-induction chemotherapy tumor extension (the post-IC GTV group). The objective
      is to compare the long-term locoregional control, survival rate, late toxicity and quality of
      life between the two groups.
