      endometrial cavity affecting almost 10% of the women of reproductive age. Although benign, it
      disrupts the quality of life of the inflicted patients through symptoms such as dysmenorrhae,
      dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility. The pathogenesis of endometriosis has not
      yet been clearly elucidated, however, recent papers implies an underpinning role of
      inflammation There is a limited number of studies about the levels of these parameters in
      endometriosis and to date, no report is available on the levels of adropin and netrin-1 in
      endometriosis. Likewise, according to the investigator's literature search, no research
      explaining the association of endometriosis with insulin resistance has yet been published.
      In present study, in an attempt to describe inflammatory pathways playing a role in
      endometriosis pathogenesis, Investigators aimed to measure the levels of serum adropin,
      salusin-Î±, netrin-1, and nesfatin-1, anti-inflammatory effects of which have been priorly
      demonstrated, and to find out any association of them with insulin resistance.
