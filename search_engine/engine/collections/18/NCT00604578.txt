      measures. Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos [R]) is a highly selective and potent agonist for
      the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma). Studies in murine models
      of allergic asthma have shown that PPAR gamma-agonists down-regulate allergen-mediated airway
      inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. This protocol is a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group (phase II) pilot study of the efficacy and
      safety of pioglitazone for the treatment of patients with allergic asthma and reversible
      airflow obstruction who are persistently symptomatic despite therapy with high doses of
      inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting Beta 2-agonists. The primary end-point
      for this study will be the change in airflow obstruction, as measured by the
      post-bronchodilator FEV1. Secondary end-points will include indices of airway inflammation,
      airflow obstruction, airway hyperreactivity, and asthma symptoms.
