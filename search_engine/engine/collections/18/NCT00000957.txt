      no cure for AIDS. It is likely that ultimate control of the disease depends on the
      development of safe and effective vaccines against HIV.

      Thirty healthy adult volunteers without identifiable high-risk behavior for HIV-1 are
      randomly assigned to receive vaccination with gp160 (50 mcg) according to one of the
      following schedules: Group 1 receives vaccine on days 0, 28, 56, and 140 and placebo on days
      84 and 112; Group 2 receives vaccine on days 0, 28, 56, 84, and 112 and placebo on day 140.
      Subjects are followed for 1 year after the last injection. Per 05/13/94 amendment, 10
      subjects at the St. Louis University site receive an additional boost 18-24 months after the
      last injection.
