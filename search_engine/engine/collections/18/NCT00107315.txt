      Primary

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in older patients with metastatic colorectal
           cancer treated with bevacizumab and capecitabine as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the median survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily
      on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-16 months.
