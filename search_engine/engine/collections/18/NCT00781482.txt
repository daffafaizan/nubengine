      (labs, EKGs, medical history, physical exam, and MRI of the brain) for safety. If eligible,
      they will return for three separate positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Over the course
      of the three study visits, each subject will receive eszopiclone (Lunesta), zolpidem (ambien)
      and a placebo in random order.

      After each medication or placebo dose, a PET scan will be done using a [11-C] flumazenil
      (Romazicon). The flumazenil will help us measure the binding of the study medications to
      chemical receptors called GABA receptors in certain parts of the brain.
