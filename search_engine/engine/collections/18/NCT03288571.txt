      after normal full term delivery.

      Samples will be tested for any bacterial or fungal growth as well as endotoxin and
      mycoplasma. The specific markers for MSCs identification will be analyzed by flow cytometry.

      Cell suspension will then be injected in the renal parenchyma of patients diagnosed with
      diabetic nephropathy.
