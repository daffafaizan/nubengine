    
      Rituximab combined with anthracycline based chemotherapy is the most common first-line
      treatment for subjects with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Subjects requiring
      second-line therapy will most often receive rituximab in combination with salvage
      chemotherapy as an induction therapy prior to autologous stem cell transplant. With rituximab
      being in first-line therapy, the response rates for subjects receiving rituximab plus salvage
      chemotherapy has significantly decreased. Treatment with ofatumumab may be able to overcome
      the resistance to rituximab in the second-line setting and offer improved response rates. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate of ofatumumab in combination
      with ICE or DHAP chemotherapy prior to autologous stem cell transplant. Additional objectives
      are to evaluate the complete response rate, ability to mobilize cluster of differentiation
      (CD)34+ cells, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.
