      2013. The parent study is a prospective cohort study of the effects of chronic stress in a
      group of maternal caregivers with children on the autism spectrum and healthy controls whose
      children have no diagnosis. Study participants are being invited to enroll in a 12-week
      stress reduction course based on the principles of mindfulness. They will attend four
      six-hour workshops and participate in 12 weekly hour-long web video conferencing calls to
      reinforce what is taught in the workshops.

      At the beginning and the end of the intervention, they complete self-report measures of
      psychological well-being and give saliva samples. Since the women are also participating in
      the longitudinal study, we have other before and after data for them. These include
      psycho-social measures, body measurements, psycho-physiology measurements, cognitive tests,
      actigraphy (for sleep), as well as saliva (for hormones), hair (for hormones) and blood (for
      telomeres, telomerase, gene expression, circulating hormones, inflammation and oxidative
      stress).
