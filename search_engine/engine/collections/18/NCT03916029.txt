      education outcomes than their non-Indigenous peers. Chronic otitis media and hearing loss
      during early childhood are associated with lower scores for these outcomes. Local problem:
      Failure to meet child health program schedules and evidence based practice in ear and hearing
      health is linked to high turnover of the health workforce, inadequate clinical skills and
      poor knowledge of ear and hearing health needs of children.

      This Hearing for Learning Initiative aims to improve health care and education services.

      Interventions: The intervention involves training and employing non-professional community
      members to facilitate busy primary health care services to deliver evidence-based ear and
      hearing health assessments in children 0 to 16 years of age, and to facilitate the teaching
      and home learning of hearing impaired children (the intervention).

      Trial design: A stepped-wedge community (n=18) cluster-randomised trial will compare the
      proportion of children receiving an ear assessment (primary outcomes) in the HfLI
      (intervention) periods with no HfLI (control) periods. Participating communities will be
      randomly assigned in 6-monthly steps to shift from control to intervention on pre-specified
      start dates.

      Outcomes: the primary outcome is the change in the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
      Islander children who receive an ear assessment, between intervention and control periods.
