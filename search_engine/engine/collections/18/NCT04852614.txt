      once they decide to stop breastfeeding. Treatment will be initiated once the women decide to
      wean their children and a warning will be given to abstain from any breast-feeding once
      treatment is started. This treatment is prescribed by the physician either the patients
      choose to participate in the study or not. In addition, effective contraceptive methods
      should be used. The treatment consists of SOF/DAC: 400 mg sofosbuvir and 60 mg daclatasvir
      administered with food for 12 weeks.

      All recruited patients will be screened for the following data at baseline: Serum creatinine,
      bilirubin, albumin, AST, ALT, prothrombin time (PT), CBC, and viral load by PCR. The
      patient's general and demographic information (age, gender, height, and weight),
      comorbidities, and concurrent medications will be assessed and recorded in a specially
      designed patient data sheet.

      The study will be conducted in the Faculty of Medicine Ain-Shams Research Institute Clinical
      Research Center (MASRI -CRC). After the first dose, women will be instructed to express their
      milk and discard it on the first two days and come to the research center on the third day
      for plasma and milk sampling. Patients will be instructed to take the dose on time especially
      the day before sampling. They will be asked to record the time of dose administration. They
      might be also followed up by telephone calls
