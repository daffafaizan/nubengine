      be carefully chosen, especially the ones that are in direct contact with user's skin. Office
      workers are constantly in contact with desk surface (while reading, typing, filling in forms,
      etc.). Therefore, it is important that the material of desk surface is suitable and properly
      chosen. It should be both functional and aesthetic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      suitability of different desk surfaces for sedentary workers. The investigators will test 10
      different surfaces (oak-ruff, oak-varnished, oak-oiled, spruce-ruff, spruce-varnished,
      spruce-oiled, particleboard laminate, particleboard veneer, corian and glass). All surfaces
      will be square shaped (800x800 mm). Firstly, the investigators will perform tests to assess
      physical characteristics of the materials (thermal conductivity, hardness, roughness, skid
      measures). Secondly, the investigators will measure the participants' forearm skin
      temperature after 20-minutes of desk use. Every participant will test all 10 sample desk
      surfaces (cross-over design). The investigators will use thermal IR camera to measure the
      temperature of participant's skin surface. The investigators will measure the temperature
      before and after the contact with desk surface. During those 20 minutes the participant will
      solve an attention test to assess the impact of different materials on attention. At the end,
      the participants will answer a questionnaire about the suitability of the material.
