      central nervous system. Despite extensive research over the last several decades, neuropathic
      pain remains poorly managed due to the lack of effective pharmacological tools. To date,
      little has been known regarding the effect of melatonin and its analogues on clinical
      neuropathic pain. We propose to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and
      crossover clinical trial to examine the effect of ramelteon [a melatonin (MT) 1/ MT2 receptor
      agonist] on neuropathic pain. We hypothesize that ramelteon would reduce pain score and
      improve functional status in subjects with neuropathic pain.
