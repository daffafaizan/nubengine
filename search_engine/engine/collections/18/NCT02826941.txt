      participating tertiary care centers, and determined the incidence of adverse neurologic
      outcomes of death and developmental scores at 12 months by Bayley II or Vineland tests
      between normothermic and hypothermic groups. This trial identified potential safety outcomes,
      compared the adverse effects of hypothermia among hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)
      infants in the normothermic and hypothermic treatment groups, and obtained rates of adverse
      outcomes.
