      order to detect differences based on the type of stress (physical or pharmacological with
      adenosine agonists) and result of test (positive or negative for ischemia) and to indentify
      biochemical markers with prognostic value. Clinical data of enrolled patients regarding
      demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, pretest probability and previous cardiovascular
      disease will be recorded. Follow up will be at one, three and five years and will be
      performed by clinical recordings or phone call when necessary. Blood samples of patients
      undergoing myocardial perfusion SPECT are taken before, immediately after stress and 2h after
      stress. Serum samples will be analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance in order to know
      metabolomic profile.
