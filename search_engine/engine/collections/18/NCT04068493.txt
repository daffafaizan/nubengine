      loss (BWL) interventions have been developed for young adults in college. Research suggests
      that standard BWL interventions are not addressing the needs of young adults as they have
      shown poorer retention rates and weight loss compared to older adults in BWL trials. Standard
      BWL interventions are also time-intensive and are not conducive to inexpensive dissemination.

      The primary aim of this project is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of Enhanced
      Project Health, a dissonance-based obesity intervention for young adults enrolled in college.
      Enhanced Project Health is based on Project Health, a dissonance-based obesity prevention
      program, which has been shown to significantly decrease weight gain and future
      overweight/obesity onset compared to a matched intervention and minimal intervention control
      condition in young adults. The current intervention was expanded to consist of eight weekly
      group sessions and to address sleep, in addition to diet and physical activity. The secondary
      aim is to test the hypothesis that Enhanced Project Health will result in significantly
      greater reductions in weight and improvements in lifestyle behaviors compared to an
      assessment only condition.
