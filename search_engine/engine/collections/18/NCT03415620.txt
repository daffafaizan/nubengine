      anxiety during the perioperative and post-operative period. Acute post-operative pain and
      anxiety have been managed via pharmacological interventions (e.g. opioid-based analgesia) for
      over a century. However, non-pharmacological interventions - such as music - have also been
      shown to be safe and cost-effective, improve the overall patient experience, and improve
      outcomes across a variety of surgical settings.

      Music has been shown to decrease pain in the perioperative period, to reduce plasma, urine,
      and salivary cortisol levels, modulate the inflammatory response (natural killer
      lymphocytes), blood pressure, and heart rate.Additionally, anxiety scores and pain scores
      (measured using the visual analog scale (VAS)) have shown statistically significant
      reductions in the perioperative period, when music therapy was available.

      While music therapy in the hospital has been offered as a part of cognitive rehabilitation
      services or end of life care, there are very few studies which investigate its effects during
      the perioperative period, especially in the local setting. In KK Women's and Children's
      Hospital (KKH), there were over 31,000 surgeries done in a year (April 2015 to March 2016).
      Based on the above rationale, the investigators shall therefore investigate the feasibility
      and practicability of deploying music listening in pain management in KKH, and further
      determine the nature of the music (duration, genre) by fitting the local context in order to
      improve the patient outcome in perioperative settings.
