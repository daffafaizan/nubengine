      chest compressions (CCC) versus standard American Heart Association (AHA) recommended
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with interrupted chest compressions (ICC) in patients
      with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA). For this study, CCC consists of a series of
      three cycles of continuous chest compressions without pauses for ventilation followed by
      rhythm analysis or until restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), whichever occurs
      first. ICC consists of series of three cycles of standard CPR each cycle comprised of chest
      compressions with interposed ventilations at a compression:ventilation ratio of 30:2 (per AHA
      guidelines) followed by rhythm analysis or until ROSC, whichever occurs first. In either
      patient group, the duration of manual CPR before the first rhythm analysis will be 30 seconds
      or 120 seconds. This treatment period will be followed by two cycles of compressions then
      rhythm analysis (i.e. each of approximately 2 minutes duration) in either group. Other aims
      of the trial are to compare survival to discharge among patients grouped by first-recorded
      rhythm or other a priori subgroups, as well as to compare neurological status at discharge,
      mechanistic outcomes or adverse events between control and intervention groups.
