      I. To provide evidence that the clipped lymph node and Magseed can be successfully retrieved
      in the excised surgical specimen when Magseed and Sentimag are used for targeted axillary
      dissection in breast cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive the Magseed marker via ultrasound guided injection into the previously
      clipped lymph node or within perinodal tissue =< 3 mm from the clipped node. Patients then
      undergo axillary lymph node localization and targeted dissection within 30 days.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 6-22 days post-surgery.
