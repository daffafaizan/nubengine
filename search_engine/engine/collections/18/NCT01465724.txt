    
      Objectives: The objectives of this study are: to compare changes in insulin resistance in
      patients with ORH after RDN; to evaluate the safety of PRDN in this patient group; to compare
      changes in blood pressure, laboratory parameters, arterial stiffness and SNS-activity after
      PRDN.

      Study design: Prospective observational feasibility-study.

      Study population: Patients with a high fasting glucose (fasting serum glucose â‰¥5.6 mmol/L(100
      mg/dL)) and with an ambulatory systolic blood pressure >130mmHg.

      Major endpoints: The effect of RDN on: insulin resistance, blood pressure and major adverse
      events.
