      metastatic, hormone refractory prostate cancer receiving one of two doses of matrix
      metalloprotease inhibitor AG3340 or placebo initially in combination with mitoxantrone and
      prednisone with provision for subsequent change in therapy. II. Compare the symptomatic
      response, quality of life, serologic (PSA) response, PSA progression free survival,
      radiographic response, radiographic progression free survival, one year survival, and overall
      survival of these patients. III. Evaluate the safety of AG3340 in regimen combination and in
      combination with therapies administered subsequent to first line in this patient population.
      IV. Evaluate the population pharmacokinetics of AG3340 when given in this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      receive the matrix metalloprotease inhibitor AG3340 (at one of two dosages) or placebo,
      orally twice a day, beginning on day 1. Patients receive mitoxantrone by intravenous infusion
      on day 1 and prednisone orally twice daily beginning on day 1. Treatment course is repeated
      every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Mitoxantrone and/or prednisone may be
      discontinued or switched at the investigator's discretion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 525 patients accrued into this study from approximately 50
      centers.
