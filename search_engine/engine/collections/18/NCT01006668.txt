      Endotracheal intubation is a painful and stressful procedure, which is associated with acute
      increases of blood pressure, intracranial pressure, bradycardia and hypoxemia with hight
      morbidity.

      In 2001, in France more than 50% of intubations in neonates were performed without any
      premedication or anesthesia.

      The most frequently used anesthesias are based on benzodiazepine or opioids. Unfortunately,
      these treatments are responsible for respiratory and hemodynamic adverse effects. Recently, 2
      new possibilities for anesthesia before intubation has been tested: propofol was better than
      association of morphine, succinylcholine and atropine and we shaw that inhaled sevoflurane
      was better than no treatment.

      The aim of the present study is to compare recovery time, efficacy and tolerance in a
      randomized controlled study, between sevoflurane and propofol for intubation in neonates in
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

      Objectives:

      The objective of this study is to compare recovery time, efficacy and tolerance in a
      randomized controlled study, between sevoflurane and propofol for intubation of neonates.

      Methods:

      Prospective, controlled, randomized, monocentric study.

      Subjects:

      Neonates in neonatal intensive care requiring intubation.

      Evaluation criteria:

      Recovery time after intubation, facilitation of procedure, tolerance of treatment (mean
      arterial pressure, apnea).
