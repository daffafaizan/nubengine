    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the Phase II dose of CBLB502 (entolimod) when given as weekly injections during
      irradiation with cisplatin, for patients with poor prognosis advanced squamous cell
      carcinomas of the head and neck receiving chemoradiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event (AE) profile and the dose limiting toxicities of CBLB502
      when administered weekly in combination with cisplatin and radiation therapy.

      II. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (if observed) of CBLB502 in combination with
      cisplatin and radiation therapy.

      III. To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CBLB502 when administered in combination with
      cisplatin.

      IV. To describe the pharmacodynamics (PD) of CBLC502 by examining plasma levels of various
      cytokines, including filgrastim (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]), interleukin
      (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±).

      V. To describe any clinical activity of CBLB502 in the form of mitigation of mucositis.

      VI. To describe the response rate to chemoradiotherapy in combination with CBLB502.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entolimod.

      Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 times per week for 7 weeks,
      receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) once weekly for 7 weeks, and entolimod subcutaneously
      (SC) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
