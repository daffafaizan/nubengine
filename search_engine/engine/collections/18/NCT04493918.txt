      effect and the ability to form into new bone.

      In Spinal Tuberculosis, the spread of bacteria is commonly hematogenous, where the focus of
      infection is at the anterior part of the vertebrae near the subchondral bone. The infection
      process continues, where the necrotic casseous fragments formed into local abcess that may
      spread to the sorrounding area.

      Patient with spinal tuberculosis who receives Anti TB Drug, is planned to undergo
      debridement, spinal stabilization. After thorough debridement, patient who fall into control
      group receives normal saline injection, patients who fall into treatment group will receive
      Mesenchymal Stem Cell.
