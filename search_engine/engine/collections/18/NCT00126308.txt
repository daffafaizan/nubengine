      Physical changes may stigmatise subjects while the negative psychological and social impact
      has become a major concern. To date, as there is no proven therapy for lipoatrophy, cosmetic
      interventions for facial lipoatrophy are being studied. Poly-L-lactic acid (PLA) has been
      shown to be both safe and effective when administered by injection to facial areas.

      Study aims are:

        1. to evaluate the extent and duration of improvement in HIV facial lipoatrophy of PLA
           injections;

        2. to evaluate the impact of PLA injections on quality of life and ART adherence in
           subjects with HIV facial lipoatrophy;

        3. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of polylactic acid.

      100 HIV-infected ART-experienced subjects with facial lipoatrophy will be randomised in a 1:1
      ratio at study entry to receive either immediate or deferred treatment (delayed 24 weeks)
      treatment with PLA. Randomisation will be stratified by age, severity of facial lipoatrophy,
      current ART (PI or non-PI containing and thymidine- or non-thymidine-containing) and surgeon.

      The study has clinical end points monitoring CD4 cell counts, viral loads and adverse events.
      The study also has psychosocial end points monitoring quality of life.
