      the tip of the urodynamic catheter beyond the obstruction site into the bladder.

      The Tiemann catheter-mounted urodynamic catheter technique can serve as a suitable option to
      insert a urodynamic catheter into the bladder in all male patients in whom it fails due to
      kinking.
