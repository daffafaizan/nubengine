    
      Open single armed study to investigate safety and feasibility of administrating autologous T
      regulatory cells at the time of allogenic islet transplantation. Patients are recruited from
      the waiting list for islet transplantation within The Nordic Network for Clinical Islet
      Transplantation. Patients included in the study will undergo apheresis while on the waiting
      list. T regulatory cells will be sorted out and frozen. Autologous, non modified T regs will
      then be infused simultaneously intraportally with the islet graft at transplantation.
      Patients will be followed for safety and efficacy regarding the islet transplantation over
      three months
