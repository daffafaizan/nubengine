        1. To identify whether trust in the health care system is associated with choice of the
           highest efficacy contraception (intrauterine contraception, implantable contraception,
           and sterilization) in the immediate postpartum period among pregnant women receiving
           prenatal care.

        2. To explore which patient-level factors (sociodemographic, reproductive history, future
           pregnancy intentions) and provider-level factors (antenatal contraceptive counseling)
           are associated with choice of the highest efficacy contraception in the immediate
           postpartum period among pregnant women receiving prenatal care.

        3. To determine whether trust in the health care system is altered during the receipt of
           prenatal care or delivery.
