      physical function data in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) in the context of daily
      life. It will be performed technical development of an internet-interactive App to collect,
      analyze and transfer the subjects' data. As a proof-of-concept, the mHealth App will execute
      algorithms that automate deployment of three well-established physical function tests. In a
      laboratory setting, it will be evaluated usability, acceptability and reliability of the
      mHealth App compared with traditional performance tests among focus groups of individuals
      with KOA. It will then evaluate its usability and acceptability when used in the
      participants' home environments. As an early indicator of construct validity, it will be
      examined if the physical function test measurements can detect diurnal variation in the
      impact of KOA.
