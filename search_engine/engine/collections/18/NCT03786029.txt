    
      Background and Aims: The pain could be a problem for the patients during the first few hours
      after the extraction because of both soft and hard tissues trauma during the operation,
      despite that the local anesthesia will last for a long time in most of the cases.

      There are no enough studies that ensure the validity of giving any analgesic in reducing
      injection pain and post-operative pain in primary tooth extraction so far.

      Design: This will be a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial including sixty six
      cooperative children, aged 6-8 years old, randomly assigned to one of three groups to receive
      one of the oral suspension drugs, that have the same colour and taste, via pre-calibrated
      medication bottles, which are identical, numbered and containing the same amount of
      pre-calibrated dosages, as per the following portions:

        1. Acetaminophen syrup: 160mg/5ml

        2. Placebo solution

        3. Ibuprofen suspension: 100mg/5ml
