      potential of Zibotentan in acute and chronic renal complications of Scleroderma. Trial
      duration will be 52 weeks for Zebra 1 and 2A (1 or 2 weeks for ZEBRA 2B with 1 year follow up
      data). Scleroderma (Systemic sclerosis) is a multisystem rheumatic disease that results in
      vascular damage and fibrosis of target organs.This project will focus specifically on the
      evaluation and treatment of renal disease in scleroderma.

      Renal involvement in Scleroderma occurs with a variety of different pathologiesÍ¾ hypertensive
      scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) being the most dramatic manifestation but milder forms of
      chronic renal disease are frequent and represent an important clinical feature.
