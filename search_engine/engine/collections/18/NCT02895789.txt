    
      Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a progressive, recessively-inherited neuromuscular disease
      characterized by weakness and muscle atrophy due to the loss of spinal cord motor neurons.
      The results from this study would provide preliminary data, using non-invasive methods, on
      oxidative capacity in ambulatory SMA patients and disease controls to aid in the design of
      exercise intervention studies. Furthermore, this information would link previous laboratory
      and preclinical findings of mitochondrial depletion in SMA to the clinical condition and
      provide important information for future studies designed to improve oxidative capacity and
      fitness in SMA patients.
