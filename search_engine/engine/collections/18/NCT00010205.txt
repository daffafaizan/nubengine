      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of benzoylphenylurea
      in patients with advanced malignancy.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral benzoylphenylurea weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of benzoylphenylurea until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
