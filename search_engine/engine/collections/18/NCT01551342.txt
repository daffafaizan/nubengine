        1. To calibrate the CellDetect® device for detecting TCC in urine cytology samples.

        2. Determine the performance of the CellDetect® device in identifying TCC recurrence in
           patients with a history of TCC using urine cytology samples.

      The study includes two parts:

      Part I Open label, controlled, Calibration part aimed to calibrate the CellDetect® device for
      identifying bladder cancer cells in urine samples.

      Part II Prospective, controlled, blinded part to determine the performance of the CellDetect®
      device in monitoring bladder cancer recurrence in in patients with a history of TCC, using
      urine cytology samples

      * The following subjects will be enrolled: Subjects previously diagnosed with bladder cancer
      undergoing routine cystoscopic surveillance, TURT or Cystectomy.

      Part I - up to 200 urine eligible samples Part II - up to 300 urine eligible samples

      Endpoints:

        1. To calibrate the CellDetect® device for identifying TCC in urine cytology samples.

        2. To determine the performance of the CellDetect® device in identifying recurrence of TCC
           in urine samples.
