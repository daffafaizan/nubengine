      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Twenty-four participants with NAFLD will be
      randomized into one of two groups: 12 participants will be randomized to receive a ketogenic
      meal plan and 12 participants will be randomized to receive a standard weight loss meal plan.
      There will be one screening visit and three study visits: the baseline visit, and follow-up
      visits 14 days and 28 days after initiation of the diet intervention. The study team
      hypothesizes that participants randomized to a ketogenic diet will have a greater reduction
      in intrahepatic triglycerides compared to those randomized to a standard weight loss diet.
