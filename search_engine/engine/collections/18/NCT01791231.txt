      assigned treatment), single dose, single center study to investigate the absorption,
      metabolism, and excretion of canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus). The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening
      phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of study (or follow-up) phase. On Day 1, all
      volunteers will receive a single oral dose of radiolabeled 14C-canagliflozin which contains
      196 mg of canagliflozin and approximately 40 microcurie (1480kBq) of radioactivity. The
      International Commission on Radiological Protection considers this amount of radioactivity to
      be acceptable for this type of study. The radioactivity allows the amount of canagliflozin
      and its metabolites (break-down products) to be more precisely measured in blood, plasma,
      urine, and feces samples, which will be collected from each volunteer. The total duration of
      the study is approximately 5 weeks (including screening and follow-up); this time will be
      increased by 6 days in volunteers who have a slower rate of excretion of canagliflozin.
