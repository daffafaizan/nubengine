      compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD).1-3 GEV hemorrhage is associated with a
      six week mortality rate of between 15% and 25%.2,3 In order to prevent variceal hemorrhage,
      screening and surveillance aims to detect high-risk varices (HRV) and determine the need for
      primary preventative therapy.2,3 Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is therefore an important
      part of the diagnostic work-up in patients with cACLD, serving as the gold standard to
      diagnose HRV.2,3 However, EGD is invasive and poorly tolerated, with many patients needing
      intravenous sedatives or general anesthesia. Although EGD with sedation relieves patients'
      anxiety and discomfort and reduces the potential for physical injury during the procedure, it
      incurs additional risks of cardiopulmonary adverse events.4 Consequently, patients may
      decline a screening procedure if they are stable and asymptomatic.

      Non-invasive methods for detection of cACLD are being explored.5-13 Although preliminary
      research is encouraging, these techniques predict the presence, rather than confirm or assess
      the size, of GEV. By contrast, capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive alternative which also
      allows direct visualization of GEV.14 A number of well-conducted trials15-19 suggest that EGD
      and capsule endoscopy may be equivalent in terms of accuracy in the identification and
      grading of varices. However, concerns remain that the quality of examination may be adversely
      affected by the uncontrolled and sometimes rapid transit of the capsule through the
      esophagus.20 String capsule endoscopy was introduced to address this concern by providing
      control of capsule movement as well as real-time visualization.21 However, this technique is
      limited by the inability to detach the string from the capsule. Thus, observation of the
      fundus, one of the predilection sites of varices, is impossible and retrieval of the capsule
      from the esophagus causes discomfort.

      Magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCCE), a novel modality, was developed and
      approved by the China Food and Drug Administration in 2013.22 Our previous studies initially
      demonstrated that MCCE was comparable in accuracy to EGD for gastric examination.22,23
      Furthermore, it has several strengths including non-invasiveness, no sedation requirement,
      and easy operation.22,23 We have since combined an innovative detachable string system with
      the MCCE (detachable string magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (DS-MCCE)) and carried
      out a pilot study showing that DS-MCCE was safe and feasible both in healthy volunteers and
      patients with suspected esophageal disease.24 Moreover, successful detachment of the capsule
      from the string avoids the discomfort of retrieving the entire capsule from the mouth and
      allows subsequent investigation of the gastric cardia and fundus. To our knowledge, the
      diagnostic accuracy of HRV, comfort and safety of DS-MCCE in patients with cACLD have not
      been explored in a large-scale trial. This prospective, multicenter study aimed to assess the
      accuracy, patient's satisfaction, and safety of DS-MCCE for detecting HRV in
      well-characterized patients with cACLD.
