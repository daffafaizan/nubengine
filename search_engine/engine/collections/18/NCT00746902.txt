      overweight/obesity and hyperinsulinism. The pathogenesis of concomitant overweight/obesity
      and hypertension is multifactorial. There is an independent relationship between the degree
      of insulin resistance and the severity of SAS. A number of studies have suggested that
      hormones secreted by adipose tissue are involved in the pathogenesis of both hypertension and
      SAS, and overweight/obesity has been shown to be associated with elevated leptin levels
      coupled with reduced adiponectin levels.

      Leptin is produced in adipose tissue and its levels rise with overweight/obesity due to
      peripheral resistance to its action. A number of studies have detected high leptinemia in
      both hypertensives and people suffering from SAS. Leptin may activate the sympathetic nervous
      system and promote SAS-related hypertension.

      Adiponectin which is also produced in adipose tissue has beneficial activities, notably on
      atherogenesis. A relationship between hypertension and adiponectin has yet to be
      demonstrated.

      Unlike leptin, adiponectin levels do not seem to be elevated in patients with SAS.

      In terms of treatment, a number of studies have shown that CPAP has a positive effect on BP
      readings. Although this effect is modest, it is greater in subjects with SAS and rises with
      the severity of this condition. The effects of CPAP on plasmatic leptin and adiponectin
      levels are as yet unknown.
