      the classical survey tools used. These devices are known to be of use in measuring activity
      and sleep in healthy patients but their use in chronic pain patients has not been assessed.
      This study will follow participants with chronic back pain undergoing treatment to see if
      changes in clinical course can be captured with these fitness devices.
