      self-record their experiences of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses. Patients,
      parents and of immunosuppressed patients and patients aged 16-17 yrs will be provided with
      online information and asked to fill in online questionnaires at baseline and weekly
      thereafter. Information collected includes medication, symptoms, contact with health care
      providers, test results and impact on daily activities. Data will be collected and analysed
      weekly to be able to monitor any potential risk factors for severe disease. This study is
      complementary to, and not overlapping with, the global ISARIC World Health Organisation
      protocol that will be studying COVID-19 cases admitted to all National Health Service (NHS)
      Trusts, including all children.
