      fast of over three days after operation. Surgeons have believed that early oral feeding might
      worsen patients' condition by prolonged postoperative ileus. Therefore, patients received
      nothing by oral route until resolution of the ileus. However, the current trend toward
      minimal operative injury and early discharge from hospital. In addition, development of
      operative technique and instrument make the operation time to be short and the patients to be
      fast recovery, and thus it is possible to feed early in less than two days after operation.
      The aim of this study is to determine whether early oral feeding after curative resection for
      gastric cancer would be tolerable and give an effect on the recovery.

      We collect fifty-eight patients for this study and divide into two groups using randomization
      method. In the early feeding group, patients will receive the liquid diet two day after
      operation followed by soft diet postoperative three day. Meanwhile, the patients who
      categorized into control group will start the liquid diet postoperative four day followed by
      soft diet postoperative six day. We evaluate the morbidity or mortality rate and laboratory
      findings. Of course, it is supposed to be same in amount of fluid and calories between two
      groups.
