      This is however of great clinical value because:

        1. Patients are often treated insufficiently with the commonly used analgesics in acute
           pain therapy or the available selection of analgesics is limited by their
           contraindications and side-effects.

        2. CBD could be an option to optimize pain therapy if the pain relief is not satisfactory.

        3. CBD in contrast to âˆ†9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) has only few side effects and due to a
           possible dose reduction of other analgesics patients might benefit from a better
           side-effect profile.

      This study is to investigate the effect of CBD on acute pain in healthy volunteers in a
      well-established acute pain model.
