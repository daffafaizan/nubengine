        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant BL22 immunotoxin in patients with
           CD22-positive refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia,
           or indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the immunogenicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on various components of the circulating cellular
           immune system in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease type (chronic lymphocytic leukemia vs non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).

      Patients receive recombinant BL22 immunotoxin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5.
      Treatment repeats ≥ every 27 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of neutralizing
      antibodies to BL22 or PE38, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving
      a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients who relapse from a
      CR lasting ≥ 6 months may receive additional courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of recombinant BL22 immunotoxin
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients (12 per stratum) will be accrued for this study
      within 1-2 years.
