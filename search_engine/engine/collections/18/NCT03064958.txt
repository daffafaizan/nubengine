      postprandial effects of a high fat meal with spices on endothelial function,
      lipids/lipoproteins, immune function, plasma antioxidants and markers of oxidative stress.
      Metabolomic profiling will also be conducted. In random order participants will consume
      either a high fat meal (1000kcal, 45g fat) or a high fat meal containing 2g of spices or a
      high fat meal containing 6g of spices with a 3 day washout period between each treatment. The
      following spices will be incorporated into the meal black pepper, basil, bay leaf, cinnamon,
      coriander, cumin, ginger, oregano, parsley, rosemary, red pepper, turmeric and thyme.

      Endothelial function will be measured by flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery in the
      fasting state and 2 and 4 hours after the meal. Participants will also provide a fasting
      blood sample and samples will also be taken at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after the meal.
