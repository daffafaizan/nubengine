      community leaders, the University of Minnesota, Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) and The
      Family Partnership. The study collaborators will develop and test a new program designed to
      help low-income multiethnic families with overweight or obese children achieve long-term
      maintenance of healthful behaviors following completion of HCMC's 16-week intensive obesity
      management course (Taking Steps Together (TST)). Next Steps, the focus of this study, will
      comprise a network of parent-led, community-based health maintenance programs that will be
      offered to TST graduate families.

      Project Aims:

      Aim 1: Establish a core parent leadership group and health maintenance program network that
      is self-sustaining and can serve the community for years to come.

      Aim 2: Test the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of the Next Steps programs.

      Aim 3: Assess the impact of the Next Steps programs on helping participant families sustain
      or improve healthful behaviors and achieve or maintain healthy body mass index (BMI).
