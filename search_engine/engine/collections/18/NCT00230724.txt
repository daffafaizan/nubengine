      is integral to secondary prevention of coronary events and cardiac re-hospitalization.
      Patients in Phase II cardiac rehabilitation programs, a majority being older adults,
      participate in regular supervised exercise during the program; however, long-term adherence
      to exercise is poor, with only 30% reporting regular exercise at 12 month follow-ups. To
      promote exercise maintenance after completion of a 12 week Phase II rehabilitation program,
      we propose to offer a theoretically-based intervention that we have used successfully to
      promote exercise among older, primary-care patients. This program (Maintenance Counseling)
      includes brief advice from the Cardiac Rehabilitation case manager at Phase II program
      discharge followed by telephone-counseling based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior
      Change and Social Cognitive Theory. Health educators will provide the telephone-based
      intervention over 6 months. Using a randomized controlled design, 180 patients will be
      assigned to Maintenance Counseling or Brief Advice plus Contact Control. Outcome assessments
      will include an exercise tolerance test (baseline/post-rehabilitation and 6 months),
      self-reported exercise participation, motivational readiness for exercise, and objective
      activity monitoring at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. These data will help to identify
      whether telephone-based exercise counseling is an effective strategy for sustaining regular
      exercise and fitness among cardiac rehabilitation patients thereby contributing to secondary
      prevention of coronary heart disease.
