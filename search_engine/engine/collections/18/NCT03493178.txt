      Baylor IRB. Subjects will stop nonvitamin supplements for 4wks before screening labs (blood
      count, HbA1c, glucose, lipid profile, liver profile, blood urea nitrogen, Creatinine, thyroid
      stimulating hormone, free T4), and for the entire 24wks duration of the study. 60 fasted
      subjects will have the following measures before and after 12wks of supplementation with
      cysteine (as N-acetylcysteine) plus glycine vs alanine: (1) Cognitive function using
      ADCS-PACC (Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite
      which includes Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Immediate and Delayed paragraph recall
      score, Digit-Symbol Substitution Test, Mini mental state examination; (2) Red-cell
      concentrations of GSH, cysteine, glycine, glutamic acid; plasma malondialdehyde,
      F2/F3-isoprostanes, sICAM, sVCAM, E-selectin; endothelial function; (3) Mitochondrial glucose
      oxidation by calorimetry. Measures will be repeated for washout effects 12-wks after stopping
      supplements.
