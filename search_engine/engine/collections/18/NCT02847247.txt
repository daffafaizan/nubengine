      The protocol is powered to compare absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in the blood 6 hours after
      inhalational challenge with CCRE compared baseline. In addition, as secondary endpoints, the
      investigators will evaluate inflammatory cytokine levels in systemic circulation and access
      for the presence of genes thought to be related to endotoxin response. Visits will be
      conducted by a study coordinator or other study staff, physical exams will be performed by
      the PI or other study physician.

      Eighteen subjects will be recruited. There will be no gender or ethnic restrictions, and
      subjects will be healthy volunteers. Prior to enrollment in this study, subjects will have
      participated in our protocol 98-0799 (screening and database study for the CEMALB). Data such
      as medical history and allergy skin testing collected during the screening protocol will be
      included with data in this study. Subjects with positive allergy skin testing will not be
      excluded. Spirometry will be performed to determine the current level of lung function.

      In order to identify those individuals who appear more susceptible to the systemic
      inflammatory effects of endotoxin exposure, subjects will undergo inhaled endotoxin challenge
      at the baseline visit followed 6 hours later by blood draw for complete blood count with
      differential to allow for calculation of absolute neutrophil count (ANC). Subjects will be
      considered "responders" if their peripheral ANC increases by at least 20% following inhaled
      endotoxin challenge.
