      strength (AAAD) on general cognitive performance of patients affected by mild Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial in two parallel groups: SCOPE: 2 health
      center of Basque Health Service , in coordination with its reference neurology services.
      PARTICIPANTS: 80 patients with mild AD.

      INTERVENTION: Both groups receiving standard drug treatment. The intervention group also
      receive a supervised EEAA program, while the control group receive a similar intervention at
      low intensity. Patients are followed up over 1 year. Three blind measurements are made
      repeatedly : baseline, at 6 and 12 months. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure is
      change in cognitive performance that is measured in a blinded way with the cognitive section
      of the ADAS scale (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) at 0, 6 and 12.Secondary Outcomes:
      Global cognitive performance (Neuropsychological battery TBR-B),neuropsychiatric symptoms
      (NPI), ADL (Blessed),functional capacity (Test of 6-minute walk), cardiorespiratory Test,
      muscular strength (hand dynamometer and trunk); PREDICTORS AND CONFOUNDING VARIABLES:
      baseline cognitive performance, previous physical activity, medication, age, sex, APOE,
      schooling and cognitive reserve. ANALYSIS: We compared the two groups in terms of observed
      mean changes from baseline in ADAS measurement and other variables, intention to treat, using
      longitudinal mixed effects models for repeated measures at 6 and 12 months.
