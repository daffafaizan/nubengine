      writing, despite adequate intelligence and conventional education, motivation or social level
      and it is often accompanied by sensory and motor deficits. It has been demonstrated that
      children with dyslexia present poor postural control compared to their age-matched peers.
      However, less attempt was made to demonstrate validity and reliability of balance impairment
      tools in children with dyslexia.

      The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a balance assessment tool that is used to evaluate the
      quality of dynamic balance during walking and an individual's ability to modify walking in
      different kinds of situations and dual tasks. It takes ten minutes and is a practical
      clinical assessment tool. Therefore, the DGI can be considered as a promising assessment tool
      to assess dynamic balance.

      There is a need for valid and reliable assessment tools to evaluate balance in children with
      dyslexia. In this study, the investigators aim to translate the DGI into the Turkish language
      and investigate validity and reliability in children with dyslexia.
