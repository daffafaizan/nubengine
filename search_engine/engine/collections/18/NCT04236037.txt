      effusion) are likely to have malignant pleural effusion. In the Danish guidelines, patient
      undergo two thoracentesis before more invasive procedures, due to the relatively low incidens
      of pleural TB and mesothelioma. The aim of the research group is to investigate the effect of
      early introduction of ultrasound-guided pleural biopsy taken at the optimal sport for
      thoracentesis. The research group will randomise half of our patients with unilateral pleural
      exudate to up-front ultrasound-guided biopsy and the other half usual care eg. a second
      thoracentesis, to see if there is a benefit of early pleural biopsy in the work-up of
      patients with unilateral pleural effusion, suspected of malignant pleural effusion.
