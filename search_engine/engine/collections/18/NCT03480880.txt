      such as brain bulge, excessive bleeding, hypotension etc. As yet there are no anaesthetic
      regimen guidelines to follow for induction of anaesthesia in neurotrauma surgeries. Although
      the functional effect of anaesthetic agents on neuronal tissue is known quite well, there is
      lack of studies documenting the effect of these anaesthetic agents on head injured patients.
      It is also not known whether the requirement of anaesthetic agent in the same as a non head
      injured patient. This study was designed to assess the requirement of anaesthetic thiopentone
      in head injured patients and compare the anaesthetic usage with and without Bispectral index
      (BIS) monitoring. We also observed the real time change in neuronal function using Bispectral
      Index monitoring after craniotomy, i.e. effectively decompression and release of intracranial
      pressure intraoperatively.
