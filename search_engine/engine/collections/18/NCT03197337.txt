      during which they will rate the pain elicited on a scale of 1 to 10. This score will be used
      as the patient's baseline level of pain for data analysis later. Then, each patient will be
      randomized into one of two groups: One group which will first undergo the control
      manipulation and then the study manipulation, or the second group in which the study
      manipulation will precede the control manipulation. This is done to neutralize a possible
      effect of the order of the manipulations on the trial's results when the data will be
      analyzed.

      The control manipulation: Inserting a speculum into the vagina without applying pressure.

      The study manipulation: First inserting a speculum, then inserting through it a large-sized
      applicator reaching the posterior fornix, then retrieving the speculum while keeping the
      applicator in place, and then applying significant pressure to the posterior fornix.

      During each of the manipulations, the cotton-swab test will be performed again, and each
      patient will be asked to rate the level of pain elicited by the test. All data will be
      recorded, and we will later analyze if there was a significant difference between the pain
      elicited by the cotton-swab test during the study manipulation compared with the control
      manipulation, or compared with the baseline test.
