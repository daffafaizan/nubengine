      second, more potent agent. BIS and Entropy are depth of anesthesia monitors in clinical use.
      There are conflicting reports about the usefulness of these monitors when nitrous oxide is
      used as a part of the anesthetic regimen. While some studies demonstrate a decrease in BIS
      and Entropy, this study aims to investigate the effects of adding nitrous oxide to a
      sevoflurane or a propofol based anesthetic on BIS and Entropy indices.
