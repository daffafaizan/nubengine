      the occurence of antimicrobial (multi)resistance. The optimal duration of antibiotic
      treatment is poorly known and often based on consensus guidelines.

      SAPS is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled open-label trial evaluating the
      equivalence/efficacy and safety of procalcitonin-guided treatment of infections in ICU
      patients versus a standard-of-care approach.

      All patients that are admitted to the ICU and for whom systemic antibiotics are prescribed
      for presumed or proven bacterial infections are eligible for this trial. Patients will be
      randomized and stratified according to clinical diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock.
      Any patient over the age of 18, admitted to the ICU and receiving antibiotics for an assumed
      infection can be enrolled into this trial. Informed consent has to be obtained in writing
      from the patient of his/her relatives prior to inclusion. In the intervention group daily
      procalcitonin levels be performed and will generate a non-binding stopping advice when
      predefined stopping-rules have been reached. The ultimate decision to stop antibiotics will
      be at the discretion of the physician in both groups.
