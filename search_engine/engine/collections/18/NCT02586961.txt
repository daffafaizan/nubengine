      respiratory tract and is most often caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The
      current treatment of bronchiolitis is controversial. Although meta-analysis of nebulized
      bronchodilators or corticosteroids treatments failed to show any consistent benefits on
      admission rate, they remain widely used in pediatric emergency wards. A recent randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial with a factorial design was conducted to
      determine whether treatment with nebulized epinephrine, a short course of high dose of oral
      Betamethasone, or both, resulted in a clinically important decrease in hospital admissions
      among infants with bronchiolitis who were seen in the emergency department. This study showed
      that infants in the epinephrine-betamethasone group were significantly less likely than those
      in the placebo group to be admitted by day 7 (relative risk, 0.65; 95% confidence interval,
      0.45 to 0.95, P = 0.02). However, after adjustment for multiple comparisons, this result
      became insignificant (P = 0.07). This synergistic interaction was not anticipated but gave
      hope that the association nebulized epinephrine - short course of oral high dose of
      betamethasone might reduce the risk of hospitalization for infants who consulted pediatric
      emergencies for a moderate to severe acute bronchiolitis. It is therefore required to conduct
      a trial dedicated to this evaluation in the French population.

      Hypothesis: using Epinephrine-Betamethasone allows to reduce the rate of hospitalization of
      mild-to-severe acute viral bronchiolitis seen in pediatric emergency departments.
