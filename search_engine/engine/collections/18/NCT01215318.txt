      to FDG PET/CT for staging or follow-up in an oncology setting. All women were provided a
      normal commercial or modified vaginal tampon with a silicon coated base to be used during
      examination. Images were analyzed to determine the localization and the FDG uptake in the
      tampons. Between the uptake phase and imaging, all patients were asked to void. After image
      acquisition, tampons were individually analyzed for creatinine concentration, blood traces,
      position relative to the pubococcygeal line, and FDG activity. Statistical significance was
      determined by means of the Mann-Whitney U test.
