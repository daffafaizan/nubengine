    
      This is a pilot study to support submission of a larger-scale federally funded study. The
      study is designed to develop new strategies for treating the severe interpersonal dysfunction
      in borderline personality disorder (BPD) by modeling the interpersonal disturbance in BPD in
      the laboratory, identifying its neural correlates and determining whether the social
      neuropeptide, oxytocin, can ameliorate the interpersonal dysfunction. The study will examine
      behavioral patterns and underlying neural correlates which distinguish patients with
      borderline personality disorder (BPD) from healthy subjects as they participate in a
      two-person trust game and will determine whether administration of intranasal oxytocin (OT)
      will normalize trust game performance and concomitant neural processing in the BPD group.

      The specific aims of the study are: 1) to determine whether BPD patients and healthy controls
      (HC) differ in their pattern of investing in a trustee when the trustee behaves benevolently
      or malevolently towards them or suddenly becomes malevolent after a period of benevolence (or
      vice-versa) in a multi-round economic exchange game ("The Trust Game"), and 2) to determine
      the effect upon behavior of the administration of 40 IU intranasal oxytocin relative to
      placebo in BPD subjects and HC's engaged in the Trust Game.
