      untreated patients with stage III or IV CD20+ B-cell follicular small cleaved cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the response rate (complete or partial) to rituximab in
      patients with relapsed CD20+ Hodgkin's disease. III. Determine the time to progression and
      time to chemotherapy in these patients after treatment with rituximab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (follicular small cleaved cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma vs relapsed Hodgkin's disease). Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-6
      hours on day 1 weekly for 4 weeks. Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, then
      every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-32 patients will be accrued for each arm of this study
      within 7-10.5 months.
