      being tested for people who have multiple myeloma who have relapsed after treatment or become
      unresponsive to treatment.

      This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ixazomib citrate using a dose
      escalation scheme. Once MTD is established, participants will be enrolled at MTD into one of
      the 4 expansion cohorts to characterize the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MLN9708.
      Blood samples for safety labs, hematology, serum chemistry and pharmacokinetic evaluations
      will be obtained at the timepoints specified. Disease response assessment is to be performed
      on the first day of every other cycle beginning with Cycle 3.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 patients. All participants will receive treatment with
      ixazomib citrate. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall
      time to participate in this study is up to 60 days, and participants will make 12-16 visits
      to the clinic for study procedures.
