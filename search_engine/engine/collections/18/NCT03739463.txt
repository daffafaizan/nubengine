    
      This randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two hospitals in the province of Quebec
      (CHUS, CHUQ- Site m√®re-enfant Soleil).

      Patients between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation with a diagnosis of preterm premature rupture
      of membranes (PPROM) who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      approached to participate. Once they have signed the IFC, participants will be randomized and
      begin a supplementation with either MAG-DHA or the placebo until delivery or for up to 2
      weeks (14 days). A total of 70 patients will be recruited.

      Principal outcome: To compare the difference in duration between the start of treatment and
      delivery between the group receiving MAG-DHA and the group receiving placebo.

      Secondary outcomes: 1) Evaluate the difference in neonatal outcome between children in the
      MAG-DHA group and those in the placebo group. 2) Determine the inflammatory status of the
      patients associated with the exposure to either MAG-DHA or the placebo.

      This regimen could potentially represent an innovative approach in the management of women
      with a diagnosis of PPROM.
