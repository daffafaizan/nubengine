      Strangulated abdominal hernias are not clean surgical wounds so applying prostetic materials
      such as meshes are problematic. Using of prostetic materials in un-clean wounds (clean
      contaminated, contaminated and dirty) is not proposed. But in surgical practice meshed
      surgical repair techniques are using largeley. In this multicenter study we try to find the
      answer for emergency hernia repairs meshed or not.
