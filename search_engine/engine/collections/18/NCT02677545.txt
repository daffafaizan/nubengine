      The main adverse event is embolic stroke during the procedure. Current medical management to
      prevent peri-procedural embolisation consists of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel
      and aspirin. Ticagrelor, a novel reversible inhibitor of the platelet adenosine diphosphate
      receptor P2Y12, was superior to clopidogrel, as add-on therapy to aspirin, in preventing
      stent thrombosis, cardiovascular outcome events, and death in patients undergoing coronary
      artery stenting, without causing an increase in major bleeding events. This study aims to
      test the hypothesis that ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel as add-on to aspirin in
      preventing cerebral embolism during the CAS procedure.
