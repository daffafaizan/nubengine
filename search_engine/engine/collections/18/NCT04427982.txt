      and effective. If it is, the study team will refine the workshop model and do additional
      dance classes in the future. This research study will involve attending a dance workshop
      twice a week for 2 months using an online, video-conferencing computer application.
      Participants will also receive information about exercise and how to manage their diabetes.
      Participants will receive a phone call every two weeks during the 2 months to assess their
      experience. Study participants will also be asked to complete surveys at the beginning and
      end of the 2-month session, as well as 1 month and 2 months after the classes end.
