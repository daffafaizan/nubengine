      Regional Stroke Prevention Clinics (combined first visits >2,800 patients per year). Data
      will be abstracted from the patient chart using methodologies developed and validated in the
      Registry of the Ontario Stroke Network. The investigators have REB approval to collect this
      data and to link with administrative datasets through the Institute for Clinical and
      Evaluative Sciences (ICES). The investigators will use regression models to determine whether
      DOC screen scores add to baseline clinical and demographic data to predict the main negative
      outcomes. The investigators hope to identify which patients presenting to TIA/stroke
      prevention clinics are at highest risk of adverse long-term events so focused interventions
      can be developed to improve survival, outcomes and function of stroke prevention clinic
      patients.
