      derived from shells of the North Atlantic shrimp. CMP acts a an immunenhancer which improve
      immune function by stimulating macrophages and other cells such as T-helper lymphocytes, (Th
      cells). In allergies there is an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 cells. Imuneenhancers shift
      the balance in favour of Th1 cells. The immunomodulatory properties of CMP have been
      demonstrated in animal models against a wide range of respiratory allergens. There have been
      no indications of toxic side effects in animal models.
