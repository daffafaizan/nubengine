    
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what
      treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study medication assigned to
      participants by chance), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with
      no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a
      real effect), parallel group, multicenter (when more than one hospital work on a medical
      research study) study, with a single-blind, long-term follow-up to Year 3. The study will be
      split into 2 phases, a double-blind phase with screening (Day -12 to Day 1), Vaccination (Day
      1) and Safety and Immunogenicity Follow-up (Day 1 up to Day 360), and a single-blind
      long-term follow-up phase thereafter until Year 3 for participants in placebo and two ExPEC4V
      dose groups selected based on the primary (Day 30) analysis. Participants will be stratified
      in 2 age groups (>=18 to less than [<] 50 years and >=50 years) and in each dosing group in
      each stratum randomized to a single vaccination with 1 of 5 doses of ExPEC4V or placebo. The
      duration of the double-blind phase (from randomization/vaccination) will be approximately 360
      days for placebo participants and participants in the dose group selected based on the
      primary analysis, and approximately 180 days for the participants in the other groups. The
      duration of the single-blind long-term follow-up phase will be approximately 2 years after
      the double-blind phase for placebo participants and participants in the selected dose group.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
