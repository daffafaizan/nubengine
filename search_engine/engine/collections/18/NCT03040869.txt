        -  Recruited the patients meet the inclusion criteria since March 2016, collected the
           information of the change of risk factors, angina in pre-operation, mode of onset,
           characteristics of coronary artery, morbility of treatment,clinical follow-up; ② Collect
           the following information in clinical cases: gender, age, history of hypertension,
           history of diabetes, cholesterol level, triglyceride level, sedentary, body index,
           family history of CHD, genotype of ALDH2 and MTHFR, history of myocardial infarction,
           coronary artery lesions and operation situation; ③ The follow-up was performed through
           clinic and telephone every half or one year. The details include whether recurrence of
           angina, the main symptom, the cause of attack, lasting time, the efficacy of taking
           nitroglycerin, whether performed electrocardiography examination, whether occurred
           myocardial infarction and the attack site. whether performed interventional therapy and
           CABG surgery again and the cause of surgery, whether re-examined coronary
           arteriongraphy, whether death and the cause, and the occurred date in above events; ④
           Analysis the pathogenic intensity with each risk factors with other age group CHD.
