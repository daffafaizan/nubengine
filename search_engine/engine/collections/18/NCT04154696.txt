      normothermic conditions all grafts with histologically proven macrosteatosis ≥ 30% that will
      be considered as unsuitable for upfront LT. These grafts have to be alloacted to one of the 3
      liver transplantation centers of Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Paris. Eligible grafts
      (macrosteatosis ≥ 30%, no severe fibrosis or cirrhosis) will be shipped to the platform for
      normothermic perfusion. Perfusion will be started provided that cold ischemia time do not
      exceed 8 hours. Parameters of grafts viability (lactates, bile production, flow) will be
      monitored. After a minimum of 4 hours of normothermic perfusion (not exceeding 16 hours),
      grafts fulfilling strict criteria (homogeneous aspect of the liver without any necrotic
      regions, lactates < 2.5 mmol/l and continuous production of bile with at least one of the
      following criteria: pH of perfusate > 7.3, arterial flow > 150 ml/min and portal flow > 500
      ml/min, homogeneous perfusion of the graft) will be considered suitable for transplantation.
      Recipient will be transferred to the operating room, and first phase of LT (i.e, laparotomy
      and total hepatectomy) will be started. Simultaneously, grafts will be shipped to the center
      of initial allocation. Perfusion will be pursued during the transport from the platform to
      the recipient. Recipients (≥18 years and ≤ 70 years) have to be enlisted for LT with an
      estimated waiting time > 6 months (i.e., MELD score < 25) and who signed an informed consent.
