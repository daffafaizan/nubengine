      and once per week for the second 3 weeks of the 6 week treatment. They are therapist-guided
      and last up to 90 min consisting of 45 minutes of contralaterally-controlled functional
      electrical stimulation (CCFES)-mediated video games and up to 45 minutes of CCFES-mediated
      functional task practice. Early sessions will focus on training the patient and caregiver to
      self-administer play of a CCFES-mediated video game at home. As proficiency with one game
      develops, more games will be introduced. The functional task practice part of the session
      will engage the participant in using the CCFES system to assist them in practicing using
      their hand in activities such as lacing beads, throwing balls, eating finger foods, and other
      play and activities of daily living. Prior to the start of lab treatment, the investigators
      will assess hand extensor and flexor muscle co-activation (see below).

      Home sessions - These consist of CCFES-mediated hand opening and video game exercises with
      caregiver assistance and supervision as needed. As proficiency develops and more games are
      added, each home session will increase in duration up to 90 minutes per day, as determined by
      the treating therapist based on the adherence of each participant. Self report of game
      difficulty and engagement will be made at the completion of each game (see below)
