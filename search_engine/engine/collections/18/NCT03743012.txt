      supervised aerobic exercises and counseling, followed by two months of monitored home based
      exercises prescribed weekly.

      Aerobic threshold (AT) will be determined based on perceived rates of exertion as measured
      using a Borg scale and target heart rate based on Karvonen's formula. Exercise intensity will
      be prescribed to achieve the earlier of moderate perceived exertion and 50-60% of their
      maximal target heart rate on a treadmill. Intensity will be increased over the course of the
      12 sessions to attain 70-80% of maximal target heart rate. Duration of exercise will also be
      increased gradually over the 12 sessions in keeping with the study participants perceived
      rate of exertion.

      Participants will be given pedometers and instructed to use these daily for the period of the
      study. At the end of the first four weeks, the participant's weekly steps will be averaged to
      establish a baseline weekly step target. Starting in the 4th week,subjects will be instructed
      to continue exercises at home whilst maintaining a comparable activity level as will be
      measured by their weekly step counts. Participants will be contacted weekly for the remaining
      8 weeks and step targets will be prescribed based on 10% weekly increments.Prior to the start
      of each exercise session, participants will receive a brief counseling module reflecting the
      primary goals of cardiac rehabilitation.
