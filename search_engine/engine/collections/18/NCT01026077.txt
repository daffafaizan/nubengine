    
      Registry enrollment is voluntary and initiated by pregnant patients or their healthcare
      providers (HCP). Patient-initiated reports must be verified by the HCP. Enrollment should
      occur as early in pregnancy as possible, preferably before any prenatal testing has occurred;
      however, enrollment at any time during pregnancy is allowed. Near the estimated date of
      delivery, the Registry prompts the HCP to provide pregnancy outcome data. If a live birth is
      reported, the Registry conducts follow-up with the infant's HCP at outcome, 4 months, and 12
      months of age. If a birth defect is indicated, the Registry requests additional targeted
      follow-up information from the HCP. Data are collected on exposure to Savella, potential
      confounding factors, pregnancy outcome, and pediatric outcome for all live born babies. Cases
      are reviewed and classified according to type of birth defects. Adverse event cases are
      forwarded to Allergan.
