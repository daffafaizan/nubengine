      previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin
      calcium, irinotecan, and bevacizumab. II. Determine the response rate and overall survival of
      this patient population treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this
      treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes,
      leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV once weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
