      and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung.

      This study will utilize pembrolizumab, a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
      receptor, thus blocks a protective mechanism of cancer cells and thereby allows the immune
      system to destroy them, in combination with chemotherapy.

      Combination chemotherapy and pembrolizumab was recently FDA approved and ongoing trials are
      utilizing this or similar combination with preliminary data demonstrating a promising safety
      profile.
