      nerve blocks (PNB) can produce surgical anaesthesia in less than 30 minutes. PNBs have been
      associated with early outcome improvements when surgery is conducted awake or with light
      sedation. These benefits include reduced nausea and vomiting, improved patient satisfaction
      and accelerated recovery room and hospital discharge. PNBs can also provide effective
      postoperative pain relief.

      Currently there is no globally accepted standard by which to assess when surgical anaesthesia
      has been achieved following administration of PNBs. The decision as to when adequate surgical
      anaesthesia has been achieved and when surgery can then proceed is usually left to the
      discretion of the anaesthetist. The anaesthetist can assess nerve blockade though several
      motor and sensory function tests: cold, heat, touch and pinprick sensitivity. Several scoring
      systems have been described using these tests to estimate when surgical anaesthesia has been
      achieved but none have been independently validated outside of the original studies in which
      they have been described.
