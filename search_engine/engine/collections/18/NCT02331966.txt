      after they will give their written informed consent. Material will be maintained in RPMI
      culture medium (Sigma, R0883, Germany). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
      healthy donors will be used as control. For detection of cancer cells in our samples we
      perform flow cytometry using EpCAM magnetic beads (39-EPC-50; Gentaur), and the negative
      selection cells (non-cancerous) are isolated and then cultured in a 25-cm2 flask (5520100;
      Orange Scientific) with RPMI-1640 medium (R6504; Sigma).

      Molecular analysis RNA is extracted from cell cultures using RNeasy Mini Kit (74105; Qiagen,
      Hilden; Germany). iScript cDNA synthesis kit (1708891; Bio-Rad, CA; USA), is used for cDNA
      synthesis and Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is performed using the iTaq
      Universal SYBR Green Supermix (1725124; Bio-Rad). Specific primers for each marker and for an
      endogenous control gene (18S rRNA) is designed using Genamic Expression 1.1 software. A
      universal Reference RNA consisting of 10 human cancer cell lines (740000-41; Agilent) as well
      as human genomic DNA (G304A; Promega) will be used in quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions
      Statistical analysis The qPCR results will be tested according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
      test; All the reactions (molecular assays, flow cytometry) are performed in triplicates. A p
      value <0.05 is considered significant.
