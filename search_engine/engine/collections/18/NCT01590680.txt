    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To provide 131I-MIBG for compassionate use in patients with neuroblastoma, who otherwise
           do not qualify for inclusion or cannot participate in the sponsor's pivotal Phase II,
           FDA-approved, clinical trial.

        -  To provide 131I-MIBG for compassionate use in patients with neuroblastoma in the absence
           of a commercially available FDA approved product for the indication.

        -  Provide palliative therapy with 131I-MIBG for patients with advanced neuroblastoma.

        -  To provide alternative therapeutic 131I-MIBG options for patients with pheochromocytoma
           / paraganglioma, not qualifying for FDA-approved MIBG treatment.

        -  To provide alternative therapeutic 131I-MIBG options for patients with pheochromocytoma
           / paraganglioma, in the absence of a commercially available FDA-approved product for
           that indication.

        -  Gain more information about acute and late toxicity of 131I-MIBG therapy for patients
           with refractory neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma.

      Patients will receive a therapeutic dose at the investigator's discretion (5-18 mCi/kg).
      However, a dose of 12 mCi/kg or higher requires stored stem cells. Patients may be eligible
      for additional 131I-MIBG treatments (up to a cumulative total of 3 treatments) if they meet
      certain criteria.

      Treatments with 131I-MIBG must be separated by a minimum of six weeks from previous 131I-MIBG
      therapy. Post-treatment evaluation will be performed 5-9 weeks (35-63 days) post treatment,
      and patients will be followed every 6 months until 2 years from therapy. All patients will
      have toxicity monitoring for 2 years following 131I-MIBG therapy, or until going off study.
