           improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after intracoronary
           autologous bone-marrow (BM) or peripheral blood origin stem cells transfer. However, it
           remains controversial, whether this beneficial effects is comparable with the
           intramyocardial delivery of the stem cells, or could be maintained during moderate and
           long term follow-up. The BOOST trial suggested that cardiac stem cell therapy did not
           improve LVEF at 5-year follow-up. By contrast, BALANCE study showed a long sustained
           benefit of BM-stem cells treatment. Due to these divergent outcomes of the presented
           trials, the aim of the present meta-analysis is to compare the safety and effectiveness
           of the cardiac stem cell therapy in different patient population, delivery mode and cell
           type, to find out, which patients with which therapy mode can have the greatest benefit
           from cardiac stem cell therapy.

        -  Study design: individual patient data meta-analysis

        -  Data sources: European Centre performing human cardiac stem cell therapy have been
           contacted calling for participation.

        -  Methods: Individual data gathering and entering into the database for a pooled analysis.
           The meta-analysis will be done in line with recommendation from the Cochrane
           Collaboration and the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses guidelines with Review
           Manager 5.0. Fixed-effect model will be used.
