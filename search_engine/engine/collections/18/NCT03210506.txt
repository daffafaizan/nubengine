      replication , but Peg-IFN-α also play an important role in immune regulation . In hepatitis B
      infection, cytokines including Fit-3L, IFN-alpha2, IFN-gama, IL-10, IL-17A,IL-2, IL-6,
      TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2,TGF-beta3, played a vital role.Peg-IFN-α recommended as the
      first-line treatment has a higher chance to achieve HBeAg seroconversion and even HBsAg
      disappearance than nucleoside analog(ue) drugs, which might be related to the increase of
      cytokine secretion in the case of hepatitis and during Peg-IFN-α therapy.This study was aimed
      at investigating the changes of cytokines during Peg-IFN-αand nucleoside analog(ue)
      therapy.Meanwhile, the investigators wanted to clarify whether Peg-IFN-α therapy led to the
      secretion of cytokines.
