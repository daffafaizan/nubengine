      million deaths per year; 6.7 million of these deaths are related to stroke. Over 80% of
      strokes are classified as ischemic. External counter pulsation (ECP) is a non-invasive method
      which consists of three sets of pneumatic cuffs attached to each of the patient's legs at the
      calf and lower and upper thigh. The inflation of the cuffs is triggered by a computer, and
      timing of the inflation is based on the R wave of the electrocardiogram. The ECP therapist
      adjusts the inflation and deflation timing to provide optimal blood movement per a finger
      plethysmogram waveform reading. This produces a retrograde flow of blood in the aorta
      resulting in a diastolic augmentation of blood flow and also an increase in venous return,
      which leads to an improved carotid perfusion pressure. Cumulative evidences demonstrate that
      ECP can augment peak diastolic and mean middle cerebral artery flow velocities, accelerate
      rehabilitation after stroke, however, no multi-center study on the effect of ECP on the
      prognosis of stroke has been reported. Thus, this study is designed to enroll 380 subjects
      with ischemic stroke after evaluation of glycolipid metabolism, heart function, transcranial
      doppler (TCD) flow velocities, endothelial function, NIHSS, BI and MMSE score, they will be
      randomized into ECP intervention or control group. All subjects receive Guideline-driven
      standard medical treatment, ECP will be carried out with a standard protocol which involves
      35 one-hour sessions (5 days a week) for continuous 7 weeks. Up to the end of ECP
      intervention, mRS of subjects will be follow up to 3 months, meanwhile, items as above will
      be retested for comparison.
