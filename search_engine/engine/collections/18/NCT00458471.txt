      clinical trial in SCI patients who require indwelling catheters for bladder drainage:

        1. Evaluate in vivo the safety of urinary catheters that have been pre-inoculated with E.
           coli 83972.

        2. Determine whether insertion of such catheters in human subjects can persistently
           colonize the neurogenic bladder with E. coli 83972. We will define persistent
           colonization as the presence of E. coli 83972 in the urine for 28 days or longer, as
           persons with indwelling catheters typically receive a new catheter every 28 days.

        3. Evaluate the biofilm present on these urinary catheters after 28 days in the bladder by
           using both sonication cultures and confocal microscopy.

      All patients will have a complete history and physical examination, serum creatinine, plain
      X-ray of the abdomen, and urine culture immediately prior to entry into the study. Renal
      ultrasound and urodynamic evaluation of the urinary tract will also be obtained upon study
      entry unless they have been performed during the preceding year.
