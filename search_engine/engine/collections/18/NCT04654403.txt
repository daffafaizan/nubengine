      results in poor OS(median<1year).Camrelizumab provided superior OS versus chemotherapy in
      heavily pretreated advanced/rucurrent ESCC.PD-1 antibody +chemo showed promisng antitumor
      activity in 1L advanced or metastatic ESCC.PD-L1 expression by CPS at cutoffâ‰¥10 has shown
      better enrichment for efficacy fo checkpoint inhibitors in ESCC.Recently, two clinical trials
      on Pembrolizumb have attracted our attention,KEYNOTE-181 and KEYNOTE-590.The median duration
      of response was 9.3 months in pembrolizumab monotherapy (KEYNOTE-181) ,and 8.3 months in
      Pembrolizumb plus chemotherapy (KEYNOTE-590). We hypothesis that administration of the PD-1
      inhibitor will significantly prolong survival compared to PD-1 inhibitor combined with
      chemotherapy, when used as maintenance therapy in patients sensitive to PD-1 inhibitors.
