    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single-dose study of AuroLase Therapy in the focal
      ablation of prostate tissue via nanoparticle directed irradiation.

      The patient population consists of men with low to intermediate risk localized prostate
      cancer with MRI visible and confirmed focal areas of prostate cancer using MR US Fusion
      Guided Biopsy.

      There is one arm/group to this study: Up to sixty (60) patients will receive a single
      intravenous infusion of AuroShell particles 12 to 36 hours prior to MRI/US guided laser
      irradiation using an FDA cleared laser and an interstitial optical fiber diffuser.

      Efficacy and acute volume of ablation will be assessed by contrast-enhanced MRI 48 - 96 hours
      after laser illumination to allow time for the appearance of coagulative necrosis and prior
      to reconfiguration of tissue by lytic action. An appearance of a 'void' (e.g., lack of
      contrast in ablation zone) on MRI would be more generally expected than lesion shrinkage.

      Efficacy of focal ablation of prostate tissue will be assessed by MRI /Ultrasound guided
      target biopsy 6 months after laser treatment and at 1 year via MRI /Ultrasound guided target
      biopsy in combination with standard systematic biopsy. Per standard of care, patient follow
      up will continue beyond the one year study visit but will be outside the scope of the study.
      Patients will be consented for up to 5 years in order to track their disease status and
      progression or recurrence if any.
