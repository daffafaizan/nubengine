      block, with permanent pacemaker implant indications recommended by current guidelines.
      Patients were assessed for preoperative electrocardiogram, quality of life scores, cardiac
      function, and left and right ventricular synchrony. Patients were followed up by regular
      outpatients. The electrocardiogram, quality of life score, echocardiographic function, left
      and right ventricular synchrony, pacing parameters and pacing ratio were evaluated
      immediately after surgery, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. At the same time,
      the left bundle branch area pacing success rate, complications during intraoperative and
      postoperative follow-up were recorded.
