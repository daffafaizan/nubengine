      Science University (OHSU). They will be recruited during their 1st or 2nd trimester. After
      consent, baseline measures will be collected including height, weight, body composition
      measurements using calipers, 24-hour dietary recalls, and blood and urine samples. Women will
      also complete questionnaires regarding ADHD symptoms, stress, depression, and lifestyle.
      Women will be given a one-week food diary to fill out at home, which will be mailed in upon
      completion. Upon receipt of the food diary, women will be randomized into either a nutrition
      intervention group or a standard-of-care group. Women who are randomized to the intervention
      group will receive individual nutritional counseling every 2 weeks during their 3rd trimester
      of pregnancy. Before delivery, the baseline measures described above will again be collected.
      At delivery, placenta and cord blood samples will be taken. After birth, the infant will
      undergo an MRI between 2 and 5 weeks of age. The scan is completed while the baby sleeps, and
      special ear protection is worn to limit sleep disruption from the noise of the MRI. When the
      infant is 3 months old, mothers will complete questionnaires about infant feeding, sleep and
      behavior.
