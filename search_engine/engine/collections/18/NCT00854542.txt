      Live and interactive Telepsychiatry (using videoconferencing) brings tremendous opportunities
      to clinical care, education, research, and administration. In the U.S. to date,
      telepsychiatry has been implemented in rural areas where people lack access to psychiatrists
      (Baer et al, 1997), in the Prison System with service users constrained from traveling
      (Brecht et al., 1996), in rural native American resettlement areas (Shore & Spero, 2005), and
      in Alaska where residents are faced with both distance and a shortage of mental health
      professionals. In this proposed study, we plan to investigate the effectiveness of
      telepsychiatry-based CSCT (T-CSCT) to provide culturally sensitive collaborative management
      of MDD to monolingual Chinese Americans. For this group of patients, telepsychiatry
      consultation could be a necessity both in urban as well as rural primary care clinics that
      are not staffed with bilingual psychiatrists. T-CSCT plans to utilize the advanced
      telemedicine technology in major academic centers to connect the scarce resource of bilingual
      and bicultural mental health professionals to underserved Chinese Americans to improve their
      access to treatment of MDD.

      T-CSCT will explore the usefulness and effectiveness of recognizing MDD subjects through
      consumer-initiated depression self-screening using the validated CB-PHQ-9, which will be made
      available in community newspapers, journals, and on the internet. To facilitate care
      management for Chinese Americans, a Depression Toolkit for Chinese Americans will be
      developed, which will include information on the nature and treatment of MDD, the CB-PHQ-9
      for depression self-screening, a bilingual instrument to monitor progress of depressive
      symptoms, strategies for patients to negotiate with health professionals for individually
      tailored treatment for depression, and answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) by Asian
      American immigrants on MDD and its treatment. If shown to be effective, the T-CSCT can be the
      prototype of a telemedicine-based Multiracial Mental Health Resource Center to provide
      services to other minority populations to reduce disparities in mental health treatment.
