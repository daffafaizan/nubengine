      this study intervention. The purpose of a pilot study is to obtain the preliminary data
      needed to justify performing a larger clinical trial on the effectiveness of an
      investigational intervention.

      Standard treatment for the subjects' disease includes chemoradiation and immunotherapy.

      In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds
      the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells and areas of inflammation. For
      the PET scans in this study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance called
      [11C]PBR28.

      The investigators would like to see if this tracer can be used to detect changes in
      inflammation during tumor treatment. PBR-PET scans will be performed at screening before
      therapy and then several weeks/months after the start of therapy, depending on the type of
      therapy used. No diagnostic decisions or clinical treatment decisions will be made based on
      any results obtained from these PET scans, and there will be no change in care. The
      information from these studies may help the investigators design methods that could be used
      in larger studies to more completely understand the role of inflammation in the treatment of
      cancer.
