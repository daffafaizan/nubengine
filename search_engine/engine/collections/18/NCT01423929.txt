      balloon angioplasty (PCI) to open the occluded coronary artery, and thereby to reduce or
      abolish the myocardial infarction. Standard treatment in these cases is 10-15 l of
      supplemental oxygen to reduce the myocardial ischemia and the infarct size. It is, however,
      unknown whether supplemental O2 is beneficial or detrimental to patients with STEMI
      undergoing PCI.

      This study aims to evaluate the effects of treatment with supplemental O2 in acute PCI for
      STEMI.

      The study is a multicenter single blind parallel group randomized trial. One hundred normoxic
      STEMI ambulance patients accepted for primary PCI are randomized in the ambulance to either
      standard O2 treatment (10 l/min) or no supplemental O2, to be given until the end of the
      acute PCI. All patients undergo cardiac MRI at day 4-6 to determine area at risk, infarct
      size and myocardial salvage index. Fifty patients undergo an extended echocardiography during
      the hospital stay to assess infarct size and wall motion score index. All patients are
      followed for 6 months. At 6 months, perceived health (EQ-5D) and NT-proBNP are recorded for
      all patients, and an additional echocardiography is performed for the subgroup of 50
      patients. The primary endpoint is myocardial salvage index. Secondary endpoints include pain
      difference between inclusion time and start of PCI and wall motion score index on
      echocardiography.
