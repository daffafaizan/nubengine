      platelet rich plasma for the treatment of chronic tendinosis. Diagnosis of tendinosis will be
      confirmed utilizing ultrasound diagnostic criteria similar to past published studies. The
      study will be a prospective single blinded study utilizing sham phlebotomy, which currently
      is not found in the published literature. All interventions will be done ultrasound-guided
      which no studies in the published literature have done prospectively. The main variables of
      interest include patient outcomes such as improved function, objective clinical improvement
      as seen on serial ultrasound surveillance and patient reported utility. Secondary outcomes
      include: determine patient's ability to return to sport or activity and level of activity
      able to achieve using validated questionnaires. Lastly, compliance with survival curve data
      will also be evaluated.
