    
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if intra-articular administration of low
      dose TXA following THA and TKA results in a clinically relevant reduction in blood loss. The
      secondary purpose is to determine if there is an increased risk of thromboembolic phenomena
      with the use of TXA following elective THA and TKA. The primary outcome metric will be - drop
      in hemoglobin following surgery; secondary metrics include blood loss, transfusion rate,
      d-dimers, troponin levels, symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism
      (PE), vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke), major and minor bleeding, and death.
