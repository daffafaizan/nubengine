      improvement in fibrosis of at least 1 stage (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis clinical research
      network [NASH CRN]) and no worsening of steatohepatitis at Month 12. Subjects from Part 1
      will continue into Part 2 and additional subjects will be newly randomized in Part 2 to
      determine long-term clinical outcomes composed of histopathologic progression to cirrhosis,
      liver-related clinical outcomes, and all-cause mortality.
