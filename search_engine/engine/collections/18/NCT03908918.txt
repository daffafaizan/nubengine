      evidence of high scientific rigor to support their therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the
      tracking of wellness outcomes, stress resilience and functioning as a result of use of a
      therapeutic digital product is a challenging task requiring expertise in technology. In this
      study, the investigators aim to investigate not only the effectiveness of an app-based MBT in
      aging adults, but also the mechanisms of efficacy - i.e. the therapeutic effects - of app
      usage, including changes in, depression, anxiety, or mood and the acceptance of the app in
      older adult populations. The investigators also aim to measure the Return On Investment (ROI)
      of mobile mindfulness on health services utilization.

      The study is a randomized controlled design with 1:1 equal allocation to treatment
      (Experimental Am app group) or control (treatment as usual). The investigators will recruit
      82 participants in total.

      The Experimental group will start the 4 week Am app intervention immediately after
      randomization and baseline intervention questionnaires, while the wait-list control group
      will receive treatment as usual. Assessments are conducted at four time point: At Baseline
      (#1), Post-Intervention (#2), Follow-up at 3 months post baseline (#3) and Follow-up at 6
      months post baseline (#4).

      The clinical champions that referred the patient to the study will complete brief surveys
      about the quality of their appointments with the patient at two time points: At baseline (#1)
      and Post-Intervention (#2).

      The waitlist control group will be granted access to the mindfulness intervention at 6 months
      post baseline.
