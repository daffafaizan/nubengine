      I. The primary objective of this study is to determine the activity of bevacizumab for
      treatment of symptomatic vestibular schwannomas (VS) defined as progressive hearing loss in
      patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) based on objective hearing response.

      SECONDARY OJBECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab in this patient population on an
      every three week dosing schedule of 7.5mg/kg for 12 months of therapy.

      II. Assess the rate of radiographic response (>= 20% reduction in volume). III. Determine the
      growth rate of VS using volumetric MRI analysis in comparison to 1-dimensional and
      2-dimensional measurements.

      IV. Assess changes in function of the auditory system during bevacizumab treatment.

      V. Assess the vascular permeability (Ktrans), relative cerebral blood volume/flow, mean
      transit time, and mean vessel diameter from perfusion-weighted MRI.

      VI. Assess the change in circulating endothelial cells, circulating progenitor cells, and
      plasma angiogenic proteins in subjects receiving bevacizumab treatment.

      VII. Observe the impact of bevacizumab on non-VS tumors in patients with NF2 via whole body
      MRI.

      VIII. Explore hearing related QOL measures throughout treatment. IX. Explore the effect of
      treatment with bevacizumab on auditory function using distortion product optoacoustic
      emissions (DPOAE) (to be evaluated at NCI only).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once every 3 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 6 weeks for up to 48 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
