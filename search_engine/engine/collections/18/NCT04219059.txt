      the aim to overcome the limitation of qualitative image interpretation, and provide
      biomarkers for disease characterization. In particular, the new paradigm, "radiomics", is
      emerging as the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from imaging which can
      aid in characterizing phenotype as in vivo expression of tumoral genotype. The goal of
      radiomics is to extract accurate and reliable quantitative biomarkers which enhance
      diagnostic confidence in oncology. A combination of correct interpretation of imaging and
      biopsy has given promising results in terms of detecting clinically significant cancer at
      radical prostatectomy.
