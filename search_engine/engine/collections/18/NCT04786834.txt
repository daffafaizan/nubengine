      12) and gynecology (n = 12)) residents (n = 36) from the KU Leuven and University of Gent
      residency training programs will be randomized (in equal discipline numbers) to Traditional
      Halstedian apprenticeship type training or proficiency based progression (PBP) training to
      learn to perform a vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) on a chicken model. Both groups will
      receive the same e-learning (on how to perform the VUA on the chicken model) and skills
      laboratory robotic training curriculum. The PBP trained group will however be required to
      demonstrate quantitively defined proficiency benchmarks for training progression (i.e., from
      e-learning to the skills lab). The PBP group will also have a defined benchmark to
      demonstrate before training is deemed completed. The Traditional trained group will train in
      the same skills laboratory for a case-matched period of time as the PBP group, with the same
      level of supervising faculty proctors and using the same training resources but with no
      proficiency benchmarks or metric-based feedback. Both groups will be required to perform a
      VUA on the chicken model before skills training proper and at the end of training.
      Investigators will be trained in pairs to assess VUA performance from a pre-defined set of
      explicitly defined binary metric events reliably (inter-rater reliability > 0.8). They will
      also be blinded as to the identity of the trainee performing the procedure, how they were
      trained (i.e., group) and procedure order.

      H1 It is hypothesized that implementation of PBP training in teaching the robotic suturing of
      VUA leads to better surgical training outcomes (i.e., lower number of performance errors)
      when compared to Halsted's method.
