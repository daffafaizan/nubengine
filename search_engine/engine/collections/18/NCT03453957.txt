      between research and practice. Research indicates that: the therapist-patient alliance is
      important to reduce patient symptoms, alliance tensions are detrimental to patients, and
      those therapists who identify and repair alliance tensions can improve patient outcomes. In
      this study we will use state of the art research to train community-based therapists in
      evidence-based interventions to identify and repair alliance tensions. Trained therapists and
      their patients will be compared to therapists who provide usual care to their patients.
      Improvement in therapists' skills in identifying and repairing alliance tensions and how this
      is associated with better patient mental health outcomes will be measured. Trained therapists
      will be interviewed to identify the best ways of improving the training and disseminating the
      findings to psychotherapists across Canada. Research to improve practicing therapists'
      ability to identify and repair therapeutic alliance tensions will result in better mental
      health outcomes for patients.
