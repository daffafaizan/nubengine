      of gabapentin compared to placebo for pain management during the time after dilator insertion
      and prior to D&E the subsequent day.

        -  Participants will receive gabapentin 600 mg or placebo prior to dilator insertion

        -  Pain scores will be measured via numeric rating scale (NRS) at baseline and 5 minutes
           after last dilator insertion while the participant is in clinic

        -  Additional pain scores, side effects (specifically dizziness and sedation), and
           additional analgesic use will be obtained by text message while the patient is home at 2
           hours, 4 hours, and 8 hours after time of dilator insertion

        -  Subjects will take a second dose of study drug (either gabapentin 600 mg or placebo,
           concordant with their initial medication) at 8 hours after their first dose

        -  Final pain score, side effect, and analgesic use assessment will occur upon presentation
           to the pre-operative are for D&E the subsequent day

      There will be no change in standard insertion of osmotic dilators (hygroscopic dilators only
      with Lidocaine 20mL cervical anesthesia), or provision of home analgesic medications
      (ibuprofen and acetaminophen with codeine in our practice).

      The investigators hypothesize that women who receive gabapentin will report a smaller
      increase in pain from baseline at 8 hours after dilator placement compared to women receiving
      placebo.
