      of reproductive age by 50% by 2025. In 2016, the WHO implemented a global policy recommending
      oral iron supplementation (60 mg daily for 12 weeks) for all women where anemia prevalence is
      more than 40%, such as in Cambodia.

      However, recent studies have shown the prevalence of iron deficiency to be low in Cambodian
      women. If iron deficiency is not the cause of anemia, then iron supplementation will not be
      effective at treating it. Further, iron supplementation may be harmful in some individuals,
      especially those with anemia caused by genetic blood disorders (which are common in
      Cambodia), as these individuals are already at an increased risk of iron overload. The risks
      are made greater by the fact that the type of iron that is commonly used in supplements
      (ferrous sulfate) is poorly absorbed. Typically, less than 20% is absorbed in the gut; the
      remaining 80% is unabsorbed in the colon where it can increase the risk of pathogen growth
      and gut inflammation.

      To investigate the safety of untargeted iron supplementation, we will undertake a new study
      in Cambodia, where we will evaluate a newer type of iron supplement that may be absorbed
      better, and thus, safer than the conventional type. We will recruit non-pregnant women (18-45
      years) and ask them to take one of the two forms of iron (ferrous sulfate or ferrous
      bisglycinate) or a placebo for 12 weeks (in line with the WHO global policy). We will measure
      hemoglobin and ferritin levels, which are markers of anemia and iron status, and markers of
      gut inflammation and gut pathogen abundance, before and after the intervention. This study
      will contribute to the evidence for safe and effective iron supplementation for women
      worldwide.
