      cholesterol. Patients who are on baseline statin therapy will be randomly assigned in a 1:1
      ratio to colesevelam 3.75 g daily for 24 weeks, or ezetimibe 10 mg daily for 24 weeks. If a
      patient has statin intolerance, they may be on a fibrate and/or niacin, or on no lipid
      lowering therapy. The primary efficacy objectives are

        1. to demonstrate that colesevelam 3.75 g daily is non-inferior to ezetimibe 10 mg daily as
           add-on to statin therapy for patients achieving a composite target of HbA1c (≤ 7.0%) and
           LDL cholesterol (≤ 2.0 mmol/L) at week 24, and

        2. to compare the proportion of patients achieving a composite target of HbA1c (≤ 7.0%) and
           LDL cholesterol (≤ 2.0 mmol/L) at week 24.

      This study will also assess the primary composite outcome in a sub-group of patients on
      sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy.
