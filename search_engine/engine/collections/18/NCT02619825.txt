      specific consultation built around a clinical examination and echocardiography, in two
      stages, with estimates of the stiffness of the myocardium ShearWave Elastography (AixplorerÂ®)
      and measures of all echocardiographic parameters estimated in children with a clinical
      ultrasound machine (Philips and General Electric).

      Following this consultation, clinic and electrocardiographic monitoring period will be
      observed for 30 minutes, to ensure the safety of our procedure.

      Required subjects: 40 healthy volunteers + 80 = 120 persons
