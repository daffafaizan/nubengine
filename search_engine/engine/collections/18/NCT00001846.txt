    
      Background:

      -NIH and FDA intramural investigators performing in vitro studies involving human blood
      components have a need for a steady, reliable, consistent source of these blood components,
      preferably derived from screened donors documented to be free of potential
      transfusion-transmissible diseases.

      Objectives:

        -  To provide a mechanism, that is reviewed and approved by IRB, for the Department of
           Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center to collect and process blood and blood components
           from paid, healthy volunteer donors for distribution to NIH intramural investigators and
           FDA laboratories for in vitro research use.

        -  To provide adequate and complete informed consent to the donors of research blood
           samples, and to assure that the education, counseling, and protection of the study
           subjects (research blood donors) from research risks is performed in accordance with
           IRB, OPRR and other applicable Federal regulatory standards.

      Eligibility:

      Donors must meet the eligibility criteria for volunteer whole blood donation with the
      exception of foreign travel history and other requirements, some of which are outlined below:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Weight greater than 110 pounds

        -  No known heart, lung, kidney disease, or bleeding disorders

        -  No history of sickle cell disease

        -  Female subjects should not be pregnant

      Design:

        -  Donors meeting research donor eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate blood and
           blood components by standard phlebotomy and apheresis techniques.

        -  The investigational nature of the studies in which their blood will be used, and the
           risks and discomforts of the donation process will be carefully explained to the donors,
           and a signed informed consent document will be obtained.

        -  Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule based on the duration
           and discomfort of the donation.

        -  NIH and FDA investigators requesting blood components for research use will be required
           to submit an electronic (Web-based) memo of request, briefly describing the nature of
           the research, and providing assurance that samples provided through this protocol will
           be used solely for in vitro and not for in vivo research.

        -  Blood components for research use will be distributed with a unique product number, and
           the DTM principal and associate investigators will serve as the custodians of the code
           that links the product with a donor s identity.
