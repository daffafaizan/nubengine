    
      Subjects are selected as they are enrolled in the Tinnitus Research Group between January
      2014 and September 2018. The study was approved by the local medical ethics committee for
      research at the Medical School of University of SÃ£o Paulo - protocol number 611.174 in April,
      2014.

      All the procedures were performed after medical evaluation and a complete tinnitus evaluation
      protocol, which included somatosensory assessment, self-related questionnaires for tinnitus
      and hearing: Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA),
      and , for anxiety and depression symptoms: Generalized Anxiety Depression Scale (GAD-7) and
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and for neck pain (Neck Disability Index, NDI). The
      subjects of this study were also blood tested for pregnancy and diabetes, which may interfere
      on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography PET acquisition.

      All subjects underwent hearing and tinnitus evaluation, counseling and hearing aid fitting.

      To prescribe and verify acoustic response, we used the HA fitting protocol recommended by the
      National Acoustics Laboratories (NAL), named NAL NL-2 (NL-non linear) FDG-PET measurements
      were obtained at baseline (prior to HA fitting) and after 6 months of HA use.

      Regarding FDG-PET images, a within-subject analysis was performed by comparing pre-treatment
      and post-treatment group using paired-t-tests.
