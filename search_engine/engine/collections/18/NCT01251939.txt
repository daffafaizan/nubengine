      infants.There are clear associations between a PDA and decreased renal and splanchnic blood
      flow. The aim is to monitor, using near-infrared spectroscopy, the effect of ibuprofen on the
      fractional tissue (renal and mesenteric) oxygen extraction (FTOE) in preterm newborns during
      ibuprofen of the treatment PDA.
