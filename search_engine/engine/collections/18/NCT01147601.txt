      history and the hemangioma. Photographs and measurements will be taken at this and each
      subsequent visit. At the first visit, subjects will have a physical exam, including vital
      signs, height and weight. An EKG will also be done. Study drug will be dispensed and
      instructions given. Half of the subjects will receive a placebo. This is a blinded randomized
      study. Follow-up visits will be weekly for the first two weeks (three visits total including
      the first visit), then monthly until the study is over. Photographs and measurements will
      again be taken at each visit. Subjects will be asked to evaluate the size and the color of
      the hemangioma against the first photographs and fill out forms regarding any changes in
      behavior and asked about any side effects.
