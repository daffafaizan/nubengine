    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate benefit of post-surgical stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on the resection bed
      in providing 6 month local control (decreasing the risk of local tumor recurrence) when
      compared to surgical resection alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival, development of distant brain metastases and complications related to
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery to the surgical cavity within 30 days of
      the craniotomy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo clinical observation after craniotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 5-8 weeks, every 6-9 weeks
      for 1 year, every 3-4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
