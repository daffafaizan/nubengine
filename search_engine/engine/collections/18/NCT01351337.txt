      subjects adopted early postoperative MRI examinations (within 3 days) to evaluate both the
      extent of tumor resection and the integrity of the PTs. Muscle strength was assessed
      preoperatively and postoperatively.The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) was adopted for
      grading functional status at the 6-month evaluation. Further tumor progression interval and
      survival analysis was conducted for each subject with high-grade glioma (HGG)
