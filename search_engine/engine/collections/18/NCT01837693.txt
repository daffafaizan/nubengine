    
      Individual data about the following study steps are collected according a fixed format:

        1. recruited women

        2. HPV DNA result

        3. cytology and randomization results

        4. p16 result

        5. mRNA result

        6. colposcopies (with relative cytology and histologies) results

        7. Women excluded after informed consent

        8. Interventions During the first year of recruitment, there will be two semi-annual
           sending of data, then each year.

      To analyze the study progress in each center, summary tables will periodically send to the
      PI.

      All CIN lesions and cancers found in the study will be be blindly reviewed. A set of quality
      assurance procedures will be implemented for both the molecular tests, including the use of
      controls provided by the manufacturers with known HPV DNA or mRNA content and the circulation
      of clinical samples prepared by the laboratories participating in the study.
