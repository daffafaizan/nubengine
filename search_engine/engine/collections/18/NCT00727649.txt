      life. Both fiber and loperamide are common, first-line treatments for diarrhea-associated FI
      in primary care. No known studies exist that compare fiber and loperamide for
      diarrhea-predominant FI. Further knowledge is needed to define which treatment is more
      effective and to compare drug tolerability (side effects) for FI. This study will also look
      at changes in quality of life with treatment and potential mechanisms of drug treatment.
