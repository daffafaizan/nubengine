    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Investigate whether changes in prosurvival signaling occur by comparing activation of
           the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) and Stat5 pathways in
           paired diagnostic and relapse samples.

        -  Investigate changes in leukemia cell responses to extrinsic cues from the environment
           change, using a bone marrow stromal-cell co-culture model of chemotherapy resistance.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved samples are analyzed for Stat3 and Stat5 expression by flow cytometry
      and in vitro chemotherapy sensitivity.
