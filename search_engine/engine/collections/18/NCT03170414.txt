    
      This is a prospective observational study of solid organ transplantation utilizing
      HIV-positive donors in HIV-positive recipients. Stable HIV-infected adults in need of a solid
      organ transplant (kidney, liver) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for organ
      transplantation will be offered enrollment in the study. Deceased donors (kidney, liver) and
      living donors (liver) will be utilized in this protocol. No living kidney donors will be
      enrolled.

      This study will evaluate overall survival and graft survival. In addition the study will
      assess potential complications of organ transplant using HIV+ donor organs, including but not
      limited to: HIV disease progression, development of antiretroviral resistance mutations,
      incidence of opportunistic infections, incidence of transplant complications, impacts of
      liver regeneration, incidence of viral-related malignancies, and incidence of
      HIV-superinfection.
