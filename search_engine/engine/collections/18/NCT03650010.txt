      radiographic outcomes . Few studies exist in the literature and rarely report fix-bearing and
      mobile-bearing prosthetics [1-4]. Therefore the data related to this study can be considered
      a reference in the literature.

      Patients who performed and will perform ankle prosthesis surgery from January 2011 to March
      2026 and who underwent a clinical evaluation (also using questionnaires and scores) and
      radiographic evaluation.

      The clinical data and radiological parameters were collected together with the visits and the
      procedures prescribed according to the clinical routine of the department.
