      demonstrating a decrease in the 2-year Relapse Incidence (RI) and in the 2-year Cumulative
      Relapse Incidence among the Midostaurin-treated patients compared to a cohort of historical
      controls. The investigators established that a 20% net reduction in the 2-year RI may be a
      clinically significant goal. So the investigators set our RI objective at 28%. Furthermore,
      the investigators will assess if the experimental treatment may obtain an increased 5-years
      Overall, Disease-Free and Event free Survival. The safety profile of Midostaurin given in
      combination with induction and consolidation chemotherapy and as a single agent in
      maintenance in CBFL patients will also be assessed.
