      children with life-threatening conditions. However, children with cognitive impairment are
      frequently excluded from these studies. Our study will evaluate the efficacy a
      family-centered songwriting intervention for the following outcomes: child psychological and
      physical symptoms, parent psychological distress, and family environment.

      Following recruitment, parent-child dyads will undergo 4 sessions with a licensed music
      therapist (anticipated to last 1 hour each). During these sessions, families and their
      children will select a song and engage in a songwriting process which includes various
      physiologic sounds from the child (i.e. heart rate, breathing). At the conclusion of these
      four sessions, a music DVD will be produced and delivered to the family.
