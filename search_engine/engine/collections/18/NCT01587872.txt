    
      This is a prospective cohort study to investigate the performance of the test instrument. The
      test instrument consists of a slim, flexible colonoscope with an overtube and an inflatable
      balloon on the tip of the colonoscope and the tip of the overtube. Patients are eligible for
      inclusion if conventional colonoscopy fails due to technical difficulties such as loop
      formation, long colonic segments or suspected adhesions. Written informed consent is
      required. The study procedures will be performed immediately after the failed conventional
      colonoscopy, or on a rescheduled appointment within four weeks.
