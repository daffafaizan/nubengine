    
      A prospective, single-blind, randomized control trial of 40 individuals with early-stage PD
      (Hoehn & Yahr stages 1 to 3). Those with PD will be randomly assigned to either a TC group or
      a control group. The TC group will participate in a biomechanical-based TC training program
      that is formed based on the movement analysis of TC and will be practiced two to three times
      a week for 12 weeks. The control group will be asked to engage or maintain their regular
      physical activity for a period of 12 weeks. The primary and secondary outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline, 6-week, and 12-week after commencing the study protocol. The primary
      outcome measures will include gait speed, cadence, step length during level surface walking
      (simple task) and fixed-obstacle crossing (challenging task); the dynamic postural stability
      will be indicated by the center of mass and center of pressure (COM-COP) separation distance
      and clearance distance measured during fixed-obstacle crossing. The secondary measures will
      be the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating scale (UPDRS-III), single leg-stance test with eyes
      open and closed, and three cognitive scores (Stroop Test, Trail Making Test- Part B, and the
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test).
