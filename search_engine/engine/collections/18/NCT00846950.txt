      However, the exact role is very unclear. The role it plays in memory performance is highly
      disputed, as animal studies show decreased performance when the H1-receptor is blocked in the
      central nervous system while such findings in humans is scarce. To clarify the role of
      histamine in human memory and different processes in cognition, the effects of an
      H1-antagonist (dexchlorpheniramine) on memory, alertness and sensory and motor processes are
      measured. The study will be conducted according to a within subject cross-over design using
      healthy volunteers.
