    
      Part A: The starting doses for both intermittent schedules will be 300 mg bd of olaparib and
      either AZD5363 given at 320 mg bd 4-days-on, 3-days-off, or 480 mg bd 2-days-on, 5-days-off.
      These starting doses are based on available data from the first-in-human studies
      [D0810C00002] (AstraZeneca) and [D3610C00001] (AstraZeneca) of both drugs, respectively.

      A general schema for 3 potential dose levels to be pursued on the 4-days-on, 3-days-off
      AZD5363 schedule (Schedule A) and 2-days-on, 5-days-off AZD5363 schedule (Schedule B) in Part
      A of the study are listed below. The starting dose of olaparib will be fixed at 300mg bd in
      both schedules. These schema only provide general guidance; it will be possible for doses of
      one or both drugs to be escalated or de-escalated in a "seesaw" fashion contingent on the
      toxicity and/or PK/PD data reported. This may create dose cohort combinations not listed
      below. Both PK and PD data will be taken into consideration if available. With the exception
      of dose level 1, actual dose escalation/de-escalation will be determined following a
      discussion with the SRC during dose escalation teleconferences. Dose escalation will continue
      until MTD(s) are reached. Patients will be dosed on a flat scale and not by body weight or
      body surface area. Both schedules will be carried out in parallel.

      Table 1: Schema for dose escalation in schedule A (4-days-on, 3-days-off AZD5363) Dose level
      (DL) olaparib bd AZD5363 bd 4d-on, 3d-off

        -  1 200mg* 240mg

             1. 300mg 320mg

             2. 300mg 400mg

             3. 300mg 480mg

                *An intermediate dose of 250mg bd of olaparib may be considered depending on
                drug-related toxicities observed and patient tolerability

                Table 2: Schema for dose escalation in schedule B (2-days-on, 5-days-off AZD5363)
                Dose level (DL) olaparib bd AZD5363 bd 2d-on, 5d-off

        -  1 200mg* 400mg

             1. 300mg 480mg

             2. 300mg 560mg

             3. 300mg 640mg

                  -  An intermediate dose of 250mg bd of olaparib may be considered depending on
                     drug-related toxicities observed and patient tolerability

      After careful review of the clinical toxicity data, if the DLT is deemed to be caused by one
      of the agents, the responsible drug may be dose decreased and if well tolerated, the other
      agent maybe be increased in subsequent cohorts. If necessary, both drugs can also be dose
      de-escalated.

      In Part A of the study, olaparib will be administered continuously with intermittent AZD5363
      in 21-day cycles. Intrapatient dose escalation of AZD5363 will be utilised to evaluate
      different dose levels. The optimal dose schedule selected based on toxicity, PK-PD and/or
      efficacy data will be taken forward into two expansion cohorts in Part B of the study. Cohort
      1 will comprise patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutated tumours, while Cohort 2 will comprise
      advanced sporadic cancers that may harbour HR defects (e.g. TNBC, CRPC and HGSOC) or those
      with somatic mutations or other aberrations known to result in a hyperactivated
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway.
