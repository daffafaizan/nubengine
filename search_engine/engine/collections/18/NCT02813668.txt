      delivery, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a worksite-based lifestyle improvement
      package including a peer-led lifestyle change education program (described below) augmented
      with changes in the worksite environment that promote social support, healthy eating and
      exercise. The lifestyle education program will include 2000 adults with prediabetes (HbA1c of
      5.7-6.4%) or unmedicated diabetes (HbA1c â‰¥ 6.5% identified at screening) across ten diverse
      worksites in India (changes to the worksite environment will impact a much broader population
      of employees). A mixed methods approach will be used to evaluate implementation of the
      program.

      Participants at high risk for diabetes or with unmedicated diabetes will be enrolled in a
      lifestyle intervention training program that includes strategies to maintain a healthy
      weight, maintain healthy blood glucose levels, eat a healthy diet, increase physical
      activity, overcome barriers, and build social support. Participants will be assigned two
      goals to achieve during lifestyle classes; to increase the physical activity to at least 150
      minutes per week of moderate level activity and lose at least 5% of their baseline body
      weight. Participants also will be given knowledge and tools necessary to improve their diet
      quality and quantity.
