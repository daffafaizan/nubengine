    
      Patients must have received a clinical diagnosis of NF1 and have inoperable,
      progressive/symptomatic PN, where inoperable is defined as PN that cannot be surgically
      completely removed without risk of substantial morbidity.

      The population are patients with NF1 who have inoperable, progressive/symptomatic PN aged â‰¥
      2years with onset of disease before they were 18 years and who have demonstrated an ability
      to swallow whole capsules, who have no further treatment options and are not eligible for
      clinical trials.

      There is no maximum duration for selumetinib treatment. Patients may continue to receive
      selumetinib as long as they continue to show clinical benefit, as judged by the treating
      physician, and in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Once patients have been discontinued from treatment, other available treatment options will
      be at the discretion of the physician
