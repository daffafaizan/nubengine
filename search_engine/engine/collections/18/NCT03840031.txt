      sweet potatoes labelled with Fe-58 daily for a period of 10 days and will then switch to the
      test meals consisting of 400g steamed and mashed control sweet potatoes labelled with Fe-57
      for a period of 10 days. The order of test meal type is random. A baseline blood sample will
      be taken on the first meal feeding day prior to consumption of any test meals, on study day
      26 (14 days after completion of the first test meal period) and on Day 40 (14 days after
      completion of the second test meal period). Erythrocyte incorporation of the stable isotope
      labels will be measured in these blood samples using an ICPMS and will be used to calculate
      fractional and total iron absorption from the two different type of test meals.
