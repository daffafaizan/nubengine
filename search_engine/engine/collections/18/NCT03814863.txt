      glaucoma, and uveitis can be expressed as red eyes. The disease with red eye as the main
      complaint is the most common condition that clinicians need to identify. It is not uncommon
      to be misdiagnosed and missed clinically. The collection and analysis of the disease
      composition of the "red eye" in Chinese ophthalmology clinics will help to understand the
      current status of "red eye" related diseases and provide a systematic and comprehensive
      clinical basis for the differential diagnosis of red eye.
