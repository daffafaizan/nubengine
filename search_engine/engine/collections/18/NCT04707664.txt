      approximately 400 adult patients who are symptomatic with mild or moderate COVID-19 (as
      defined in the FDA Guidance Document: Covid-19: Developing Drugs and Biological Products for
      Treatment or Prevention, May 2020) who are at high risk for progression to more severe
      disease. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to inhaled sargramostim plus standard of
      care (SOC) or placebo plus SOC. All patients will be randomized to receive either 250 mcg of
      sargramostim or equivalent volume of placebo diluent. Treatment will be administered once
      daily for 5 days delivered via a vibrating mesh nebulizer. Patients will be followed for up
      to 60 days after start of treatment.

      Sargramostim (Leukine) is a formulation of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor
      (GM-CSF), which is a critical cytokine for healthy pulmonary function. Detailed studies have
      shown that GM-CSF is necessary for alveolar macrophage (AM) maturation and maintenance.
      Although GM-CSF was discovered as a myelopoietic growth factor, it has diverse additional
      effects that both promote differentiation of myeloid precursors into neutrophils, monocytes,
      and dendritic cells and control function of mature myeloid cells. GM-CSF is also known to
      reverse immunoparalysis seen in sepsis, resulting in beneficial outcomes. In addition, GM-CSF
      prevents bacteremia in post influenza bacterial pneumonia through locally mediated improved
      lung antibacterial resistance and increased reactive oxygen species production by AMs.
      Pulmonary delivery of this GM-CSF has potential to reduce morbidity and mortality due to
      viral pneumonias, potentially including COVID-19.
