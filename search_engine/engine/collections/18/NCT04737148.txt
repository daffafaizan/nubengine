      for burn patients admitted to the intensive care unit and to determine the risk factors
      associated with poor outcomes.

      A total of 211 patients with who were admitted to the ICBU in a tertiary care centre in
      Kuwait from January 2017 to December 2019 were analysed retrospectively. Data were collected
      using patient medical records. The FLAMES, BOBI and revised Baux scores were calculated, and
      the survivor and non-survivor scores of patients were analysed to determine the sensitivity,
      specificity and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) of the different
      scoring modalities.
