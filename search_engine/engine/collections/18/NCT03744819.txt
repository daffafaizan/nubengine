      will be recruited to this study. Tumor samples were obtained from patients underwent surgery
      to establish the baseline status of biomarker assessed. Peripheral and microbiota will also
      be collected before and after surgery. For patients undergoing radiotherapy, tumor biopsy as
      well as collection of blood samples and microbiota will be performed during the course of
      treatment. These biological specimens will be used for assessment of tumor phenotypes and for
      exploration of potential biomarkers that could predict the tumor response to therapeutics and
      prognsis in patients with solid tumors.
