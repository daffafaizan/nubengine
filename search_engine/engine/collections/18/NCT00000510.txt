      By dilating coronary stenoses, PTCA can relieve angina pectoris and improve exercise
      tolerance and left ventricular function. However, restenosis occurs in 20-30 percent of
      dilated stenoses within three to six months following PTCA making it necessary to restrict
      patient activities, resume antianginal medications, repeat PTCA, or perform coronary artery
      bypass surgery.

      Balloon dilatation of the atherosclerotic lesion damages the endothelium, intima, and media
      of the artery. This may lead to restenosis via platelet deposition, mural thrombus formation,
      and intimal proliferation by mechanisms that appear similar to those causing aortocoronary
      vein graft (ACVG) occlusions. It had been demonstrated that dipyridamole plus aspirin therapy
      suppressed these mechanisms of ACVG occlusion in the animal model, prolonged a shortened
      platelet survival in patients with coronary artery disease, and reduced ACVG occlusions in
      patients both early and late after the operation. Thus, a trial of these drugs in patients
      undergoing PTCA was a logical and necessary step to reduce the major shortcoming of the
      initially successful PTCA therapy, namely the high rate of restenosis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind, fixed sample. Patients were randomized to treatment with
      dipyridamole plus aspirin or placebo.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report (QVR)
      System.
