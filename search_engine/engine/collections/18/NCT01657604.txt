      Primary:

        -  Evaluation of the major molecular response (MMR) rate at 18 months of nilotinib compared
           to nilotinib+pegylated Interferon alpha (IFN) in adult patients with newly diagnosed
           Ph/BCR-ABL CML in chronic phase.

        -  Evaluation of the feasibility to discontinue drug therapy in stable deep molecular
           response (MR4) after nilotinib versus IFN maintenance therapy.

      Secondary:

        -  Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of IFN added to nilotinib 2x300 mg/day.

        -  Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of a maintenance therapy with nilotinib
           versus IFN after stable MMR after at least 24 months of nilotinib therapy.
