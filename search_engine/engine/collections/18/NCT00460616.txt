      admitted to the hospital for a complete endocrine screening, a cardiological visit that will
      include an electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram.

      The endocrine profile will include measurement of IGF-I, PRL, FSH, LH, 17-Î²-estradiol,
      testosterone, FT3, FT4, TSH, and cortisol at 8.00 in the morning after an overnight fasting.

      The clinical profile will include blood pressure measurement at the right arm, with the
      subjects in relaxed sitting position. The average of six measurements (three taken by each of
      two examiners, in the same day of echocardiography, between 8.00-9.00 in the morning) with a
      mercury sphygmomanometer will be used in all analysis. According with the seventh report of
      the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High
      Blood Pressure (10), hypertension, if present, is classified as mild (Stage 1) when the SBP
      or DBP were between 140 and 159 mmHg and between 90 and 99 mmHg, respectively; severe (Stage
      2) when the SBP or DBP were >160 and >100 mmHg respectively; pre-hypertension is defined as
      SBP >120Â¬ and <140 and DBP >80 and <90 mmHg. Heart rate will be also measured.
