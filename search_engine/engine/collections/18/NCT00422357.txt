      case-control design. The object of this study is patients with T2DM. Patients are randomly
      assigned to start with placebo tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in boiling
      water for 20 minutes: mixture of bran powder which is already boiled in water twice plus
      spinach powder) in control groups and UD tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in
      boiling water for 20 minutes) in patients with T2DM for two months. Every two weeks, fasting
      glucose, postprandial glucose after a standard breakfast, serum insulin, lipids, alanine
      amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), creatinine (to calculate GFR),
      along with blood pressure will be measured.

      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Randomized Clinical Trial.
