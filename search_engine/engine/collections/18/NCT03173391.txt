      a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period based on diet and exercise interventions for
      screening eligible subjects. The eligible subjects are randomly assigned to HMS5552 75mg BID
      group or placebo BID group with ratio 2:1 to receive a 24-week double-blind treatment. Then
      all subjects receive 28-week open-label treatment of HMS5552 75mg BID . After 52-week
      treatment, all investigational drugs should be discontinued, followed by 1 week for safety
      evaluation.
