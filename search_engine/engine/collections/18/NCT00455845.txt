      treatment of choice for symptomatic disease and results are usually satisfactory but symptoms
      recur in 10-20% of treated women per year. Postoperative medical therapy has been
      controversial. Whereas some studies have observed a long pain free interval or higher
      pregnancy rates when surgical treatment is followed by an interval of medical suppressive
      treatment, numerous others have found no differences between the prevalence of recurrent pain
      or pregnancy rates 1-3 years after surgery treatment in women who did and did not receive
      postoperative medical treatment.Endometriosis is generally a localized disease but is
      currently managed with systemic medical therapies. The use of drugs administered locally and
      specifically aimed at pelvic organs could limit the metabolic impact without reducing
      antalgic efficacy.An intrauterine device releasing levonorgestrel, a potent
      19-nortestosterone derivative progestin, can induce amenorrhea with a different modality with
      respect to standard regimens. The levonorgestrel intrauterine device (Lng-IUD) provides an
      alternative means of administering progestins.Some researchers reported the effectiveness of
      the Lng IUD in the patients with endometriosis.The primary objective of this study is to
      determine whether the frequency and severity of dysmenorrhea are reduced in women with
      symptomatic endometriosis in whom a Lng IUD is inserted after operative laparoscopy compare
      with those treated with laparoscopic surgery only.

      The secondary objective is to compare about pain, bleeding, satisfaction and quality of life
      score between both groups
