      angiography at baseline and again at 3 months, rate of major amputation (above the ankle) of
      the affected limb within 3 months or an unchanged critical limb ischemia of the affected limb
      after 3 months defined as less than 15% change in tcPO2 or ABI or absolute ankle
      pressure.Efficacy endpoint is at 3 months. Clinical endpoints and safety will be measured
      through 12 months.
