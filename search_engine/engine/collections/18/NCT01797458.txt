      these have their proponents who claim they provide the best performance in terms of
      longevity, aesthetics, bio-compatibility, etc (Qvist, 2010; Yengopal et al., 2009). However,
      despite the great variety of techniques and materials, there is no definite evidence for the
      most effective approach when dental caries in primary molars is concerned, as yet. On the
      other hand, there is conclusive evidence that shows that glass-ionomer cement is an
      inappropriate material for class II restorations in primary teeth, due to its significant
      shorter longevity compared with other restorative materials like compomer and amalgam.

      Recently, there is re-surging interest in more biological (less-invasive) techniques: such as
      the Non-Restorative Caries Treatment (Peretz & Gluck, 2006; Gruythuysen et al., 2010) or
      stainless steel crowns with the advent of the Hall technique in Scotland (Innes et al.,
      2007). However, there is lack of comparative evidence from high quality clinical trials
      leading to uncertainty in the effectiveness of these techniques. In addition, these
      techniques are rarely compared with standard fillings.
