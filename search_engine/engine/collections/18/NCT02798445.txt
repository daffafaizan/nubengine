      suffering from this condition. Most of therapies available under the obligatory health plan
      (POS, acronym in Spanish) to date cover the cleaning of the ulcerous lesion and its medical
      handling using saline solutions, topical antibiotics and elastic dressings, implying an
      important intake from health resources due to its chronicity and the delay in ulcers healing,
      which usually takes periods ranging from 12 months to several years. Therapeutic
      alternatives, which can guarantee optimal, fast and persistent in time healing, should be
      identified.

      The aim of this study is to determine the percentage of healing of active venous ulcers
      (using a clinical, etiological, anatomic and physiopathologic classification (CEAP), C6)
      following Endovascular Laser Treatment (EVLT) of axial vein hypertension plus
      ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy of superficial venous reflux under knee, closing
      perforator veins and terminal reflux under de ulcer in patients with chronic venous
      ulceration (TAPIRS technique) plus compression with an adjustable compression system (juxta
      cures) versus a control group using the traditional multilayer bandages. The investigators
      expect that the minimal surgical invasive approach closing all the superficial venous reflux
      plus adjustable compression system will diminish the time of ulcer healing compared with
      standard treatment of multilayer bandage care.
