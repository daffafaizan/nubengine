      and the outer margin of the myocardium which can be considered an endocrine organ that
      secretes pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including
      adiponectin.as investigators know, inflammatory response is an important factor in the
      coronary atherogenesis. Therefore,epicardial adipose tissue is likely to be connected with
      the severity of coronary artery disease.Recent studies showed that the thickness of the
      epicardial adipose tissue in patients with coronary artery disease was greater than that with
      normal coronary arteries.

      epicardial adipose tissue will be assessed using transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac
      magnetic resonance which allows for an accurate volumetric quantification of epicardial fat.
