    
      Part 1 Speech perception tests. You will hear words and sentences under a variety of
      listening conditions and be asked either to either repeat them or to select what you heard
      from a set of options. You will also answer a few questions about the speech and the
      background noise. The goal is to determine the ability of the most recent version of the
      device to deliver good quality speech that is comfortable and understandable over a range of
      conditions that are representative of everyday listening.

      Part 2. Suitability and Acceptability. You will be asked to respond to a short structured
      interview about the device. If the device has reached a wearable stage, you will wear it
      outside the laboratory while engaging in discussion with one of the researchers before
      completing the interview. The goal is to obtain the opinions of persons with hearing loss
      about the device itself, and about their willingness to wear it as a hearing aid in their
      everyday life, if they were to be involved in a research study.

      Part 3 is a focus-group session with about 10 hearing-aid users, some of whom will have
      participated in Parts 1 and 2. Topics will deal with hearing aids in general and about the
      current version of the experimental device. Discussion will be recorded for later
      transcription and analysis. The goal is to gain the perspective of hearing-aid users about
      hearing aids, hearing-aid research, and the acceptability of this experimental device for
      field research.
