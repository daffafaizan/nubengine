    
      Adults ages 18-75 with Relapsed and/or Chemotherapy Refractory Multiple Myelomas.

      Design:

      Participants may be screened with:

      Medical history Physical exam Blood and urine tests Heart tests Bone marrow sample Multiple
      scans and X-rays Lymphocytes are collected by apheresis from the enrolled patient or a
      healthy donor. Blood is removed through a needle in an arm. The rest of the blood is returned
      through a needle in the other arm.

      The cells will be changed in a laboratory. Participants will get 2 chemotherapy drugs over 5
      days. Two days later, participants will get an intravenous (IV) catheter in an arm. They will
      get the split doses CART cells on day0, day1, day2 through the IV in 1 infusion.

      After this, participants will stay in the hospital for at least 9 days and stay nearby for 2
      weeks. Then they will have blood tests and see a doctor.

      Participants will visit the clinic at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the infusion, then
      every 6 months until two years after infusion. A bone marrow sample will be taken at the
      3-month visit.
