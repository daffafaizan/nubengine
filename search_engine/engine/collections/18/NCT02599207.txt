      single allogeneic sibling cord blood infusion in young children with cerebral palsy. Children
      ages one to six years with uncomplicated cerebral palsy and an available HLA matched or
      haploidentical, qualified, sibling cord blood unit will be eligible to participate. All
      participants will receive a single intravenous infusion of allogeneic sibling cord blood. All
      participants will have an initial clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of cerebral
      palsy and determine eligibility. The main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion
      reactions as well as incidence of infections and graft versus host disease will be assessed.
      Functional outcome measures, described below, will be assessed at baseline and six months
      post sibling cord blood infusion and described.
