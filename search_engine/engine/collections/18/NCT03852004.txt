    
      Children referred to the "Center Broussais" clinic for hypotonia are evaluated in terms of
      psychomotor development by a pediatrician competent in neuro-pediatrics. It is a cabinet for
      the care of children from 0 to 16 years.

      Osteopaths and pediatricians work together in this office of which 50% are children with
      neurological disorders.

      If osteopathic care is indicated, and for children with inclusion / non-inclusion criteria,
      the study will be offered to parents. In case of parental acceptance, children will be
      randomized in single blind to receive either an osteopathic treatment (osteo group) or a
      simulation (simulation group). Neither the parents nor the pediatrician will know the
      randomization group.

      The osteopathic treatment or simulation will be performed in a standardized way according to
      a previously established protocol.

      In both groups, a neurological evaluation of the axial tone will be performed by a
      pediatrician before randomization, at the end of the first consultation and at the end of the
      3rd consultation, ie 3 consultations by a pediatrician.

      If the child was drawn in the "simulation" group, three additional consultations will be
      offered at the end of the study to allow him to benefit from optimal osteopathic care
