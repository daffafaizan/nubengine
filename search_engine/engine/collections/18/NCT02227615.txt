      disorders or chronic diseases participated in the 10-day mango consumption study. They were
      aged between 21-38 years and with a weight between 45-95 kg. Participants were asked to stop
      taking dietary supplements for 1 week prior to the study begin and study duration and asked
      to avoid excessive exercise and alcohol consumption 3 days prior to the start of the study
      day 1 and study day 10. Participants were also required to fill out a 72-hour nutritional
      report at home that detailed their food consumption over the previous 3 days leading up to
      the first and tenth day and were reviewed for compliance. All participants fasted from fruit
      and vegetables, coffee and tea one day prior to study day 1 and 10 and were asked to bring in
      a stool sample collected prior to consumption of mango on the first day of the study. After
      an overnight fast of at least 12 hours, urine collections were made (baseline) and a baseline
      blood draw was taken from each participant. Each participant was given 400 grams of mango to
      consume and urine collections were made at 0-3, 3-6, 6-8, and 8-12 hours. The volume of urine
      was recorded and an aliquot immediately frozen at -80°C until analysis. Blood samples were
      also taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12hrs, collected in heparinized tubes and
      centrifuged for 10 mins at 4000 x g, 4°C. Supernatant (plasma) was aliquoted into 2mL
      samples, acidified with 50 μL 85% formic acid, and immediately frozen at -80° C until
      analysis. Participants were given 400 grams of mango to consume daily for the next eight days
      and the study design was repeated again on the 10th day. After completion of the tenth day of
      study, stool samples were collected and immediately frozen at -20°C for microbial analysis.
