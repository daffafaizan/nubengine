    
      This randomized, global, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of AV and AVG versus chemoimmunotherapy (FCR or BR) in subjects with previously
      untreated CLL without del(17p) or TP53. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3
      arms through a block stratified randomization procedure.

      The study includes screening (35 days), treatment (from randomization until study drug
      discontinuation) and follow-up phase.
