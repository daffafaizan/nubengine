      will result in significantly lower pain scores after 4 weeks when compared with a traditional
      landmark-guided approach at the superior nuchal line.

      The greater occipital nerve (GON) has been implicated in several conditions that prompt
      referral to pain medicine specialists, including occipital neuralgia and cervicogenic
      headache. According to the International Headache Society, a local anesthetic block of the
      GON can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of occipital neuralgia. Many practitioners perform
      GON injections using a conventional approach, relying solely on superficial bone-based
      anatomic landmarks to infiltrate local anesthetic and corticosteroid around the nerve at the
      level of the superior nuchal line. The ambiguity of these injections poses a risk of
      anesthetizing adjacent structures or injecting into vessels, such as the occipital artery.

      In an attempt to mitigate these risks and improve the efficacy of GON injections, ultrasound
      has been increasingly utilized. Multiple studies have demonstrated successful
      ultrasound-guided GON blockade at the superior nuchal line and improvement in pain scores
      compared to non-guided injections. The investigators' preliminary data confirms the
      feasibility, efficacy, and safety of an ultrasound-guided GON block technique at the level of
      C2, but it is not yet known whether this technique provides greater pain relief and
      functional outcomes compared to traditional injections.
