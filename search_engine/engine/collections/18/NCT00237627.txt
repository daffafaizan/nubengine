      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered with pegylated
           doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome in patients with refractory hematologic or solid
           tumor malignancies. (Phase I [closed to accrual as of 10/15/2007])

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I [closed
           to accrual as of 10/15/2007])

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with this
           regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response in patients with hematologic or solid tumor malignancies treated
           with this regimen. (Phase I [closed to accrual as of 10/15/2007])

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients with metastatic breast cancer
           treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Obtain further evidence of the safety of this regimen in patients with metastatic breast
           cancer. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I (closed to accrual as of 10/15/2007), dose-escalation study of
      bortezomib followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 10/15/2007): Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1,
           4, 8, and 11 and pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 1 hour on day 4.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive bortezomib (at the maximum tolerated dose determined in phase
           I) and pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome as in phase I.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of the
      study and 40 for the phase II portion.
