      compared to oral iron in the treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients receiving
      erythropoietin. Patients are randomized to receive either two doses of 510 mg of intravenous
      ferumoxytol in sequential dialysis sessions or 200 mg oral elemental iron daily for three
      weeks.
