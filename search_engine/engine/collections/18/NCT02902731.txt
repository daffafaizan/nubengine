      therapy will have: a time and a complete remission rate respectively shorter and higher,
      fewer relapses and a decrease of the total consumption of prednisone over a 12- month
      follow-up.

      This controlled study is the first to assess the inhibition of the IL- 1 pathway in the GCA
      with anakinra in add-on therapy with corticosteroids in patients newly diagnosed or on
      relapse. The purpose of this work is to support the following proof of concept of the
      addition of anakinra to corticosteroid therapy in the treatment of GCA: potential synergies
      of this association and intrinsic therapeutic action of anakinra in patient newly diagnosed,
      and this without loss of opportunity for patients that will benefit all of the reference
      treatment. The other originality of this study is to demonstrate the steroid-sparing effect
      of targeting interleukin -1, which is per se a therapeutic and nosologic innovation for this
      disease. Finally, ancillary biological studies will clarify the mode of action of the
      anti-cytokine therapy and identify markers of response to this biotherapy.
