      capping trial immediately following PCNL. A total recruitment target of 1,046 subjects is
      planned and participants will be randomized into one of the two study arms.

        1. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) arm: On postoperative day 1 (unless not clinically
           indicated), each subject will undergo CEUS with an administration of Lumason via their
           pre-placed nephrostomy tube.

        2. Non-contrast CT scan plus capping trial arm: On postoperative day 1 (unless not
           clinically indicated), subjects' pre-placed nephrostomy tube will be capped and they
           will undergo a low dose non-contrast abdominal CT scan.

      Subsequently, nephrostomy tubes will be managed based on the results from these studies by
      the treating surgeon.

      Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.

      The following investigational regimen will be used only in the CEUS arm:

      Experimental Investigation: Lumason at a 2 mL single dose, repeatable once at the time of
      imaging as needed.

      Subjects will be exposed to the randomization schema for 1 day during which they will undergo
      one of the two diagnostic imaging pathways. After that imaging study is complete, clinical
      care will proceed as per norm. Clinical and imaging data will be prospectively collected from
      the time of initial presentation until 6 months after surgery. The total duration of the
      study is expected to be 5 years to reach target accrual. Therefore, the investigators
      anticipate that the total duration of this study will be 4 years and 6 months for patient
      recruitment with the final 6 months used for collecting follow up data.
