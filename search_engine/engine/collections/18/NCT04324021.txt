      efficacy and safety of Emapalumab or Anakinra, versus standard of care (SoC). Patients
      between 30 and 80 years will be eligible to participate in the study. The study is planned to
      consist of three groups, each comprising 18 patients. Treatment will be randomized to either
      Emapalumab+SoC, Anakinra+SoC or only SoC for two weeks. Follow-up visit or phone calls will
      be made 4 and 8 weeks after end of treatment period.
