      reported about normal reference values for CAN using this test in the Chinese population.
      This study aimed to evaluate the reference values for the short-term HRV in a large
      cross-sectional dataset, and to estimate sensitivities and specificities of CAN diagnostic
      tests using the Bayesian approach, in the absence of a gold standard in another independence
      dataset. Finally, CAN prevalence was estimated in the investigators' cross-sectional dataset.
      Firstly, the reference the values for the short-term HRV were calculated in the
      investigators' previous study (including 371 healthy subjects). This study dataset contained
      88 subjects who completed both the short-term HRV test and Ewing's test. Simultaneous
      inferences about the population prevalence and the performance of each diagnostic test were
      possible using the Bayesian approach without a gold standard.
