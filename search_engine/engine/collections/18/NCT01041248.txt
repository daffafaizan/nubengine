    
      In this N = 1 study a single known patient with relapsing polychondritis who has failed
      methotrexate, various anti TNF medications, anti IL1 medication and prolongued
      glucocorticosteroids will be recruited to receive Tocilizumab 8 mg /kg q 2 weeks iv.

      The objective is to assess efficacy of tociliuzmab in combination with stable ongoing
      therapy. Our patient received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg over 1 hour by intravenous infusion every 2
      weeks throughout the course of the study. To assess tocilizumab efficacy, the primary
      objective is the change in physician global assessment on a 100-mm horizontal visual analogue
      scale (VAS) of disease activity.

      The secondary objectives were the change in parent global assessment of disease activity on a
      100 mm VAS and the glucocorticoid dose in mg per day. Frequency of adverse events was also
      measured at baseline and after each biweekly tocilizumab infusion.
