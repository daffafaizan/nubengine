      assumed for 3 months by the IASP. The symptoms include either continuous or intermittent
      pain, that could be caused by tumor or other multiple etiologies. The consequence of
      uncontrolled chronic pain presents not only physiologic symptoms but also psychiatric
      disorders leading to severely impact daily living.

      In Thailand, the use of methadone for pain management has been limited because physicians are
      not familiar with its dosing and concern about the risk of drug accumulation and cardiac
      arrhythmia. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a
      protocol of methadone dosing in outpatients with severe chronic pain.

      Thirty four chronic pain patients will be included to initiate methadone use following the
      protocol. Pain scores, pain interferences scores, neuropathic pain score, severity of adverse
      effects, and QTc intervals will be assessed at baseline, and two, four, eight, and twelve
      weeks after starting methadone.

      The approved protocol of methadone therapy obtained from this study could be clinically
      utilized by physicians for severe chronic pain management.
