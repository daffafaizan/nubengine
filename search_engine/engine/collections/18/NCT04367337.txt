    
      This observational study aims at testing the adherence to handwashing guidelines (the World
      Health Organization, WHO, 2020) at two measurement points, spanning 1 month. Adults from the
      general population in 14 countries (Poland, Australia, Canada, China, France, Gambia,
      Germany, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Switzerland) will provide
      self-report data on handwashing behavior and its social-cognitive predictors (perceived
      effectiveness of handwashing, risk perception, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, intention,
      planning, and action control), anxiety, as well as COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates
      within the country.
