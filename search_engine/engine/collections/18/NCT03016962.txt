      keeping the colonic mucosa away from the lens at the colonoscope tip. This assists in
      negotiating sharp turns by better anticipation of the direction. Cap-assisted colonoscopy can
      be tried as a salvage procedure in cases of failed cecal intubation with regular colonoscopy.
      Colonoscopy in patients with a history of abdominal surgery is considered to be difficult due
      to adhesion-related bowel angulations. There were few study evaluating usefulness of
      cap-assisted colonoscopy in patients with prior abdominal surgery. The investigators designed
      a randomized, controlled trial to verify the usefulness of cap-assisted colonoscopy in
      patients with prior abdominal surgery.
