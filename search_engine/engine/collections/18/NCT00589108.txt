      knee system with two types of fixed-bearing total knee systems in patients undergoing
      cemented total knee arthroplasty. The devices to be used are FDA approved: the Sigma Knee
      System (mobile-bearing), the Sigma, Pressfit Condylar posterior cruciate substituting
      (fixed-bearing) system with a metal backed tibial tray, and the Sigma press-fit condylar
      posterior cruciate substituting system (fixed bearing) with an all polyethylene tibial tray.

      The surgical procedures were performed by 4 experienced orthopedic surgeons with a
      subspecialty interest in total knee arthroplasty. A midline skin incision and medial
      parapatellar arthrotomy were used to expose the knee. The distal femoral resection was
      performed with an intramedullary alignment guide, and the proximal tibial resection was
      performed with an extramedullary alignment guide. Knees with fixed deformities had a surgical
      release of the contracted tissues on the medial or lateral side, as appropriate, to obtain
      symmetric balance of the total knee replacement in both flexion and extension. The flexion
      and extension gaps and the medial and lateral soft-tissue structures were balanced in
      accordance with standard techniques.

      Patients began progressive weight-bearing on the first postoperative day, and active knee
      range of motion was initiated with 24 hours after surgery. Patients were typically discharged
      on the fourth or fifth postoperative day after obtaining the ability to walk with a walker,
      to ascend several stairs, and to flex the knee 290 degrees. Patients were asked to return for
      examination and radiographs at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after surgery.
