    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-925. This study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-925 and will assess the effects of TAK-925 in sleep-deprived
      healthy adult participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 20 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the 4 treatment sequences-which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK-925 Low Dose + Placebo + TAK-925 High Dose + Modafinil

        -  TAK-925 High Dose + TAK-925 Low Dose + Modafinil + Placebo

        -  Modafinil+ TAK-925 High Dose + Placebo + TAK-925 Low Dose

        -  Placebo + Modafinil + TAK-925 Low Dose + TAK-925 High Dose

      TAK-925 will be administered as an intravenous infusion based on the availability of safety,
      tolerability and PK data from health Japanese participants in ongoing study TAK-925-1001.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 10 weeks. Participants will make a final visit 7
      days after receiving their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.
