      methods prior to obtaining written informed consent. Once written informed consent is
      obtained and baseline demographic and medical history is collected, subjects will undergo
      administration of Cytosponge and transnasal endoscopy (TNE) prior to their scheduled
      clinically indicated upper endoscopy performed per routine standard of care. Following the
      procedure, a follow-up phone call will be made during which an impact of events scale related
      to the subjective distress of each procedure, a preference and acceptance questionnaire, and
      adverse events related to study participation will be collected.
