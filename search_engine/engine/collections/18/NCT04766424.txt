      (HTN), heart disease, stroke, or diabetes. Even with advances in screening, education, and
      medication management, controlling these chronic diseases remains challenging. Despite the
      well-established negative effects of short sleep duration, surprisingly few studies have
      tested the benefits of sleep extension and even fewer studies evaluate the science of sleep
      extension interventions. Therefore, the goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a
      behavioral sleep extension intervention on sleep duration, CMD risk factors, and health
      behaviors among adults with elevated BP/HTN and short sleep duration.
