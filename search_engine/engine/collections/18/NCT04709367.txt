      minute intervals, after prosthesis doffing. This allows for evaluating the time required for
      volume stabilization after prosthesis removal, for each amputee. In subsequent sessions, 16
      residual limb scans in a day for each amputee are captured to evaluate volume changes due to
      prosthesis removal and physical activity, in two times per day (one in the morning, one in
      the afternoon). These measurements are repeated in three different days, a week apart from
      each other, for a total of 48 scans for each amputee.
