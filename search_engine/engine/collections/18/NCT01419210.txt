      Gynecologic Oncology Clinic at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. Prospective candidates,
      identified via chart review, will receive a mailing that describes and invites them to be
      screened for eligibility. Potential participants seen in the clinic will also be approached
      and invited to participate.

      The informed consent process and pretesting will take place in the clinic, with exceptions
      made as needed for women who prefer to complete documents at home.

      The intervention, which will consist of four educational CAM sessions, will be held on site
      in a private room at Moffitt Cancer Center. Immediately before and after each session, we
      will administer a brief on-site pre- and post-test. Upon completion of the intervention,
      participants will be asked to complete a post-test on site or at home, depending on their
      preference. Follow-up telephone calls will be made to the participants at 8 weeks after the
      last session.

      Pre- and post-test measures will focus on quality of life, prior use of CAM therapies, topic
      preferences, knowledge gained from the presentations, changed intentions and behaviors
      associated with CAM, and satisfaction with the program.
