      Patients will be asked to spend an additional 3 hours at the hospital on each of two study
      days separated by at least a week. At the first study visit, the patient will be randomized
      to receive the drug fexofenadine (120 mg, orally) either 3 hour prior to, OR at the
      conclusion of their regularly scheduled dialysis treatment. Three hours following
      fexofenadine administration, a single 4 mL (approximately 1 teaspoon) blood sample will be
      drawn. One week or more after the first study day, the patient will have the study repeated
      but with the timing of the dose altered to match the randomization. For example, if at the
      first study visit the patient received fexofenadine after their dialysis session, they will
      now receive the drug 3 hours prior to their dialysis session. The blood sample will be
      centrifuged immediately and plasma stored at -80 celsius until analysis. Fexofenadine
      concentration will be determine by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.
