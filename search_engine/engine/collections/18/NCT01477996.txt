      intravitreal therapy (IVT).

      Design: Randomized clinical trial Methods: A total of 200 patients, treated with an IVT for
      exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or a vascular retinal disease, will be
      included and randomly assigned to be treated with either a 27-gauge needle (group 1) or a
      30-gauge needle (group 2). After IVt the patient has to fill out a standardized questionnaire
      including pain scores on the visual analog scale after the surgical procedure.

      Regression analysis of the scaled questionnaires should allow for a standard recommendation
      regarding the optimal needle size for minimal subjective pain during IVT.
