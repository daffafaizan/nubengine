      Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a high throughput proteomics-based assay of
      nasopharyngeal lavage fluids and/or swabs of human sinus drainage material will be able to
      identify, with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, patients with CRS specifically
      due to the presence of NTHI biofilms.

      Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that a priori assay for increased presence of
      phosphorylcholine-rich lipooligosaccharides in nasopharyngeal lavage fluids from chinchillas
      co-infected with adenovirus and biofilm forming NTHI will successfully predict, with a high
      degree of sensitivity and specificity, the development of CRS in this in vivo model.

      Results from this project may: enable the design and conduct of a clinical trial to
      preoperatively identify patients with CRS earlier in their disease course (possibly prior to
      the initiation of long courses of empiric antibiotic therapy); aid in the development of
      non-surgical therapies to eradicate bacterial biofilms with the sinus cavities; result in the
      identification of an objective biomarker to monitor success with therapies; and ultimately
      lead to less morbidity and risk for complications compared to conventional surgical therapy.
      In addition, transforming this paradigm would make progress towards achieving the goals of
      the U.S. Department Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 objective 14-19, which is
      "reducing the number of courses of antibiotics prescribed for the sole diagnosis of the
      common cold."
