      course. For patients in remission, glucocorticoid (GC) and immunosuppressant are used to be
      maintained for a long time in fear of disease flare. Long-term GC and immunosuppressant could
      bring a lot of side-effects and economic burden. Whether and when patients with stable
      disease should withdraw GC or immunosuppressant? How about the relapse risk respectively?
      What are the risk factors for disease flare? All the above remain unclear. The aim of this
      study is to explore the relapse risk after GC or immunosuppressant withdrawal in IgG4-RD
      patients with stable disease and to establish a predictive model for risk stratification.
      Meanwhile the investigators aim to testify the effects of immunosuppressant in preventing
      IgG4-RD relapse. This study is a prospective cohort clinical trial.
