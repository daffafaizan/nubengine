      function is important for regaining independence in activities of daily living. Researches
      show that the death toll of people who suffering from stroke more than 200 millions,the
      annual growth rate of this data reached 8.7%, which ischemic stroke take percentage of 60-70,
      and who suffered from UL impairment reached about 70%. Nowadays, morbidity of ischemic stroke
      of China is the first of the world.

      Aging is a risk for ischemic strokeï¼Œespecially over the age of 50 years old, which will
      increase morbidity rate of UL motor function impairment.

      UL dysfunction make patients despaired and can not attend social activity normally,
      decreasing the quality of their lives. Attending social activity is very important for
      people's health, otherwise, people will get a series of diseases, like disability, depressive
      disorder,etc.

      This subject is primary to compare effectiveness of scalp electroacupuncture and scalp
      acupuncture on motor function of the UL in convalescence phase of ischemic stroke. The
      clinical research is a randomized controlled trial (RCT),consisting of two arms of scalp
      electroacupuncture group and sham sclp electroacupuncture group to value difference of upper
      limb function after 4 weeks. The result indicates that scalp electroacupuncture is more
      sufficient to alter function.

      As a further study, this research contains two parallel arms of scalp electroacupuncture
      group and sham sclp electroacupuncture group. The purpose is to value effectiveness of scalp
      electroacupuncture on motor function of the UL in convalescence phase of ischemic stroke,
      comparing with sham scalp electroacupuncture.
