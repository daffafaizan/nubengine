      patients with low health literacy. The purpose of this project is to pilot a multi-media
      technology intervention designed for patients with diverse health literacy skills with the
      aim of improving patient receptiveness, willingness, knowledge, self-efficacy, and positive
      attitudes regarding clinical trials. The intervention is comprised of multi-media touchscreen
      computer program components for clinical trial education and assessment of patient-reported
      outcomes. Patients presenting for their first oncology appointment were eligible. Patients
      viewed an interactive teaching video concerning clinical trials that was adapted from the
      National Institutes of Health. Validated surveys assessing receptiveness, willingness,
      knowledge, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes regarding clinical trials were administered
      before and after the test.
