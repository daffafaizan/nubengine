      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bevacizumab in combination with sunitinib malate
      (SU11248) in patients with solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the objective response rate, time to disease progression, and overall survival of
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and oral sunitinib
      malate (SU11248) once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab and SU11248 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 10 patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.
