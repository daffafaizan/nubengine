      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of G3139 in combination with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel.

      II. To determine the quantitative and qualitative nature of toxicities of G3139 with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      III. To measure G3139 activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes by quantitating Bcl-2/Bax
      expression and transcription, as well as T-cell functioning and signaling.

      IV. To measure G3139 activity in tumor biopsy specimens by quantitating Bcl-2/Bax expression
      and transcription.

      V. To determine the pharmacokinetics of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and G3139, as well as
      intratumoral G3139 levels.

      VI. To screen various signal transduction pathways that may be affected by Bcl-2
      down-regulation in PBMC and tumor biopsy specimens in order to better understand the
      mechanism of G3139 chemosensitization.

      VII. To seek preliminary evidence of antitumor activity for the combination of G3139,
      carboplatin, and paclitaxel.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of oblimersen.

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 4. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oblimersen until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      An additional cohort of 12-15 patients receives treatment as above with oblimersen at the
      MTD.
