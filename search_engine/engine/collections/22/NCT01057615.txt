      dietary modification can ameliorate exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. It has been shown
      in separate studies that fish oil and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) individually protect against
      EIB by improving pulmonary function and reducing airway inflammation. The main aim of this
      study is to determine the comparative and additive effects of fish oil and ascorbic acid
      supplementation on EIB and airway inflammation in asthmatic individuals.
