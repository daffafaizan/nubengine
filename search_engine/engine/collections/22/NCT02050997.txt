        -  Cohort B1 = Target is 80 unresectable locally advanced PDAC patients who will receive
           standard treatment of chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy.

           chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy.

      Control patients: Target is 50, with acute pancreatitis admitted to hospital for

      Blood samples will be taken at the following time points:

        -  prior to resection, whenever feasible for cohort A

        -  prior to CT, for both cohort A and B

        -  during CT, for both cohort A and B
