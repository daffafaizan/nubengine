      objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound guided corticosteroid
      injection in reducing symptoms caused by carpal tunnel syndrome.

      In this randomised clinical trial, 50 patients with both a clinical and electromyographic
      diagnosis of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome will be recruited from the Centre
      Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS). Subjects will be randomised to ultrasound
      guided or blind injection groups. All subjects will receive 40 mg of methylprednisolone. The
      primary outcome will be the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire - Symptom Severity
      Scale at baseline and 3 months post injection. Both subjects and assessors will be blinded.
