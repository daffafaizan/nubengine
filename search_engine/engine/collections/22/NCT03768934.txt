      four airtime incentive amounts contingent on them completing the noncommunicable disease risk
      factor survey. This mobile phone survey will be sent as a short message service (SMS). In SMS
      surveys, participants use their touch tone key pad to answer written questions. (i.e. If you
      are male, press 1; If you are female, press 2). This study will be conducted in both Colombia
      and Tanzania.
