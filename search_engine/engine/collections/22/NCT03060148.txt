      in therapies. Previous studies have shown that the autonomic nervous system plays an
      important role in the pathophysiology of HF and sudden cardiac death.

      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a neurostimulation therapy, which involves the stimulation
      of selected nerve fibers and intends to create end-organ responses characterized by changes
      in blood flow, decrease of catecholamines and reduction in inflammation. The SCS system
      consists of an implantable pulse generator (IPG) and dual leads. Each lead has electrodes on
      the distal end. Electrical impulses travel from the IPG through the leads to the electrodes
      positioned at the selected nerve fibers to provide the therapeutic stimulation. By virtue of
      its potential in augmenting blood flow, decreasing catecholamines and reducing inflammation,
      SCS may benefit HF patients.
