      for post-operative morbidity and mortality. Retrospective comparisons suggested that
      splenectomy is associated with poor long term survival. However, Japanese studies revealed
      that 20 - 30 % of patients with non-early carcinoma in the proximal stomach have nodal
      metastasis in the splenic hilum and therefore, pancreas-preserving splenectomy is part of the
      standard operation in specialized centers where splenectomy is not considered a risk factor
      for operative mortality. There have been no prospective randomized trials to evaluate the
      survival benefit of splenectomy in total gastrectomy for proximal gastric cancer.

      without splenectomy
