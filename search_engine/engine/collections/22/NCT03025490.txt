      routine and safe.Standard monitoring during these procedures includes continuous Oxygen
      Saturation (SpO2), Heart Rate and rhythm and interval Respiratory rate and blood pressure.

      Capnography allows for continuous monitoring of exhaled carbon dioxide, it is an important
      tool during anesthesia, providing valuable information on the patient's respiratory status
      and is standard equipment in most operating rooms. Its use in procedural sedation has
      increased over the past years as the body of evidence supporting this practice has been
      growing.

      It has been previously shown, use of capnography may allow for earlier detection of
      respiratory adverse events in various types of procedural sedation. The fall of oxygen
      saturation can occur very late during an adverse respiratory event, especially if
      supplemental oxygen is given. Today's procedural sedation in the electrophysiology
      catheterization lab are more complex, patients are of increasingly older age, have more
      comorbidities, procedures are lengthier and often require deeper sedation (i.e. during
      complex ablation procedures).

      The use of capnography in the electrophysiology lab has not been addressed thoroughly in the
      literature. A recent multidisciplinary review of anesthesia in the electrophysiology lab
      states: "In the obstructive sleep apnea or non-obstructive sleep apnea patient, capnography
      should ideally be employed throughout the sedation period."â€¦"Capnography appears to be
      underutilized in the electrophysiology lab, given its omission from electrophysiology
      literature documenting safety of sedation by non-anesthesiologists" We hypothesize that the
      routine use of capnography during nurse administered procedural sedations in the
      electrophysiology lab could aid in detection of early signs of adverse respiratory events,
      thus allowing early intervention and reduction of these events.
