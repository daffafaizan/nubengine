    
      CALIBER is a two stage phase II, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT). A control
      group has been included to provide prospective data about surgical management and outcomes
      and assess feasibility of recruitment to a randomised study.

      Stage 1: 80 patients will be recruited with treatment allocated 2:1 by randomisation between
      chemoresection and surgical management.

      Stage 2: If the stop/go activity criteria at the end of stage 1 indicate that recruitment
      should continue, 9 additional participants will be recruited, all of whom will receive
      chemoresection.

      Patients assigned to the chemoresection group will receive 4 once weekly intravesical
      instillations of 40mg Mitomycin C (MMC) as outpatients. This treatment will be delivered via
      catheter under local anaesthetic.

      Patients assigned to the surgical management group will receive the standard surgical
      management in use at their hospital for treatment of recurrence which may include a single
      post-operative installation of 40mg MMC within 24 hours.

      All participants will be followed up at 3 weeks from the start of treatment (ie at time of
      final MMC instillation for chemoresection group) and each will receive a cystoscopy three
      months from the end of treatment to assess response, in accordance with European Association
      of Urology (EAU) guidelines.

      Subsequent cystoscopic follow up will take place 12 months after treatment if recurrence-free
      at 3 months and then annually.
