        -  To determine the relationship between degree of lymphedema, lymphedema-associated
           symptoms, and local upper extremity functioning.

        -  To determine the relationship between degree of lymphedema, lymphedema-associated
           symptoms, local upper extremity functioning, and overall health-related functioning.

        -  To determine the relationship between degree of lymphedema, lymphedema-associated
           symptoms, local upper extremity functioning, overall health-related functioning, and
           quality of life.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to presence of lymphedema (yes vs no).

      Patients complete self-reporting questionnaires to assess the degree of lymphedema using the
      Norman Questionnaire and Jane M. Armer's Lymphedema and Breast Cancer Questionnaire;
      lymphedema-associated symptoms using Symptoms in the Affected Breast/Mastectomy site
      questionnaire, Symptoms in the Shoulder, Arm, or Hand on the Affected Side questionnaire, and
      General Symptom Experience questionnaire; local upper extremity functioning using hand
      dominance questionnaire and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH)
      questionnaire; quality of life (QOL) using the Multidimensional QOL Scale; and comorbidity
      using the Charleston Comorbidity Scale. Patients undergo a 3.5-hour testing to assess the
      degree of lymphedema by arm circumference and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS); local upper
      extremity functioning by strength testing, range of movement and neurodynamic testing using a
      goniometer, a skin examination, skin sensation and sensation at scar using the
      Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament test, and fine motor control/finger coordination using the
      Purdue Pegboard, Finger Tapper, and Vibration Threshold; and overall health-related
      functioning using a graded exercise test.
