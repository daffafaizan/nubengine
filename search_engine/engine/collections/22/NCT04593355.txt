      patients. More importantly, many of those patients with chronic hepatitis C eventually
      develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).Our survey found the rate of hepatitis c
      infection in northeastern China without intervention is 34.3%, due to the abuse of caffeine
      sodium benzoate. This population has the similar mode of transmission, which is a fine study
      of the natural outcome hepatitis C. We plan to carry out epidemiological studies for this
      population, review of the influencing factors of the disease, and analyze the host factors
      that can effect the prognosis.
