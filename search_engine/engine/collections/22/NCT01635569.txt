      (CBT) and serotonergic medications; however, the disorder is under-diagnosed and access to
      care is frequently delayed or difficult to obtain. Moreover, despite the important role of
      family accommodation as an outcome predictor, standard CBT does not systematically include
      parents and mechanisms of response are not fully understood. The investigators propose to
      address this challenge by evaluating a novel treatment approach called Group-based Family CBT
      (GF-CBT).

      To determine clinical and neural effects of GF-CBT, we will perform a case-control study of
      two groups: Group 1 - OCD-affected youth receiving GF-CBT treatment (N=90); Group 2 -
      OCD-affected youth receiving no new treatment (waitlist controls; N=90).

      The investigators will collect clinical outcome data related to OCD severity, individual and
      family functioning at four time points for Group 1 subjects and at two time points for Group
      2 subjects. For Group 1 subjects, these time points include baseline, at midpoint, at the
      completion of 12 sessions, and at one-month follow-up (all time points are +/- one week). For
      Group 2 subjects, time points will be at baseline and after a time delay equivalent to
      completion of 12 GF-CBT sessions. Clinical measures will be used to compare changes between
      GF-CBT treatment and waitlist-control groups (Groups 1 versus 2).
