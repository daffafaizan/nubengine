      post-marketing observational study in China mainland.

      Each patient will be observed during his/her lopinavir/ritonavir - containing treatment
      regimen for a maximum period of 18 months.

      If the physician decides to permanently discontinue lopinavir/ritonavir before the end of the
      planned observational period of 18 months, the reason for the discontinuation and the new
      treatment regimen prescribed will be documented. The next routine follow-up visit will be the
      termination visit for this patient in this study.

      This post-marketing observational study will be conducted in a prospective, single-arm,
      multicenter format.

      As this study is observational in nature, its follow-up is not interventional and is left to
      the judgment of each physician within the 18-month period, which defines the survey for each
      patient. For indicative purpose, follow-up of patients should enable approximately 4 patient
      visits during this period. These visits will take place at average intervals of 6 months,
      apart from the first visit following inclusion (usually at the end of the first 3 treatment
      months) and apart from visits required because of an intercurrent event. If treatment with
      lopinavir/ritonavir is discontinued, standard practice is to review the patient after a
      period of 3 months.

      For these reasons, the most likely visits are defined as "V1", "V2", "V3", "V4" although
      numbers and dates will depend only on the decision of the physician. As a result, failure to
      meet these suggested dates will not constitute a deviation of the protocol.
