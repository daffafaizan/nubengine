      after the 4-week ankle splinting intervention. To examine the acute effects of splinting,
      vascular measures will also be obtained before and immediately following 30 min of ankle
      splinting. All procedures will be performed at the Integrative Cardiovascular Physiology
      Laboratory at the University of Florida.

      Participants will have one leg randomly assigned to using a splint to stretch the calf
      muscles 30 min per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks, while the contralateral non-splinted leg
      will serve as an internal control.
