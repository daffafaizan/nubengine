      must have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for at least one year and on an insulin pump
      for at least one month. Subjects are between the ages of 10 and 17 years, inclusive, have an
      HbA1c less than 10.0% and normal thyroid function. Subjects can not have had a severe
      hypoglycemic episode in the last three months, any other illness or treatment that may affect
      the wearing of a continuous glucose monitor or the completion of the study as determined by
      the investigator. Subjects may not use drugs containing pseudoephedrine within 48 hours of
      the study visits.

      This study consists of three overnight visits at the Clinical Translational Research Center.
      Meals eaten during the study will be consistent for each of the three visits.

      Subjects will participate in a standardized afternoon exercise session on a treadmill as has
      been done in previous Diabetes Research in Children Network studies. Exercise will begin at
      4pm and must be completed by 6pm. Dinner will be eaten at the end of the exercise.

      At 9pm, treatment will be given as determined by the randomization group the subject is
      assigned to. The treatment includes either an oral dose of 2.5mg Terbutaline, a 20% basal
      reduction for six hours or no treatment as the control. Blood glucose levels will be measured
      every 30 minutes until 6am.
