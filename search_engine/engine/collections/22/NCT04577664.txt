      common cause of hyperthyroidism. [2] Treatment of Graves' disease includes antithyroid drugs
      ; radioiodine ; and thyroidectomy . patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism can be treated with
      any of these treatment options. There is a wide geographic variation in the choice of
      therapy.[3] Medical treatment with antithyroid drugs is often accepted as first-choice
      modality in Europe, followed by radioiodine in case of recurrence. Although surgery offers
      the advantage of quick control and low morbidity in experienced hands, it is infrequently
      recommended as initial treatment. Therapy with radioiodine is the most common treatment in
      the United States, while antithyroid drugs and/or thyroidectomy are used more often in
      Europe, Japan, and most of the rest of the world.recent literature shows that the relapse
      rate was the highest among patients who received antithyroid drugs (40%) as compared to those
      who received radioiodine (21%) or Surgery (5). [4] Two different surgical techniques are used
      for the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism: a total thyroidectomy (TT) in which the entire
      gland is removed and a subtotal thyroidectomy (STT) , in which most of the gland is removed
      leaving a small unilateral or bilateral remnant in situ about 4-5 grams. Although
      thyroidectomy has been broadly considered as a viable alternative theapy for patients with
      Graves' disease , the resection extent and remnant size of thyroid gland remains
      controversial.[6] Although total thyroidectomy has a lower recurrence rate it has raised a
      concern that a more radical operation would increase the complications.[7] we intend to
      perform this analysis based on the published literatures of randomized controlled trials to
      evaluate the specific risks of thyroid surgery including recurrent hyperthyroididm ,
      post-operative bleeding , recurrent laryngeal nerve injury , hypoparathyroidism and
      opthalmopathy progression.
