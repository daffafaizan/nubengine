      I. Determine the frequency of objective response (complete and partial responses) in patients
      with recurrent ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer
      treated with E7389 (eribulin mesylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior platinum
      sensitivity (yes vs no).

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
