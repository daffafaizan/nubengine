      clinical study. Since the surgical procedure is independent of the population a single center
      study is applied. A double-blind study is not possible considering the implantation procedure
      with the surgeon always knowing if the device is set. Therefore, the study is designed to be
      non-randomized and non-blinded as a pilot trial.

      To reduce bias and other influences of single surgeon skills a principal investigator and one
      investigator are part of the clinical study. Further, subjects with previous treatments such
      as Pillar implant or previous airway surgery other than nasal, adenoid, tonsil or UPPP are
      excluded from the clinical study. A double-blind study is not possible considering the
      implantation procedure with the surgeon always knowing if the device is set. Therefore, the
      study is designed to be non-randomized and non-blinded as a pilot trial.
