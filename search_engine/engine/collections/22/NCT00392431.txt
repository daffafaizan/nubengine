    
      Primary objective

      To determine differences in adverse event rates between patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation who are randomized to episodic amiodarone treatment (EAT) strategy and patients
      who are randomized to continuous amiodarone treatment (CAT) strategy, while atrial
      fibrillation is still effectively suppressed.

      Adverse events can be related to:

        1. amiodarone use

        2. atrial fibrillation itself or underlying heart disease.

      Secondary objective

      To determine differences in quality of life between patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation who are randomized to the EAT strategy and patients who are randomized to the
      CAT strategy.
