    
      Primary Objectives:

      To evaluate the magnitude of the humoral immune responses to quadrivalent vs trivalent
      influenza vaccines in adults between the age of 50 and 64 years with a prior diagnosis of
      GOLD Stage C and D COPD (vs. those patients without COPD).

      To demonstrate immunogenicity by measuring hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies (HI)
      against the components of viral antigens using seroconversion (≥4 fold increase over baseline
      titers) and sero-protection (HI titer of ≥40 against the vaccine components).

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the degree of antibody response of COPD patients based on severity of disease as
      measured by FEV1.

      To assess the impact of inhaled corticosteroids on the adaptive immune response after
      vaccination.
