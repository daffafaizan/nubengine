      longterm survival in lymphomas.

      The aims of this study were to find out whether intensification of ABVD (dd-ABVD) is feasible
      and can improve the outcome of patients with early stage Hodgkin Lymphoma. In view of
      emerging data on the role of early PET in defining prognosis in Hodgkin Lymphoma patients,
      the percentage of FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) negativity after
      two cycle was chosen as the parameter to evaluate dd-ABVD activity.
