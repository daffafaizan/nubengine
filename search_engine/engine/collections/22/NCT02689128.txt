      anesthesia, in the literature it reaches up to 70% of the surgical patients and it occurs
      after local and general anesthesia with surgery.

      Locally in Jordan there was no proper clinical study to estimate PONV among surgical
      patients, the aim of this study is to estimate the incidence and the risk factors of PONV at
      Jordan University Hospital over one year period.
