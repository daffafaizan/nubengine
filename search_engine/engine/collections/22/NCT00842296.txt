      alternative to the current ClosurePlus catheter for treating the GSV and to accumulate
      pivotal data for optimization of the operating parameters. The results from this study will
      be used to further evaluate the risks and benefits of the ClosureFAST device and to obtain
      clinical evidence that the treatment provides effective and durable clinical outcomes.
