      modalities in a random fashion, for two days each.

      The two designed modalities are:

        1. Complete pumping of one breast (first left) for 15 min, followed by complete pumping of
           the right breast for 15 min, until the breast is empty.

        2. Pumping both breast simultaneously for 15 min.

      At day one of the study, the mothers will follow the standard pumping modality in practice at
      our department.

      In between the two studied procedures at day 4 of the study, the mothers will again follow
      the standard pumping modality.

      On each day of the study, in the morning after the first expression of the day, a sample of 2
      ml of pumped breastmilk will be taken, and the total volume of the daily expressed milk will
      be recorded.
