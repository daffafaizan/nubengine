      Lactobacilli and those associated with BV, thus the vaginal microecology and gut is adversely
      affected. It is widely acknowledged that Lactobacilli and other genera that produces some
      metabolites such as lactic acid, contributes to vaginal health by maintaining the low pH of
      the vagina.

      The objectives of this study are three folds, first to determine the effects before and after
      14 days oral feeding of Lactobacillus pentosus KCA1 on the vaginal and gut microbiota
      compositions of women diagnosed with BV. Second to measure the level of two proinflammatory
      cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-6 before and after KCA1 consumption and third to determine in
      silico, the relative abundance of microbial genes involved in metabolic functions using the
      16S rRNA datasets.
