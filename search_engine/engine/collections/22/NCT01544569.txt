        -  To investigate the expression and function of transposons in 50 primary rhabdoid tumors.

      OUTLINE: Freshly frozen rhabdoid tumors will be studied using fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish the genomic location of
      transposons. Protein expression in rhabdoid tumor tissue microarrays is also analyzed.
