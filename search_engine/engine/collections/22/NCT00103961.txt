      the course of HIV infection in treated and untreated HIV infected adults to identify host
      immunological, virological, and therapeutic factors that influence disease progression. This
      study will also monitor changing patterns in the transmission of drug-resistant viral strains
      and evaluate ongoing behavioral risk factors associated with HIV infection.

      Participants in this study will be followed for up to 10 years. During the first year of
      participation, study visits will occur approximately every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks,
      then every 12 weeks thereafter, with a minimum of 8 study visits during the first year.
      Participants will be asked to complete a behavioral questionnaire at Week 8. After the first
      year of participation, there will be 4 visits per year. Blood collection and vital sign
      measurement will occur at each study visit.

      Participants enrolled in this study are strongly encouraged to also enroll in the AIEDRP
      CORE01 study.
