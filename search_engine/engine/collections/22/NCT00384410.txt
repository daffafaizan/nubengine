      The current evidence suggests a sleep promoting effect of THC. Although, there is some
      support from pre-clinical and small sample size human studies suggesting a direct sleep
      enhancing effect, it remains unclear from the larger clinical trials, whether improved sleep
      is an epiphenomena secondary to improvements in the primary outcome measures ( i.e., pain,
      nausea or spasticity). There are no studies evaluating the sleep promoting effects of THC or
      analogues in patients with primary insomnia or objectively evaluating sleep at baseline and
      following treatment with THC or analogues in patients suffering from chronic pain disorder
      and insomnia. Cannabinoids have the potential of simultaneously improving sleep and lessening
      chronic, non-malignant pain, thereby interrupting the vicious cycle of pain and sleep
      disturbance. An investigation of the efficacy of cannabinoids in treating insomnia in
      chronic, non-malignant pain patients is therefore warranted.

      Research Question:

      To evaluate if nabilone (Cesamet) is effective in improving sleep in patients with insomnia
      and chronic, non-malignant pain
