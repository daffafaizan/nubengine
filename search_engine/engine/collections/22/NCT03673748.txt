    
      A Phase 2b, double-blind (neither the participant nor the investigator will know if active
      drug or placebo is assigned), placebo-controlled, randomized (assigned by chance), in which
      subjects with Lupus Nephritis (LN), who do not respond -or respond partially- to induction
      treatment, shall receive either MSCs (1.5 million cells/Kg) or placebo by intravenous
      injection. The administration of cells will be done only once. Eligible patients should have
      been receiving induction treatment for at least three months but no more than six.
