      "IntelliH" - Intelligent Health for All, that combines four key technologies in one platform:
      1) Mobile health application (mHealth) App and web portal, 2) wireless sensors and wearable
      devices, 3) Secure text messaging when both sender and receiver are logged in to the system
      and video-based patient interaction, and 4) remote health monitoring. The purpose of this
      pilot program is to understand a) usage and adoption of these technologies by providers and
      patients, and b) document the short-term improvements in health outcomes in a diabetic
      population. This pilot study will follow 20 diabetic patients (Type 1 or Type 2) as they
      beta-test this system, and will acquire data on consented subjects over a period of six
      months.
