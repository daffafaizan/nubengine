      clinical decision-making for clinicians treating participants with varied mood disorders.
      Investigators will assess the types of collateral information used in the clinical setting
      and treatment decisions made after a clinical session. We will gather this information from
      interested clinicians who will provide this information after each patient visit over the
      course of one week.
