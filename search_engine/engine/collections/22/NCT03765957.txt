      are characterized by epidermal hyperplasia, increased angiogenesis and immune cell
      infiltration. Psoriasis prevalence is about 0.1%-3%, affecting approximately 125 million
      people worldwide. In China, there are about 10 million psoriasis patients.

      Human umbilical cord-derived MSC (huc-MSC) has many advantages for the treatment of immune
      disease. Because it was demonstrated that huc-MSCs are effective in modulating immune cells
      and treating diseases and it has low immunogenicity. Furthermore, huc-MSCs do not raise
      ethical issue for clinical applications.

      Some experimental results and cases has showed that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) can prevent
      or treat psoriasis. This clinical study is conducted to provide more data to evaluate the
      effect and safety of treatment of psoriasis by human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem
      cell.
