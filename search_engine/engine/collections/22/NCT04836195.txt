    
      This is a phase I dose-escalation study of oral PCLX-001, conducted in a multicenter,
      non-randomized, open-label, non-controlled design. The study is comprised of two parts: Part
      A (single-agent dose escalation) and Part B (single-agent expansion cohorts).

      For Part A dose-escalation, patients will be accrued in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients to each
      dose level. A new dose level cannot open to accrual until toxicity has been determined in the
      preceding dose level (i.e. all patients have completed their first cycle of therapy and data
      for all patients in that dose level have been reviewed at a safety cohort review meeting).
      Six patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II
      dose (RP2D). If required, the MTD cohort may be expanded by an additional 10 patients for
      further toxicity and response assessment. The MTD cohort expansion may be restricted to
      B-cell lymphoma or advanced solid tumours to ensure there is proper distribution during dose
      escalation.

      For Part B (single agent expansion cohorts), two expansion cohorts (N=20 each) will be opened
      to determine the preliminary clinical activity of PCLX-001 at the RP2D:

        -  Expansion Cohort A: Participants with advanced solid malignancies showing preclinical
           sensitivity or molecular markers of sensitivity to PCLX-001. This includes breast,
           nonsmall cell lung (NSCLC), small-cell lung (SCLC), colorectal (CRC), and bladder
           cancers

        -  Expansion Cohort B: Participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell lymphoma: diffuse
           large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), follicular lymphoma
           (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Burkitt lymphoma. Transformed large B-cell
           lymphoma will also be included.
