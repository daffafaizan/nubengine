      visit, a 4 week inpatient period, a 4 week outpatient period known as a wash out period and
      finally another 4 week inpatient period. During the inpatient periods, the Rockefeller
      University Hospital (RUH) becomes your home. The subject must sleep here every night and
      consume all the food provided. During the screening visit, blood and urine samples will be
      taken and an EKG (electrocardiogram) and a complete physical exam will be done. After
      enrollment into the study, the first 4 week inpatient period begins. You may continue to go
      to work or do other activities as long as you eat the diet provided and sleep at the
      Rockefeller University Hospital. You must eat everything that we give you and you may not
      substitute or supplement the diet in any way. During each 4 week stay at the Rockefeller
      University Hospital, there will be three flexible sigmoidoscopies done and biopsies taken of
      the mucosal lining of the colorectum. This procedure is painless and takes about 5 minutes.
      In addition, blood samples will be taken every few days for follow-up and research, and two
      24 hour urine samples will be done on separate days during the hospitalization. Vital signs
      are measured every day and your weight will be measured three times per week. During the four
      week wash out period, the subject will return to their home, go about their normal activities
      and consume their normal diet. The subject will return to the Rockefeller University Hospital
      for the second 4 week inpatient period. The procedures and laboratory tests are the same
      during the second inpatient period. The study concludes with the subjects' discharge from the
      RUH.
