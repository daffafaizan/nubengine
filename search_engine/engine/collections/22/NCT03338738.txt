      consequences of multidrug-resistant enterobacterial infections predominantly represented by
      ESBLs are currently well known, both from the individual point of view (increase in mortality
      and length of hospital stay) and collective (increase in costs of care). Data from the
      literature reveal an increased risk of ESBL bacteremia in patients with rectal carriage of
      ESBL-producing enterobacteria. It therefore appears necessary in known patients with
      ESBL-producing enterobacteria to evaluate the impact of different antibiotics (beta-lactams)
      on the modification of flora, the increase of faecal abundance in multidrug-resistant
      bacteria such as E. coli ESBL and evaluate the factors associated with infections in these
      patients.
