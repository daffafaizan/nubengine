      evaluating which strategies are most effective in long-term treatment of HIV-1. Using data
      from present and recently completed studies, this study will collect information on therapies
      and their control of HIV infection and maintenance of durable suppression of HIV-1
      replication.

      No treatment is provided by this study, but patients will continue to receive highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) from other studies in which they are coenrolled. Blood and
      urine collection will occur at study entry and periodically throughout the study. Women may
      undergo pelvic exams and Pap smears. Portions of blood samples will be stored to evaluate
      genotypic/phenotypic susceptibility testing. Medical histories, physical exams, and
      questionnaires will be completed periodically.
