      established. It has been suggested that at this age for each stroke prevented there is one
      non-stroke death. HYVET is designed to help clarify this.

      HYVET is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hypertensive subjects aged
      80 or older. Active treatment consists of indapamide 1.5mg SR with the addition of
      perindopril 2mg - 4mg to reach a target blood pressure (BP) of <150/80 mmHg. Entry criteria
      include a systolic blood pressure of 160-199 mmHg. Patients with isolated systolic
      hypertension (ISH) have been recruited since August 2003.
