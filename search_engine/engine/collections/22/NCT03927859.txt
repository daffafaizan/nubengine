      individuals, have not had their screening done within the last two years. The rates are even
      lower if you examine screening rates within the last year. Within Ontario, the highest rates
      of unscreened individuals live in the Greater Toronto Area (Toronto Central Local Health
      Integration Network (LHIN), Central LHIN and Central West LHIN). Despite the recommendation
      for patients to be screened every year, currently only about 5% of patients in TCLHIN and
      CLHIN have been screened within the last year based on a preparatory analysis for this study.

      It is, therefore, important to identify which intervention strategies, or combination of
      strategies, will be most effective in improving screening rates in Ontario. While many
      studies have examined the effects of various strategies individually, for this project we aim
      to use several interventions that have been identified in the past as being effective and
      examine the effects of these interventions alone or in combination.

      The approach we are taking in this study is the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST). This
      study design approach consists of three stages: a screening phase, a refining phase and a
      confirming phase.

      During the screening phase, several intervention approaches are evaluated alone or in
      combination with each other in order to assess which intervention(s) have the greatest
      potential for impact on the selected outcome. During the refining phase of MOST, the selected
      components are fine-tuned and issues such as optimal levels of each component are
      investigated. During the confirming phase, the selected components are delivered at optimal
      levels and the intervention showing greatest promise is evaluated through a standard
      randomized controlled trial.
