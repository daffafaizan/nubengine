      impairment for more than 3 months poststroke were randomly assigned to either the
      experimental (EXP) group or the control group. All participants received regular conventional
      rehabilitation programs. The EXP group received an additional UE-TS protocol for 30 minutes a
      day (3 days/week for 8 weeks); the control group received the same TS protocol over the lower
      extremity (LE). The Brunnstrom's recovery stage, the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the
      Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM), the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT),
      and the Barthel Index (BI) were outcome measures and were administered at baseline, 4 weeks
      and 8 weeks post inception, and at one-month follow-up.
