    
      HE2000 is a synthetic steroid hormone that, when tested in the laboratory, had anti-viral
      activity against wild-type and drug-resistant variants of HIV. HE2000 works through a natural
      biochemical mechanism in cells to make them less able to support viral infection.

      There are 4 treatment groups of increasing doses of HE2000; each group consists of 2 parts
      (Part A and B). Part A is a single administration of HE2000 injected intramuscularly, and
      Part B is 5 consecutive daily intramuscular injections of HE2000. Patients receive the same
      dosage throughout Parts A and B of the study. Patients are asked to return to the clinic
      periodically for blood sample collection. Patients may remain at the hospital overnight for
      pharmacokinetic evaluation. Drug safety, tolerance, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics are
      measured. Samples from treatment Group 4 are analyzed for specific cell function.
