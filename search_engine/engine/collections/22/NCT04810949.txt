    
      A comparative randomized clinical trial that will evaluate the effect of 2 treatments in
      health personnel of Hospital Clínica Nova with serum vitamin D values +/- 20ng / ml.

        1. Supplementation with 52,000 units of vitamin D3 monthly

        2. Hygienic-dietary measures: sun exposure 10 minutes a day plus recommendation of
           consumption of foods rich in vitamin D.

      Hypothesis: There will be no difference in the development of respiratory infections
      (COVID-19, H1N1 Influenza, A, B influenza) in health personnel with serum levels of vitamin D
      equal or greater than 20ng / ml when they receive supplementation vs treatment based on
      hygienic-dietary measures (diet and sun exposure), in a 6-month follow-up.

      Baseline serum levels will be assessed, and monthly follow-up will be given regarding the
      development of symptoms suggestive of respiratory tract infection. The monitoring of serum
      levels of vitamin D will be every 3 months.

      Efficacy endpoint: The most effective treatment will develop a lower respiratory tract
      infection rate ( COVID-19 and/or H1N1, A or B Influenza ) during the follow-up period.

      The sample size will be of a finite population as it will include all health personnel who
      work at Hospital Clínica Nova.

      Procedures:

        1. Serum levels of vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) will be measured in all medical
           personnel working at Hospital Clínica Nova.

        2. Vitamin D3 will be supplemented to all health personnel with serum levels of vitamin D
           +/-20ng / ml

        3. Treatment group will be randomized to patients with vitamin D3 levels+/- 20ngml.

        4. Serum vitamin D levels will be monitored every 3 months

        5. Monthly follow-up will be given through the endocrinology consultation of the
           development of respiratory symptoms
