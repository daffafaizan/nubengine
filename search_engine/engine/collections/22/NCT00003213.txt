      combination with Dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of delayed nausea and vomiting induced by
      emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in patients with or without emesis in the acute phase.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients are stratified by prior
      chemotherapy (yes vs no), regular alcohol consumption (yes vs no), and prior chemotherapy
      regimen (cisplatin/carboplatin vs others). Patients receive dexamethasone and granisetron by
      mouth bid on day 0. Patients are then randomized to receive either granisetron or
      metoclopramide with dexamethasone concurrently with chemotherapy. Arm I: Patients receive
      granisetron by mouth bid on days 1-5. Dexamethasone and a placebo are administered by mouth
      once daily on days 1-5. Arm II: Patients receive metoclopramide by mouth tid on days 1-5.
      Dexamethasone is administered by mouth once daily on days 1-5. Patients must complete a diary
      card daily for 6 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 360 patients.
