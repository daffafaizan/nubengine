      weak teeth, and cervical spine instability. Experienced clinicians use a lightwand while
      bending it adequately. However, there has been not previous studies to investigate the
      adequate angle to bend it.

      This randomized controlled trial is to compare three angles (70, 80, and 90 degrees) as
      bending angle of lightwands for safe and efficient tracheal intubation in cases which require
      the use of lightwands.
