    
      This study will document the use of Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection (citrate
      formulation) in patients referred for [F-18]-FDG PET or PET/CT imaging at Royal University
      Hospital (RUH) in Saskatoon, SK. This investigational agent is produced using procedures, raw
      materials, equipment and quality standards that are equivalent to commercially-approved
      [F-18]-FDG Injection (Glucovision®, manufactured by the CPDC in Hamilton ON).

      This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomized study to monitor for adverse drug
      reactions among subjects administered Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection. Eligible
      subjects are those who would normally be referred by their physician for [F-18]-FDG PET or
      PET/CT imaging at RUH in Saskatoon, SK.

      The primary goal of this study is to permit immediate access, with appropriate regulatory and
      REB oversight, to Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection pending commercial approval.

      Monitoring for adverse drug reactions, during and after subjects are administered
      Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection, will support the primary objective of this study.
      Based on the well-established safety profile of [F-18]-FDG and the comparability of
      Fedoruk-manufactured [F-18]-FDG Injection to commercially-approved [F-18]-FDG Injection
      (Glucovision®), it is not expected that any ADRs will be observed.
