    
      This is a randomized, open label 2x2 factorial study of four regimens of initial therapy.

      I. AZT + ddl + EFV

      II. AZT + ddl + r/LPV

      III. D4T + 3TC + EFV

      IV. D4T + 3TC + r/LPV

      Eligible patients will commence their randomly allocated study drugs as soon as possible
      after randomization. Episodes of treatment limiting toxicity will be managed in keeping with
      protocol specified guidelines.

      Patients who experience treatment failures (as specified in the protocol) will be managed by
      changing their regimen to that corresponding to one of the other treatment groups.
