      PICC placement, for better exposure of the punctured vein and a wider aseptic area, the PICC
      set is investigated with the patient's arm abducted in a supine position. While in actual use
      of the PICC line, patients commonly prefer a more comfortable position with arm adducted.
      Considering the incorporation of the arm position when the catheter is placed and being used,
      the effectiveness and safety of the PICC line with the punctured arm adducted are of
      practical importance.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of arm abduction and adduction on the intravascular
      electrocardiograph (ECG) during ECG-guided PICC placement and to explore how arm movement
      (from abduction to adduction) makes an influence on the catheter tip position.

      This study is expected to enroll 150 participants. All participants would undergo the
      procedure of ECG-guided PICC placement. ECG data will be recorded before the procedure (basal
      ECG) and during the procedure with the punctured arm abducted and adducted. After the
      procedure, participants will take a post chest X-ray confirmation with arms adducted and
      abducted in a supine position. The catheter tip position and influences of arm movements will
      be calculated by the distances from the catheter tip to the carina on radiographs.
