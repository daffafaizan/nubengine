      slow or alter the course of the disease, cardiac valve repair or replacement is necessary.
      Transcatheter treatment has become a safe alternative to surgery. The United States and
      Canada developed the TAVI (Transcather Aortic Valve Implantation) program and TAVI Nurse is
      strongly supported by scientific societies as a key leadership role in the aortic stenosis
      care process. This nursing role is not implemented in Spain.

      The objective of this study is to develop a new nursing role in interventional cardiology,
      similar to TAVI Nurse but including all the structural heart diseases, through conceptual
      definition and competencies, and evaluate its impact on the quality of care after of its
      implementation.

      The new nursing role of a hemodynamics and interventional cardiology unit in Spain will be
      based on the model existing in other countries.

      This study consists of three phases:

      Phase I) Integrative review to explore and identify the definition and competencies of TAVI
      Nurse or another similar figure outside Spain, as well as identify quality of care
      indicators.

      Phase II) The competences of these nurses will be contextualized in Spain, and indicators of
      quality of care will be defined through the consensus of experts using a Delphi methodology.

      Phase III) Quasi-experimental pre / post study to assess the quality of care, through the
      indicators developed, of the implementation of the new nursing role.
