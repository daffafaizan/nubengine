      patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia(AEH) is still not clear. Our previous finding
      from subgroup analysis in a phase II randomized controlled trial showed that 39.6% of AEH
      patients in metformin plus megestrol acetate group achieved complete response, compared with
      20.4% in group of megestrol acetate alone. This trial aim to fully testify the effect of
      metformin in fertility-sparing treatment for AEH patients with adequate sample size.
