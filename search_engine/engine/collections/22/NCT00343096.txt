      longterm morbidity and mortality. The use of intravenous lorazepam as first line therapy in
      acute childhood convulsions where venous access has been obtained is widely accepted in
      developed countries. However, intravenous access can be a problem out of hospital or in small
      children.

      Benzodiazepines such as Lorazepam have long been the mainstay of first line therapy for acute
      convulsions but there is insufficient clinical evidence as to the optimal mode of
      administration when venous access has failed. Lorazepam can be given via the intranasal and
      buccal route offering the potential to be as effective as intravenous lorazepam whilst being
      easier to administer and avoiding the need for intravenous cannulation.

      To date there are no large published studies that have evaluated the efficacy and safety of
      intranasal or buccal lorazepam compared to intravenous lorazepam in the treatment of acute
      convulsions. In this study we wish to address the urgent need to obtain randomized controlled
      data in treating acute convulsions in children using a drug and delivery system that is safe,
      effective and easy to use in our setting.
