    
      DISCOVER CKD is an international observational cohort study in CKD patients, comprising both
      prospective and retrospective patient cohorts. The study does not attempt to test any
      specific a priori hypotheses, is largely descriptive, and utilises data collected only under
      conditions of routine clinical care. No additional invasive clinical tests or procedures are
      mandated per study protocol, and all data collected/extracted is based solely on observations
      of disease management and treatment decisions made between the treating physicians and their
      patients, and is not intended to be interventional in anyway. Patients will not receive any
      experimental intervention or experimental treatment as a result of participating in this
      study. Analyses will be conducted separately for prospective and retrospective CKD cohorts
      (via interim reports), and then in aggregate by combining prospective and retrospective data,
      to the extent possible, at the end of the study.
