      cesarean section. The incidence of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension is as high as
      62.1-89.7% if prophylactic measures are not taken. Vasopressors has been highly recommended
      for routine prevention and/or treatment of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension. As a potential
      substitute drug for phenylephrine, norepinephrine has gradually been used in parturients
      undergoing cesarean section. There's some evidence that prophylactic infusion of
      norepinephrine could effectively reduce the incidence of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension
      in parturients undergoing cesarean section. But the ideal infusion dose of norepinephrine is
      still unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the suitable infusion dose of
      norepinephrine for prophylaxis against post-spinal anesthesia hypotension.
