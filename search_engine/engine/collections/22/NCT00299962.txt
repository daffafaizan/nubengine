      human interferon-beta (hIFN-β) gene. This Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety
      and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of two doses of intrapleural (IP) Ad.hIFN-β in subjects with
      pleural malignancies either metastatic or pleural mesothelioma.

      Five dose levels will be studied:

        -  Dose levels 1, 2, and 3 will be given on Days 1 and 15

        -  Dose levels 4 and 5 will be given on Days 1 and 8
