      inclusion criteria. Bacteria will be subcultured; one sample will be lysed and shipped to St.
      Jude; the remaining sample will be stored onsite for the duration of the study. Samples of
      bacteria from both oncology and non-oncology patients will be included. Whole genome
      sequencing will be performed on the bacterial samples at St. Jude and the genotypic and
      phenotypic antimicrobial resistance testing (AST) results compared. Genotypic results will
      additionally be used to describe phylogenetic relationships and potential transmission events
      both within and between sites.

      Each participating location will collect limited clinical data corresponding to disease and
      treatment related factors on the affected patient. This will include sociodemographic
      variables, oncologic diagnosis, treatment phase, presence of a central venous catheter or
      other foreign body, antibiotic treatment within the past month, and previous history of
      colonization or infection by a resistant organism.
