      like age, gender, and body habitus moreover, young female patients, anxious and depressed
      patients or thin patients experience more pain during SWL.

      Several physical variables influencing treatment-related pain have been identified: the type
      of the shockwave source, size, and site of stone burden, peak pressure of the shockwaves,
      diameter of the focal zone, and size of the aperture of the shockwave source reflecting the
      area of shockwave entry at the skin.

      Pain relief during SWL is vital, not only to maintain patient comfort and satisfaction, but
      also to facilitate stone imaging and targeting by reducing patients' movements during
      successive shock wave impacts. Reduced patient movement enables increase fragmentation
      efficiency and reduce the risk of procedure-related morbidity. So, a relaxed, cooperative
      patient during treatment is paramount in maintaining stone targeting for optimal
      fragmentation.

      Across 21 centers in the United Kingdom (UK), 17 distinct analgesia regimens were reported in
      SWL analgesia practice.

      In 2016 European Association of Urology (EUA) guidelines for SWL Pain control stated that
      pain control during SWL is necessary to limit pain induced movements and excessive
      respiratory excursions, However no recommendation for proper analgesia in contrast to clear
      recommendation for Pain relief in patients with an acute stone episode.

      The investigators will try in this trial to identify the best efficacious type of analgesia
      for patient during SWL in this study.
