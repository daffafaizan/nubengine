      Intermountain Medical Center who meet the study eligibility criteria. Following the baseline
      visit for obtaining informed consent and conduct of baseline procedures, subjects will be
      required to return to clinic at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after enrollment. Cognitive testing
      will be performed at baseline and repeated at 24 months. As much as possible, the study
      follow-up visits will be scheduled at the same time as the patients' regular visits for
      clinical care.

      Six questionnaires will be administered at the baseline visit and repeated at the 24-month
      visit. At the time of cognitive assessment, the following will be completed, if not already
      performed as part of usual standard of care: complete blood count, protime/INR, basic
      metabolic profile, review of cardiac medications, and review of adverse events and
      hospitalizations. Additional serum tests will be performed on all subjects at enrollment and
      at the 24-month visit. Biomarkers will be drawn at specific intervals (baseline, 6, 12, 18,
      and 24 months) then on an as needed basis (within 7 days) when treatments for atrial
      fibrillation that may increase brain injury risk occur.
