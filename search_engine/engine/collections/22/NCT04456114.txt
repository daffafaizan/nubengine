        1. To describe a method to chemically etch the bases of stainless steel orthodontic
           brackets.

        2. To observe the changes in the micro-structure of the brackets with sandblasted bases and
           acid-etched bases under an electron microscope.

        3. To compare the failure of orthodontic brackets with a chemical etched base versus a
           sandblasted base bonded with composite using the conventional acid etch technique, over
           a follow-up of 18 months
