      been shown to improve outcomes, however the optimal timing of treatment of the non-culprit
      lesions is not known. The 2018 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization states
      that "routine revascularization of non-IRA (infarct related artery) lesions should be
      considered in patients with multivessel disease before hospital discharge". Our trial showed
      that among the fore mentioned patients there was no difference regarding outcomes when using
      a strategy of complete revascularization with non-culprit lesions PCI during PPCI or during
      the same hospital admission.
