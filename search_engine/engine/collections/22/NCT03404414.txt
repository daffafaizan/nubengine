      microadenoma.This study compared the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/MRI with that of 18F-FDG
      PET/CT in detection of functioning pituitary microadenomas in patients with inconclusive
      conventional MRI findings. Trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy was performed within 2 weeks of
      imaging.The PET/CT and PET/MRI findings and tracer uptake levels were correlated with the
      surgical findings and pathological results.
