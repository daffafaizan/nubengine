      approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States, mostly belonging to minority,
      under-served populations. SCD is associated with substantial morbidity, premature mortality,
      individual suffering, health care costs and loss of productivity. Hydroxyurea (HU) the only
      disease modifying therapy for SCD is efficacious in reducing complications such as pain
      crisis and acute chest syndrome and improving survival. It is however, vastly underutilized
      and poorly adhered to because of barriers at the health care system, provider, treatment,
      socioeconomic, and patient levels. The investigator's overarching hypothesis is that barriers
      to acceptance and adherence to HU are multi-factorial and that a structured set of
      interventions can lead to improved adherence to medication and patient centered outcomes.
