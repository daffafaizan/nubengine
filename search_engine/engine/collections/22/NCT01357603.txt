    
      The purpose of this study is to test for bioequivalence based on the pharmacokinetic
      parameter AUC INS-GLR 0-24h and on pharmacodynamic parameter AUC GIR 0-24h between the two
      long-acting insulin glargine formulations, Lantus® and Wockhardt's Glaritus® in subjects with
      type1 diabetes as well as assessing safety and local tolerability of the two insulin
      preparations.
