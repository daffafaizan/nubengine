      for tonsillectomy randomly in two groups: tonsilectomy group or waiting list(control group).
      Patients in tonsillectomy group were operated as soon as possible and data on postoperative
      morbidity was collected. In the control group, patients were placed on our normal waiting
      list and they were operated on in normal time (about 5-6 months). The data on preoperative
      morbidity was collected. All the pharyngitis episodes were treated by a study investigator
      and laboratory tests (crp, procalcitonin) were taken at that time and after three days. In
      addition, the patients record their symptoms on a diary.
