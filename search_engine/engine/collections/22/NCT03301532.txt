      compatibility of C7 oil with the ketogenic diet in subjects diagnosed with G1D. The ketogenic
      diet will have been previously described by the patient's treating physician independently of
      this study and for clinical reasons. The ketogenic diet supplies over 50% of calories from
      fat, subjects, who are already tolerating over this much fat as part of their previously
      prescribed ketogenic diet, will replace 45% of their daily caloric intake with the
      triheptanoin for 24 hours, during a 48 hour inpatient stay. Subjects will have a continuous
      EEG to monitor for any potential C7 related changes in seizure before, during, and after
      triheptanoin oil ingestion.
