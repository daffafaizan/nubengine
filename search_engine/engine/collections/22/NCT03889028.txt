      occur between the third and fourth week after allo-HSCT, may conceivably have a different
      course from episodes emerging after engraftment once patients have begun to expand
      donor-derived T cells (post-CMV DNAemia). Thus, whether the precise timing of Letermovir
      treatment initiation should matter will ultimately depend on the impact of CMV DNAemia
      episodes developing prior to engraftment on clinical outcomes. There is limited information
      available on this topic. Here, we conducted a retrospective multicenter, non-interventional
      study to further address this issue.
