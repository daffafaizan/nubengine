      ventricular outflow tract obstruction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In order
      to further investigate this phenomenon, the following study aims to compare mitral valve
      geometry indices, as assessed by transthoracic echocardiography, two- and three-dimentional
      transesophageal echocardiography and mitral valve quantification analysis, and papillary
      musles' function, as assessed by 2D speckle tracking imaging, in patients with hypertrophic
      obstructive cardiomyopathy, patients with arterial hypertension and left ventricular
      hypertrophy and people without structural heart disease. This will provide information on the
      geometric characteristics of mitral valve that predispose to the development of obstruction.
      Futhermore, patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy that are eligible for the
      surgical relief of obstruction will be randomised into four groups according to the modality
      of intervention. These groups are as follows: 1) isolated extended septal myectomy; 2)
      extended septal myectomy + edge to edge mitral valve repair; 3) extended septal myectomy +
      posterior lealfet sliding plasty; 4) extended septal myectomy + secondary chordae
      transection. After surgery, said indices will be reassessed and the degree of outflow tract
      obstruction relief noted, in order to elicit which geometrical changes are produced by each
      type of intervention. Patients will be followed long-term, up to 5 years, in order to define
      whether the addition of the intervention on mitral valve helps abolish the residual gradient
      more effectively, and whether it translates into any survival benefit.
