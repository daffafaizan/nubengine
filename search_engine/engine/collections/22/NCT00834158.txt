      liver function of these patients has been damaged, which often limit the execution of major
      hepatectomy. A tumor is generally regarded as unresectable if the future liver remnant
      (FLR)≤40％ of total liver volume in patient with underlying liver disease. In China, TACE is
      the most common treatment for these unresectable HCC. TACE can slow down tumor progress but
      has little effect on enlarging FLR. Recently, PVE has been employed to enlarge the FLR of the
      patients so as to increase the resectability and surgical safety of major hepatectomies. But
      the intrahepatic arterioportal shunt and the tumor progress has decreased the effect of PVE.
      In order to shut the arterioportal shunt and control the tumor progress TACE sometimes is
      performed before PVE. In this study we design a randomized control trial to investigate the
      efficacy of sequential TACE and PVE on increasing the resectability of hepatitis B related
      HCC compared with TACE alone.
