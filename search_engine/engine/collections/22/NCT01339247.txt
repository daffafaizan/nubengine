      mg tablet with controlled release (Paxil CR) manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Inc. -
      Mississauga - Canada (test formulation) and Paroxetine Hydrochloride 25 mg tablets with
      controlled release (Paxil CR) manufactured by SmithKline Beecham (Cork) Limited - Cidra -
      Puerto Rico (reference formulation), fed administration in healthy volunteers of both
      genders.

      The study is prospective, open, randomized, crossover in steady state and the volunteers
      received multiple doses of the drug test and reference (two periods of drug administration).
      The population is composed of 60 healthy volunteers, adult of both gender, with age between
      18 and 40 years, with a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 27. Volunteers have weight
      above than 50 kg. 50% of the volunteers recruited are female and 50% male. There are no
      restrictions regarding the ethnic group.

      The relative bioavailability of the formulations after oral administration in steady state
      will be evaluated based on statistical comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters
      obtained from data of drug concentration in blood. The concentration of Paroxetine
      hydrochloride (controlled release) will be measured by an appropriate analytical method and
      valid after the drug administration.The Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at steady
      state in each period after standardized meals. The safety assessment will include evaluation
      and clinical monitoring, vital signs monitoring, ECG, and laboratory tests. Adverse events
      will be monitored throughout the study.
