      regions of Québec (Canada). A special effort will be made to recruit men and women with low
      socioeconomic status (SES), but without rejecting adults from middle/high SES. First, 325
      adults from low SES (high school or less and gross annual household income < $55,000
      canadian) and from several administrative regions of Québec will be identified by a survey
      firm. In addition, an e-mail mailing list from the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Food
      (INAF, Laval University) will be used to distribute the recruitment ad to complete our sample
      (n=93 from all SES).

      The survey is based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and assesses intention to participate
      in NutriQuébec as well as attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control. The
      salient beliefs underlying the determinants of individual's intention to participate in the
      NutriQuébec study most frequently cited in the focus groups (from a preliminary elicitation
      study: 2018-042 A-1/18-05-2018) were used to develop the survey questions. The survey also
      assesses the preferences regarding the recruitment. Sociodemographic questions are also
      asked.
