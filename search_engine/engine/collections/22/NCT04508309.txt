      approximately 1025 girls aged 9 to 14 years, in one country in Africa (Ghana) and one country
      in South/Southeast Asia (Bangladesh). Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive
      Cecolin® at 0 and 6 months, 0 and 12 months, or 0 and 24 months, Gardasil® at 0 and 6 months,
      or Gardasil® at 0 months and Cecolin® at 24 months. For each arm, blood will be collected for
      immunologic testing at baseline and one month following second dose. Additional blood
      collections will occur immediately prior to the administration of the second dose, as well as
      at additional later time points, for immunobridging to other published and ongoing trials.
      The study also aims to evaluate the performance of a mixed arm (group 5) of Gardasil®
      followed by Cecolin® and collect data on effects of interchangeability.

      Girls of target age will be identified, and their parents contacted to attend an
      informational session for individual discussion, informed consent, assent and randomization.

      The study will be conducted by the research groups in icddr,b in Bangladesh and Malaria
      Research Center (MRC) in Ghana.
