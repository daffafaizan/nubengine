      adolescents. Over 80% of these children have pain in the upper abdomen which is diagnosed as
      functional dyspepsia (FD). Many of these children are also found to have eosinophilic
      duodenitis (ED). ED is a type of inflammation in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract
      characterized by an increase in eosinophils. An increase in intestinal eosinophils is a
      finding also seen with food allergy upon exposure to the offending antigen. The presence of
      intestinal eosinophilia in ED would suggest an allergic mechanism may be involved in the
      generation of pain and other symptoms associated with ED. Endoscopy and biopsy are used to
      aid in the identification of ED, which often is followed by elimination diets and food
      challenges to identify the offending allergen. This approach is both invasive (due to
      endoscopy) and cumbersome (due to the complexity and restrictiveness of the elimination
      diet). The value of screening for food hypersensitivities in children with ED has not been
      well characterized despite the theoretical links between food hypersensitivities, gut
      inflammation, and symptoms of dyspepsia. The current study will determine if standard and
      investigational tests used to evaluate food hypersensitivity have the potential to be used as
      biomarkers to direct treatment of children with ED.
