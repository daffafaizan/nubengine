      patients will receive progressively higher PTC299 dose levels; in this stage, treatment will
      be given in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of 4 weeks of oral PTC299 twice per day
      followed by a 2-week, no-drug period. During Stage 2, study candidates must be women with
      natural or induced suppression of ovarian function to post-menopausal levels who are
      receiving or are candidates for hormonal therapy. These subjects will receive continuous
      administration of PTC299, 100 mg/dose BID, in repeated 6-week cycles in combination with
      continuous administration of one of 3 hormonal agents. All planned PTC299 dose levels in all
      stages are expected to achieve circulating blood levels of PTC299 known to be active in
      animal models of human cancer. Treatment for each patient can continue as long as the therapy
      appears to be safely offering tumor control to that patient. Up to 36 evaluable patients will
      be accrued across both stages.
