      depressive symptoms ("internalizing symptoms"). Maternal depressive symptoms and children's
      internalizing symptoms may be reciprocally related over time. Optimal interventions for
      children's internalizing symptoms may involve treatment components for mothers, children, and
      the maternal-child relationship. The Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention
      is a empirically-supported, family-based treatment program that has been shown to be
      beneficial for children in varied high-risk family environments, but has yet to be tested
      among mothers and children recruited on the basis of heightened depressive and internalizing
      symptoms, respectively. The overarching goal is to examine the acceptability, feasibility,
      and preliminary effects of the ABC program on a sample of mother-child dyads (n = 20) with
      heightened depressive and internalizing symptoms. Our specific aims are:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of ABC for mothers with depressive
           symptoms and their offspring with internalizing symptoms

        2. To explore whether children who receive ABC show improvement in internalizing symptoms
           from pre- to post-intervention

        3. To explore whether mothers who receive ABC show improvement in depressive symptoms from
           pre- to post-intervention

        4. To explore whether parents and children who receive ABC show more adaptive physiological
           responses to stress from pre- to post-intervention
