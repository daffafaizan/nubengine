      infection. Among oncogenic HPV, HPV 16 and 18 are found in 70% of invasive cancers. Among the
      non-oncogenic HPV, HPV 6 and 11 are found in 90% of anogenital warts. Two prophylactic
      vaccines are currently available: Gardasil 速 protects against HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 and
      Cervarix 速 that protects against HPV16 and 18. Gardasil 速 is indicated for the prevention of
      high-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN2-3), cancers of the cervix, high-grade dysplasia of the
      vulva (VIN2-3) and genital warts.

      The choice of Gardasil 速 is linked to the theoretical risk of graft rejection with the
      bivalent vaccine, and the fact that the frequency of anogenital warts related to HPV 6 and 11
      is increased in the immunocompromised population.

      The immunosuppressed women are more likely to present abnormal cervical smears than general
      population.

      A notice on the age of vaccination against HPV for girls to receive a transplant was made by
      the High Council of Public Health, recommending that vaccination against HPV could be offered
      to girls to benefit a transplant before the age of 14 years and according to data from the
      MA. The High Council of Public Health also renewed its request that studies be conducted
      specifically on the vaccination of girls and young women, immunocompromised, including those
      receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the persistence of immunological response to tetravalent
      HPV vaccine at 18 months after first dose of vaccine.
