        -  To demonstrate the feasibility and safety of administering margin-intensive stereotactic
           body radiotherapy together with preoperative gemcitabine hydrochloride to patients with
           resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride. Patients
      receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

        -  Regimen 1: Patients undergo a single fraction of margin-intensive stereotactic body
           radiotherapy (SBRT) on day 1. Patients undergo pancreatoduodenectomy between days 15-43.

        -  Regimen 2: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
           and 15. Patients undergo a single fraction of SBRT between days 21-28 followed by
           pancreatoduodenectomy between days 35-63.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
