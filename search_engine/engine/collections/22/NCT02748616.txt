      FDA-approved antibiotics currently in use today because of their effectiveness in suppressing
      the growth of C. difficile and therefore quickly eliminating the colitis and diarrhea.
      However, they do not promote the restoration of the normal bacterial flora. Therefore, when
      medication is stopped, the C. difficile colitis returns. In vitro findings have established
      that ursodeoxycholic acid is a surrogate for deoxycholic acid in preventing the growth of C.
      difficile, and interrupting recurrence.
