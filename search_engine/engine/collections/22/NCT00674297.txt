      pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory markers in aPL-positive lupus and non-lupus patients
      (primary endpoint) and to determine the safety of fluvastatin in aPL-positive lupus and
      non-lupus patients (secondary endpoint).

      All eligible patients will sign an IRB-approved consent form during the screening visit and
      give blood for baseline laboratory tests. Within a week of the screening visit, all patients
      will be started on Fluvastatin 40 mg daily for three months. At three months patients will be
      instructed to stop the study medication and they will be followed for another three months.
      Thus, the total duration of the study is six months: first three months is interventional and
      the last three months is observational.
