      Hypertension (PAH) to determine whether patients have detectable changes in FES SUV following
      treatment with fulvestrant on the separate therapeutic protocol IRB# 824861 "Estrogen
      Receptor Antagonist in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (ERA PAH)". Subjects
      will undergo up to 2 [18F]FES PET/CT scans for this protocol. A baseline FES PET/CT will
      occur on Day 0 (-2 days) of the companion treatment trial prior to initiation of fulvestrant.
      The second FES PET/CT scan will occur on week 9 (63 Â± 7 days) after initiation of
      fulvestrant. We will compare SUV values after fulvestrant to pre-treatment values.
