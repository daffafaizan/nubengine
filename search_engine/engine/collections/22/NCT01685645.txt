      block failure and the ratio of the blocked side PPI over the unblocked side PPI:

        -  study the potential link between algic thermal sensitivity (tested prior to general
           anesthesia) and the blocked side PPI (or the asymmetry of the index between the blocked
           side and the unblocked side).

        -  study the potential link between postoperative morphine consumption and the blocked side
           PPI index (or the asymmetry of the index between the blocked side and the unblocked
           side).

        -  study the potential link between consumption of remifentanil during surgery and the
           blocked side PPI index (or the asymmetry of the index between the blocked side and the
           unblocked side).

        -  study the potential link between the hemodynamic response to incision and the blocked
           side PPI index (or the asymmetry of the index between the blocked side and the unblocked
           side).

        -  study the potential link between morning pain assessment and the blocked side PPI index
           (or the asymmetry of the index between the blocked side and the unblocked side).
