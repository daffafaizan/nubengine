      and disability associated with osteoarthritis (OA); a chronic, degenerative condition that
      compromises the quality of life of 37% of adults over age 60. With the aging of the
      population, an estimated 3.5 million TKAs will be performed annually by 2030. Despite
      improvements in pain and self-reported function, physical activity after TKA remains at
      pre-operative, sedentary levels (<5,000 steps/day). Physical activity in TKA confers powerful
      protective effects against common post-surgical sequelae including increased weight gain
      (mean=6.4 kg, 2 years post TKA), decreased functional performance, increased risk/progression
      of co-morbid conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease), and
      progression of knee and hip osteoarthritis which may necessitate additional joint replacement
      in the contralateral limb. An intervention aimed at improved self-management of physical
      activity may aid patients in overcoming habitual lifestyle patterns of low physical activity
      secondary to knee pain prior to TKA.

      Recent investigations on the effects of real-time, user-friendly, electronic physical
      activity feedback (PAF) systems and face-to-face (FTF) patient group meetings aimed to
      promote self-management of physical activity suggest that such interventions can successfully
      increase physical activity. Therefore, the investigators propose a randomized, controlled
      trial to assess efficacy and feasibility of a physical activity intervention combined with
      FTF group meetings (PAF+FTF) initiated within one month of patients' discharge from
      outpatient rehabilitation for TKA compared to a control group receiving standard care (CON).
      This type of intervention is surprisingly novel to this patient population and is not common
      practice in rehabilitation following TKA.
