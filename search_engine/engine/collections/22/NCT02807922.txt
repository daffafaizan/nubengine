      multicenter trial investigating the short time effectiveness of zopiclone on self-reported
      sleep quality in patients with advanced cancer who use opioids and who report insomnia.
      Patients with advanced cancer who use opioids and who report insomnia are randomized to
      either a hypnotic, zopiclone (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) for six nights. For this study
      zopiclone Actavis 3.75 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg (active comparator) and placebo are defined as
      Investigational Medicinal Products. The initial dose is zopiclone/placebo 3.75 mg/day.
      Evaluation of sleep quality is performed in the morning after night 2 and 4 with evaluation
      of sleep quality by using a numerical rating scale 0-10 with the question "Please circle the
      number that best describes how you feel now" 0= Best sleep, 10= Worst possible sleep.
