    
      Residents of Southeast Minnesota over 60 years of age with an inpatient or outpatient
      diagnosis of heart failure (HF) will be consecutively identified in real-time using a natural
      language processing (NLP) search engine, their HF diagnosis validated, and those with a
      recent (≤ 12 months) echocardiogram documenting a preserved EF( ≥ 40%) and LV wall thickening
      will be consented to undergo venipuncture, urine collection and 99mTc-PYP SPECT/CT imaging to
      rule in/out the diagnosis of TTR-CA. Hence, the prevalence of TTR-CA will be defined. To
      place this prevalence in perspective of the global HFpEF cohort in the community, a rigorous
      screening log will be maintained to allow generation of a comprehensive CONSORT diagram.
      Importantly, baseline characteristics of patients who qualify for our study but decline to
      consent will still be collected provided that consent for use of their records for medical
      research had previously been granted.
