      micronutrient of interest, 100 g tomato puree as a source of carotenoids, a lutein
      supplement, a vitamin E supplement or a vitamin D supplement. Blood samples were taken in the
      postprandial period (up to 8 hours after the test-meals intake) and the concentration of the
      studied micronutrients were measured in the chylomicrons. Multivariate analysis were then
      performed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms that best explained the variance in the
      interindividual response (0 to 8 h area under the curve) in micronutrients.
