      and rural environments. After liaison with the local Shehia (the elected community leader)
      mothers and their children aged between 6 months and 5 years old were invited to attend a
      walk-in mobile clinic. In accordance with WHO sample size recommendations of 30 individuals
      per site and to cater for drop-out/non-compliance, target enrolment was about 50 mother and
      child pairs at each study village.

      Stool specimens were transported to the Helmtin Control Laboratory Unguja laboratory for
      visual inspection of stool consistency and presence of blood, after which a single Kato-Katz
      thick smear (41.7mg) was prepared. Eggs of all STH species were counted by inspection at 100x
      microscopy and expressed as a tally of eggs per gram (EPG). To ensure consistency of egg
      counts, slides were read by the same two technicians for each study village.

      10 Mother and child pairs found positive for Ascaris and/or Trichuris were randomised, by
      coin tossing, to receive either a single tablet of ALB (400mg) or an appropriate dose of LEV
      (2.5 mg/kg). A parasitological follow-up took place 18 days after treatment where a requested
      stool sample was analyzed by a single Kato-Katz thick smear for assessment of STH clearance.
      In accordance with WHO's 'no survey without service' all attendees were given an additional
      ALB tablet.
