      to evaluate the utility of the SBST for providing risk-stratified care. The concept of this
      approach revolves around matching treatment to patients based on their risk for developing
      chronic disability from back pain. Those at low risk receive less treatment, and those at
      high risk need more specialized treatment, that includes psychosocially-focused and cognitive
      considerations. This approach will be compared to usual care, where general practitioners
      carry out the course of action they think best for each patient, without any other guidance.
      Patients will be followed for 1 year.
