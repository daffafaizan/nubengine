      of Aphasia due to stroke that restore patients to higher levels of functioning, decrease
      disability, and promote higher quality of life. While language therapy for aphasia is
      effective, improvements are typically slow, and gains may be small. Noninvasive brain
      stimulation has been suggested as a method to enhance outcomes from language therapy. This
      study will examine whether outcomes for language therapy with brain stimulation are different
      from outcomes for language therapy without brain stimulation in people with aphasia. Our
      central hypotheses are (1) targeted right hemisphere HDtDCS (RH-HD-tDCS) administered in
      combination with language treatment will result in greater changes in naming accuracy than
      language treatment with the sham RH-HD-tDCS (2) RH-HD-tDCS plus language treatment will
      result in greater increases in communication within the affected hemisphere compared to
      language treatment plus sham RH-HD-tDCS (3) RH-HD-tDCS plus language treatment will result in
      greater increases in perilesional areas working together immediately post-treatment compared
      to language treatment plus sham RH-HD-tDCS
