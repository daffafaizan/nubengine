    
      Participants will be divided into 2 groups (control group: n=15 and PFPS group, n=60).
      Participants of the PFPS group will be classified according to their PFPS etiological
      factors, and as a function of changes at proximal or distal factors. Participants' inclusion
      in the study will be done based on their anamnesis, clinical tests, functional tests and
      strength measures. Participants will be recruited primarily at the School of Physical
      Education, Physical Therapy and Dance of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS).
      The PFPS group will be submitted to one of two intervention models based on physical
      exercises, with an 12-week duration, and 2 sessions per week. Model 1 will be composed of
      exercises focusing on local and proximal factors, and Model 2 will be composed of exercises
      focused on the PFPS local and distal factors. Only the PFPS group will receive the
      intervention program, and every intervention model will have 2 participants' groups (group
      with proximal factors and group with local factors). The allocation of each participant's
      intervention model will be randomized. All participants will be submitted to the following
      evaluations: (1) anthropometric measurements (mass, height and thigh length), (2) clinical
      tests (Compression Test and Kujala Questionnaire), (3) single leg squat (kinematic analysis),
      (4) muscle mechanical properties of the knee extensors, external hip rotators, hip extensors,
      hip abductors, ankle plantar and dorsal flexors, foot pronators and supinators [evaluated
      with a manual (Microfet 2) or isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3 Pro)], (5) myoelectric
      properties [evaluated by electromyography (Delsys system)], (6) drop landing test (kinematic
      analysis), (7) patellofemoral cartilage thickness (evaluated by ultrasonography), and (8)
      muscle architecture of the knee extensors, external hip rotators, hip extensors, hip
      abductors, ankle plantar and dorsal flexors, and foot pronators and supinators (evaluated by
      ultrasonography
