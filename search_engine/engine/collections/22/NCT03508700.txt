    
      This is an open-label, extension trial designed to evaluate safety over 40 additional weeks
      of TNX-102 SL therapy taken daily at bedtime for the treatment of PTSD.

      The study will consist of 5 in-clinic study visits, including Baseline Visit 1 (Day 0, which
      is anticipated to be the same visit as the last visit of the 12-week open-label extension
      study TNX-CY-P303), followed by in-clinic visits after 7, 16, 28 and 40 weeks of open-label
      treatment.
