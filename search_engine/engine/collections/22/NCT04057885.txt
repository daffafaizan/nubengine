    
      The primary objectives of this study are to understand the effects of soft-tissue balancing
      on Gait, function and rehabilitation potential after sensor-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty
      and to correlate Intra-operative subjective feel with OrthoSensor Outputs

      Secondary objectives are to quantify and observe pain medication use, swelling, muscle
      strength and girth, gait efficiency, patient satisfaction, activity levels, functional return
      (i.e., back to work, resume normal activities) and patient perception of a balanced knee
