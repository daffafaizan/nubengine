      Bayesian logistic regression model, guided by the escalation with overdose control principle
      and overseen by a safety review committee, will be used to make dose recommendations and
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      Once the MTD has been confirmed, remaining patients will be enrolled into a full expansion
      phase to assess PEN-221 efficacy in patients with gastrointestinal mid-gut neuroendocrine
      tumors or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or small cell lung cancer.
