      acceptance and refusal, a brief questionnaire recording demographics (gender, age, level of
      education) and clinical features was prospectively recorded in a standard data sheet by one
      of the four endoscopists at enrollment. Clinical features recorded for each patient included:
      indication to the procedure, history of abdominal surgery or irritable bowel syndrome,
      presence of pain as main symptom, chronic use of sedative medications, level of patient's
      anxiety (none, mild, moderate or severe), main concern about the examination and reason for
      willing to attempt unsedated procedure.
