      years of age. There is solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in the
      treatment of wet AMD. However, it has not been registered for such indication yet.

      In response to the need for a proper adaptation, LumiereÂ® has been developed in a
      single-dose, sterile dosage containing bevacizumab 5 mg/vial in 0.2 mL injectable solution.

      This adaptation is intended to assure intravitreal administration avoiding the risk of
      contamination and potential adverse consequences, such as endophthalmitis and blindness,
      associated to reutilization or repackaging of bevacizumab vials for oncological use.
