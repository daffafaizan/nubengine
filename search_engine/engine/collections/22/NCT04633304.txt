      new and novel method of fistula creation, which uses a percutaneous method to create an AVF.
      Thirty male and female subjects with CKD 3-5 and who are clinical indicated for arteriovenous
      fistula (AVF) creation will be enrolled using the WaveLinQ device. Eligibility confirmation
      will be confirmed during screening up to 28 days from the index procedure. Subjects who are
      eligible will undergo fistula creation per standard institutional technique (index/baseline)
      and be followed at least monthly for 6 months per their standard of care plan. Primary,
      clinical and functional patency will be observed throughout the trial in addition to other
      data collection points per protocol. The expected total duration of subject participation
      from screening until the end of study is up to 7 months.
