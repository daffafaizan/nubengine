      regimen in Jinling hospital. The AL amyloidosis diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy, and
      the assessment of organ involvement were based on consensus criteria. The clinical and
      laboratory data were collected at the beginning of each cycle and every 3 months thereafter.
      The initial BD regimen included bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 i.v.) and dexamethasone (40 mg i.v.)
      twice weekly for 2 weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11), which was followed by a 10-day rest period
      (days 12-21). The investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of BD as the first-line
      treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis.
