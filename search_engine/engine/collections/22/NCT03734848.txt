      stress response with hemodynamic profile stability, decreased analgesic consumption and
      improves patient postoperative outcomes after(OPCAB).

      Materials and Methods: A prospective, single-blind, controlled study enrolled forty patients
      between the age groups of 25 and 65 years undergoing (OPCAB) through midline sternotomy under
      general anesthesia and randomly allocated into two groups with 20 in each group. Group 1
      patients did not receive Pecs block (control group), patients were anesthetized to keep the
      heart rate and blood pressure within 25% of the baseline values. Whereas Group 2 patients
      received bilateral Pecs block preoperatively. Patients were extubated once they fulfilled
      extubation criteria. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, Plasma levels of
      adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) and cortisol, sufentanil consumption were determined at the
      following points: Basically (T0),immediately before the induction of anesthesia; (T1),
      immediately after tracheal intubation; (T2),immediately after sternotomy;( T3), 30 minutes
      after the start of surgery; and (T4), at the end of surgery. Ventilator duration, duration of
      ICU stay hospital stay were recorded postoperatively.
