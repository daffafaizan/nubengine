      endoscopic dilation of luminal strictures of the GI tract. Endoscopic dilation allows
      effective remediation of benign esophageal and upper GI tract strictures. Stricture dilation
      is performed after the stricture diameter is crudely gauged by the endoscopist. Stricture
      characteristics are based on the severity of symptoms and appearance. A stricture may be
      graded as mild, moderate, severe and as to whether or not the endoscope is able to traverse
      the luminal narrowing. By precisely measuring the diameter and length of a stricture, the
      endoscopist can know exactly what type of dilation is necessary. Benign esophageal strictures
      may also be refractory to dilation and thus require multiple sessions, prior to achieving
      successful remediation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a functional
      luminal imaging probe to characterize benign esophageal luminal strictures before and after
      dilation and identify predictors of response to therapy. Patients will be evaluated during
      endoscopy using functional luminal imaging (EndoFLIP; Crospon Medical Devices, Galway,
      Ireland) to characterize the geometry of benign luminal esophageal narrowing before and after
      dilation. The study will include patients with strictures referred for endoscopic dilation
      for the following indications: radiation induced strictures, peptic strictures, RFA induced
      strictures, EMR induced strictures, eosinophilic esophagitis, Zenkers diverticulum, and
      strictures related to surgical anastomoses. In patients with benign refractory esophageal
      strictures referred for endoluminal prostheses EndoFLIP will be used to characterize the
      stricture prior to stent placement.
