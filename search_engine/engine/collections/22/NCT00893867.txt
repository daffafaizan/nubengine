      parallel-arm, pivotal study comparing a placebo group to a DP-b99 group treated with
      intravenous 1.0 mg/kg/d for 4 consecutive days, in acute ischemic stroke patients with an
      entry National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 10-16 and a clinical
      syndrome that includes at least 1 of the following: language dysfunction, visual field defect
      or Extinction and Inattention (formerly Neglect) (as reflected by at least 1 point on any of
      the corresponding items of the NIHSS: 9, 3 or 11). An interim analysis for futility will be
      performed after Day 90 (or last available observation) primary endpoint data have been
      collected on about 45% of subjects planned to be enrolled. Clinical trial material (CTM) will
      be administered within 9 hours after the onset of acute ischemic stroke symptoms. Subjects
      will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to receive either DP-b99 or placebo. A data and safety
      monitoring board (DSMB) will assess the accumulating safety data periodically and will
      oversee the interim futility analysis.
