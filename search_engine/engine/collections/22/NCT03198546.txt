    
      1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,with written consent
           for this study;

        2. Perform biopsy to determine the expression of GPC3 of the tumor by western blotting or
           IHC;

        3. Collect blood from the patients and isolate mononuclear cells, activate the T cells and
           transfect the T cells with GPC3/TGFβ targeting CAR (or/and scfv/cytokines-secreting),
           amplify the number of transfected T cells as needed, test the quality and killing
           activity of the GPC3/TGFβ-CART cells and then transplant back the patients via systemic
           or local infusions (via artery or intra-tumor), and follow up closely to collect related
           results as needed;

        4. To enhance the killing capability, CD4+ T cells are genetically engineered to express
           TGFβ-CAR and secret IL7/CCL19 and/or SCFVs against PD1/CTLA4/Tigit; CD8+T cells are
           constructed to express GPC3-DAP10-CAR with knockdown of PD1/HPK1;

        5. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.

        6. Will also perform the similar clinical trial on lung squamous carcinoma with the GPC3
           expression.
