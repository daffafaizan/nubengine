    
      Comparison of cognitive function in severe septic/septic shock ICU patients with non-septic
      postoperative ICU patients and actively recruited healthy controls at several time points up
      to 12 months after leaving the ICU.

      Secondary aims:

        -  Profiling specific cognitive deficits in sepsis survivors over time.

        -  Identifying possible subclasses of long-term cognitive impairment according to facets of
           disease, therapy and ICU experience.

        -  Investigating long-term brain morphological changes, with hippocampus as region of
           interest (ROI).

        -  Determining values of Serum- and CSF-Biomarkers

        -  Evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic value of non-routine biomarkers for systemic-
           and neuroinflammation in the acute phase and in the long-term

        -  Investigate associations between brain morphological changes, cognitive changes,
           neurological status, psychiatric burden, disability level, employment status and
           health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

        -  Investigating brain-activity changes in resting state electro-encephalogram (EEG)
