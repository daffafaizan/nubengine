      16 month period), in a prospective analysis.

      Based on a retrospective study, we created a checklist of individual patients data which was
      completed for each patient.

      In accordance with the institutions guidelines all patients with blunt head injury received
      plain skull x-ray in 2 plains and additional cranial CT-scan (CCT) in case of fracture or
      neurological symptoms. We developed also an diagnostic algorithm consisting of anamnestical
      data and clinical signs and symptoms to define these risk factors and to catch all patients
      with minor head injury who are at risk to develop intracranial bleeding.
