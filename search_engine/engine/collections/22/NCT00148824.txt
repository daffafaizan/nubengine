      patients. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPV) is poorly immunogenic in patients
      with CD4 below 500 cells/mm3. The purpose of this multicentric national study is to evaluate
      whether a prime with a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), able to induce
      immunological memory, would improve immunogenicity against SP polysaccharides. 212 HIV-1
      infected patients, with a CD4 count between 200 and 500/mm3, will be randomly assigned to one
      of two vaccine groups: PCV at Week 0 followed by PPV at Week 4 or PPV alone at Week 4.
      Evaluation will be done at week 8. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who had
      antibody responses against 7 pneumococcal polysaccharides at Week 8. Secondary endpoints
      include the persistence of antibody responses at Weeks 24 and 96, vaccines safety and
      occurrence of pneumococcal disease over time.
