    
      This protocol aims to

        -  Develop new imaging methods that are sufficiently sensitive to allow early diagnosis of
           BOS.

        -  Improve patient treatment outcomes through earlier diagnosis of changes leading to BOS
           by obtaining image guided biopsies of transplanted lung.

        -  Provide image guided biopsies for use in future research of ex vivo biomarkers of BOS
           and in the development of treatments through future clinical trials.

      The study will achieve these aims through a prospective, non-randomized, longitudinal,
      observational study that will recruit about 5 subjects a year for 5 years. The study will
      follow these post lung transplant patients at 6 months and 1 year with 129Xe MRI
      (Hyperpolarized 129Xenon Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and image guided bronchial biopsies to
      detect early BOS and to better understand BO disease progression. The biopsies will provide
      future research for rapid determination of cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to BOS
      and to facilitate identification and validation of translatable pharmaceutical targets.
