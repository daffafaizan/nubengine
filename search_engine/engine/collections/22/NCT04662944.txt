    
      The main goal of this study is to assess to what degree disease activity assessment is
      influenced and supported by the enrichment of OCT images with segmentation information (i.e.
      by identification, highlighting and quantification of pathological fluid compartments
      associated with neovascular activity).

      The study comprises a prospective data collection phase and a retrospective analysis of OCT
      images phase. The prospective observation period per patient will be up to 12 months.

      The study will include 720 patients (na√Øve patients and patients who have been pre-treated
      with licensed anti-VEGFs not more than 3 years) being treated for nAMD with brolucizumab,
      ranibizumab, or aflibercept according to the respective drug label. Patients will be enrolled
      at approximately 20 centers across 6 countries.
