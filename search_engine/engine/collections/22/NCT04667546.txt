    
      This is a non-randomised prospective monocentric pilot study whose main objective is to
      describe the proportion of asymptomatic patients after 5 days of effective antibiotic therapy
      in an uncomplicated febrile urinary tract infection, in children between 3 months and 18
      years of age. After being informed about the study, all patient meeting inclusion criteria
      will respond to a survey at D2, D5, D10 and D28 to evaluate the persistence of symptoms to
      determine the effectiveness of a 5-day course of antibiotic treatment. All patients will be
      treated in accordance to the French guidelines.
