      disease prevention behaviors among subjects with pre-diabetes. We will randomize subjects
      with pre-diabetes to genetic testing vs. no genetic testing in order to obtain an
      unconfounded test of the hypothesis that genetic testing will change patient behavior.
      Intervention subjects will be provided with their individual diabetes genotype risk score
      derived from aggregating the combined results of 37 diabetes risk-associated genetic loci.
      Because patients can receive either "Higher risk" or "Lower risk" genetic test results, we
      will separately examine the impact of "Higher risk" and "Lower risk" test results compared to
      untested controls. All subjects will be enrolled in a 12-week diabetes prevention program.
