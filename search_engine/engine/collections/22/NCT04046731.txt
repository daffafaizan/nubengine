    
      This study will be a prospective study to accurately determine the negative predictive value
      of skin testing with NMBAs.

      It is hypothesized that the concentrations that should be used for NMBAs are actually much
      lower than previously recommended and that the higher incidence of identifiable NMBA induced
      allergic reactions during anesthesia in the past may be due to irritation of the skin rather
      than a true allergic reaction (false positives).
