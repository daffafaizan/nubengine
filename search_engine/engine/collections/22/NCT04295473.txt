      reduced port laparoscopic gastrectomy has not been systematically evaluated. The
      investigators designed a comparative study, which sought to compare the short and long-term
      outcome of patients with gastric cancer who underwent reduced port gastrectomy with patients
      underwent traditional laparoscopic gastrectomy. The short-term outcome include surgical
      complications, postoperative morbidity, postoperative nutrition. The long-term outcome mainly
      include long-term survival.
