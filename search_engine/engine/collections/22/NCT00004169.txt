      blood stem cell support in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease. II.
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose of etoposide when combined with carboplatin and
      cyclophosphamide in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of etoposide. Patients undergo total nodal
      radiotherapy twice a day on days -35 to -31, -28 to -24, and then radiotherapy boost once a
      day on days -21 to -17. Patients then receive etoposide IV continuously and carboplatin IV
      continuously on days -6 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.
      Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients who have received prior
      extensive radiation (at least 2000 cGy to any site) only receive chemotherapy and peripheral
      blood stem cell infusion. Cohorts of 4-8 patients receive escalating doses of etoposide until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 1 of
      4 or 2 of 8 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 1-3
      months for 2 years, then every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 4 patients will be accrued for this study.
