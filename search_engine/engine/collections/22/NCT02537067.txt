      be screened and those who meet trial criteria will receive CHONDRON (Autologous cultured
      Chondrocyte) by transplant. During the trial period, subjects must follow the instructions
      given by principal investigator. Subjects will make 6* hospital visits on a regular basis
      inclusive of hospitalization. During these visits subjects will be examined. For the
      evaluation of safety and efficacy of CHONDRON, examination with doctors, x-ray, MRI tests and
      arthroscopy will be performed. *If tissue samples can be collected at screening visit, there
      will be only 5 visits.
