      6,000 newly diagnosed cases per year. Beside the therapy- and cancer-associated somatic
      illness, about one third of patients develop anxiety disorders or depression and need
      psychotherapeutic or psychiatric care. Women with breast cancer display the highest psychic
      comorbidity compared to patients with other cancer entities (40% point prevalence) .

      To assist with psychological coping with the disease several psycho-oncological interventions
      have been established in the past decades.

      Self-efficacy describes the extent or strength of one's belief in one's own ability to
      complete tasks and reach goals. Nagel & Schreiber have developed an individualized
      self-efficacy coaching for cancer patients to mobilize and strengthen the belief in one's own
      ability to deal with and fight the disease. The SECOM-PSWE study evaluates the impact of
      regular self-efficacy coaching on the perceived self-efficacy and the quality of life (QoL)
      in patients with early breast cancer.
