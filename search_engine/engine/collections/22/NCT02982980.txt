    
      A clinical trial, randomized, blinded study. The groups were divided according to the type of
      rehabilitation (weekly sessions of Physiotherapy-F and Orientation -O). The surgical type
      (M-Mastectomy and Q-Quadrantectomy) was also taken into account.

      Were not included in the study those patients who underwent previous surgeries of breast
      cancer, breast reconstruction, those with some neurological deficit or acute orthopedic
      shoulder injury, such as tendonitis or bursitis, patients with previous histories of shoulder
      fracture with limited range of motion and tumor stage T4b or N3 or patients with bone or
      brain metastases.

      All patients underwent preoperative evaluation and guidance of general care; then returned
      after one, two, three and six months postoperatively for reassessment and reorientation. The
      physiotherapy group, in addition to receiving guidance, had, weekly, physical therapy
      sessions with the goal to increase muscle strength in the upper limbs, between one and three
      months after surgery.The exercises performed were active-free, with the aid of a stick or
      resistance by elastic bands and dumbbells for flexion, extension, adduction, abduction,
      external and internal rotation of the shoulder, and elbow flexion and extension, besides
      activities to enable movements functional. The mode of execution of the exercises was
      isotonic, done slowly and within the joint amplitude reached by the patient, using resistance
      according to the muscular capacity of each patient.

      All evaluations were performed by the physiotherapy team; the professionals were not aware of
      whether the patient belonged to the physiotherapy group or to the guidance group, constituted
      by a single evaluator (blinded study).

      The evaluations were: muscular strength of the shoulder, evaluated by means of a manual
      isokinetic dynamometer, which records the peak of force, in kilograms, during five seconds of
      muscle contraction duration; range of motion of the shoulder: measured by a goniometer;
      function of the upper limb: ascertained by the application of a specific questionnaire, the
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH) assesses functional capacity
      in upper limb diseases and measures the abilities to perform certain activities; pain:
      evaluated by the application of the Verbal Numerical Pain Scale (NVA); perimetry: evaluated
      with a tape measure in eight distinct points in the upper limbs and quality of life, analyzed
      by a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life C30
      (QLQ-C30) questionnaire with a Specific module for breast cancer (BR) 23 - Breast Specific
      Module.
