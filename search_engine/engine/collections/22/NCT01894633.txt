      10 fractions over 2 weeks) concomitant with 150 mg of CLQ for 4 weeks (the CLQ group).
      Thirty-four patients received the same schedule of WBI concomitant with a placebo for 4 weeks
      (the control arm). All the patients were evaluated for quality of life (QoL) using the EORTC
      QLQ-C30 questionnaire (Mexican version) before beginning radiotherapy and one month later.
