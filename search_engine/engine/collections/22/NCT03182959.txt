      activation in oral epithelium can be induced by administering Avmacol® to patients curatively
      treated for a first tobacco-related HNSCC.

      The aim of this Phase 0 clinical study is to determine the oral bioavailability of
      sulforaphane in the commercially available dietary supplement, Avmacol®, and to determine the
      level of pharmacodynamic upregulation of NRF2 target gene transcripts that occurs in the oral
      epithelium of patients who have completed curative treatment for tobacco-related HNSCC,
      including high grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma.
