      induction, propofol causes pain or discomfort on injection. Many factors appear to affect the
      incidence of pain, which includes site of injection, size of vein, speed of injection,
      buffering effect of blood, temperature and composition of propofol solution and concomitant
      use of drugs such as local anaesthetics and opiates.

      Pain on injection of propofol can be immediate or delayed. Immediate pain probably results
      from a direct irritant effect whereas delayed pain probably results from an indirect effect
      via the kinin cascade. Delayed pain has latency of between 10 and 20 s. The pain produced is
      usually described as tingling, cold, or numbing, at its worst, a severe burning pain proximal
      to the site of injection. This sensation tends to occur within 10-20 s of injection and lasts
      only for the duration of injection. Despite this discomfort, the incidence of phlebitis is
      less than 1%.

      Several methods have been used to reduce this pain with limited success. Lidocaine
      pretreatment is commonly used to decrease propofol induced pain, but its failure rate is
      between 13-32%.

      Dexmedetomidine is an selective alfa-2 adrenoreceptor agonist with supraspinal, spinal, and
      peripheral actions. Alpha-2 receptors are located on blood vessels where they inhibit
      norepinephrine release. Investigators, therefore, speculated that dexmedetomidine could
      attenuate the pain due to injection of propofol.
