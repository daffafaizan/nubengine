      and can be identified as difficulties accessing health and especially water.

      We chose to take stock of these populations defined by difficulties accessing water as
      precarious setting. Subjects homeless population fall into this by accident of life, a life
      "homeless" or migrant subjects often illegally having only transitory access (associative or
      charitable structures host) the conditions precarious sanitation including drinking water or
      toilet. Populations of slums in the same conditions or the presence rationed water (one tap
      for 150 people) restricts hygiene.

      The sampling system as part of a consultation in routine care (will be in DBS (blotter) only
      alternative to invasive venous sample and requiring heavier care facility. The capillary
      sampling on filter will also detect a marker of malnutrition .

      Thus in live in large social precariousness adult this study should show which interventions
      in public health and management proposals are most appropriate for this population.
