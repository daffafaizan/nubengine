      infections have occurred within communities of IDUs. In St. Petersburg (population 5
      million), the prevalence of HIV infection in IDUs (estimated population 100,000) leapt from
      4% in 1999 to 12% in 2000. At present there are an estimated 5-7 million IDUs, a four-fold
      increase since the end of the Soviet Union. In St. Petersburg, there has been a three-fold
      increase in regular IDUs and a nine-fold increase in teenage IDUs during the past five years.

      The intervention to be tested in this study draws upon theoretical and empirical evidence
      suggesting that peer educator programs can have significant effects on the risk-related
      behaviors of both the educators and the peers whom they educate. Providing peer educator
      training to IDUs may efficiently cultivate sustainable protective behavioral norms related to
      injection and sexual risk among the IDU educators' social networks. Prior studies have
      demonstrated that peer educator programs can realize such normative changes, and it is
      hypothesized in this study that these normative changes will be reflected in significant
      reductions in the rates of HIV transmission among the peer educators and the members of their
      social networks.

      Comparison condition: Informed by the Centers for Disease Control model of best practice"
      standard of care of HIV testing and counseling, participants in the comparison condition will
      receive risk reduction education and motivational counseling to reduce their risk behaviors.
