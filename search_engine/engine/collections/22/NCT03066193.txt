      therapeutic combination of Dronabinol and PEA in 18 adults with Tourette syndrome.
      Participants will receive Dronabinol and PEA in combination for the duration of the trial.
      The goal for this pilot study is to (1) provide initial safety, feasibility and tolerability
      data on both Dronabinol and PEA in a TS population and (2) provide data in order to make a
      more informed decision regarding the appropriate sample size and design of a larger clinical
      trial to prove efficacy (i.e. sample size and trial duration in large efficacy trial of the
      Dronabinol/PEA combination in TS).
