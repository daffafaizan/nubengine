      patients are diagnozed at advanced stage in China. Peritoneal metastasis is the most common
      metastatic site. For gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis, chemotherapy can
      bring survival benefit versus best sportive care. Paclitaxol is the standard second line
      chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer patients.

      Apatinib mesylate is a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It has been approved as third-line treatment for patients
      with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in China.

      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      apatinib combined with paclitaxol versus placebo combined with paclitaxol in advanced gastric
      cancer or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma patients with peritoneal metastasis.
